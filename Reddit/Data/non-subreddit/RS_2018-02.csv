7uewfh,2,2018-01-31,[SF] The New Year's Day Virus (First Story),B3NTIM3,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/7uewfh/sf_the_new_years_day_virus_first_story/,"
This is a personal recollection on what happened. I’m not too sure who I’m writing this too, or even if anyone other than me will read it. But until then, I guess I’ll call this a personal recollection. I don’t know where to start, but I suppose I will start from the very beginning. And I mean the VERY beginning. Well, as far as I know the start was back in the end of 2017. The problem was a computer virus back then. We now know that the virus was released at 1 minute to midnight on new years eve 2017. On January 2018, Windows, Mac, Linux, etc, were getting infected with the virus. It was undetectable at first, but some tech savvy people realized that their computer storage decreased by 2 MB every single day. People got worried and contacted their different tech supports, and some scammers even hopped in claiming to fix this seemingly national problem. (This took place in USA by the way, forgot to mention that. Also my name is Callum. Also forgot to mention that. Sorry.) Then all of a sudden, Microsoft came out with a patch. Then Apple. And so on, the problem disappeared.

A week later tons of worldwide computers crashed. Alot. It was bad, and Linux computers were hit the most. The company stocks dropped dramatically, and the company owning it went bankrupt in 3 days. 3 DAYS. The entire problem was unthinkable 2 weeks before. Unsetting detail, that turns into quite worrying when I mention it, is the fact that when the computers started back up the user was greeted by a red smiling face.

If they pressed space, sometimes personal info of the user or users popped up. Names, online aliases, even frightening details like house addresses or birthdates. May I mention that homemade computers were not affected? So the clear solution here is to just make homemade computers from now on, right? Well, scientists really wanted an answer for this. And boy, were they working to find out the answer. The company took top research guys from all over the globe, (with a handful of interns, ceos, and people they thought could either help them or assist the researchers. May I add that I’m one of the members in the group (intern). I have access to the database of events and research logs.
And yes, I’ll use plenty in whatever this is.

Back when 100% of the research was focused on only the computer virus, we were not making much progress, but we were at least confident. We found out that the computer virus first started infecting computers in california. Then it spread to most of the pacific shore states, before growing to the midwest, and the rest of the US. Then then tried to start find out how to, you know, REMOVE the virus.
And that was when things got stuck. I’m just going to show you a voice recording of one of the former (dead) scientists.


“This is Otis with the login report for the week. Now, uh… we did not make any progress in removing the malware, as it seems that it completely encrypts itself in the files. So currently the only way to remove the malware is to remove the hard drive, and the computer obviously can't run without that, so we installed a new one and it almost immediately got infected. We are still trying to figure out why homemade computers are not infected, and the clear difference between them and factory made ones. 
*cough* I uh.. I-we are still working on this, and hope to make new progress. “

That was Otis. He got tasked with doing the weekly report. And he did just that. I’m not going to just input every report, because to be honest most of them were 1 or 2 sentences.

“This is Otis with the report, we have not made any progress with anything, but are still working.”

However they did make some sort of what you would call a “breakthrough” 2 weeks from then.

“Hey this is Otis for the weekly report, and we have made progress in identifying what the malware is capable of. You see, it used to only be able to infect computers, as far as we knew, but now it can actually infect any electronics that are hooked up to the internet. Hell even this voice recorder could be infected if it was not for the wall.”

What Otis is referring to is what I’d like to call the “cyber-wall”. Original, I know, but I completely forgot what it was actually called. What Otis called it. I might look in all of the feeds to see if he called it by name instead of nickname.  Anyhow, it protected internet machines from getting hacked ,as far as we all knew. So all of us kept on trying to find out safe ways to remove the virus from people's computers.










All of a sudden, a new face would appear on people’s screens. A green one. It had a curved smile, and the text below it was: “Symptoms include: Insomnia, anxiety, general insanity and”. It just stopped there. The team was trying to figure out why it stopped there, why the face was green and non-symmetrical now, and why it even was talking about symptoms in the first place. Then, in the city of Rochester Minnesota USA, a virus was discovered in 3 patients. A human virus. Patient 1 was showing signs of insomnia, and they were shaking uncontrollably. Patient 2 was once again showing signs of insomnia, but apart from that was fine. Patient 3 was seemingly completely insane, and had darkened skin under their eyes. The Mayo Clinic  found that the 3 patients all had an unknown pathogen inside of their body, and through blood tests managed to get some of the pathogen inside a test tube. The World Health Organization was made aware of the situation, They never found out which patient got the disease first, nor how it was contracted. Our team, (which now had government funding on our side), demanded that The Mayo Clinic give us the test tube for our own personal analysis. They did not respond, because at 6:32 PM The Mayo Clinic building exploded. 

90% of everyone at the building were killed. Exactly 90%.  That didn't sit well with me at the time, because that couldn't be a coincidence. But there was one more thing, you see, the building exploded. We were unsure how the disease spread between the original patients, but 1 thing was for sure, the virus was released in the process. It would quickly spread across the country, and even that most borders were blocked, eventually to the whole world. In orders of disease protection, it was us and the World Health Organization. The public began to float to our side, because we were tackling both problems.

The World Health Organization, or WHO, sent us more resources in tackling the disease, and eventually merged with us. Because I was an intern, I was frequently doing different jobs.
1  of the days I’m taken into a stereotypical lab, and someone wearing a tie ushered me to help him. I poured 3 substances together, and he analysed it using a computer. I don’t know what he saw in that analytic, but he then poured a grey fluid into the mixture. It turned red. He sighed and told me I could return to my desk. Was that some kind of cure attempt? I was never told. One of the days stuck out, and was about 3 months after that. We had a group of people in a closed room, and I was told they were infected. They looked normal enough, not acting too crazy, but I noticed bags under their eyes. 
None of them had slept. I was told to enter the room, open a vial, wait 5 seconds, then close it and leave the sealed room. I had protective gear put on me, including a gas mask. So I guessed the virus was airborne. I asked if I was supposed to enter the room yet, and 1 of the scientists told me to wait. He opened a glass lid on top of a red button, and pressed it. 2 holes opened up in the sealed room, and un-operated machine guns came out of them. I was silent. They fired at the crowd in the room and all of the people fell down. I was then told to enter the room and then to the thing with the vial. I was already sick. I’ve never in my life seen someone die before, and there were so many of them. But I walked past the air seal and into the room. I uncapped the vial, waited 5 seconds, and started to walk out. Keyword: started, because something grabbed the back of my leg. I looked back and it was a about 30 year old man, the only one that I know of who wasn't dead. I shook of his grip and quickly ran to the door. The “scientist” noticed that one of them was alive, and pressed the button again. Nothing happened, so took his pistol and gas mask, entered the room, and shot the man in the head.
I was sent back to my desk.



I suppose I should introduce our building sectors.
Basically because we are now fighting a disease the building was separated by sectors. If one of the 5 sectors happened to be infected, then it will be shut off by doors and subsequently quarantined. Those doors were kind of like the watertight doors in the Titanic, in more ways than one.
I was put, and still currently am typing in sector 5. 

Anyways, whenever Otis recorded his weekly report, he was instructed to keep it under 5 minutes. If otherwise, the recorder would automatically stop and get sent to everyone at the lab, for safety precautions in case he died or something. 

Now the thing is only the main ceos of the organization were able to listen to it. We on the other hand, just got a transcript of it. The transcripts were not hand typed however, they were automatically made by a voice recognition software. Software software software. There’s software everywhere in this building. This place would be crippled if, for example, one of the scientists got infected. If he went on an insane rant and rushed up to our server room. And set it on fire. Because if that were to happen, our cyber-wall would be the first to go. The sad thing is, that did happen. Our cyberwall stopped working. And over the course of  months, everything that was connected to our main mini-internet got infected. Slowly. The computer part of the virus could have easily infected all of our electronics nearly instantly, but it didn't. It’s as if it was toying with us. It’s as if it wanted to give us false hope. For some reason my office computer was one of the first to get infected. I was checking my desktop for any assignments, and all of a sudden my screen went black. 

I saw a red face.

But it wasn't just an image. It moved. Its “mouth” slowly formed into a smile. Then my screen and all the lights in my room turned off and I heard a window break. I was rushed to another office. Little did I know that slowly all computers in there would get infected. It simply was inevitable. So our problems were quite big. This so called “New Year’s Day Virus” had even stopped us.


There was another obvious problem.
Sector 4 was infected.

You might have been wondering how that one scientist got infected. Well he went outside to get a sample of the oxygen outside. He was wearing a gas mask, but he still got infected. It's likely that his gas mask had a hole in it or something. He then set our server room on fire, as you already know. He retreated into sector 4, and that's when people started to get infected there.

I was chilled when I received the text transcript from a broadcast from Otis.

Here it is.
“Otis here, not here for a weekly report, I’m just worried. I haven't gotten much sleep recently, so bags are starting to appear under my eyes, I’m not infected, but just worried. Maybe I’m anxious because my sector’s been infected, but hiding in this room is working. It is. I’m not infect-... Oh god. I’ve been chewing my thumb for the past 5 minutes. It’s bleeding. I won’t get a bandage or anything, I can't. I won’t risk going outside because I can hear them in the hallway. They won't stop screaming. WHY WON'T THEY JUST DIE AND STOP MAKING NOISE! People will think I’m infected right?!! BECAUSE I CA-.....................I can’t hear anything. I can’t hear myself. I’m seeing red. I’m infected. I’m infected. I’M INFECTED. INFECTED. CORRUPT.

I’m not sure what was with the text there. It seems that it was glitched. Maybe by the virus.

Anyhow I knew 2 things. Firstly, that many people in this company are now dead.
Secondly, that the main file for the human virus was in one of the ceos office, or at least the computer version. So I’m going to take a stroll to that office, as my sector has not been infected yet, (It however has been evacuated), get the file into a thing drive, and bring it back to my computer.


I just gt back and my hands are shaking.
I needd to calm down in oreder to type corretcly


There you go.
I’ll explain what happened.

I entered the CEO’s office and he was dead. 
He was on the floor, and it looked like someone threw a brick at his head.

I think.

I didn't take to much of a closer look, I just ran to the table to get the file.
There are more details about the dead body though. I won’t put them in here, because seeing those gross details in relation to the corpse made me vomit.

So I wont put them in here.

I need to go sleep.

I’ll read the file tomorrow.




Chapter 5
So. I wrote a lot yesterday. But I’m going to finish this report. I really don’t care that I'm using informal language, I’m just trying to get this out. Just in case someone finds this , or just in case I survive this and show it to someone. It’s going to get out.

So I looked at the file in the thumb drive. It was the company's classified report for the Entire human section of this virus.
Some things I already knew. I’m actually still reading it right now as I’m typing, so I’ll just copy paste it in and finish reading.

Virus strain 1a-37b “The New Year's Day Virus 1a”

Time for symptoms to take in effect: 1 day-8 months

It is airborne and can infect by inhalation and skin contact

Known symptoms: Anxiety, Hyperactivity, Insomnia, Psychosis, and Tiredness.

I noticed something.

How it infects people.

I think I get something now.


I get how that scientist got infected.

All he had was agas mask, so he got infected because his skin was unprotected.

I was unprotected during the cure research

I think I’m infected.

Yeah, I am.

I’ve got to be.

I don’t know what to do.

I’m just going to keep typing away for a report that no one's going to read.

I’m going to die alone.

In this office.

Ohh man,

Idonts kwno what to do

icaNt see too uch right nowa but imstill trying to sype

I'm sad and I don't fucking understand why. I'm surrounded by good friends who all love me and remind me that I'm loved, my family loves me and cares about me, I'm doing good in school and have never done drugs or alcohol to make me act or feel strange. I'm smart and have done amazing things in my life like get a NASA internship but **why is it not enough?**

I think like a scientist, if I want to know something, I learn about it. But I don't know this feeling and it hurts inside. It makes me feel alone and really really... insignificant. It makes me want to feel loved, to make people happy.  I do that though... I tell jokes and make my friends laugh. I even made a room at our school for engineering that we called the ""Nerd Lab"" and all my friends come up there to hang out with me. I'm surrounded by good friends who love and care about me but yet something doesn't feel like its good enough for me. **It's eating me alive because I don't know it.**

I understand how the planets work and the basics on how to land a man on the moon but yet I can't fucking comprehend what it is that has suddenly transformed over me. It feels empty. It makes me mad because it's unknown to me. I want to feel happy, I want to feel loved, significant, anything. I want this horrible feeling to go away.

Part of me is nagging at me to stop being a little bitch, to just put on a smile and move on. But the analytical part of me, the one that drives my every action is demanding I find the cause of this and destroy it. Find this ""cure"" that exists, a *cure for happiness.* 

I feel like I'm a good person- no, I know I am. I make sure I don't hurt anyone and try to teach others how to do good, share my knowledge, learn from my mistakes. I've been told I'm a sweet and loving person but yet I haven't dated in four years... I've only had one relationship and I'm convinced it was my one in a million...

What is it? What is fucking with my mind and my heart?! **I want to be happy. I want other people to see me as happy.** I just got done with texting to my friend for an hour and a half about this and she said that part of it is my ""genius"" personality, to where I understand machines and science but can't read people or emotions. And the other part is that I'm not happy with myself, I need to be happy with myself before I try to go and make others happy. The entire time she kept reminding me that it's ok to feel sad and to cry, its natural. That I'm surrounded by friends who love me and care about me so, so much... But something is still wrong.

Why? Why is it not enough for me? What is this, this *curse* that has consumed me? Is it depression? Hell if I know, I've had friends with horrible lives and witnessed true depression, I'm not even going to insult them by saying ""I'm depressed."" ...There's the part of me that says to stop being a little bitch... I'm going to stop... I'm sorry."
7ufcq8,3,2018-01-31,I'm done. I don't know what to do anymore,hsphoenix_95,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/7ufcq8/im_done_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"When my (ex) girlfriend cheated on me with her ex, I tried not to let it affect me too much. 

When this girl ruined my reputation with my friends in college by telling them lies, I tried to ignore it.

When I gave her one last chance, she cheated again. I left her and again, I tried not to feel too bad. 

When I found out that this ex was about to get engaged with this new guy, I tried to not let affect me. 

When my friends from college ignore me or say crap about me, I try to ignore it and not feel bad. 

During my master's degree, my thesis adviser basically told me that I had no future in academia or research and gave me the lowest possible possible grade for my thesis, effectively ending my dreams of getting a Phd in my field, at least for the time being. I even missed out on getting distinction in my program since my thesis grade greatly decreased my gpa. Again, I tried not to let it affect me too much.

I started applying to jobs and internships to get some experience under my belt. I've gotten rejected by just about every organization I've applied to. 

Much of this may seem trivial, but it's getting unbearable for me. I'm living 5000 miles away from home in a lonely one-room apartment with no around one who cares about me or who I care about. All my friends from my master's program have shifted out or gone home. My friends from my undergrad program (mostly) don't want to talk to me. My friends from high school (and earlier) don't want to talk to me because (i) they think I've become too high and mighty (inspite of me reaching out to them all the time) or (ii) they think I'm just whining since they feel I'm living the 'high life' in a foreign country. 

My parents, as loving as they are, don't get how/why I feel this way. They miss me but don't want me to come back since my country is kinda shitty and feel that if I come back, I'd be even more unhappy.  

I thought about joining a couple of volunteer organisations here but they told me I couldn't join since I don't speak the local language fluently. The two other organisations that do accept English speakers are located in the northern part of the country and require regular commuting. I don't have the financial means to commute everyday. Since I'm not a citizen of this country, I don't get any passes or concessions either.

In addition, the people in my social networks (people from my master's program, etc.) are doing great (thanks LinkedIn). They are getting great internships, jobs, research positions and what not. When I ask them, no one explicitly tells me what or how they achieved what they did!  

I feel numb all day. I used to love reading about subjects related to my subject (economics) - public policy, politics, finance, etc. - loved playing and composing music, writing computer programs but nothing interests me anymore. What's the point? Everyone, everything around me left/right/center is telling me that I'm not good enough - be it as a partner, as a friend, as a researcher, as a job candidate. What's the point of these hobbies? 

I'm so done with everything. I mean during those earlier instances, I'd felt that it was just a blip and things would be okay again. But the cumulative pressure of all these shitty experiences has me beat. I've never been so demotivated in my life and I don't know what to do.

7ufjst,57,2018-01-31,"Incredibly frustrated. Employer has taken away our company vehicles and is now forcing us to use personal vehicles for daily work, what options do we have?",throw_away_1230,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ufjst/incredibly_frustrated_employer_has_taken_away_our/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I work for a large fortune 500 company in the Midwest USA where most employees’ have company vehicles, or access to them, for work use. My job was described to me as 50% fieldwork and 50% office work (although its probably more like 80% field and 20% office work), I work as an engineer (on salary) and I have a B.S. in engineering, as do my coworkers. I’m trying to be as vague as I can but I feel that is important. When I was hired on, the company had 1 vehicle for every 2 employees in my department that we shared via a sign out sheet. I was told we had vehicles to check out to use for work or if you wanted to drive your own car you could and be paid mileage.

Over the past 6 months that vehicle count has dwindled to 1 vehicle for all workers to share between more than 10 employees. We had half taken and were told they would be replaced as their lease was up, that obviously never happened. My job often involves needing to access active construction job sites, off road on large plots of open land, gravel roads, frequently needing higher ground clearance or 4-wheel drive, often times we are working and parking next to the roadway with active traffic. Now we are told we have to drive our own vehicles and be paid the IRS standard mileage rate for miles driven. 

We drive, a lot. Although not necessarily a large amount of miles driven for the time we are in our cars, though this varies and there are times where you drive 120 miles round trip. We drive frequently in town, in stop and go traffic, where 4 miles takes 30 minutes. There are days where I don’t see my office and am in my car, between job sites, idling in traffic all day long but only total 40 miles driven. So it's the worst driving for wear and tear, fuel economy, etc. We also have to be out in bad weather, rain, snow, or shine. We’re field engineers at the end of the day.

I’ve been advised by my (pension receiving) coworkers and superiors to get a new car or a different car for work. I do not have money for a second car nor do I want one. I have retirement to save for where most coworkers have pensions and are close to retirement, the last thing I need is a car loan for a second car. My primary car is paid for and has been for long enough that I can’t imagine having a car payment every month.

I feel as if we above many other employees should have company vehicles, as we are the face of the company. We meet customers and are the first line of face-to-face contact. We deal with homeowners, business owners, developers, and contractors alike from simple small requests to working along side multi million dollar projects. These customers consistently question me on my vehicle and they constantly ask where my (company) truck is. It’s embarrassing.

I’m incredibly frustrated, I fear I’m not thinking clearly and wanted to get some objective outside opinions and try to gain some clarity before frustration turns to saying something regretful at work. I feel as if now I’m burdened with the risks and costs to do my job and without any ample compensation for doing so. I should also note, we also have interns that are still in engineering school and they are now being told they need to drive their personal car for their assigned work as well.


What is reasonable moving forward? Is this added expense tax deductible? Would that even matter for a single person whom does not itemize as is?

Is it out of the question to ask for a raise to cover the added expense and liability? I feel as though if i were being hired on today and they told me I was going to need to use my personal car for work that I would have tried to negotiate a higher salary. I've heard multiple supervisors/managers say to not tell my insurance and don't mention that you're working if I'm in an accident while driving for work. I know that this is ridiculous to say the least and my insurance needs to know that I am driving for work, occasionally transporting other employees for work, and my yearly mileage amount will likely triple from what it previously was. I've put 55k miles on my car in 9 years, I generally didn't drive my car a lot before now and will now have to put aside more money for looming maintenance that will need to be done more frequently.

Thanks for any insight or thoughts on this. It's been an incredibly frustrating week for all of us after management announced this change."

Speed Racist sounds relieved, then regales me with a story of how she's been by one of the local high schools recently when it was letting out and ""there wasn't a single white kid there,"" and reminds me of her belief that you fall in love with the ethnicity you're surrounded by growing up and ""I'M NOT PREJUDICED BUT I WANT WHITE GREAT-GRANDBABIES."" I almost laughed out loud as soon as I heard her say ""I'm not prejudiced **but**."" 

Then she went on about how her sons went to a Bible Study in a predominantly black neighborhood and they were the only white kids and how the black girls were ""beautiful but I wanted white grandbabies!"" Then she said ""I'M NOT PREJUDICED BUT"" ***again*** and reiterated how important she thinks it is for people to basically stick with their own kind and have purebreed children. 

Yeah.

And at this point, the rich school in her neighborhood being so overwhelmingly white is a reason *not* to send my kids there, barring some kind of catastrophic shutdown of all the quality magnet programs in my almost mathematically diverse school district (if you take the entire population, it's literally an even split between all of the major groups - it's won recognition for the diversity of its population). The other being that her current school is already in a moderately nice neighborhood, nicer than our home-zoned school, and DD is already feeling ""poor"" and like she needs to keep up with the other kids as far as having character backpacks and light-up shoes and things. These schools have uniforms and still there's the pressure to have something distinctive that's *expensive*. I really don't need her feeling that kind of heat from kids who are dressed head-to-toe in Gucci. 

Do I feel bad that she won't make those networking connections with well-to-do kids who could get her into good colleges and internships and careers? Sure. Is it worth giving in to Speed Racist? Heeeeell no."

Yesterday I had my first crisis with a client. After rigorous consultation with supervisors and documentation (etc etc) we decided against hospitalization. When everything was said and done, no one was available to process with me some of my emotional reactions. While working with the client, I kept calm and remained professional. But when it was all over, I felt rattled. I trust my supervisors and i have many indications to lead me to believe that my client will be ok,  but it was still intense. This was a new experience for me.
Today was also a very intense day. I feel drained, I feel a little shaken up. I hope this gets a little less heavy as I gain more experience... but community
mental health is so goddamn fast paced. Everything is “chop chop,” the work load is intense... I guess I’m feeling some growing pains.

Anyways, I just wanted to reach out for a little support if possible. Am I a big softy? Has anyone else been here? "

7ugdl4,96,2018-02-01,180 Days of Kevin,chelskied,StoriesAboutKevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/7ugdl4/180_days_of_kevin/,"It was the best of times, it was the Kevinest of times. 

After months of reading stories about Kevin, I was shocked or rolling on the floor laughing about Kevin. How could he be so ignorant? Is he capable of learning? Does he really exist? 

He does exist.  I finally met him, last July.  And as my coworker, he's been my companion for the past 180 days. So here begins a sequence of Kevents.

I noticed he was wearing a Beatles shirt (the famous Abbey Road photo).  So i said, 'Cool shirt, I love Abbey Road.  He said, 'what?'.  I said, 'The Beatles? Abbey Road?' So he says, 'Oh, my dad gave me this.  Free shirt'.  Fair enough.  He's not into music, that's okay. 

But he proceeded to wear the shirt for three days.  And the same pair of sweatpants.  And then he would change the shirt and wear that one again for three days.  I asked him about it and he said, 'Oh, it's easier'.  Not wrong, but still...

It continues.  He never washes his hands in the office, and other men have confirmed that he doesn't in the restroom either.  But that's just a guy thing, right? Maybe.  But when Kevin is standing at his desk, he rests his hands on his butt.  INSIDE OF HIS PANTS AND UNDERWEAR!

Kevin makes our office coffee used grounds, more than once.  We had to tell him not to. I understand not wanting to be wasteful, but he has a habit of questionably old food.   He posted this fun tidbit to the group chat: 

&gt;Can you still eat a wheat bread after it’s been laying on the counter for 1 and half week and in the fridge for another half(probably almost 1) week? Or was it 2 weeks on the counter
I just toasted it. It looks like wheat bread, smell like sour dough. See that’s the hardest thing to tell, white bread, you can tell from the color, but wheat is like your black shirt, you can get shit stains and still wouldn’t notice

Here's another direct quote: 

&gt; I still got turkey and sausages from like 4 week’s ago, opened in the fridge, but they still smell like sausages and turkey( slices)

One night, we ordered BBQ to the office.  Some of the guys were joking about how the sausages look 'phallic'.  Kevin had never heard that word before. He LOVED it.  For days, he kept joking about things looking phallic.  Then he'd remark that he loves using words that nobody else understands.  He also learned the word 'flaccid'.  He just casually would use these words around the office.  But don't worry, clearly nobody else could understand them. 

Kevin thinks liberal arts students and 'liberals' are the same thing. 

Kevin learned last week that you can't put metal in the microwave.  I walked by the microwave and saw a coffee cup with a metal spoon in it.  I did a double take and immediately opened it and pulled out the spoon.  Then Kevin strolls by and I ask if it was his coffee. He says yes, but he doesn't know what's wrong. Evidently, Kevin's been successfully microwaving metal for years.  

He once sent a message to the Slack helpdesk.  He asked them for cookies.  Unfortunately, Slack couldn't help with that. 

There's a local coffee shop that does payments on honor system basis.  So you order your coffee and then go to the cashier at another area of the shop.  Kevin calls this 'getting free coffee'.  We've called him out on it and keep leaving comments for the workers to look out for him.  But lately Kevin has been going through an enlightenment.  Instead he has been paying for the smaller size and ordering a bigger drink.  *Baby steps*. 

We once had plans to go to recruit interns at a school career fair.  I casually mention this to our CEO one day, and he said 'You're taking Kevin with you? ... Why would you take *Kevin*?'

Once Kevin returned from vacation to visit his girlfriend.  A coworker asked him, ""How was your vacation?"" Kevin replies ""SEX SEX SEX"".  He also once used the phrase ""dat pussy"" to me at work about his hookups. I told him it's probably not a good idea to use the 'p' word in an office setting.  He just edited the comment to ""dat kitty"".  Crisis averted. 

After Thanksgiving, we were talking about our weekends, and I offered to show him a picture of me with my sister.  He said, ""Oh, is she hotter?"".  Kevin realized he had said something wrong, so he corrected himself, ""I mean, is she better?"".  The word 'no' seemed so wildly inadequate all of the sudden. 

Kevin takes an active interest in my appearance. If we order food for the office and I eat a piece of pizza, Kevin asks ""does that make you gain weight?"" I try to explain that I would gain the same amount of weight, like anyone else.  He also asks, ""Oh, do you exercise?""  If I dress casually like in jeans and a baseball shirt, he'll say, ""that outfit makes you look young"".  

We once let him interview an attractive female intern candidate.  He managed to extract some valuable information from that conversation.  We learned that she in fact, does have a boyfriend. 

Nobody is really sure what Kevin does all day.  No one really knows what his titles is.  Or if he has one. Once, Kevin had to train me on his job when he was going to be out of the office.  Kevin didn't explain anything to me about what he did, even after I asked pointed questions to try to get more information out of him.  I told him that when he is training someone, he should write a training workflow and provide that to me so I can duplicate his process. He did create one for me, but he gave me a word document with screenshot images of links that he uses for websites, etc. Very informative. 

Kevin is all about good business practices.  He asked me a favor once.  He said all I would need to do is sign up for Upwork and some other sites he uses to find freelance workers and then give him my login information. I thought that was weird. I asked him about it and he told me he was banned from using the sites because he hired foreign workers directly outside of the platform to try to pay them LESS than they make already. He said he couldn't use his login again because he had to legally agree to never approach people directly again. I said no, because the same thing could happen again, and it would be in my name.  He guaranteed me that it wouldn't, and it was just one disgruntled person.  Why was the person disgruntled? He didn't pay her for all of her work because it was unsatisfactory to him.  I explained to him that because this happened before, it could and will happen again.  I did not make new credentials for him. 

But Kevin is so skilled a trainer, he boasts that he can make a foreign employee we pay $5 an hour the best and most productive employee ever! 

Kevin thinks that having workers sign Non-Disclosure Agreements protects the worker, not the company. But it's easier to ask me these questions than to read the agreement itself.  It's lucky we have him to point out some things our lawyers who drafted the NDA didn't think about. 

Kevin made an unsavory comment about people who are struggling to eat.  We work in a well-off community.  I sent around a notice about the building's food drive going on.  Kevin chooses to say, 

&gt;Who are the local families in need? I thought we are in a super well-off area....
He continues to argue the point, until we convince him to stop.

Why is Kevin employed?  Kevin is friends with the CEO.  And the CEO takes care of Kevin (pays for his housing, among other things).  I am waiting to find out the incriminating details that he holds over him that he is still employed and housed. 

But the thing is, just when Kevin is being his most Kevinest, he will do something that you can't hate him for.  He once told me I had the best jokes.  And he once donated his blood (rare Kevin-only blood type) and saved a man's life.   And he always has a smile on his face. 

As for me, my days with Kevin are drawing to a close, as I just quit this job, that inexplicably employs him. "
7ugvao,461,2018-02-01,I am a student in a school/an institution ABS-CBN has built and endorsed. We are being deprived of proper education. Help us voice out. Ask me anything.,abscbnkilledourdream,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/7ugvao/i_am_a_student_in_a_schoolan_institution_abscbn/,"For confidentiality reasons, I am using a throwaway account. 


I am a student in Eugenio Lopez Jr. Center for Media Arts Senior High School, a school that ABS-CBN has established. If you're frequently tuned in ABS-CBN and/or watched Umagang Kay Ganda in the morning, you might have seen a certain commercial about it (can't post facebook links here. PM me if you want to see the commercial) once or a few times. I have chosen to apply here because they made a promise that we would be secured training or a job at ABS-CBN after graduation during several orientations and talks. They also promised they would help financially if ever we chose to go to college first instead of working immediately. These words came from people working in ABS-CBN who would go to our school every now and then to tell us what to look forward to. For the first few months of the school year, we didn't mind that we were located inside Quezon City High School, literally having classes in a flimsy building whose floors would crack on the second or third floor, because they [were building a better school for us](https://twitter.com/ukgdos/status/739592881275441154?lang=en). It's been two years. We still aren't in the building that was promised to us. The one those celebrities posed for. Instead, we are in rooms with plastic chairs and slowly disintegrating cement. Our parents were told to come to an orientation, and they told our parents to BUY the facilities in our rooms. Our temporary rooms. Of course, no parent wants their kid to go to school everyday having classes in the heat, right? So they were forced to buy electric fans. They were forced to buy drawers. Trash cans. Classroom furniture and supplies from money out of their own pockets. We suffered through a lot. Since we were located inside Quezon City High School, we had to abide by their rules and security guards. Students were locked out of the gates if ever they were even a minute late and they were forced to go home and be absent from their classes. The guards would threaten to hit students with their arnis whenever a student would plead to be let in. We had professors from ABS-CBN who witnessed these things. I'm not sure if they didn't pay attention or if they did but didn't care enough to do anything. Our professors had other problems too. None of them cared about attendance. You'd probably say that college professors are the same, too. But it's so much worse here. There would be weeks leading to a month where we wouldn't have a day of classes because none of our professors would care about us enough to come to class and teach us. There were more days we didn't have classes at all than days we did. We would just come to class for the sake of attendance and sleep the whole day through. This is what infuriated us the most. The Grade 12 are graduating in fear. ABS-CBN is producing students almost equivalent to out-of-youth kids because of the lack of material taught the whole Senior High School. What will we answer in college entrance exams? Education is a human right, but ABS-CBN, with all its revenue and budget, has been depriving its students of it. 


A few months ago, in the middle of the school year, ABS-CBN said they would revoke all their promises. No more college financial assistance. No more opportunity to be granted a starting job in the studio. The head of the school chose to go to Japan and work there instead, leaving us without supervision and direction. We are students who were asked to waste two years of our lives by a corporation. We were fed promises upon promises and they just decided to pull the plug like that. I have seen these turn of events mess with the mental health of my fellow students. Some of them came all the way from Mindanao and Visayas so they can't go home that easily. I have listened to their stories. Most of them said they went to Manila in hopes of being able to stay here, because they thought they would find a future here. Some didn't plan to go to college because they thought they would be able to secure training and a small job opportunity. I'm not sure of how much magnitude this all has on paper (or on site?), but everyone in the school has been so distressed the whole year. I have talked numerous people out of attempting/commiting suicide because they don't know where to go from here. Escape is not easy for others.





We have informed authorities. They are aware or have been aware, but are continually indifferent. It's absurd seeing ABS-CBN show all these commercials being ""pro-poor"" and generous, especially ones where they present themselves to prioritize the education of others when you know how it plays out when the cameras aren't around. It has ""hypocrisy"" written all over.





Perhaps there are more things I have missed. You can ask me anything. 




EDIT: removed quotation. I think it is better to replace it with this excerpt from [an article on The Varsitarian](http://varsitarian.net/news/20170118/ust-abs-cbn-ink-agreement-for-faculty-exchange-internship-programs), where it says:



&gt;""THE UNIVERSITY signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with media giant ABS-CBN last Jan. 18 for faculty exchange and internship programs.



&gt;“UST will help us in the creative formation of media and industry leaders through [an arrangement] that will benefit [from] a rigorous academic environment [steeped] in the core values and teachings of this university,” Charo Santos-Concio, chief content officer of ABS-CBN Corp. and president of ABS-CBN University said in her opening remarks.




&gt;At least 300 senior high school scholars of ABS-CBN University will be given the chance to get degrees from partner-universities such as UST and become employed after graduating from a two-year course.""





Not sure what happened with the teachers, the ""rigorous academic environment"", and ""become employed after graduating from a two-year course""."

However, I’ve been applying for all types of editorial positions, as well as other full-time positions in other fields just to start getting full-time work. 

I graduated last May with a Bachelors in Business Administration from a solid university. I did pretty well in school –– had a 3.5 GPA, received academic scholarship aid, etc. Never got in trouble. I also recently was accepted to Syracuse University's graduate school for journalism.


I currently freelance write for about six publications, and I do have a part-time job, but it doesn’t have benefits (which I desperately need) and does not pay well.  

Throughout college, I juggled part-time work, internships and extracurriculars. I completed 5 internships in PR, editorial, and marketing. Simultaneously, I worked retail at makeup counters and began freelance writing, on top of that, in 2015. 

I’ve gotten so many leads, but nothing that ends up in a job, unfortunately. This past December, I even had the chance to meet one of my favorite fashion editors at a Conde Nast magazine, which I was so, so grateful for. I reached out to her personally and she graciously invited me to grab coffee to give me advice. She even helped me workshop a few pitches, recently, but I haven’t heard back from the beauty team I submitted them to, upon the fashion editor's introduction.

I’m frustrated because I feel like I tried to do everything the “right way"" in college, but I’ve just hit a wall.

For the first time in my life, I have no idea what to do and where to go from here. I’m just lost. I guess there’s beauty and freedom in that, but I’m a very career-driven person, so this is exceptionally difficult.

I am totally not the type to feel sorry for myself or get down in the dumps –– I’m generally quite optimistic. However, the incessant rejection is really taking a toll on me. I still apply and power through my freelance work every single day, but it’s definitely disheartening to feel like I’m not where I need to be.

If anyone can offer any advice on how to break into the editorial industry (or just career advice, in general), I’d be so appreciative. I’m happy to send my resume, if anyone is willing to look at it and give feedback, too.

7uhanb,3,2018-02-01,Brauche Rat zwecks Jobwechsel (Ruhrpottler in Stuttgart),TZH85,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/7uhanb/brauche_rat_zwecks_jobwechsel_ruhrpottler_in/,"Hey r/de, ich würde gern bei euch (insbesondere den Stuttgartern) nachhaken. Nächste Woche hab ich ein Vorstellungsgespräch in Stuttgart und es wird auch um die Konditionen gehen. Ich arbeite in der Verlagsbranche und würde auch im potenziell neuen Job weiterhin in diesem Umfeld bleiben (Zusatzinfo: Der Jobwechsel wäre quasi 'intern' weil beide Zweige zum selben Konzern gehören und ich von unserem Recruitment-Center gescoutet wurde. Also sind meine Chancen auf die Zusage relativ gut). Habe einen BA, danach zwei Jahre zusätzliche Ausbildung und vier Jahre Berufserfahrung sowie mehr als sechs Jahre Erfahrung als Freiberufler. 

In meinem jetzigen Job bin ich definitiv ziemlich weit unter Tarif bezahlt (2800 brutto, nach Tarif wären es ca. 3700) , aber meinen Erfahrungen nach ist das ziemlich Gang und Gäbe in der Branche. Dennoch kann ich im Pott wirklich ganz gut davon leben, weil die Lebenshaltungskosten recht niedrig sind. Man kriegt eine ansehnliche Zweizimmerwohnung für unter 500 Euro warm. Plus, die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel sind dicht vernetzt, so dass man auch ohne Auto gut zurecht kommt.

Ich hab im Vorfeld schon mal ein wenig recherchiert und ähnlich günstig würde ich in Stuttgart wohl nicht so schnell etwas finden. Es sei denn, ich haue mein Erspartes auf den Kopf und kaufe ein Auto, um weiter raus ziehen zu können. Was dann aber wieder bedeuten würde, dass ich zusätzlich zu den Umzugskosten erst Mal ein dickes Minus mit dem neuen Job machen würde. 

Daher meine Frage: Wieviel Bruttogehalt braucht man in Stuttgart und Umgebung, um entspannt leben zu können? Dazu zählt natürlich die eigene Wohnung, Ausgehen, Sparen, alles mögliche.

Vielleicht sind unter euch ja Leute, die in ner ähnlichen Situation waren. Daher dachte ich, ich hau euch mal an und frage nach. Kenne leider niemanden in der Gegegend, der da Erfahrungen hat.
Danke schon mal!"
7uifmf,11,2018-02-01,"The Holiday Party [FM+F+] [bd, exhib, job, oral, piv, rough, bi, dp]",DarienRexxx,Erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/7uifmf/the_holiday_party_fmf_bd_exhib_job_oral_piv_rough/,"Arriving home from visiting your parents,  you find an outfit laid out on the bed: a black leather dress with crocheted lace above the bust, a red balconette bra and matching string bikini panties, a black garter with sheer red thigh high stockings, and a black lace choker. Your phone buzzes with a reminder that my holiday party is that evening.

You disrobe as you thumb through the clothing, rubbing your fingers over the different materials and textures. You enter the bathroom to shower, and makeup has been set out on the vanity counter, a matte red lipstick, a warm colored palette of eyeshadow, along with your usual eyeliner, mascara, highlighter and foundation.

Vibrating against the counter, your phone displays a text: ""I just got out of work, I'll be home in 45 minutes."" You pull back the curtain, gingerly stepping into the tub, letting the warm water cascade over your skin, taking the chill of the season with it down the drain. You lather your hair and condition it before soaping up your body, and finish cleaning your body with a razor before stepping out and toweling off.

You wrap the damp terry cloth sheet around your hair, pausing to admire your alluring body in the mirror on the back of the door. You break your reverie and determinedly dress, pulling your garter on first, snapping the suspenders onto your stockings, before snugging your panties at your natural waist. You fasten your bra and slide your still damp arms through the straps and pull the dress over your head, shimmying it down your body. The choker completes the ensemble, cinching around your throat.

As you walk towards the bathroom once more, you pause, bending your knees as you slide your panties off and tuck them back into your drawer. You lift your skirt, admiring your pussy in the mirror, and you feel it begin to dampen in anticipation of surprising me later. Your makeup goes on quickly, a fiery sideways ombré on your eyelids and bright cherry red lips.

You press your lips together, spreading the tint evenly and hear the front door open. I present your calf boots to you, admiring your silhouette in black and red. You style your hair in a simple flip and follow me from the house to my still warm car. The drive is uneventful, only stopping at a few lights, and we arrive at the country club for the party.

Entering the hall, I remove your coat as all eyes turn to gaze upon your striking outfit. I check your coat, stopping at the bar to retrieve a drink for each of us. We sip our beverages, helping ourselves to some of the crudité and mingling with my coworkers and their spouses. The dinner conversation is lively but forgettable, and after some speeches from management, the DJ opens the dance floor and photo booth, a camera focused on the center of a dark background. 

After dancing to a few songs and having a few more drinks, you clutch my shirt, dragging me to the photo booth. You put on a silly hat and give me funky sunglasses for our first picture, then we swap different props for the next. The final picture has you holding an inflatable guitar which catches on the hem of your dress, exposing your garters as well as your bare pussy. The attendant tries to warn you as the timer ticks down, but is too late as the camera flashes and the picture is printed, displayed on the monitor all the while.

Word passes quickly through the crowd and the staff gathers around the booth. I point out your exposed cunt in the picture and your cheeks flush in embarrassment. I pull you aside, whispering in your ear, ""It excites you showing off, doesn't it? I'd like to show you off too."" I take your hand and bring you back in front of the camera.

Unhooking several of the ties to the backdrop, I lash you by your wrists and ankles to the metal tube frame. I set the camera to shoot a picture, capturing your reaction as the zipper of your dress lowers. You turn your head to the side to hide your face, your blushing cheeks nearly blending with your eyeshadow. In every picture, my grin gets wider, as I pull your dress over your head, hanging behind you, away from your body.

I leave you there, tapping the button to take another set of pictures, your body exposed. You suddenly regret not wearing panties as you feel your wetness dampening your thighs. I snatch the microphone from the DJ, announcing: ""This pretty little girl came here with me but she wants to leave with cum from you. Who's going to be the first to have their way with her? Photo remembrance of this event is provided courtesy of our wonderful company.""

I give you a reassuring glance, before turning back to the crowd. ""Bob, you always complain about Carol not fucking you, why don't you have a go? Let's start this party right. Now, Esther, wait. You can be HR manager on Monday. Tonight we're just having a little fun. And Heather, don't worry, your daughter can tell you how to lick a pussy like a good little lesbian. Thanks for bringing her along.""

At the mere mention of sex, Bob from accounting rushes over to you, rubbing his cock through his tight khakis, glancing furtively at you for consent. I walk over and announce: ""Well, he seems a little shy. How about we cheer him on, ladies and gents?"" A roar of applause and yells rise from the crowd as he takes another step towards you, sheepishly lowering his zipper. You notice his cock barely pokes past his open fly, and he hardly presses the head against your hot wet cunt before you feel drips of warm, gooey liquid dribbling onto your thigh. He makes a few furtive thrusts as the camera flashes behind him, apologizing to you then zipping up, the last dribbles of cum soaking into the front of his pants. 

""Well, thanks for giving it the old college try, there. Who's next?"" The camera flashes once more, capturing the glistening fluid dripping down your legs. Before your eyes can adjust, you feel a tongue on your clit, and something rigid sliding between your thighs.  Out of the bottom of your eyes you see long red hair over a poinsettia print top against your legs, and feel hands cupping your breasts, rubbing up and down.

The tongue leaves your clit as you feel your lips parting around the shaft thrusting under you. Regaining your vision, you see Alice, the secretary of production, and realize her husband, Ted, the manager of the maintenance department, is behind you. She is sucking the head of his cock as it rubs over your clit. The sensation makes you cum, warm wetness coating his cock as he continues to push your joints against the restraints. His nails dig into your skin as he shudders. Alice takes his entire load, then licks your cunt, frosting it with his cum.

Your expression goes from one of being embarrassed, to unsure, now reveling in the power and prowess of satisfying so many people, and a line is forming off to the side. The interns approach you next; Dan, a tall, fit undergrad and three recent female graduate who have just started the month prior in sales. He does a short strip tease, tossing his tie into the crowd, and Jan, the senior in charge of personnel catches it. As he peels away his other layers to raucous hooting, he wraps his arm over your shoulders, swinging his body around yours. The boldest of the coeds drapes her arms around your neck, kissing you deeply, her tongue tasting of the sweet liquers in the shots she took earlier.

You hear the smacking of lips behind you,  left, then right, as two mismatched hands grope your chest. The woman kissing you moans as the hands wander back and forth from your body to hers. You feel your cunt spreading as your pussy is finally filled. He thrusts into you forcefully, but measuredly, as the mass of bodies undulates around you. Every few seconds, the flash of the camera goes off, capturing your passion. You scream as you cum over and over, the thrusts into your pussy coming faster, the caresses of your body firmer, the kisses sloppier. 

Mid quiver, he withdraws his cock, and you feel knuckles brush against your tailbone, the rubbing becoming slick, sliding strokes as the other interns pump their hands over his shaft, bringing him to release. He walks out from behind you, giving you a kiss on the cheek as his softening cock smears even more cum onto your stockings. ""What a performance!  Those are some real go getters there. Always there to lend a hand. Heather, come on down!"" 

You see a short blonde with a center parted pixie cut being pushed from the crowd, guided her much older boss. He commands her to remove her top, exposing her tiny tits, and sit down with her legs crossed under her. He shoves her face against your ass, still tacky with cum. You feel her tongue, hot and wet, tentatively lick your asshole before it explores it earnestly. She moans against your cheeks, her strong arms clutching your thighs and pulling your body backwards towards her mouth. She shoves her tongue into your ass as another orgasm builds inside you, tugging at your core.

He pulls out his cock, caressing his sack and stroking the shaft. His eyes dart from your chest to hers, though his gaze spends more time on your firm, full breasts. He steps behind you and she turns underneath you, sliding two long, spindly fingers inside you. The sensation from her thumb circling your clit helps ease her boss' cock into your ass, and the fullness causes a shuddering wave of pleasure to wrack your body. You barely have a second orgasm before he grips your body tightly, his cock bulging as he fills you with more hot, sticky cum. 

Heather stays in front of you as he wipes himself with a linen napkin and rejoins the crowd, the flash of the camera pulsing again and again. Her skill with her fingers seems preternatural, her gaze never leaving your cunt. She pulls her pants down to her mid thigh and rubs herself through her panties, cumming each time you do, just a few seconds after. My voice booms over the speakers: ""I guess she's enjoying that more than she thought. But, it's time to give someone else a turn now. Who's next?!?""

Two more people approach, switching the ties to pull you into a bend. Chris ties your wrists together on one side and Terry loosens the tie on your left ankle. At once, Chris grabs your throat as Terry alternates smacks on your ass, one side then the other. The pink handprints are visible in the rows of pictures falling from the slot of the machine. They quickly fill your mouth and pussy with their cocks, stretching your tight fuckholes. 

Their thrusts become rougher, your body bowing from the force. Heather sneaks back up and sucks on your nipples, her mouth still frigid from the ice of her drink. Your body is tossed back and forth between the men, and she has to bite to keep from losing her grip on your stiff, swollen buds. They high five each other over your back before clutching and stretching your body, as they pull themselves deeper into you. Once more, my voice echoes through the room: ""Who's gonna win the race? Which one of these two are going to cum first? Let's cheer them on, shall we?""

I ask, ""Will it be Chris?"" making the crowd erupt in applause and whoops. ""Or Terry?"" the audience explodes with raucous yelling and clapping. As the cheers die down, you feel your mouth fill with sticky, salty cum, at the same time your pussy receives spurt after spurt of warm gooey fluid. You drop to your knees, swallowing the bracing liquid as the rest of the cum drips down your thighs. ""I think she's had enough for tonight, but we're not done with her, are we?""

I tie a blind fold around your head and refasten your wrist to the other side of the frame, leaving you seated on your sore bottom, legs and arms spread. You can hear footsteps approach, and after a few minutes, warm cum splashes onto your cheeks, chest and thighs. Moans, groans and grunts fill your ears as your body is glazed with the cum from coworker after coworker. Some of the women even approach you to shove your head against their cunts until they get off, leaving your lips coated with their wetness, their grinding motions smearing cum into your skin. 

Finally, I announce, ""Thank You all for coming tonight. Have a happy holiday and drive safe!"" I wrap you in your dress, sticking to your body from the cum, and drive you home to a well deserved shower before I tuck you into bed, the nights events replaying over and over in your mind as you thumb through photo strips of your debauchery.

7uishh,0,2018-02-01,Visa application as an intern,r2f317,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/7uishh/visa_application_as_an_intern/,"Hello everyone,

A large software company wants to employ me as an intern in Korea for one year. Sadly, we are having quite some trouble with the application process. I am a master's student with around 1.33 years of experience in programming. 

First off the embassy at my country (Germany) was quite unwilling to help me with those regards and could not tell me what documents we needed to hand in at the immigration office in Korea, but that is not the real problem.

The problem is how to be granted a visa application by the immigration office. We have found two options until now to obtain visa, which is either the D4 as a trainee or the E7 visa in my case. For those kinds my company has to obtain a document at an immigration office first. The D4 visa would put me and my company under unbearable financial constraints as the immigration office wants me to only earn up to 700,000 Won per month, which of course is not an option for me nor my company. The second one requires me to have one year of POST graduation experience, which I cannot fulfill. 

My company has had no experience yet with foreign interns, so there is no deeper knowledge of this process established yet.

Has anyone had experience with this yet? Is anyone aware of other options to obtain a working visa or some twists in the application process? Could there be other ways? I thank you for your help."

7uj0sn,2,2018-02-01,M4M - The young Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7uj0sn/m4m_the_young_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

7ujb7q,10,2018-02-01,First day on the job! (Adult Services Therapist),echelonwarfare,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/7ujb7q/first_day_on_the_job_adult_services_therapist/,"Hello my fellow social workers,

My first day as an adult services therapist is coming up fast (February 12th).  I am extremely nervous and self-conscious about my abilities.  What if I'm a terrible therapist?  What if I can't help anyone?

My strategy for difficult situations in life has always been to look at things from a different, more positive angle and to remember that no one is perfect and that everything happens for a reason.  Up until now, that has worked out well for me (despite my anxieties in other situations).

Previously, I my internships during my MSW program were doing in-home therapy with kiddos and their families, and then working at a state psychiatric facility where I mostly worked with older adults.  I now have my MSW, but this new position as an adult therapist will be very new to me, as I have not had a lot of experience with CBT (the agency's primary focus).  I am very, very excited for training and I love to learn.  Therapy has always been my dream job, but I'm terrified that I won't be good at working with the general adult population.  I did very well in graduate school (4.0), but I understand that social work in my studies will be very different from social work therapy in practice.  Needless to say, I'm pretty terrified.  Of course, I also want my coworkers to like me.  (Who wouldn't?)

Any advice you folks can give would be greatly appreciated, specifically regarding therapy with adults, getting used to a new job and new coworkers, or starting a first job as a graduated MSW in general.  Thank you all so much.

Edit #1:  Thank you so much to everyone, including the mods, for the wonderful feedback.  You've all made me feel much better and more ready to take on my first day.  I will edit again and post after a few days on the job and let you all know how it went!"
7ujda6,1,2018-02-01,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ujda6/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door."
7ujdpp,4,2018-02-01,Student with a scholarship but can't get a job...,ednyazik,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ujdpp/student_with_a_scholarship_but_cant_get_a_job/,"Hello,

I'm new to this subreddit and don't want to take up too much of your time so here's a quick **TL;DR** of everything that's below:
* Freshman in college
* 40% tuition covered by scholarship
* Rest of it covered by mom's savings.
* I can't find an internship.
* My mom won't let me get a job at fast food place or the sort.
* I have $28 in my paypal.
* I won't be 18 for a couple months.
* Want to do something financially responsible with the money.
* Anything to do with the stock market is off the table....

This is my first year in college and I was incredibly fortunate to receive a scholarship from my school which covers around 40% of my tuition. Blessings from above allowed my mom to save up for the rest of my tuition and a lot more. Now that I'm in college, and I realize how fortunate I am to be in the position that I am but if I've learned anything from the successful adults around me, it's that I had better learn to earn my own money as well. My mom doesn't want me to work a job at fast food place or anything like that, and all 31 companies I applied to for internships rejected me because they do not accept freshmen (that or because I wasn't good enough...). In any case, I have $28 in a paypal account and want to do something financially responsible for myself. I looked into some kind of investing but they all require you to be 18...and you guessed it, mom won't let me; it's something about religion that I don't quite understand.

Anyway, I hope you all can help me. I want to reiterate that I am very fortunate in my circumstances and have no place to complain or even be stressed about money. I just want to start acting financially responsible now rather than waiting until I'm 18 to start thinking about. Thank you all for your help!

EDIT: I apologize if this question has been asked before! I've actually gone through the links in side bar about what to do if you're 15 to 20. Considering my circumstances, not a lot of those responses are super helpful."
7ujrfl,64,2018-02-01,My First Tabletop - The First and Last Adventure of The Lonesome Dove,OWFourFoxAche,rpghorrorstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/7ujrfl/my_first_tabletop_the_first_and_last_adventure_of/,"**TL;DR** I stumbled upon a game group, stole the star player's thunder and insulted the ST's creative process. This is a long one. Not breaking it into parts because it was only the one session.   
  
*****  
  
This was my very first experience with a tabletop roleplaying game. It's not the time I got *The Bug*. I wasn't keen on joining the group or finishing the story. I just wanted these weirdos out of my life. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Almost twenty years ago, I was a fake intern at my mother's office. She just dragged me to work in the summer. No college credit. No chance for employment. Just being held for ransom by a bunch of socially inept engineers. My mom was one of *The Cool Kids*, so before she and her girlfriends left for their pre-lunch mimosas, she'd dump me off at some cube farm to do whatever grunt work they had piled up. I spent my days shredding, filing, stacking boxes, emptying trash bins and scrubbing toilets while the janitorial staff took long lunches. Pure drudgery. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
After a couple of days of this, it fell to me to prep the conference room for morning meetings. The conference room was pretty swanky by late 90s standards. There was a sleek, long table surrounded by plush, wingback chairs. A smaller table was in the back for water, coffee and snacks. The vertical blinds were on an electric track. They were a bit slow, but they never tangled. And the air conditioning was better in this room than in any other on that side of the building. There were even little speakers and mics so everyone could hear even if the whole table were occupied. A real sweet setup. But every Monday morning, the room would be trashed. The tabletop would be smudged with sticky prints. Soda cans kicked under the table dripping dark stains onto the carpet. Worst was the Cheetos crumbs in the crevices of the seats. The wimpy dustbuster couldn't get them out. Not only did I have to clean this room every Monday morning, but people acted like it was my fault when they got orange dust on the backs of their pantsuits. Ingrates. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
One Friday, my mom and her friends checked out for lunch. That lunch rolled into Happy Hour and I was stuck without a ride. I lingered around her office and waited by the phone. I didn't have a cell or enough bus money. When that got boring, I wandered around the empty cube farm and pushed over photographs and plants. Around 5 in the evening, I smelled pizza and followed the scent to the conference room. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I saw Gamers for the first time. Most of them were the sort of people my mother laughed at behind their backs: pudgy, sweaty and badly dressed. There were six of them, but I only remember four clearly. The others kept looking to their leader or the sole lady gamer before deciding what to say or do next. The ST sat at the head of the table with a slice of pizza right on the tabletop. No paper plate or napkins or anything. Just gross. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Gamers:** *(nervously)* Why is she here? Is she allowed to be here?  
**Me:** Am I allowed to be here. Are *you* allowed to be here? You're the ones who leave this room all nasty every weekend. Go be gross somewhere else.  
**Gamers:** You can't talk to us like that. Who do you think you are? I'll go straight to your super. You'll get fired.  
**Me:** Like I give a shit.  
**ST:** You're Suzie's kid, aren'tcha? Got a mouth on you.  
**Gamers:** Suzie from Design? She's so tall. Her hair smells nice.  
  
&gt; Dafuq? Stay away from my mom, Hairsniffer!  
  
**Me:** And you got pizza stains on you. 'Cause you're gross. Clean this shit up and get out.  
**ST:** Nice try, kid, but you have no power here.  
**Me:** Fine. I can't make you leave, but I know who can. Security's right downstairs.  
**ST:** Little bitch--!  
**LadyGamer:** Hang on. We have been a bit sloppy lately. How about we promise to pick up before we go home? &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
*low grumbles from around the table* &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I plopped into a chair. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** Whatever. Fine.  
**A Gamer:** What are you doing?  
**Me:** Uh, watching you? Think I was born yesterday? &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I watched them play. It was intriguing, like I was sitting in the audience of a radio play. But I'd built up this nonchalant persona and I didn't want to spoil it. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**LadyGamer:** *(sweetly)* We're going to be here awhile. You might get bored if you don't join in the fun. You want to play?  
**Me:** Pfft! No. What game is it?  
**ST:** We're playing a special version of *The World of Darkness* with homebrew aspects of my own creation.  
**Me:** Never heard of it.  
**A Gamer:** It's like D&amp;D, but in a twisted reflection of our world. A world contorted by the unseen grip by malevolent forces *blah blah blah*...  
**Me:** ... What's that?  
**A Gamer:** Ah, well, malevolent means--  
**Me:** ^Fuck's ^sake! Gawd. What is *D&amp;D*?  
**ST:** If you want to know, you'll have to play.  
**LadyGamer:** This will be fun!  
**Grumpy Gamer:** This will be stupid! You can't just insert someone right at the crux of the story!  
**ST:** I can and I will. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I pulled up to the table. ST handed me a sheet of paper and a pencil. He told me to jot down a character description. I asked what kind. He told me to describe any kind of person who would fit into present day L.A. and that he would make the dots fit. Everyone was talking about dots and splats and I had no idea what it all meant, so I kept it simple. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** Okay, she's a college student who dances ballet. And she wants to be a movie star, so she moved to L.A., but she's not really good so she's a waitress.  
**Grumpy Gamer:** ^Weak!  
**Me:** ^Asshat.  So what have you guys got, anyway? &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
*Side Note:* I don't exactly remember the characters' names. Just the impressions I had of them. I remember a sitting through a barrage of information and long-winded descriptions. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**LadyGamer/Werewolf:** I am Song-Of-The-Wind-Through-Autumnal-Leaves, a travelling Fianna Galliard... reincarnation... amnesia... long lost love... betrothed to a Vampire Prince!  
**Grumpy Gamer:** *(in an impatient, nasal whine)* A Fianna Galliard is a Werewolf.  
**Me:** Oh, okay.  
**A Gamer/Vampire:** And I'm Song's betrothed from another life, the exiled Assamite Prince, Saddiq Khaddir Ras Ossman. Warlord/Millionaire/Playboy/Art Thief/Spy/Smuggler... lost fortune... rebuilding kingdom ...reformed by True Love... quest to restore memory and humanity together!  
**Grumpy Gamer:** An Assamite is a kind of Vampire.  
**Me:** Okay.  
**Grumpy Gamer/Mage:** I'm Lord Armitage Slade. Hermetic Mage and master of--  
**Me:** And the mage is a mage. Got it. Next. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Rude? Yes. There was also a Mummy reporter and someone playing a Shih (from Demon Hunter X), but I don't remember them doing anything important. The ST was playing an Immortal Kinfolk Mage. He was orphaned and lost his memory, then raised by monks hidden in the Arctic. When his memory returned, he got back to L.A. to inherit his father's billionaire weapons industry. His mother was a celebrated mystery author. He read all her books and learned how to be a master detective. Now he writes under her name in his spare time. And he had twin katanas, twin Desert Eagles, some flashy sports car and a mansion where all these misfits hung out. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** You guys are all super powered and I'm a waitress. This sucks.  
**ST:** You can have powers, too. You can be anything you want.  
**Me:** Can I be a werebat? Y'know, like half vampire/half werewolf.  
**Grumpy Mage:** *(scoffs)* They're extinct.  
**Me:** Ugh, fine. Can I be a super hero?  
**Grumpy Mage:** No, they're not even the same game line.  
**ST:** You can be a super hero.  
**Grumpy Mage:** What?!  
**ST:** A super hero is just a variant of a Mage. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
ST handed me a character sheet with the dots filled in. I didn't know what a Celestial Chorus was or what half of the things on the bottom of the sheet meant, but I was just glad that the Grumpy Mage looked pissed off. He complained that the game was oversaturated on Mages. The ST told him that he had been saving this NPC to help the party through the next encounter because there were some gaps in their combined magical abilities. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** If there's too many mages, I can do something else.  
**Grumpy Mage:** Good.  
**ST:** It's fine. There are many different kinds of Mages. For instance, I'm an Immortal Mage.  
**Me:** So why do you get to live forever and he doesn't?  
**Grumpy Mage:** Not regular immortal. *Highlander* Immortal.  
**Me:** Like on tv? That stupid show with the fake lightning?  
**Grumpy Mage:** It's not stupid!  
**ST:** We all get our inspiration from somewhere. Nothing is truly original.  
**Vampire:** For instance, I'm a huge fan of *Buffy The Vampire Slayer.*  
**Me:** There weren't any werewolf girlfriends in that movie.  
**Grumpy Mage:** The movie? Oh my God.  
**Werewolf:** Well, some of us enjoy the show and can expand upon that tapestry. What kinds of shows do you like? *Star Trek*?  
**Me:** Nah. But I guess *SeaQuest* was okay. It was like underwater *Star Trek*, I think.  
**Grumpy Mage:** *SeaQuest DSV*? Can she get any worse?  
**ST:** What show do you really like?  
**Me:** *Sailor Moon*.  
**Grumpy Mage:** I'm leaving.  
**ST:** No, you're not. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
ST began describing the scene and the action from where they'd last left off. The party was in an isolated part of the docks and getting surrounded by slimy Fomori. After the first round of actions, it wasn't looking too good for them. The Highlander was first on initiative. Instead of taking his action, he looked up and squinted into the mist. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**ST/Highlander:** ""What's that?"" I point out a lone figure moving through the fog. Fox, that's you. Describe your entrance and take an action.  
**Me:** Okay. I fly in, guns blazing and shoot the Fomoris.  
**Grumpy Mage:** Oh, so now she flies? And just how did you fly, huh?  
**Me:** Uh, magic. Duh.  &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Grumpy Mage went on about Paradox. ST simply said that if my style of magic fit my paradigm and the reasonable expectations of the sleepers, then it was permissible. I had no idea what they were on about. So the ST asked me what my superhero theme was like. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** Something like a bird. So she can fly. And...guns...so she can shoot. But pretty. A dove. A dove with a gun.  
**Grumpy Mage:** A dove with a gun. Gimme a break! Why are we allowing this? This isn't even a thing!  
**Me:** It is so! It's even some crap tv show! *Lonesome Dove!* I'm a superhero that's like part cowboy, part saloon girl, wandering gunslinging ace! With wings!  
**Grumpy Mage:** Oh yeah? Well, I'm going to unravel your secret identity and expose you as a fraud.  
**Me:** What? No! You can't. Because... I'm wearing a mask! &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
The Vampire laughed and the Werewolf rolled her eyes. I guess they'd dealt with the Grumpy Mage giving new players shit before. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Grumpy Mage:** You think a mask is going to save you?  
**Me:** It's a magic mask! It's one of those little tiny top hats with the net veil.  
**Werewolf:** Ooh, a fascinator! I love those.  
**Me:** Yeah. So I can still see to shoot, but it's magically obscuring my features. And my skirt's made out of bullets so I don't run out.  
**ST:** I'll allow it.  
**Grumpy Mage:** WHAT?! &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
The ST pointed out something on the sheet that made for 7 dots of magical items and the Grumpy Mage sulked. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Grumpy Mage:** None of this is supported by any ruleset.  
**Me:** What rules? I haven't seen a single rule yet.  
**Grumpy Mage:** Ugh. THE rules set forth by White Wolf Publishing? These books we're all holding?  
**Me:** Fine, then. Let me see some rules.  
**ST:** No. That's *my* rule. No flipping through books during the session. When I want you to find something in print, I'll let you know. The only rules lawyer at this table is me. &amp;nbsp;   
&amp;nbsp;  
Grumpy Mage sank back in his chair and grumbled. Lonesome Dove blew away the Fomori with her silver pistols, then introduced herself to the group. The ST told us that she was on the trail of a kidnapper. The very same person who'd killed Grumpy Mage's wife. This villain was going to use the victim as a sacrifice and do some Nephandus stuff. I gathered that was bad and agreed to help. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
We followed some clues to the hideout/ritual site. We were short on time because there was an alignment of stars. The evil mage used some mind magic to trick Grumpy Mage into thinking his dead wife was calling him. I shot the tip of his pinky off to bring his mind back to reality. ST allowed it. I had a really stellar roll. The other players were laughing at him. Grumpy Mage was pissed. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
The party stopped the ritual sacrifice, routed the minions and caught the villain. But they didn't know what to do with him or the portal he'd opened. The party turned to the Grumpy Hermetic Mage for a solution. He blathered on about the tear in space and paradox, but ultimately said there was nothing he could do. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** Then why don't you just roll it over and sew it shut?  
**Grumpy Mage:** What? That's stupid. You just heard me say that I couldn't pull from this plane to close that one.  
**Me:** No, you're thinking of the tear as a negative space. An empty gap. Think of it as a positive space, so you can do something with it. Look. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I took a sheet of paper as an example. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** So you got this portal fabric, right? Fold the bottom horizontal end up twice, then you put the vertical sides together and seal it up there. It's just like making a skirt. You don't want the edges of the fabric to unravel, so you conceal it in the hem. Everything that's in that little channel stays in. Portal Prison Tube Skirt.  
**Grumpy Mage:** You can't do that!  
**Me:** Why not? This sheet says I've got points in Crafts, so I'm going to say that's Basic Sewing. Portal Prison Tube Skirt.  
**ST:** I'll allow it. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
I still have no idea if that is feasible. To me, Mage: The Ascension is one of those games where, if you out talk your GM, anything is possible. But the Grumpy Mage's face turned purple and his cheeks shook. Even better, I decided to have Lonesome Dove escort the evil Mage into the prison and play warden. So when one of the players asked if they'd ever see me again, I got to say something like, ""When you bring the fight to injustice, I'll be there!"" or some shit. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
It was about 10pm. We packed up and the Grumpy Gamer stormed out. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**ST:** I like the way you think. Ever do any writing?  
**Me:** Only at school.  
**ST:** Well, I'm looking to turn our game here into a novel. Maybe even a movie. One day, you'll tell people that you knew me before I was famous. Until then, if you want to get in on the ground floor, we can hang out. You can tell me about your thought process. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
We were in the elevator and he was trying to get his arm around my shoulders. Sick. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Me:** One: I don't hang out with 45 year old dudes. Gross. Two: You don't need a thought process to write this schlocky shit. You just have to think, ""If Charles Bronson were in a bad telenovela, what would he do?""  
**ST:** You ungrateful little bitch.  
**Me:** Fuck off, Gramps! &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Then I walked away. &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Fox: 1**  
**ST's Heart: 0**  &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Downstairs, the security said they'd been looking all over for me. I doubt it. They called a cab and I went home. I didn't play another RP for another four years at least. By the time I met up with another WoD gamer, there was already the NWoD version of Vampire out. I told them that I'd played a bit. When they asked me what I'd done, I told that new group about my Lonesome Dove and her Immortal Kinfolk Mage/Vampire-Werewolf-Romance/Mummy-and-Mage Super Friend Crossover Demon Portal Shenanigans. They laughed their asses off.

7ukf1o,14,2018-02-01,"F4M Oops, caught me.",wendy-is-darling,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ukf1o/f4m_oops_caught_me/,"""You sure it's okay with your roommate?"" I question, still uncertainty in my voice.

""Yeah.  He's cool, a bit of a control freak but mostly keeps to himself. As long as you don't eat his pop-tarts, I doubt you'll bother him.""

My brother gives a chuckle but I don't laugh.  What kind of grown man was still eating pop-tarts?  Eh, whatever.  It was only going to be for a few weeks after all.  The summer would be near end before I knew it and Becca would have an open room for me at her apartment.  I had never been so eager for college to start back up before.  One year left and then hopefully I would land a job making enough money that I wouldn't have to worry about finding someone to take me in when I break up with my asshole boyfriend and get kicked out.  You know, not that future plans currently included yet another asshole boyfriend, but my track record wasn't amazing so far.  Best to think ahead.

The first couple of weeks bumming at my brother's apartment went by relatively fast.  The only downer was my new internship kept me busy during the week days and then my brother always worked nights.  The only time I saw him was on the weekends.  I guess it worked out for you guys as far as roommates go because he had the place to himself during the day when you worked and you had it nights.  Well.... At least until I showed up and promptly made shit awkward.

To your credit, you had been nice and all.  My brother was right though, you mostly stuck to yourself.  I went out every now and then at night with some friends from the office but most nights I stayed in, my college friends either back at home for the summer or busy themselves with summer jobs.  Most nights I was perched on the living room couch when you came in.  I got to know your schedule pretty well.  On Tuesdays and Fridays you went out for some beers with a few guys from your work.  The other three days of the week you were home at 7:30 PM sharp.  Your awkward 'hello' and 'goodnight' the only words we had spoken to one another.  You're not a people a person probably so I shrug it off.  It did make me curious however what you did in your room for hours with the door shut.  I asked my brother about it once when you weren't home.

""I don't know.  Decapitating bodies on the dark net?  Hacking Russian servers?  How am I supposed to know?  He's probably just gaming.  Don't be so nosy, Molly."" 

Okay, okay, I knew he was right but curiosity was in my blood!  It was an impulse decision really.  It was 7:10 on a Thursday.  I stared at the clock on the hallway wall as I passed by your shut bedroom door on the way to the bathroom.  Twenty minutes before you were home.  Just a little peek inside, see what kind of creeper you are and then I'd be done.

I open the door slowly, blindly reaching for the light switch before I make an attempt to observe my surroundings.  I flick it up.  *Oh*.  It looked like an average room of any 20 something bachelor.  Well, maybe not.  It was in fact a lot neater than the bedroom's of most guys I knew.  My brother was right.  You apparently were lame after all.  There was the big gaming PC right smack in the middle of the room.  It was enough to keep my curiosity satisfied, I supposed.  I turn around to vacate quickly when I hear it.  The front door opening.  *Oh fuck!*.  My brother had left a half hour earlier, it had to be you.  But you were never home before 7:30!  Bastard!

I put my hand on the door knob but I can hear your footsteps reaching the front of the hallway already.  What could I do?  Explain I heard some noises in your room and checked it out?  No.  That sounded made up even in my head.  

Without thinking, I rush to your closet.  Sliding down the wall, tucking myself in a sitting position on the floor, I shut the door most of the way closed.  Putting a hand over my mouth to silence my panicked breathing, I wait.  Within seconds you're in the room.  I watch through the crack in the door.  *Fuck, fuck, fuck!* I mentally scold myself.  I could only hope you weren't going to change clothes and discover me here.

I calm myself and formulate a plan.  At some point you'll leave to go to the bathroom or get some water.... I don't know, something!  And I'll have a chance to sneak out and plant myself in my brother's room like I was in there the whole time.  I just have to be patient and wait it out.  I sneak a look out again, you were settling into your computer, headphones on.  I could try now, hoping the volume was loud enough that you wouldn't notice.  No.  You would notice.  I just have to wait it out.  *For once in your life get it together Molly!*

My back is stiff and achy from the bad position on the floor after nearly two hours.  I was getting annoyed too!  You had to leave at some point, what were you?!  A robot that never peed?  I hear the movement of your computer chair.  Finally!  I watch you rise up and push away from the desk.  This was it, freedom.  And then... you lay down on the bed.  *No!*.  I feel like crying, I was never going to get out of here undetected at this rate.

I curl up putting my head against my knees.  After a few moments I decide to check again.  My eyes go wide.  Holy fuck... That was the biggest cock I had never seen in my life, in person anyway.  I inch ever closer to the closet door, my eyes mesmerized by your rhythmic stroking as you lay back on the bed.  Your own eyes shut, completely oblivious to the voyeur hiding out in your room.  Slowly I re-position myself, intent to move my head closer so I could see just a little bit better.  *There!* I manage to turn around and lean against the door frame until... my shoulder misses entirely and I fall back against the other wall.  A loud thud accompanying my clumsy closet acrobatics.  

The closet door flies open.  I'm busted.  I can't quite read your expression but it seems to fall somewhere between anger and disbelief.  You at least managed to stuff your giant penis away so I'm able to look in your eyes without distraction.

""I can... explain?"" I offer up.

I have no explanation though, other than to remind you that I had indeed not eaten any of your pop-tarts and I think that should be taken into consideration right now.

""Oh, you're going to and it better be good.""

7ukpxv,5,2018-02-01,[M4F] Taking the edge off [Sleeping Single],johnj47,DirtyStoryWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyStoryWriting/comments/7ukpxv/m4f_taking_the_edge_off_sleeping_single/,"The message from Mrs. Collins said two fifteen sharp, in the Board Room.  *The Board Room?*  Suddenly I'm glad I'm an intern, not an apprentice!  Still, the way she said 'don't be late' made me resolve *not* to be late.  

The burly guard in the gray slacks and blue blazer standing at the elevator door as it opened is a surprise.  He asks for my pass and takes a good long look at it before he waves me on.  Security is usually very friendly and full of smiles and apologies for the delays and inconveniences.  This guy makes me feel like I'm in his way.  I say thanks, walk down the short corridor and open the door.  No wonder security is tight.  There stands J. Randolph Croder in the flesh, consulting with Marvin, our boss.  But Randy is *his* boss.  Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, he's the founder of *The Firm*.

I glance around the room and see you seated at the table.  Oh shit.  They called you in too?  Do they know?  Did we get sloppy?  Randy had some hard and fast rules that were conditions of employment.  The top directive, the first thing we were taught was 'Do not defecate in your picnic hamper'.  Picnic hamper?  No 'shit' or 'mess kit' for *The Firm*.   Well Randy has a few years under his belt, but he's no prude.  Randy will not tolerate romantic relationships between employees or with customers because it's bad for business.  It's fine to entertain customers but it's to be strictly business.  It's fine to collaborate with coworkers but it's to be strictly business.  

Well with all the travel we did together in cities all over the country, well, how was Randy to find out, as long as we were very discreet.  We took great pains to ensure we weren't caught.  We were careful not to let any of our colleages even *suspect* we were involved.  We often had to sleep single even when we were in the same city.  Even stayed in different hotels.  Yet here we were.  Randy looks at me with an odd smile.  He knows!  He is going to fire us.  Yes I can tell from the way he's looking at me, he knows.  We're toast.

The door opens and Randy turns his gaze toward it.  He smiles and says ""Well, Jen.  You made it just under the wire.""  Oh no, he caught Jen too?  I wait for him to explode.  But instead Randy smiles warmly at each of us and asks Mrs. Collins to distribute our packages.  As she hands us each a leather portfolio with our names embossed in gold leaf in the upper right corner, Randy welcomes us to *The Firm*.  ""Congratulations.  We wish to offer you full time positions.  Effie's giving out your employment packages, but time is short for one of you so you will have to decide quickly.  Jennifer we want you in Boston and Brianna, you in San Diego.  Josh.  It's Kansas City for you.  But you need to decide right now Josh.  There's a key meeting tomorrow and your plane leaves in ...""  Mrs. Collins fills in the blank.  ""One hour.  The car is waiting.  You better just buy what you need when you get out there and expense it.""
 
Mrs. Collins flips my portfolio open and points to a few places.  ""Salary, bonus, housing allowance, expense account, club memberships, time committment.""  She gives me one of her patented 'are you stupid looks' and says ""Only a fool would refuse.""  She hands me a pen and taps the page near the bottom.  She says one word, ""Signature!""

As I stand Randy claps a meaty hand on my shoulder and crushes my hand in a shake I will not soon forget.  Quick goodbyes all around and I'm on my way down to the car waiting at curbside.

It's a short drive, but long enough for me to wonder what life was going to be like with us half a country apart.  Well with all the travel we do I guess it doesn't really matter all that much, does it?  We can meet up for weekends either at one of our places or someplace on the road.  Not much different than we have been doing.  All we need to do is be careful.

***

Six months later and everything is just great!  Lots of money, lots of interesting work and company nearly every weekend.  I'm a *very* lucky man.  My phone beeps.

*  BEEP  *""Hi, wish you were here.""*

""Yeah Jen.  Boy do I remember Amarillo.  Be right there.  Just let me send one line.""

*  Yeah, me too.  Sleeping single sucks.  Vegas next weekend.  Nite Bri.  SEND"
7ukria,16,2018-02-01,What's your story? We all have interesting lives whether we think so or not. Share yours!,Beerificus,navy,https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/7ukria/whats_your_story_we_all_have_interesting_lives/,"After seeing [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/7ubydd/the_navy_premieres_the_first_episode_of_faces_of/), a couple of comment suggested that while the Navy is highlighting some of the more special &amp; meaningful stories of a sailor's path to the Navy, there may be many more stories untold. So here's mine (incoming wall of text).

I grew up in Los Angeles area (Palos Verdes) in the 80's. Both parents worked, but had decent jobs &amp; while things were expensive in LA, we didn't have a lot to complain about that I can recall. I had some great birthday parties, did cub scouts, got a Lazer Tag rifle (quite expensive for a 10 year old) and thinking back, it was all pretty good. My older sister was a bit crazy, but overall, ""normal,"" family.

My parents were sick of the city &amp; wanted to move somewhere north, or basically away from So. Cal. We ended up in a pretty small town in Nor. Cal., with about a 5000 population for the whole county. Very rural. I went from drive-thru &amp; movie theaters to a 50's style burger stand &amp; some serious red-necks. It was kind of a shock to me, but there was some good there too. We moved between my Jr. High &amp; High School years, so I started High School in the small town. Immediately linked up with some other transplants who'd also moved from other cities &amp; we were friends. So new school, new friends, just got my drivers license, life was good again. 

I was not an A+ student, more like a C- student (except for earth science.. I loved that shit &amp; got A's there). Focused more on friends, learning automotive repair in one of the vocational classes &amp; generally didn't participate in the whole rush to 'find your college' thing Sr. year. School was fine... I was going to graduate, so no big deal. Had lots of pressure to pick a college, even if community (which was 80 miles away). Not interested in more school at all.... Parents kind of threw down a gauntlet, explaining that I was not going to be residing at their address come graduation. I already had a job working fast food, was already paying for my own car (insurance &amp; gas), so kinda felt like I could just move out &amp; roll with it. That was when I met the Navy Recruiter. 

This guy was on shore leave, just back from some kind of east coast sea tour. He was a 2nd class, but don't remember which rate. He was non-stop about how awesome all the port visits were &amp; how each day was filled with something cool to look forward to, all the usual stuff now that I've been in &amp; have left the service. I did drink the koolaid, but focused on a couple of things he said, which still stuck through my enlistment &amp; are still true today: You will learn how to take care of yourself &amp; you will learn skills important to the rest of your life. 

I signed up for the initial things, took ASVAB test (93~!). After getting that done, the recruiter was now at flank speed trying to get me to sign up. I got some advice from the High School counselor to, ""ask more questions."" So I did... I asked about the different jobs, where I'd be stationed, all of it. I'm not trying to bash on recruiters, but I very distinctly recall him saying, ""Whatever you want!"" So I signed up &amp; more specifically, volunteered submarines during DEP since that was my desire. I mean come on... Hunt for Red October was awesome!

I'm going to skip through my 4 year enlistment, because many of those stories are not new or unique. I'll save them for another day. I shipped out to Great Lakes, then to Groton for Sub School &amp; SONAR ""A"" School. Got orders to USS Honolulu SSN-718 in mother fucking **HAWAII**. Spent at bit over 3 years on the boat, saw many things, met some awesome people &amp; did things I'm proud of. Ultimately, I decided to part with the Navy &amp; get back to civilian life.

Most of my story that I'm proud of comes after the Navy. And it's all because OF the Navy. I flew out, July 4th 1998. Re-born on the 4th of July. Flew to Sacramento where some of my old HS friends were, was picked up &amp; drove straight to Lake Tahoe for the 4th celebration. Not having any plans to stay anywhere yet, my buddies offered to let me hang out at their apartment in Davis, CA, where they were going to school. I had about $4000 saved &amp; the only plans were to blow it out &amp; party. So we did that... and when I had about $500 left after two weeks, I decided I should probably get a job now &amp; find my own apartment. 

Looked in the paper &amp; saw a job for Security Officer. Well, I've stood watch above &amp; below decks for a couple years now, so I must be qualified for this job! One phone call, drove downtown Sacramento to the Burns Security office, took a test &amp; was assigned a location *that same night.* Spreckle's Sugar Factory in Woodland, CA. Yep... went from guarding multi-million dollar weapons to sugar beats &amp; more so was watching out for fire than anyone trying to steal anything. The job was really easy.... every half hour walk about a 1.2 mile loop. Repeat &amp; log the book. I think it was something like $9:50/hr, or not enough to get my own apartment. So I pitched the idea that I just keep living in the college bachelor pad &amp; contribute to rent. They agreed &amp; I ended up working for about 6 months before I felt the need to learn something new (more quals!!!). 

Checked the paper &amp; found a job listing for, ""Electro-mechanical repair."" Sounded neat, the company had a weird name, so I called up &amp; applied. Went in for an interview &amp; the service manager pretty much demanded that I provide my DD-214 to prove that I had an honorable discharge. I got the paperwork the next day &amp; was hired on the spot. I spent a year &amp; a half learning the insights of Ice Cream machines, working on motors, control electronics, refrigeration &amp; pretty much any other maintenance required. It was a fun job, but the hours killed me in summer. Up at 5 AM to head out on a ~180 mile trip to a store w/broken equipment, ending my day sometimes 300 miles south of where I started around 10 PM. I was making around $12/hr then plus an obscene amount of overtime. Service manager loved me, because I didn't bitch about the schedule or the hours. MO MONEH! I had a new car to buy at some point since the junker I had was making more &amp; more noises. Luckily I drove a work truck from the company I really didn't have to drive my car much anyway. 

The company went through a handful of other repair techs throughout the ~18 months I was there. Service manager would always tell them, ""Be like /u/Beerificus."" It was easy to set an example having done the many things I did while in the Navy. Shiiiit.... 17 hour day? No problem... I still get to go home &amp; have some beers. That's a win. Oddly, no one else that was hired while I was there was ex-military. One old guy was pretty good but I remember thinking, ""Why are all these guys so fucking lazy??"" It was about this time I started to reflect on where I got my work ethic &amp; why it was important to me to keep it up to a high standard. I also needed some more since I had somewhat mastered what there was to learn at this place &amp; did not see a lot of room to grow. 

As fortune would have it, my buddies in Davis were on the cusp of graduation from Engineering programs at UC Davis. My one good friend then had an internship with a large tech company nearby. He was offered a full time position upon graduation &amp; basically accepted their offer &amp; moved closer to where the company was. I followed, ya know, cause cheap rent ;)  In his first months at the company, but already having interned for 2+ years, he let me know that his team was looking for a computer technician. I asked what I needed to do to interview &amp; he sent me a name. I called up &amp; arranged for a phone interview the next day. At work the next day, repairing a shake machine at a McDonalds, I took a break to do my phone interview covered in grease &amp; moldy ice cream, very ready to try something new. Guy calls me right on the dot at agreed time, I answer &amp; we start talking about my qualifications. Turns out, he was an ex-submariner (resigned commission as an O-3). I don't think we really talked much about computers, but after about 20 minutes, he says, ""Well, I know your completely qualified for this position having been a Sonar Tech and all that."" Most of his questions were how fast I got my sub quals &amp; what I learned outside of my Sonar Tech role. Finished the conversation with, ""Come by next Monday &amp; we'll get you a badge."" That easy... something to be said for right place, right time.

Going from pure blue collar repairman to *sorta blue* collar computer tech at a large company was awesome. I was all wide-eyed &amp; ready to learn as much as possible. I started under a 12 month contract &amp; 6 months in, was hired full time. I guess I had proven myself, &amp; the board repair, computer work (installing OS, changing parts, etc.) was all very easy to me. Again, when offered the full time job, I received feedback about my work ethic &amp; how positive it was to work with someone eager to learn. Again, I immediately thought back to things I'd learned in the Navy, from my crew mates &amp; having to endure some situations where you have to push through a tough scenario. Something like an ORSE inspection seemed so much harder than anything thrown at me here. Everything seemed easy after those things. That was July, 2000. 

Nearly 18 years later, I've been promoted 6 times, have held 4 different positions at the same company &amp; have ascended the ranks to become a full time engineer. *But but... you didn't go to college???* Let me tell you, if you can do a job better than someone with a Masters degree in that **exact** field, no one gives a shit what education you have. I have to be thankful to the company for recognizing me as a candidate for some of the positions I've held. In order to climb the ladder to my latest spot, I had to do panel interviews, provide references &amp; prove that I can do the work. I was chosen over what on paper would be more qualified persons. 

Each ladder rung I've ascended reminds me of what that recruiter said long ago, **""You will learn how to take care of yourself &amp; you will learn skills important to the rest of your life.""** While some people's stories come from what they feel they owe the country that has given them their life's opportunities, I've come to accept that the lessons the Navy has to teach can propel you forwards &amp; past your peers. I would have never imagined that I'm working on engineering projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars. I never would have imagined that I'm creating things that very well may change all of our futures. And how did I get here? Some life lessons from stellar shipmates, enduring some tough times with those shipmates and learning that I really have far more potential than I realize. It's too easy to give up. I want more than that &amp; I have the Navy to thank for it. I'm forever grateful to the amazing crew of SSN-718 from 94' - 98'. You are still my family &amp; I still keep in touch with many of you today. Thank you! I have not wasted any opportunities &amp; can only appreciate the many lessons I learned in those short 4 years.

tl;dr - The Navy taught me things I have kept close my entire life so far. I'm a better person for it &amp; strive to always be that better person. There's a lot to learn through hardship &amp; discipline. Don't forget those lessons! I would not be successful today without them."
7ukyvj,135,2018-02-01,Announcing the DigiByte PR and Marketing Partnership,Chilling_Silence,Digibyte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte/comments/7ukyvj/announcing_the_digibyte_pr_and_marketing/,"Dear DigiByte community,

It is with great pleasure that we can confirm we have engaged a PR Agency to begin aiding DigiByte in this exciting next step for us. We have engaged them to help spread the DigiByte brand on a global scale, and after countless hours of sifting through a number of options, background checks, due diligence, discussions with the Agency, we’ve decided on one company to help us.

Then we crowdsourced the funds, the DigiByte community stepped up and we reached our goal in just a little over 24 hours. A fantastic achievement we should all be proud of.
We reached our goal of 300,000 DGB!

With this, we are honored to be able to announce that we are partnering with Tom Cridland Public Relations!

The goals of this partnership and the marketing funds are so that we can primarily expand our awareness of DigiByte globally, exposure, building dApps and other use-cases for the DigiByte Blockchain. These funds raised will not be used for exchange listing fees. We have maintained a firm stance thus far that we do not and will not speculate on the price of DigiByte, and this stance will not be changing.

It’s also worth mentioning that the funds raised thus far are purely to engage with this agency, and we still maintain our 1,600,000 DigiByte “stretch goal” which we estimate would provide us with the funding to cover the next 12-months worth of DigiByte marketing materials.

We also promised a little something more, and so we’re super excited to be able to let you know that we’ll have a merchandise store shortly! We will be announcing a partner in this space who will handle it all for us, and will be doing a “merchandise store launch special” soon to coincide with this.

Please join me in warmly welcoming Tom Cridland Public Relations to the DigiByte community, we can’t wait to see where things go from here!

Here’s a few Q&amp;A we’ve had already from our Telegram channels:
- Why did you not pick a Fortune 500 company? What’s the advantage of a more modest PR agency?

A main advantage of working with Tom Cridland Public Relations, as opposed to a bigger corporate PR agency is the fact that we know that the person writing and pitching has a proven track record, as opposed to dealing with an “account manager” who outsources this to a trainee or intern. Tom Cridland Public Relations is also a lot more transparent and their methods are more dynamic, so fair more suited to DigiByte.

- How will the PR agency be paid?

They have agreed to accept payment in DigiByte. This naturally provides additional incentive for them to generate results, as it makes them an investor in DigiByte as well.

- How does the DigiByte team know they won’t run off with the DigiByte?

We have a signed engagement letter from Tom Cridland Public Relations confirming they will refund the DigiByte if the contract is breached

- Has the PR agency marketed Blockchain technology before?

The firm is doing PR/Marketing across various industries, just not fashion. The scientific approach and pitching process is one that remains applicable across all industries and simply needs to be adapted to blockchain.

- What areas will the PR agency be working on for DigiByte?

They will be targeting Online, Print, TV, Radio, They have been able to secure coverage on Podcasts.

- Are they going to focus on social media at all?

Social media marketing is not their core expertise, however they have expressed a willingness to assist where possible.

- How will the campaign be audited and the success measured?

We have two methods to begin with. Firstly, we will have a Google spreadsheet that will be internally shared with the heads of the Foundation team, and we can identify the real-time status of any particular PR outreach. Secondly, we have access to the DigiByte email address at any point so we can monitor emails and other communication through this.

- How many clients does this PR agency serve?

The maximum amount of active clients the firm will have is 15. This is due to them providing a more focused, detailed approach in generating results for their clients.

- What other clients has this agency been involved with?

We felt this was best to share what Tom Cridland Public Relations have shared with us, directly:

Since 2015, We have continuously been securing coverage in the likes of NBC, CBS, The CW, National Public Radio, BBC, ITV, CNBC, The Times, The Telegraph, Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, The Independent, The Guardian, Sydney Morning Herald, Daily Star, Daily Mirror, Forbes, Fast Company, Esquire, Evening Standard, CityAM, The New York Times, El Pais, ABC, Il Sole 24 Ore, The Hindustan Times, South China Morning Post, The Atlantic, The Huffington Post, Bild, Die Welt, GQ, Daily Express, Bloomberg and Fox News.

Our PR methods are dynamic, relentless, organised and as a scientific as possible. We think the importance of writing is overlooked by many in PR and articulately conveying actual story ideas to journalists, as opposed to bombarding them with scatter gun press releases that resemble consumer facing marketing material, yields the best results. Above all, our way of securing press can be applied to any industry and we would relish the opportunity to work with DigiByte.

We just secured Henry Poole coverage in Vanity Fair: https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/how-jacqueline-durran-created-costumes-fit-for-a-princess-and-a-prime-minister
 
And the BBC: http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20171215-the-real-reason-we-love-a-suit
 
We’ve been helping build Cornerstone, the shaving subscription brand, through securing press like this feature in The Independent: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cornerstone-shaving-subscription-service-razor-blades-club-boots-mens-aisle-balm-cream-gel-scrub-a7825346.html
 
We just scored the watch start-up, Freedom To Exist, this feature in The Telegraph: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/11/27/high-flying-couple-created-thriving-side-business-holding-two
 
Cocorose London had a huge spike in sales thanks to this great Daily Mail piece we secured them: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4090234/Woman-sold-innovative-foldable-shoes-market-stall-rejected-100-factories-turns-1m-30-countries-Pippa-Middleton-fan.html

After our pitch on ‘the socks you don’t need to wash’, within 48 hours Corrymoor Socks had appeared in The Guardian, Metro, Express, Daily Mail, Telegraph, Mashable, Radio 5 live, Radio Coventry, BBC World Service in UK (just to name a few!) to the likes of Good Morning America and The Sydney Morning Herald internationally. We were subsequently asked us to halt our PR services for 6 months so could keep up with sales.

By pitching creatively on a number of different angles, from body image, women in business, Brexit, gender pay gap, ethics, sustainability, fashion-specific, women with children to name a few, we have secured Rose &amp; Willard coverage in the likes of BBC News, The Guardian, Metro, Daily Mail, Town &amp; Country, Evening Standard, International Times, The National, Huffington Post, Cosmpolitan, ABC, Marie Claire, The Times, Die Welt, The Australian and The Telegraph of multiple occasions.

7uldvs,15,2018-02-01,What do you all think about Career Fairs?,thesquarerootof1,UniversityOfHouston,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/7uldvs/what_do_you_all_think_about_career_fairs/,"I am an electrical/computer engineering student and today I went to my first career fair at the university. I appreciate the university in organizing these career fairs and having these available to us, but I really disliked the engineering career fair I went to today.


Although I talked to a few companies, handed out my resumes, and it seemed like one of the companies liked me enough to say they will probably call me back, the career fair rubbed me off the wrong way.


As a Computer Engineering student that wants to get into tech, the only companies that were present were all oil/gas, energy, consulting, and pretty much non-tech. Although I understand the reason why, its because Houston is not a tech city, its all energy. Another reason why I did not like the career fair is because there were way too many people there and there were huge long lines for almost every company. Waiting two hours to talk to one company is ridiculous. They should not let freshman and sophomore students attend these career fairs because the chance of them getting hired is really low anyway. Also, all the companies there were...just...not exciting. They were so non-interesting and boring (perspective varies of course). It is also highly competitive. All the companies I have talked to said there were only 2-3 summer internship positions available.


I am just curious to see what everyone's opinion on UH's career fairs, whether it is the engineering one or non-engineering. A lot of my classmates in my major advised me not to go, due to the fact that it is not good for EE/CompE majors. I would really like to go to the computer science career fair, but since I am in the engineering college, I can't go.


So, what did you all think about it? Are other career fairs good?"
7uleh0,1,2018-02-01,The Post Review,AGrandQuiet,u_AGrandQuiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AGrandQuiet/comments/7uleh0/the_post_review/,"The story of The Post is that Spielberg first read the script under a year ago. While working postproduction on Ready Player One he somehow got permission from Warner to go make the thing. Tom and Meryl got attached a month after that and they were shooting a prestige period drama by summer. It’s not something that you really need to know, the film feels seamless even without that information. I mean, it’s not like the man has ever been guilty of turning out a non-functional film, but you get the sense that the hurried breathlessness and claustrophobia of the joint was influenced by its rapid production.


Y’all can see why watching it that they wanted to get it out so fast. The story of a corrupt and venal president lying to the public and attempting to use the executive branch of government to silence criticism. The story of the truth seekers with the ability and conviction to take him to task. The story of the woman who used the power available to her to defy the system. It plays well.

Streep is Katharine Graham, publisher of the Washington Post. At the time a small family paper, she took the position after her husband’s suicide. Spielberg shoots her amidst a great sea of men struggling to hold court in a position that, she has not yet expanded to fit. She is of course fantastic in the role, it’s Meryl Streep for fucks sake. Hanks is Ben Bradlee, the irascible editor in chief, committed to the ideals of the free press and of quality journalism but with a chip on his shoulder that he and his paper aren’t taken seriously by the major players. He is of course fantastic in the role, it’s Tome Hanks for fucks sake.

Then, like third billed is Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian the Post’s investigative reporter who follows his gut and chases his leads and eventually finds his way across something big. He’s great, was always going to be. He got old, developed a face interesting enough for prestige TV and all of a sudden has been reborn as a bankable dramatic actor. Seeing him in a Spielberg joint feels close to revelatory. He just dances through the script with grace and nuance and finds the moments where he can release that comedian chained inside himself and it’s wonderful. Pay attention to a late dialogue he has with Jesse Plemons about the identity of his source, it’s masterful.

So after this opening coda, the plot hounds us through the week that starts with the New York Times publishing confidential government documents regarding the United States’ international relationship with Vietnam leading up to and during their failed war. Nixon then bars them from publishing anything and as history goes, the Post defied the ban to spill those secrets anyway. Part of its power lies in the procedural, it’s not proclaiming its politics, it’s rarely even about nobility and resolve, it’s just a bunch of people doing their jobs.

The Streep stuff is as close as it gets to commentary. In a slight B-plot we watch her struggle to reconcile her new position and reportage with her place in Washington high society. Another side story involves the struggling newspaper’s public offering of stock in order to remain in business, and the threat that a prominent lawsuit would bring to the business’ future viability. It is important that all of this weight must fall onto a woman, it’s the way it tends to go anyway, ambitious men protected in their follies by the handy presence of a fall-not-guy.

But it embraces that, becomes about fear and power and doing the right thing. When we climax at the Supreme Court the script don’t let this become some courtroom drama for ten minutes. It’s not about that, we don’t want to hear about law, what does legality have to do with anything that happened? We just saw about two hours of people sweating and deliberating and ultimately being good. Who cares if you don’t own a newspaper? That’s not what the film is about, it’s about getting you to get up and be your best.

The political world is hot garbage right now. Do something. We don’t get many agitprop films unless they’re coming from agitprop filmmakers, think Ken Loach and try not to think about his troubling anti-Semitism. They come across bold and didactic, beliefs firmly held and delivered fierce, preaching politics but without compelling action. There are part of Loach’s socialist vision I admire, but he offers us no way to fight for it.

The Post is more humble, it is an argument for goodness, for decency and the mobilisation of resistance against corrupt power no matter how small. It’s a real Spielberg thing to divide a portion of time to even the smallest characters. Here he presents interns and typesetters and engineers, they all have their part to play, they are all engaged in a heroism of some sense.

We watch how we act, we must be aware of how we come into ourselves, how we engage with the world. I carry a sense of shame everywhere that I go that I am not doing more. I must, it is imperative and yet I sit and fail to make the world better. The Post rouses you, holds you and makes you want to fight. I am weak and broken and useless. I will try my best anyway.

7ultcu,3,2018-02-01,Muscle soreness worse on T than pre-T??,Lotterhippie,FTMFitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMFitness/comments/7ultcu/muscle_soreness_worse_on_t_than_pret/,"Hi! I've been working out for... almost 3 years now?? but I've only been on T for about 6 months.
Due to university and jobs and general poor lifestyle choices I've had an on-off relationship with the gym, where I would go through months of going every second day without missing a beat followed by months where I barely showed up- if I even did at all.
Every time I left the gym tho I'd come back months later without having done ANY exercise in the meantime and just pick everything back up like I left it and I was completely fine. I had the typical sore muscles for a day or two, usually the worst on day one after work out, and waited for that to subside until I go again to take care of the healing process. The second time around the soreness wasn't much of a deal anymore and I could just go back to going every second day.

For the first four months of T I went irregularily to the gym (due to private issues and university stress) but then I had to move for an internship and it was impossible for me to work out for about two months- until this week. So on tuseday after work I showed up to the campus gym and did my stuff. I was careful this time, knowing I have an actual job to do now and didn't go too high with my weights, and was able to push through my three sets per exercise, 8-12 repetitions each, 1.5 minutes break between each set (just saying in case someones an expert and can tell me it's wrong or sth lmao).
Everything felt fine and I even had the feeling I could've done more, but didn't feel like pushing myself and just took things slowly.

But a day later I already felt the intense soreness and could barely move or sit still or basically exist- and today it was even worse, as everything seemed to stiffen up and I couldn't lift my arms.

I noticed that most of the soreness is focussed on my chest and the muscles connected to it. I hit my chest even less than I did before working out and everything was fine and dandy at the gym, I'm also sure I did the exercises correctly as the trainer who was walking around talked to me every now and then and corrected my form in certain exercises if needed- so I'm sure she would have said something in case it was wrong.

So now the question: Is muscle soreness more intense on T? Does this have something to do with the normal bodily changes?

Thanks!"
7um8lo,41,2018-02-01,Mock Draft - 2/1/18,sfzen,NFL_Draft,https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/7um8lo/mock_draft_2118/,"I guess I'll put together my first mock of the year. No trades, but I will base this on free agency (QB only) speculation. I'm also assuming SF wins the coin toss for #9 because Raiders luck. Shout out to /u/Apache1021, I'm largely using his big board with a few of my own tweaks.

Free agency moves:

Kirk Cousins to the Broncos.

Drew Brees stays with the Saints.

Jimmy Garoppolo franchised by the 49ers.

Sam Bradford to the Cardinals.

Teddy Bridgewater stays with the Vikings.

Case Keenum to the Browns.

Josh McCown doesn't retire, stays with the Jets.

**1) Browns - Sam Darnold, QB, USC**

I'll start off by saying I think Rosen is the best QB in the draft. But with the Browns signing Keenum, I think they like Darnold's upside better, and new GM Dorsey actually gives him some time to develop behind Keenum. At least half a season, you know? Keenum hands off the starting job in year 2 whether he's successful or not.

**2) Giants - Josh Rosen, QB, UCLA** 

The Giants land their future. Rosen is the best QB in the draft, and I think he'll fit the Giants really well. My only concern with him is the concussion history.

**3) Colts - Bradley Chubb, DE/OLB, NC State**

Ultimately, I think the Colts will trade down from this spot with a team looking for a QB. But I'm not projecting trades here, so Indy fills a big need with the best pass rusher in the draft.

**4) Browns - Saquon Barkley, RB, Penn St.**

I know some Browns fans would much prefer Fitzpatrick here and a RB later on. But while Fitzpatrick is great, I think Barkley is easily the best player in the draft, and a talent like him is too hard to pass up. The Browns use 1 and 4 to grab a tandem they hope will be the faces of the franchise for years to come.

**5) Broncos - Connor Williams, OT, Texas**

Denver gets their QB in Cousins, and I wouldn't be surprised if they make him some promises to get him to sign. With this pick, they keep a promise. I need to watch the OL prospects a little more, but right now, Williams is the #1 tackle in the draft. I think Nelson is a better overall prospect, but the Broncos don't want to take a guard this early.

**6) Jets - Baker Mayfield, QB, Oklahoma**

The Jets keep McCown around for another year, but they know they need to find a QB. Mayfield might even take the starting job right away, but McCown can hold down the fort if the team wants to take their time bringing the rookie up to speed. They've learned from the Hackenberg mistake, and stay the hell away from Josh Allen.

**7) Buccaneers - Minkah Fitzpatrick, CB/S, Alabama**

The Bucs execs are doing backflips in the war room while some poor intern trips over himself sprinting to hand in the card. Fitzpatrick is an elite talent, and he falls right into Tampa's DB-needy lap. Grimes is old and VH3 has yet to meet expectations.

**8) Bears - Orlando Brown, OT, Oklahoma**

The Bears have to protect Trubisky if they want him to be their franchise QB. Brown is the best OT available, and he'll be thankful to play next to a great interior line.

**9) 49ers - Quenton Nelson, OG, Notre Dame**

They've found their QB in Jimmy G., now they just have to keep him upright.

**10) Raiders - Tremaine Edmunds, LB, Virginia Tech**

The Raiders take the extremely athletic and versatile young LB in Edmunds. He can slot into any LB spot on the field, and even rush the passer if needed.

**11) Dolphins - Roquan Smith, LB, Georgia**

Smith is my BPA, and he fills a need on the Dolphins' defense.

**12) Bengals - Mike McGlinchey, OT, Notre Dame**

The Bengals lost a lot of OL talent last offseason and didn't really make up for it. The offense struggled hard. I think they'll reach for McGlinchey here.

**13) Redskins - Vita Vea, NT, Washington**

The Skins lose Cousins but pick up Alex Smith. He could use more weapons, but there aren't any real standout receivers this year. Vea fills a big hole at NT and gives Washington a talented young DL.

**14) Packers - Denzel Ward, CB, Ohio State**

The Packers need CB help, and they don't hesitate to take it. I think Isaiah Oliver is the 2nd best CB in the draft, with Josh Jackson and Denzel Ward fighting over the 3rd spot, but with the success of Marshon Lattimore, I think the Ohio State pedigree might push Ward over the top for this choice.

**15) Cardinals - Josh Allen, QB, Wyoming**

Here it is. He had to go somewhere. I really don't like Allen as a prospect. He seems like a great guy, but I just don't see NFL QB in him. Personally, if I were the Cardinals, I'd take Lamar Jackson every day of the week here. But NFL execs will be drooling over Allen's size and arm strength, and we all know someone's ego will get the better of him and he'll decide he can turn Allen into a star. Thankfully, the Cardinals at least managed to sign Bradford in free agency, so they'll sit Allen and let him develop before throwing him into the fire. Assuming Bradford stays healthy, that is. 

**16) Ravens - Calvin Ridley, WR, Alabama**

The Ravens take the first WR off the board. Ridley is generally seen as the WR1 of this draft, and the Ravens desperately need receiver help.

**17) Chargers - Da'Ron Payne, DT, Alabama**

The Chargers' run defense was terrible, and they need a good DT in the middle to be a force. Payne is a physical freak and fits the bill.

**18) Seahawks - Marcus Davenport, DE/OLB, UTSA**

The Seahawks take the small-school star in Davenport to man the edge. They could go guard here, but I think they wait on that. 

**19) Cowboys - Derwin James, S, Florida State**

The Cowboys could use a safety to round out their secondary. I was a little torn between safety and LB here, but James has the versatility to be kind of a 'tweener in certain packages. He reminds me a lot of Kenny Vaccaro.

**20) Lions - Derrius Guice, RB, LSU**

The Lions have needed a run game to balance their offense for a while. Riddick is an excellent receiving back, but I see Abdullah as the same kind of player, rather than a complimentary runner. Guice would bring that force between the tackles Detroit has been lacking. 

**21) Bills - Lamar Jackson, QB, Louisville**

The Bills clearly aren't committed to Tyrod Taylor. I think they'd rather a more traditional QB, but they don't want to start the season with nothing but Taylor and Peterman at QB. Jackson is a huge talent, and in the right situation, he should flourish.

**22) Bills - Billy Price, C, Ohio State**

The Bills pick again, this time adding talent to the offensive line. With the unfortunate sudden news of Eric Wood's retirement, the Bills need to find a replacement Center on short notice. Price is an excellent prospect and he should be a quality starter right away.

**23) Rams - Josh Jackson, CB, Iowa**

The Rams may be losing both Johnson and Coleman, and Webster is dealing with a big Achilles injury. The Rams take Jackson to plug a big hole in the defense.

**24) Panthers - Christian Kirk, WR, Texas A&amp;M**

The Panthers need WR help. I actually agree with some Panthers fans that safety may be an even bigger need, but the safeties available don't really fit the mold they need. Kirk would provide a slot option to go along with big Devin Funchess, Curtis Samuel, and Kaelin ""Tedd Ginn Jr. Jr."" Clay. 

**25) Titans - Harold Landry, DE/OLB, Boston College**

The Titans need help getting to the QB, and they take the best pass rusher available in Landry. 

**26) Falcons - Braden Smith, OG, Auburn**

The Falcons' high powered offense took a step back this year, especially in the redzone. Beefing up the O-line should help shove them back in the right direction.

**27) Saints - Dallas Goedert, TE, South Dakota State**

The Saints' run game was incredible this year, but the passing game sputtered at times. Coby Fleener isn't worth his contract and is likely to be cut. Goedert comes from a small school, but he's shown the athleticism and receiving ability that Sean Payton wants in a TE.

**28) Steelers - Rashaan Evans, ILB, Alabama**

Hopefully Shazier can come back at 100%, but the Steelers need to be prepared for life without him. Evans is a do-it-all LB that should fit nicely into their defense. 

**29) Jaguars - Will Hernandez, OG, UTEP**

Bortles looked good this year, and the defense is amazing. Now the Jags need to help out the offense. Building the O-line will make life easier on both Bortles and young star Fournette.

**30) Vikings - Maurice Hurst, DT, Michigan**

The Vikings miss out on the top OL prospects, and decide to take their anger out on the rest of the league by improving an already deadly defense. Hurst should fill in the 3T spot next to Linval Joseph.

**31) Eagles - Malik Jefferson, LB, Texas**

Yes, I think the Pats win the Super Bowl. Please, Eagles, prove me wrong.

Jordan Hicks can't stay healthy, so the Eagles take a LB to man the middle of the field. OT might be a bigger need, but the draft just doesn't fall in their favor this time.

**32) Patriots - Ronnie Harrison, S, Alabama**

Harrison is up there at the top of the BPA list, Chung is getting old, and the rookie can contribute on special teams if he doesn't win the starting job right away. Seems like a Belichick kind of move. Or even more likely, they'll trade out of the 1st round and take a QB in the 2nd."

7umvuz,5,2018-02-01,My story from Texas (Roommate invited gangsters in my apartment),lardos123,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7umvuz/my_story_from_texas_roommate_invited_gangsters_in/,"I am already back to the UK, but have been thinking about my experiences in Texas. Oh lord, how much s**t I’ve experienced there in terms of my living condition. That will be a bit like a story but I hope you enjoy it.

So, I arrive in Texas for my 1 year internship. I stayed at the hotel I was working at for the 1st one month, but after that I had to find a place. So I look around apartment complexes and stumbled on a very nice one I liked. It had gym, pool and all that kind of stuff and also a person who was already living in the 2 bedroom apartment. 

I haven’t gotten my 2nd salary yet, right?! I go to meet this girl who looked very innocent, oh boy I was wrong! So we chat at her place, she had this cute cat, right and we talked about how much the rent is, when it needs to be paid and what the lease is in general. 

Until the day I moved in, she starts talking to me how religious she is and tells me that her parent will come and visit the place so they can meet me, because I am a guy. So the dad was questioning me 1000 things, her mom as well sat me on the couch to teach me that I can’t touch their daughter while living together. Bear in mind, I am just trying to have a roommate. 

Fast forward to a week after I moved, this girl starts inviting these dudes into the apartment every nights. I am not joking, this was every night with different dudes. It was the same story, 8PM - a stranger comes into the apartment, they stay in the living room smoking weed and flirting with each other (my room was right near the living room), 1 hour later they were in her bedroom. And that was every night with a different dude for the next 2 weeks. I barely met these people but a couple of times we said hi to each other. Oh well, they were mostly gangsters (real talk). After the 10th day there, every morning I looked at the table and I could see a pile of weed and a gun. 

I used to wake up at 4:30AM, because I had to open the hotel at 6:00AM and not only I see a gun on the table but her fu**ing cat pissed all over the carpet and always ate my food from the kitchen boards. Not only that, but because of the disastrous hygiene, there was roaches. Not to mention, that after the moaning in the bedroom, every morning I would go to brush my teeth in the bathroom (that has a door to her room, but not to mine) and I would see 4/5 used condoms on the floor even though the  bin was right near the sink. 

Enough said, I went on Craigslist from my 3G internet on my iPhone 4s at the time to post adds, because there was no WiFi in the apartment. Even though, it sounds so weird telling that story now, I am happy I have seen s**t. 

Fast-forward to my next roommate from hell story after I moved from this place. Let me know if you want to hear the next one with the passive aggressive, manipulative, criminal, crack addicted roommate I found off craigslist that threatened to kill me. "

7uncaz,1,2018-02-01,(26/f)Is my long distance boyfriend (28/m) trustworthy?,rubi2092,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7uncaz/26fis_my_long_distance_boyfriend_28m_trustworthy/,"I am very sorry for the long post but I can really use some advices. Thank you very much for your help.

Our history: 

My boyfriend and I had been together for almost 2 years. I met him at my college's new student orientation, and right away, I had the biggest crush on him. However, at the time, he was in a relationship so I did not pursuit him. I befriended him and he studied together with me and my classmates. We were friend for a year, and during that time, he had broken up and gotten back with his now exgirlfriend for at least 4 times. When they finally broke up with her the last time, I had hope that I could ask him out, but he then told me that he had feeling for another girl and he asked me to help set them up together. I was sad but I did it for him because I wanted him to be happy. Thing didn't go well for him and the other girl, and he was upset, so we went hiking together. A week after the hike, I drove him home after our study session, and he confessed to me that he had feeling for me. A day later, we decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend. A week later, he told me he loved me.

My concerns:

The first few months we were together, I had to constantly put up with him missing his exgirlfriend. To me, it was normal, because they had been together for about 5 years. I understood that it would take at least a year for him to get over her. But that is still my first concern about our relationship.

Second and biggest concern is about his past broke-up with his ex. Many of the broke-up period was due to him sexting another girl or making out with girls he met at parties. He was very honest to me about his wrongdoing. The sexting was an on and off thing for 5 years as well. I told him that it was the past and as long as he didn't do it again, I would be willing to look past it. Well, the first summer that we were together, I got an internship that was 2 hours away from where he was, so I was able to drive back to see him every 2 weeks. The first time I came back to see him, we drank and he got drunk, he then confessed to me that he started texting the girl he sexted before. He just texted her to say hello and nothing more had happened. I got really upset with him and started to cry, and he felt guilty about it. He said he would never let it get that far and he would have just stopped if she started acting weird, but to me that was not good enough. He deleted her phone number and ripped off her phone number from the phone book as well. I let him pass that time because nothing happened. I had access to his facebook because he used my computer. Since he got rid of her number, he had been actively seeking her facebook account. I wanted to confront him but I felt I was wrong for looking at his facebook history. Now we are doing long distance relationship because of our job, he is looking for her facebook account everyday, 10-20 times a day. I am really concerned that he is going to sext with her again. I want to trust him and his words but I can't shake that fear. Please give me some advices on this matter. Thank you very much."
7ungmg,1,2018-02-01,My (23F) boyfriend (23M) wants to cut off his dad (60?M).,wesfortrees,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7ungmg/my_23f_boyfriend_23m_wants_to_cut_off_his_dad_60m/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for the past 5 years. We get along very well (besides the average argument here or there) and are very open, honest, and respectful of each other. However, there is one issue with our relationship; his dad.
When I first started dating my bf, his dad was not in his life. His dad has major depression, and deserted his wife (my bf’s mom), my bf, and his younger brother for 5 years. And by deserted, I mean rented out different hotel rooms around town and never contacted any member of his immediate family. About 2 years ago he reentered my bf’s life, to which my bf was very forgiving and open-armed to. I was initially fine with this. My mom had also had mental health issues and abandoned me with my dad, so I knew how much that hurt and how much my bf wanted a dad. So, even though we had relatively no relationship with him, we started the process or trying to reconnect, my boyfriend as his son and myself as his DIL.
This is when the situation went sour. It started with him offering my bf money (the dad comes from a very wealthy family), which was fine. But then we started noticing he would use this to bribe my bf and hold it over his head, ex. Paying for his semester of school for him (my bf) having dinner with him 3 nights a week. Now at this point, I had not met him yet. I just figured, “Well he’s paying for your stuff, he just wants to be able to interact with you”, which I thought was relatively fair.
He then started interacting with us on a much closer level, by inviting us to dinners and outdoor music events around town. These get-togethers were usually very uncomfortable because 1) he never asked me about myself, 2) he would frequently comment on the size of my breasts, 3) criticizing my boyfriend and calling him a woman (his reasoning was that my bf thinks about what other people say), and 4) just being very rude and obnoxious. I realized I really didn’t like this guy. I tried to distance myself.
He then began entering our house (which we shared with close friends), even when my bf wasn’t there. It was uncomfortable for not only me, but our roommates as well. My bf was really annoyed by this.
The dad had moved back into the house that my bf’s mom lived at (he had all the financial resources in the marriage, so it was his house). The mom had moved on during his absence, and had a boyfriend (even though they weren’t divorced). They didn’t interact with each other, and when they did, huge arguments broke out and frequently he physically attacked her. He had spent multiple nights in jail for assaulting her. I have a very good relationship with my bf’s mom, so we would always go visit her.
On one of these visits, I took a shower because we spent the night for dinner. When I exited the bathroom in my towel, his dad was outside the door and stared at me while he took off his robe and stood in nothing but his underwear. I ran down to the room my boyfriend and I were staying in and told him. My boyfriend sighed in disgust and just replied “What is wrong with him?”
My boyfriend then told me his dad has been trying to talk him out of being with me because I come from a poor family and I am not a doctor or lawyer (I am a graphic designer). All his behavior, plus him not accepting me, was the final straw. I told my bf I wanted nothing to do with him, and that my boyfriend does not deserve to have this deserting, horrible man try to play “dad” to him. My boyfriend agreed, and promised that he would always put me above his dad. But he said he wanted to keep trying to do as his dad wanted until he was done with school, so that he continues paying for it. I understood, but I tried to reason that my dad could never afford my schooling, but he has always been the best dad to me and I stand by him because of that, not because of his money. But every time my bf tries to stand up to his dad, the dad just retorts by explaining that he knows he’s a shitty person and that me and my boyfriend need to deal with it because it’s easier for younger people to change. 
And finally, my boyfriend got an internship in San Francisco. I, of course, cannot afford housing in the Bay Area. My bf’s dad offered to pay for housing, if he lives with him. The internship is for 6 months and we will be 4 hours apart. My boyfriend accepted because of the opportunity and there is no other way he would be able to take it otherwise. But, I am so worried. My bf said after the internship, he was going to cut his dad off, marry me, and be financially independent. But I’m morally conflicted because is it my place to come between a father and son? Is my bf doing the right thing? Is there a better strategy then cutting him off? 

TL;DR: My boyfriend’s dad has him bound by money. He is abusive to my bf and me. My bf wants to cut him off after an internship (where he is staying with his dad because he can’t afford it himself) because he doesn’t like how the dad treats me. Am I coming in between a father and son and is there a better strategy than cutting him off?

The problem is I can't find a job now. I've tried going the freelance route with music and sound effects for video games but the opportunities are far too sparse. I have been unemployed for about 13 months now and now I'm stuck in a deep depression. I'm still living with my parents at 23 and the only work history I have is working at Kroger for about 6 months. There are music studios around the area that have unpaid internships but they involve cleaning the place without the promise of a job. Not something I can do right now. I'm currently thankfully not in debt and I have 10k in savings. I'm thinking about going back to school for computer science to combine both degrees and pursue audio programming in video games. It seems stable and in demand currently. The thing is I don't if it would be worth going back for. I lack a social life as well so I definitely think it would help with that. I just don't know if the investment would be worth it. I would rather not dip into my 10k in savings but I will if necessary. My parents are only willing to help with housing, I would have to pay tuition on my own. I don't know how I'm going to accomplish this on a musician's salary.  "

Given my history with characters I believe I didnt go too crazy with creation,but making a rando roll power fit into the wormverse was a little fun.)


**Alice/Spectral** 


**Age:** 9


**Physical appearance:** Small slip of a young girl dressed in a dirty and frayed pink hoodie, jeans and old tennis shoes. Her features are that of a plain faced preteen with her long straight jet-black hair and green eyes. Due to poor nutrition shes a bit small for her age, her frame thin with the barest hints of muscles from moving or running away frequently. Given she does not get much time for grooming, her hair is long and greasy, often seen pooling out the front of her hoodie and obscuring her face. If she remembers she uses a white bandana or scarf to obsuce her face. Generally seen holding one of the ragdolls that she keeps tied to her belt or backpack.


**Mentality:** With what she has been through she has been made to grow up quickly.  Due to her mental traumas, Alice tends fall back on a child-like facade as a defense mechanism. Barring acting a little childish at times when one gets to know her, they might see glimpse of a girl that is actually extremely mature.   Given she is generally seen conversing with invisible people she is often seen as a little crazy and creepy. The creep factor tends ratchet up to 11 when she starts talking about things she should not know or when he voice changes to accommodate one of her ""ghosts"" possessing her. She tends to fall back on her child-like behaviors to try to cover up her weird actions. Through it all, she has a kind heart and hates the fact that she has to steal to get by. Going past the creepiness, she is just a scared little girl that has learned to be distrusting of adults. This distrust is warranted through the countless times that she has been lied to by adults; be they self-righteous heroes or sweet tongued villains. She is not proud of it but she has hurt people to protect herself. Ultimately, at the point she comes to Ashton she has gone through a lot, with fatigue setting in and the craving for human ties growing she is in a vulnerable state. She has the capacity to be either a hero or villain based on how things play out.


**Backstory:** Alice lived in the poorer side of town, her father was often absent, either working at the office or drunk at a bar. While away, her mother would bring in various men for ""fun"". Given her mother never was the motherly type, Alice quickly learned to take care of herself. They both tended to avoid her father due to the physical and mental abuse he would give out when he was home.


This was her life until one fateful day after stealing from her mom's wallet so that she could go to the corner store to pick up some groceries.  It was during this incident that she had the misfortune to catch the eye of a certain individual.  All she remembers is having a conversation with a kindly man in line then having a pair of strong hands grabbing her. This was followed by a sickly sweet smell and blackness.


When she awoke, she was in a small room with a tinted window taking up one wall. Through the window, she saw what seemed like her home with The walls  covered floor to ceiling with pictures of her. She watched as her parents fought in the other room. 


A screen turned on showing the man she spoke to before, this time wearing a mask. He introduced himself the villain known as the Mortician. Her Parents are given a chance to tell a damaging truth about themselves then end their lives or pull a lever to kill their daughter.  A recorded video displays on the screen of her sleeping with a knife to her throat.  They unfortunately pull the lever. A door opens and the Mortician walks in scalpels in hand.


 Alice watches as he kills them slowly in the most gruesome way imaginable. As they lay flayed and disemboweled the two-way mirror falls away.  Mortician beckons her forward, which she followed in horror. The Mortician spoke to her in a friendly manner while cleaning his blade, her mother mewling on the floor, reaching for her with her final breath.  Alice completely broke.  She trigger with her mother death, her bloody fayed fingers grasping onto her ankle.


The Mortician experienced Trigger shock but continued to try to speak with Alice even as the Ghost of her mother manifested behind him.  He was so distracted that he did not even notice one of his discarded scalpel rise up from the ground..  


Alice watched as her mother stabbed the man in the back 67 times. By the end of the ordeal she was covered in the man's blood. Alice ran away and has never stopped running. Ever since then, she has been living on the streets and when too much attention, she moves to the next town. It is thanks to the ghosts that she has been able to make it this long. While on the road she has collected ghosts to make up a small surrogate family to help her out.For those few ghosts that she feels a connection to she creates a doll and takes it allow her journey. 





While she has attempted to remain below the radar there has been enough incidents of her using her powers that she is a partially known cape(even though her powers are not categorized correctly).Each time she has narrowly escaped disaster due to her ghosts help.   The worst incident occurred when she had been staying with a group of street kids. Their little group got taken by a kindly old woman hosting a safe haven in an abandoned subway tunnel. She was able to provide safety, a clean bed and warm food to all of them. She had thought she had found a home, but that was not to last. She quickly ingratiated herself to her new family, doing chores and odd jobs, never once questioning why she was so ready to do so. She even ignored the pleas of her ghost when she revealed her parahuman abilities. Things changed from that point on as the more sinister aspects of the Mater Motts family became known. She happily committed crimes of theft on her of her new master of a mother. If not for a moment of weakness that allowed one of her ghost to possess her, she would have continued down this villainous path. 

It took a little while after her stint as a villain but it did not take too long before her wishes for living connections drew her to making more bad decisions. She met a solo hero in a small burg of a city. Her time mentoring under the boy scout acted to soften some of her indiscretions while helped her learn how to properly utilize her powers. She worked under him for several months before things turned sour. It was thanks to one of her ghosts spying on him that she found out his pedophilic intentions for housing and training her.   Her ghosts had unlatched her window and carried her down to the ground within the hour. The pervert didn't know she had left until she had long left city limits.

Historically she craves human contact but always finds herself falling back to her ghosts. Those that she deigns to keep close, Act as her family, guides and teachers. Unfortunately for her the Mortician is one of the few ghosts she unintentionally collected. While she has much better influences he tends to be in the background to whisper in her ear. He tends to act nice but his true motives are unknown. As it appears, you can't always run from your problems. 

**Resources:** she is currently homeless, besides the clothes on her back, and a backpack she stole to carry stuff she find, she doesn't have much. She keeps a thin blanket, a sewing kit and what food she can carry inside it. She tends to steal only enough to get by.


**Alignment:** Non-Aligned, but open to change based on her opening act. Given she lives on the street she is more than willing to steal to survive.


 **Equipment/Weaponry: **  Has a knife that she has been keeping for protection. 8 Rag Dolls, 


**Specializations: ** When she actually has the materials she likes to draw and paint. Due to poor parenting she knows how to cook, clean and sew. All other skills she tends to simply glean and take council from her ghosts.


**Versatility:**:  She is a pretty creative little girl even though her powers are not always under her full control. 


**Power:** Thinker Master Phantom


Alice's ability allows her to see and control ""ghosts"".  Ghosts are a relative term for what Alice actual sees. She has temporal sight attuned to locations and objects linked to a deceased individual. She sees silent looped snippets of film of  deceased individuals carrying out actions as if they were still alive. The act of her touching ghosts allows her to empower it to be able to speak and interact with the world to a degree. From her powers perspective she creates a body composed of invisible force to house a copy of the mind of an individual a few moments before they died. Any ghost she manifests has a positive attitude towards Alice, but does not generally have to follow her orders. It is because of this reason that she prefers to use ghosts she has developed a bond with over random spirits she finds everywhere she goes.


Any Ghosts she manifests are unseen by anyone that does not have an ability attuned to sense force fields. They can be detected by the minor electronic disturbance they create when they get too close to sensitive electronic equipment.  Ghost have selective etherealness, While they generally pass through living things they can interact and touch nonliving things.  By focusing they can shift topass through nonliving material or briefly interact with living material(Any force directly done to a living subject is instantly minimized, but a weapon would be treated normally. A ghost can not punch someone but it can briefly lift Alice off ground). When a ghosts shifts to pass nonliving things, ghost gives up any ability to interact with the world. Ghosts have a pseudo ability of flight and would be better described as slow floating at a walking speed. Ghosts maintain a durability of a natural human protected in body armor. If enough force is applied to kill a ghost it will discorporate and reform near its focus after 5 minute. In this sense small piercing objects will often pass through with minimal discomfort but a car or a weapon empowered by superhuman force can take them out easily(Given things simply pass through them, they dont act well as sheilds).   Strength of a ghost is on par with the strength the spirit had in life. It takes 30 seconds to manifest a ghost she is familar with and 1 for an unfamilar ghosts. Unfamilar ghosts take 30 minutes to reform. She can maintain any one ghost for 5 hours taking 2.5 hours of recharge time once that time has elapsed. 


The strength of her ghosts is determined by the number she has manifested. Strength and weaknesses noted above are example of when only one or two ghosts are manifested. As more are manifested strength is severly diminished as the ghosts substance is spread among many targets.  With more ghosts, going ethereal becomes more easier , but they loose coordination to effect the world, they may sustain more damage before disincorporating.(Think of it in terms of a ballistics gel density with each new ghost causing the material to be less dense.)  By 7 manifested ghosts each one has the strength and consistency of a mild breeze. At the max of 15 each ghost has no substance. Manifested ghosts have a range of 100 yards from Alice with their physical strengths quickly diminishing at 50 yard mark.


If a ghost passes through Alice(or Alices touches it) The ghost can possess her. Normally she must give her consent to be possessed but consent is waived in moments of emotional weakness or distress. It is because of this that Alice acts the way she does given a ghost could take over if she is not careful. When she makes the choice they become an amalgimation of two minds, while if one takes over during a time of distress she tends to take a backseat. Her Ghosts tend to develop a fondness for Alice, they will never go too far away from her wishes but given some might have different mindsets the means they go about completing the task may differ.


Generally a ghost is limited in manifesting in the location of death, around its body, or an item important to it in life. If Alice keeps an object linked to the death site or that of the person in question she maintains the ability to manifest that specific ghost as if she were at that location. She normally keeps theses totem objects in handmade dolls she makes. Creating new totems above some noted below requires an equipment post. (For the most part this allows her to keep a number of ghosts in reserve and keep he generally at a known quantity leaving random ghosts as non special or mod approved plot devices.)  

People do not believe she is a master given people do not see or hear her ghost minions, because of this when she starts talking about her imaginary friends people just think it's her coping with her semi-uncontrolled powers.  She has been mislabeled as minor Shaker with Thinker capabilities.



Name|Description
-------|-------
Amos|Amos was a Homeless Drifter that was caught unguarded in his sleep when a group of stupid kids beat him to death. Amos has a lot of experience living on the streets. In his youth he had made his money as a thief,a grifter and a gambler. As a excon legitimate work never really came. Amos appears to Alice as a Wily old man in tattered and worn clothes. Given she uses his advice to keep safe and avoid people she values him greatly.  In a fight he is a more of a scrapper or brawler.
Desmond King/Mortician| Psychopathic supervillain and former psychiatrist that  suffered from severe blood loss from being stabbed in the back by a ghost. Desmond was a cerebral mastermind type of supervillain that reveled in breaking down people even though his powers were physical based.  He was well known in his time, knowing full well how the great game of heroes and villains works. Skilled with knives and hand-to-hand combat.  Had an obsession with anatomy and psychology which he used in his former life.  To a lesser degree, he liked studying Chemistry and engineering which he often used in setting up deathtraps to play his games in. Alice herself has been marked as one of his death sites allowing him to manifest without a doll.  He oddly has a protective fondness for Alice, hurting anyone that would threaten her. Given she is not able to get away from him she has undergone Stockholm syndrome to a degree. She unconsciously sees him as a father figure but would never admit it.
Sigmund Green| Death by choking on a fatty piece of steak.  Sig was a CPA to the public and a number of government offices.    In his down time he was a man that enjoyed the arts, a good book, historical documentaries, good food and fine wine. Sig was a cowardly type generally trying to avoid conflic. He is a clutz, lacks social skills and could not fight his way out of a wet paper bag. Given she is only 9, an accountant is not very useful to her day to day life but Alice for some odd reason likes him enough to keep him around..
Fujiwara Kenji| Meeting his end crushed under a bookcase this immigrant spent most of his life behind a computer monitor. He specialized in computers, security systems and surveillance devices.  He made his wages as a security consultant for companies and government agencies by being paid to break into their systems and then improving on them. Later in life he began growing more and more paranoid seeing enemies around every corner (mild undiagnosed mental disorder).  Alice being a young girl on the streets doesn't understand his skills but she makes use of his paranoia to help her stay off child services radar. She made a doll for him after he ""withdrew"" funds from an atm.
James Bryant|James was a young boy around her age that died from a terminal illness. She created a doll for him after realizing that she was feeling lonely and wanted someone to talk to around her age. He knows a lot a games to play . He is actually a pretty upbeat individual given his circumstances.
Cheryl Morgan| Cheryl was strangled to death while on the Job. Her job happens to be a high priced ""escort"" something she tends to gloss over when speaking to Alice. Alice just sees the stylish dress and grownup way she acts and sees someone that stepped out of one of those fasion magazines. She see her as an older sister to ask advice from.  
Detective Lacy Stein |Former PRT officer that transfered to the police force.   She was unfortunatly killed when an investigation brought her to the apartment of a supervillian. She was too smart for her own good and picked up on clues  that outed the villian. She was killed for the secret.   She know PRT and police codes and conducts like the back of her hand.  She is good at deductive logic and investigation basics. She is pretty good with a hand gun.She is straight laced(pardon the pun) and always trying to be Alices's good concious.  
KIKI| KIKI was an academic and a scholar or in other words a bum of a career college student enrolled in the law program. She has the collective credit hour for 5 undergraduate degrees, 7 minors and was finally working on a masters when she died. Ironic that she would be struck by a car because she was trying to study more while walking. Things had been looking up before that, she finally found a track that fit her, she got an internship in a lawfirm while she worked on getting through law school.  She has a lot of book smarts, but is not really good in a fight.Alice sees her in a similar way to Cheryl as an older sister to look up to, just in a slightly different way. While Cheryl oozed femininity Kiki is an adult who is geeky, cool and smart.
Franci |Franci was a ER doctor she met when she stumbled into a hospital parking lot with a high fever. She had manifested Franci while half delerious.  Franci helped her by stealing some meds and nursing her back to health. Franci is the overly caring type, to the point that she was killed by a druggie that she was trying to help. Alice views her as a surogate mother in some ways.

7uocfd,3,2018-02-01,Looking for feedback on my ESPN Summer Production internship cover letter!,kbarry015,CoverLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverLetters/comments/7uocfd/looking_for_feedback_on_my_espn_summer_production/,"Dear Hiring Manager:

Whenever I am asked about my major, I always say “I’m a computer science major, but my goal is to work in ESPN’s Production Department.” With over six years of production experience, as well as a love for sports and many leadership roles, I am applying for the Production Summer Internship with ESPN. The skills I have developed as the Sports Director at the UConn Student Television Station (UCTV) and on the video production team for UConn Athletics align well with the qualifications you are seeking, and I believe I would make an exceptional team member at ESPN.

After demonstrating professional production skills as a freshman at UCTV, I earned the spot of Assistant Director. As a sophomore, I continued to expand my knowledge, while demonstrating excellent leadership abilities, which led to me being selected as Sports Director by the Board of Directors. Now, I lead a department of over thirty members, conduct camera and editing training, and ensure we bring the best content possible to our thousands of viewers across a multitude of social media platforms, including YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. In addition, I am the producer and director for our flagship program, which airs live on YouTube and TVs across campus. Finally, I continue to film games, practices and other events, and edit packages and highlights for shows.

As a sophomore, I wanted to continue to learn from my peers and industry professionals and was hired to the Video Production team for UConn Athletics. There, I produce a multitude of different videos, including game highlights, interviews, and promotional videos. I also log footage to our servers, and film and live-stream press conferences, games and interviews. 

I believe after years of working with sports video production that I would be an asset to the ESPN production team. I can create a storyline, select top plays and other videos to fit that storyline and edit them into a final product that tells a complete story in minutes. After speaking with UConn alumni and other individuals who work at ESPN and have done the productions internship, I feel as though the skills I have developed in working my way up through UCTV and at UConn Athletics would translate to success if hired for this position.

I appreciate you taking the time to read and consider my application. I look forward to speaking with you and your team soon. If you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to contact me via the information above. 


Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read and give feedback, I truly appreciate it."

I am a Computer Science freshman from India. I have been selected for an internship program at NTU. The link is: http://www.corporategurukul.com/for-universities/.

It is a 3 week program in the month of June. We will be working on Big data and be working on complex big data and machine learning problems. We will be graded daily for the complete time period and the people getting the top grades(A,A+ , O) will get LOR from NUS professors and (A+ and O) will get an invitation for a masters program in NUS. However, the program is quite costly and everything is paid by us. It will be 2 lac indian rupees or 2800 Singaporean dollars. Can anyone give the feedback for the program? What should I do according to you? Also,only top performers ( above A) will avail benefits from the program and the competition will be cut-throat."

7upluw,1,2018-02-02,Paying for HRT in Alabama via BCBC *while remaining closeted to parents*? (also venting/storytime),trains_memes,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7upluw/paying_for_hrt_in_alabama_via_bcbc_while/,"(Long post, wow, scrolling over it now; if you want the tl;dr just read the last 5 or 6 paragraphs)

So I'm currently a student(undergraduate) in Alabama.

I'm not living IN my parents' household currently, but I am definitely extremely dependent on them and interact regularly.

""Dependent"" being:

 * They pay for usually about half my school cost
 * They buy me assorted groceries and provide me with several meals a week
 * They own the title on the car I use, and pay its insurance
 * **They also pay my health insurance**

This insurance is Blue Cross Blue Shield. I have zero idea what plan they have, or anything else; the parents directly get all the paperwork; I don't even get statements or anything like that.

At one point they said that I should probably take Dad's health insurance card (they gave me a spare dental one) for when I'm driving, just so I can have the account number or something; but I don't have that anymore. So if I were to call up BCBC, I don't know what I would even have to tell them to get what I need.

I had been self-medding since late June(2017) for 3 months, until I screwed up and they caught a glimpse of my budding boiboobs, at which point cat was out of the bag and they made me do a 3-month ""detox"" so I can get ""clean"" bloodwork (more on this later) with the doctor, who's now trying to get me diagnosed with ADD and depression/anxiety. (Both of which my family had vaguely suspected I had for years, the depression/anxiety moreso since adolescence, but mysteriously were nonissues during that brief period.)

They also have been pushing me to pursue conversion therapy; more on that later, too.

Anyway, I moved out in late January, back on self-medding although I am out of estradiol so I've just been making do with just the blocker (which I'm not out of, but supply is sadly dwindling) and some pueraria mirifica (ghetto but itwerks as a stop-gap, and, furthermore fully legal to order); but the catch is due to fate being interesting that my roommate is a close friend of both mine and the family.

They (the family) know I haven't given up on ""pursuing this trans thing"", and they have told me explicitly that I'll be in very hot water indeed if I have any self-medding stuff shipped to either our house or to the place I'm with my roommate, and due to various other cascading and compounding reasons all the miracles I would be able to rely on for receiving packages are not an option. The self-medding is basically no longer viable.

So fine.

I'm needing bloodwork ASAP anyway (since I don't want to fuck my liver, kidneys, or ability to have kids), so I figure now's a good a time as any to pursue The Official Route.

But this shit is playing out like a Legend of Zelda quest:

 * Step 0 is to even FIND this list of steps, which I was only able to get consolidated into one place by essentially a miracle
 * you have to find a counselor (miracle of miracles that this school has a trans-friendly licensed counselor on-premises, counseling services included in tuition, fully confidential, etc. So finances aren't a blocking issue; at least not yet.)
 * then you have to GET the appointments scheduled (these counselors are eternally booked so the waitlist situation can be horrendous if you're unlucky)
 * then you have to make it through god-knows-how-many months of gatekeeping to get The Letter
 * then you have to find a doctor (and find a way to *pay for* the appointments) to convert The Letter into A Prescription (let's pray the doctor is competent and the prescription is for reasonable dosages of everything)
 * then you have to find a way to pay for both the HRT itself AND the regular bloodwork

Now, from what I've read, Blue Cross Blue Shield does cover this. HRT and associated bloodwork (after appropriate gatekeeping: they, too, require a letter; presumably even in states where Informed Consent exists) are covered 100%.

But here's the thing

During my brief talks with the parents on this topic, one of the things they complained about is ""how are you going to pay for this; we're certainly not"" (they also made intimations to the effect of ""if you've got money to burn for this frivolity, I guess you've got everything in life figured out and no longer need a subsidy for school."")

it turns out, when they brought me in to get my T levels and thyroid performance checked (they thought my problems might have been Low T, or some kind of Bad Humours in the Thyroid—since *obviously* both of those are leading causes of gender dysphoria), since this was completely unnecessary, the insurance didn't pay for very much of it.

Now, that makes me worry. I don't know WHAT all the details of my insurance plan are; whether there's copays to consider, how much they're going to generally bring my treatment to the parents' attention. Right now, we've just not made eye contact very much on the issue, but I...haven't been as explicit as I could have been about the fact that I'm not ready for conversion therapy at this point in time. (I'm not entirely ""leading them on""; I *do* intend to give it a try—once I'm safely off Testosterone, *with medical supervision*. Right now I just feel too cornered.)

Ideally, I would just call BCBC up, invoke some patient privacy protection laws or whatever (I'm 19 currently, turning 20 in 2018Q3), and they would from that point be legally obligated not to take any action that might reveal my condition or treatment regime to my parents: No ""statement of services utilized"" (idk if this actually exists), I want to be billed rather than them if a charge slips through the cracks or something, etc.

But I don't know how well that's going to work out *in reality* when the parents **pay the bill** and I've literally never interacted with the insurance company even once. They probably don't even have even my email on file anywhere.

So please, please, please, does anyone have any stories or advice on remaining closeted from the primary insurance payer? Preferably Blue Cross Blue Shield, and preferably them in Alabama; but I want to hear anything, really. Even (ESPECIALLY!) if it blew up in your face.

I'm really hoping to get off self-medding and onto Scripts Proper, with medical supervision and blood work and the whole 9 yards. I've got the first of the gatekeeping appointments scheduled for next week.

But I don't want my parents to decide to get angry and cut off all financial support when/if some kind of clerical error occurs and BCBC sends them a bill for a refill appointment or something. I don't want to risk putting myself in a position to try to pay for both 100% of school AND my own sustenance, just off my internship (whose time is already very very hard to balance with schoolwork)."
7uq4az,1,2018-02-02,Me [25F] pickle in my living situation with my BFF [25F] and my boyfriend [31M] not sure who to live with also I created this problem myself,jhsbzkdfnbmvlc,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7uq4az/me_25f_pickle_in_my_living_situation_with_my_bff/,"okay, my bff and I have been friends for like...7 years. since college. she's been with me through thick and thin. she also has a bad habit of trusting shitty people and getting into abusive relationships but that is because she has the amazing talent of finding the best in people and making them feel special. even garbage people. I love her, but it's the truth. Currently she lives with an ex-girlfriend who is for sure verbally abusive and borderline physically abusive. She has no support system cause her family sucks.
  
I live 2 hours away from her with my boyfriend in a tiny (TINY) studio apartment. I finally got a job that pays well enough for me to move out after a year of being below the poverty line. I have been wanting to do this for a year. I never felt like my bf ( of 1.75 years) ever took me seriously on how much I hate this apt.before I took on this higher paying job, I had a low-paying job that wouldn't pay well enough to get a new apartment. But I wanted to shop around regardless of my income, because my job was akin to an internship and had an expiration date. I knew I'd get a better one immediately after ending it. Whereas, my boyfriend doesn't want to start even entertaining options of any possible life changes (new jobs, new apartments, new cities, etc.) unless he is sure all the pieces are in place. I like to shop my options first - #1 to keep my spirits set on a goal and #2 to understand the market when I start seriously looking to make a change. I do it with jobs, apartments, clothes, cars, everything. I'm always passively looking to inform my future decisions. This ""shopping around"" stresses him out. Which made me think he just never wanted to move. we had a talk about it, and he made it sound like he wanted to, but not in the concrete serious way I wanted. Like in the ""I hate this apartment and I'm leaving in 2 months whether you are with me or not"" way that I was feeling.
  
My BFF from college told me a month ago about her bad living situation. on a whim and out of compassion, I told her ""come to [redacted] city, live with me. I'm getting a new job. let's get an apt together. i'll get you a job. i'll get you out."" to my surprise, she said yes. I offered this because I know it's gotten bad. She has a history of bad relationships but this is the only time she has asked for help *while* it was happening. every other time she has been too proud, and I only find out months later. I know it's bad this time, if she is asking for help while it's going on.
  
I told my boyfriend, whom I live with now, I was looking for apartments with her. When I first moved in with him, we agreed it was temporary, just to get on my feet. we agreed it wouldn't affect our relationship if I moved out at any point. it lasted for a year because the job I found was a great opportunity, but was so low pay it made sense to stay in our studio. But now, with the new job, I'm looking at other places. we had talked vaguely about finding another apartment together, but because of the way he plans, it didn't feel serious with him. like, he never really cared to do it. I hate this apartment so much, I would have moved out yesterday if I had the chance.
  
Now he is hurt I made this decision to move in with my friend without asking him first - which absolutely is my fault for not communicating what I wanted or needed or what my BFF was going through or why I offered. At first he was okay, but he brought it up again, and is obviously hurt. I feel awful because it was my fault, I didn't take his promise to move out soon seriously, because we have such different styles of planning our lives. I didn't put myself in his shoes.
  
 But I also have a history of bailing on my friends for the comfort of my boyfriends. And I know my friend is seriously in trouble. She is sleeping on the couch of a coworker tonight because her exgirlfriend tried to coerce her to have sex, and then yelled at her when she didn't agree. I want to be there for her. I'm the only person who can actually help her. and who wants to. She literally doesn't even have parents to help her. It's so important to me. But I didn't do well by my boyfriend, so I fucked up both sides. Now they are both counting  on me to live with them. What do I do? My BFF is cool with living with me and my BF, but he doesn't want a roommate, understandably, he is 30 something. What do?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: proposed living with my BFF from college, didn't tell my current roommate / BF. He is hurt because we vaguely discussed moving out of our shithole apt after I got a better paying job. I did not discuss this decision with him, because I just offered my friend to move in with me without a second thought. I have a history of inconveniencing my friends for my BF's. I don't want to be that person. but I created this problem. halp"

7urpjl,6,2018-02-02,ADHD and Major Depression throughout law school and re-taking the bar exam,patriotlawyer00,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/7urpjl/adhd_and_major_depression_throughout_law_school/,"This is my 5th attempt at the UBE after finishing in 2016 and battling major depression, adhd, anxiety, ptsd all because the broken home I live in never allowed me to be truly myself off everything without being some sort of abusive to me, this has been the result of me sitting in a fire because I fought through break-ups during 1L and during my first bar sitting, two diff relationships both broke me in many ways, only companions I had during this time and it wasn't until I saw my psych recently that I even had a chance of employment.

I realize after being in insurance defense litigation twice and getting fired after two weeks twice, I'm not interested in the work and it seems to be drug induced to force the issue, otherwise I'd want to do something like law enforcement, sports (don't we all), or JD-related job in compliance. The employer told me it was nothing personal but you can see how unhappy and unproductive I was, before I go to increasing my meds and dose, I think getting to the root of the issue is more beneficial so this will be my last sitting next month.

I have full-time job interview for financial crime compliance analyst with cantor fitz. this week and hoping it goes well because I need not only a job but a full-time job and out of the legal industry. I believe the root of all my unhappiness either lies in there, or because reasons that are detrimental to my health, I can't come off all my meds to pass this thing. 

Every morning I'm tempted to raise my Effexor XR dose to one 75 mg a day VS the 37.5 mg twice a day (even though same dose, they affect me differently). On the one 75 mg per day, I'm much more lethargic and don't care as much but can't depend on higher doses of meds to live a life unless this continues then I'll have no choice but my broken home and single parent support is completely gone so I have to be as present as possible to get on my feet right now. I am taking an Executive MBA program, one class at a time (I know sounds worthless) just because any federal aid can help my financial situation until I'm stable with a job and then maybe can stop pursuing it. 

Hoping to land this job or another different job soon, trying to get myself to study is the hardest part right now, fighting for something that took everything that made me happy from me because I thought fighting through all these conditions and suffering would have been the best way to go, when in fact, I'm not too sure but this window between graduation in 2016 and re-taking the bar every few months has been the hardest time of my life. I did manage to hold two pretty big internships over my law school summers, but maybe I'm just not cut out for this. police or fire dpt is always there if nothing pans out soon I guess. Thanks for listening never been more depressed and lonely..

7urquj,1,2018-02-02,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7urquj/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Hey everyone. Longtime lurker here. I've been thinking a lot and the events in my life finally led me to this point where I needed to vent and ask for some advice in this sub. It's a long story so sorry for the bad English (i'm a native Portuguese speaker, so...).

I'm a 21F born in a city of medium proportions in Brazil, now living in São Paulo. Last year, I've moved in for trying to graduate and make things straight in my life. But I had to live again with my nMom, who has been physically abusive in my childhood and really, really violent with words for as long as I can remember. 

I've been living with my dad and grandma, and in NC with nmom since mid 2015, dropped out of college and found myself so desperate and worried that I'd never get a decent career to the point of forgetting everything she has done to me.

Didn't make many friends, but now I have an internship at somewhere I love to work, my sweet and supporting boyfriend [24M] and his amazing parents by my side. They're like my family now. 

In this meantime 
- I've been physically and emotionally hurt;
- had personal objects broken (which I had to pay for fixing!!);
- Spent my last savings by buying plane tickets (under her threats and attacks) for my little and neglected brother so he would fill her narcissistic demands and then go back home;
- Had my little brother leaving São Paulo mad at me for things she said to him about me;
- Missed day jobs because she was depressed and needed someone to take care;
- Went into college debt because I needed to pay part of the house debts while she was buying skincare stuff and clothes;
And so it goes...

This month, it has been 1 year since I moved in. This has been one of the darkest weeks where I couldn't even sleep properly, afraid she would fight or hit me. Now I have plans for leaving nmom's home THIS WEEK! My boyfriend is really an angel, and so are his parents. They're really insiting to help me get me back on my feet:

- He has some savings and good understanding on investments, so offered help with ALL my college debt and late fees. Seriously, it's a lot of money. Something about $1.200. He's also willing to help with saving and investing advice since nMom has made me lose me lots of money by borrowing her.

- He has a free bedroom at his place (which is big and he shares with parents), and is gonna shelter me in his house. We have made some privacy agreements just to make sure it wouldn't be uncomfortable, embarassing or invasive. I'm afraid I might ruin our relationship, but I need to give it a shot at my peace of mind.

The questions are: 

- I want to go NC again. And I wanna write her a letter, but I don't know how to do it without being FLEA or unfair and I don't want to go crazy. Any tips on this?

- I want to make sure she won't attempt against her own life. Guilt is haunting me 24/7 and I wouldn't forgive myself it that happened."
7urys2,3,2018-02-02,How much affects a drug test?,TheGreatLakeLUC,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/7urys2/how_much_affects_a_drug_test/,"Hello Reddit!!

I am beginning to take a break from smoking, because there are internships I have the chance to have, that will drug test me in May. If I fail, I will be ruined. 

As some background info, I have found weed to be a true medicine and cure for hangovers for me. So as I ask this question, realize smoking is not that big of a priority for me, just when I’m hungover and have to do things that day, it’s easier if I get high.

So my question is how much weed actually affects a drug test. I’ve never been tested before, but I have smoked a lot recently. I’m going to give myself a little over 3 months before my test to stop smoking to be safe, but if I take like 2 or three hits once a month, will that show up on my test? I don’t know how accurate drug tests are, and I don’t know if it would be a piss or hair test. Hope someone have more knowledge on this than I. I appreciate any help you can give!

7us5um,3,2018-02-02,"I have 3 years to go, and I don’t know how to cope with it.",false_utopias,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7us5um/i_have_3_years_to_go_and_i_dont_know_how_to_cope/,"Hey again, guys. 

I usually prefer to just read about other people’s experiences on here, rather than write about my own. For some reason, listening to everyone’s stories, how strong they are to go through them, has always made me feel better. But then, things have been going south in false_utopia—ville, and I just needed somewhere to pour everything out. Maybe ask for advice along the way? 

So...

Back in October, Sperm donor threw a narcfit, as I like to call them. Came home screaming, yelling, slamming doors, threatening physical abuse over absolutely nothing (Because I had worn something he didn’t approve of, even though he’d NEVER mentioned he didn’t approve of it before, and I’d worn it in front of him multiple times in the past. And because my brother broke the sacred: you’re not allowed to leave the house for anything but Uni. Kid is 18 and just wanted to see his friends...). Anyway, I had a major anxiety attack, and ended up calling 911. Spermdonor freaks the fuck out, and goes full ‘supportive dad mode’ to avoid the paramedics arriving and finding me having a melt down and blaming it on him. After I’ve calmed down, and after he’s managed to dismiss the ambulance, he throws another fit. Except, this time, he says he wants nothing to do with this family anymore. Because how DARE his kids break down under the immense amounts of pressure and psychological abuse he’s putting them under? For shame! 

My response was: lol, k. I stopped talking to him. Haven’t spoken a word to him since October, and can’t find it in me to speak another word to him until I move out. Except he’s furious that I didn’t go back groveling, the way he expected me to. My brother doesn’t give two shits either, though he’s talking to sperm donor to try and keep the peace. That isn’t enough, since **I** still have the gall to be upset. So now he’s taking his shit out on my mom, more and more by the day, in hopes it’ll somehow drive me to do what he wants. 

It’s burning me from the inside out, seeing my mom go through this shit. She ISN’T an enabler. She’s as trapped here as my brother and I are. Explaining her situation would need a post all on its own, but the jist of it is that he isolated her financially for years, managed to take all the money she’d saved over the years she spent working, and put her in a situation where she’s completely dependent on him. Same as he’s done with me (not allowing me to get a job til I finish Uni, and god knows what shit he’ll try to pull when that day comes). I think I mentioned in an old post I made on here once that my biggest problem is financial security. My Nsperm donor doesn’t allow me to leave the house for anything but Uni, and the very rare family outing. 

I have no idea how to deal with all this shit. Things at Uni are difficult enough as it is, without having to deal with a fucked up family life too. I know I just need to give it this final push. My final year medical school exams are in three months. After that, I have to do an unpaid internship for a year. Then I was thinking of working as a GP for two years, while staying with my parents, because those are the two years it’ll take for my brother to graduate (I don’t want to rock the boat while the poor guy is still studying and rob him of his opportunity of an education he deserves). We’ve been living with this turd for the past 23 years. 3 more aren’t a big deal. But I just can’t find it in me to go on, sometimes. Besides the anxiety that’s taking my life apart one day at a time, I’m starting to find it difficult to just function. I’m always terrified life is going to fall apart. I’m always thinking “What’s the use of pushing past one more day, if it’s all going to snap in the end, anyway?”. I’m not talking about anything drastic, in case anyone’s thinking I’m hinting at that. Not at all. I’m just talking about things like not wanting to get out of bed, not really wanting to talk to people, or not bothering to study anymore.

The only advice I seem to get from people, for very understandable reasons, is: move out. I’m definitely planning to move out. I just need to get through those 3 years. Or at least one more year, so I can finish my internship and get my medical license, without which my medical degree is useless. I’m planning to secretly work as a tutor on the side, during the unpaid internship year. Our internship hours are long, so I have room to lie to Spermdonor about why I’m home late (aka, go do tutoring work and just lie and say I was held back at the hospital). That way, I can hopefully save enough money to move out if things get too bad. 

It’s just this one year that I’m trying to get through. "
7us6o7,27,2018-02-02,My family is making me feel awful about making my own decisions.,amicrazyorismyfamily,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7us6o7/my_family_is_making_me_feel_awful_about_making_my/,"I made a big mistake. I wanted to go to graduate school and I was applying last year. In March of 2017 my grandmother passed away and my mom and I went to visit her when she was in hospice. When I was down there, my mom and grandfather kept suggesting to me to apply to the local school here, and eventually I relented and got accepted. It ended up being the only school I got accepted to. When I told them I was going to attend the local school, my grandfather made me an offer to give me this crappy house he's owned but it'd been vacant since 2001 when my aunt moved in with her husband and abandoned it and all of her crap that she left in it. He'd also offered to pay my tuition. As a broke recent grad struggling to get her career off the ground, I accepted.

My SO and I made the move to be near the school in June. It immediately became apparent that this offer had many strings attached. Apparently my grandfather spent ~30k fixing up the house so it didn't look like a drug den (I later found out from talking to the neighbors that this house WAS a drug den, that people would break in because they knew it was vacant and there was all kinds of drug residue and paraphernalia that my family cleaned up before I got here). Even with all the fixes this house is very decrepit, the electrical system needs to be updated and it keeps surging and practically killing my computer. My grandfather made my SO finish the repairs that they started but didn't finish, as ""payment"" for being able to come with me, and they were no small tasks. And they complained that he didn't have a job on day one, but how the heck was he supposed to get a job if he's spending almost every waking hour on the crap they left for him to do? 

My grandfather continuously shows up unannounced. I work from home, and he takes that as an invitation to come over because I'm physically at the house. I have to stop what I'm doing and give him my full attention, taking me away from my job and causing conflict with my boss. He comes over and tells me the same stories about his life, where he was at my age, and his plans for my life (as if I want to do what he wants me to do). I've developed anxiety and my heart starts racing if I hear the doorbell ring. I've installed cameras so I can see if he's here when I'm not, if I don't open the door he walks around the house and looks into every window, or lets himself in and goes through my stuff. 

He's threatened me multiple times about kicking my SO out because he's not the way he thinks he should be (one of these threats came because there was a small smudge of dirt on the kitchen floor that hadn't been cleaned up immediately). Threatened to forcibly move me into his house to ""keep an eye on me"" and ""so I can focus on school without any distractions"". I've been living without my parents since I was 19 and I'm 23 now, and I'm deeply disturbed at the idea of someone trying to force me to live in their house. I'm terrified.

In October I got it in my head that I want out of this house. The deal was that he was going to sign the house over to me, but then when we got here it became ""oh you can live there while you're going to school but I'm signing it over to your aunt"". And he's not paying my tuition as agreed, I would not have accepted the offer if I'd known that was the case. But I'm happy at the school now and I want to stay, it's much more affordable to live here than where I came from so my quality of life overall is much better. That, and I got myself an internship in LA for the summer so I need to make sure my family doesn't terrorize my SO while I'm across the country. So my SO and I bought a house, it's a bit of a fixer upper and we're in the process of getting the big stuff done before we move in. 

I told my mom about the house, and my aunt snooped on me and found out I bought the house (she apparently googles my name and tries to snoop on anything publicly available online). They're both mad at me for not talking to them about it, but if I did they'd go to my grandfather and my ass would've been on the doorstep in a day. I feel like they all think that I am a child and I need their approval because they are related to me. I wasn't raised in a way that made me value blood relations to anyone. I'm very uncomfortable with this ""family"" idea they're trying to enforce on me. I can't fathom why I should be subjected to all of this crap just because we're blood. I managed to convince them not to tell my grandfather about the house yet because it's not ready, but today we're going out for his birthday and I suspect they're going to force me to tell him. 

I'm miserable and scared and they're making me feel like I'm crazy for standing against my family. But I can't just sit back and take being treated badly. Am I wrong to want to get out on my own, away from their money and strings and all that? I'm the only grandchild, niece, and child on my mother's side of the family, so I don't have anyone else in my position to confide in."

Really starting to hit me and make me depressed,Such_a_pessimist,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7us6w2/have_zero_irl_friends_really_starting_to_hit_me/,"I’m 19 years old in college and have no IRL friends. I have a decent amount of “online” friends that I have a great time playing games with and shit. But staying home all day can get depressing real quick. In the beginning of high school I had a decent amount of friends, but sophomore year I got in a relationship and distanced myself from my friends (just naturally cause I’d want to spend all my time with my gf). I was fine with it though I was genuinely happy though. 

My girlfriend broke up with me in October and is now in another committed relationship and happy without me. Which is fine because I’m just really glad she’s happy. It’s just depressing to see her social life prospering and I’m just alone. I mean yeah I’d rather have her be happy with plenty of friends and a boyfriend than alone like me. Because even if she did me dirty she’s a genuinely good person and I want her to be happy. 

I find as I’m a likable guy and I get along with people well. I just have trouble meeting people and now I’m left with not one single friend which makes it even worse because I have no one to go do stuff with. I’m an IT intern so I really don’t talk to anyone at work besides my direct supervisor and we just kind of have two different personalities and he’s twice my age. 

I always thought I was funny and I went to an audition workshop type thing for comedy writing and had a really good time and had great laughs with people, but I didn’t get casted as a writer which was really disheartening. I had a great time and was looking forwarding to do it in the future. 

I honestly don’t know why I’m making this post I just wanted to vent because I have really no one else to talk to. I’m generally a really happy guy, but recently this has made me depressed "
7us9xb,13,2018-02-02,I used to write about Mean Christians on my Christian conspiracy blog: Oh The Irony!!!....,godmakesmesad,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/7us9xb/i_used_to_write_about_mean_christians_on_my/,"I wrote several articles about ""Mean Christians"" I guess my focus at the time was to say hey maybe Christians should try to be nicer. I know that the things I observed pushed me out to deconversion in the long run. Keep in mind as you read this stuff, I went into the Remnant, believing the churches were mostly fallen away-the world run by luciferians and the ""new world order"" and had been sheep-dipped into extreme conspiracy. A lot of my readers were unhappy with churches too. Funny thing is when I finally examined the ""operating system--the religion itself and it's claims, I suppose deconversion was inevitable, and I have had my worldview do a 180. I do believe today that Christianity especially it's extreme forms does bring out cruelty in people and will explain more in another post. In some of these articles I shared class concerns regarding the UU, I have noted since my return more of this has been addressed. I also realized I kept many of the liberal values from the UU despite being brainwashed about hell, needing a Savior and entering into the Christian construct of good vs evil.

One thing I have been thinking about lately is how I wasted so much time trying to befriend uptight Christians and sure some of them could be nice, but really it is a religion that brings out rigidity in people.

Some of the paragraphs, these are from several different articles. ""Mean Christians"", ""Mean Christians II"" and ""The Fake Christians Oppress Us"" --LOL yes I got brainwashed believing there were loved filled true Christians vs all the fake ones.

******************
""How some see the Christian world in the above picture. Sadly there is a reason these stereotypes exist. Betty Bower is a caricature by non-Christians of how they see pretentious stuck-up false ""Christians"". Sadly you don't have to be a non-Christian to feel burned by such types.
**********************
""They live in a narrow world where Reagan was a great man and where the war in Iraq was really about those horrible weapons of mass destruction.  Ted Cruz is our best friend and Trump will save the country from too many immigrants.  They bow down to all the elite's political agendas. In the last church I was in, not one had ever heard of the ""new world order"" which flabbergasted me considering the information that is now available on line. Brain-dead Republicanism absolutely ruled. There wasn't even a libertarian in the mix or a 9-11 truther in this coven of die hard Republicans.  I am so tired of these type of people, that my head hurts. The other side of the coin people don't do me any favors either. ""

*****************************
""The ""Christian"" culture stinks, it is faith destroying not faith elevating. ""
**************************
""The ""Christian"" world has become one of even more conformity. It has worsened in the last ten years.  The non-believers who complain about Christian ""pod people"" are on to something. They are absolutely correct about silly externals and appearances being focused on.  Their disgust matches mine, with the core difference, they rejected Jesus Christ based on the Mustard Tree of deceit. I wish I could have sat down with the ex IFB pastor guy and tell him, ""Yeah, you are absolutely right the Christian world stinks"". It's false programs, and appearances, and little social codes. It's drivel and busy-work for adults. It's control-freak land. As an ex-Catholic and ex-UU, I never really learned the social codes of the IFB and even in those kind  of churches, in some social ways I never fit in and never would. It was like moving to a town where everyone had been born there. ""

**********************
 
""The churches and Christian system disgust me. I became a UU even watching the TV evangelical preachers in the 1980s, realizing they were all bunk. The religious world is indeed a stinking cesspool. Look at this blog, I've written it for 5 years and haven't had time to expose all the rot, I found out about. The pastors are money-makers first and foremost but many are down right evil. The churches follow every agenda laid out and there's a reason more of them are becoming the same. ""I met a man two weeks ago, who overheard my conversation with my husband and told us, he felt like because he was poor area churches did not accept him. He had tried three and left. I told him of my own experiences and how I was done with the church system. Jesus Christ Himself in these churches today would be rejected as a ""homeless man"" 'without a job'.  He told us how at one church the pastor drove a BMW, and everyone was just fine with this while looking down on him for being impoverished.""

**********************

""I am tired of fake people. Be real or get out. Don't tell me you have a direct line to God and then spend years playing with my mind. Don't send me 70 DVDs extolling the virtues of Missler and then get mad when I see through the guy. Don't use my poverty to pretend to ""help"" and see me as a worm while doing it. I've had my fill of busy-body gossipy types too. I have learned to avoid them like the plague around here. Their eyes of condemnation and always lecturing me like a schoolmarm. Brained washed by the likes of David Ramsey, they see the poor as ""children"" who must be set on the right road and who have made bad decisions. Even those of us at an advanced age, seem to live under a cloud of oppression from wealthy narcissistic Baby Boomers with endless entitlement and smugness. They aren't any better at 70 then they were at 50. They still tell us we are no good because white picket fence dreams never existed for us. Their oppression for those unlike them never ends.""

**********************************

""Too many approach God with this thought that if they ""appear"" good, God will accept them. How about getting real and telling the truth? God will know anyway. The world sees the hypocrisy and turns away from God in absolute disgust. They know when people are faking it. Too many Christians present themselves as ""goody-goody two shoes"". ""Look at me, look how perfect I am!"" It tires me out. I'm not perfect. My life is on the verge of collapse every minute. God has made sure I have a roof and food, but there's no showing off here like the rest of these people are so busy doing. The Duggars are show offs, but there's many like them in churches across this land.""

*****************************

""I have encounters with the ""Christian"" world and many of those have been negative especially in the last ten years. From my vantage point of my own personal circumstances and location, yours may be different, the ""Christian evangelical world"" seems to be one of these middle class and upper middle class people who live very smug and privileged lives. When I visited the churches around here, I saw no poor people. I was an outliner even from my socioeconomic status alone. Arriving in the church parking lots with my car with its loud muffler, rust spots and cracked windshield was strange since no one else had that old of a car.""

******************************
 ""The churches preached to people with comfortable lives who never have faced any turmoil. They did truly believe in the ""best life"" now programming and lived it. Their lives were comfortable. Outside grandma facing serious illness and or elderly people dying, people with real troubles were banished. 
They were told things like ""God is in control"" as if God had brought evil things to them or that they needed to have more faith and get a ""miracle"". One thing I noticed is if people didn't ""fix"" their problems right away Oprah style, then people lost patience with them. They didn't want to know. They deemed them a failure. The best life now, stuff has been infused into the churches. Even the fundamentalists have a flavor of it, with the focus on competition and life ""improvement"".  It is a cancer that has taken over. You are told you do not belong unless your life is up to snuff. It happened to me. ""

***********************

""I have been judged harshly by the Christian crowd, both as non-believer and a believer. During my non-believer days, a Dutch Reformed cult, that had taken over a place I had an internship at, told me over and over I was hell bound and never preached any gospel. One of the people who worked their taunted someone for being Jewish. Still no gospel, just meanness and coldness. One would be dorm mate when I was listening to U2 on the radio, told me I was listening to the devil's music and almost smacked my radio off it's shelf. I was called ""Heathen"" by relatives angry that I had left the Catholic church. My view of Christians wasn't very positive. I saw Christians as mean people who wanted to oppress others. Sadly I see much of the same behaviors today.""

{{{{LOLOL that's for damn sure now....you know if you can't stand most of the crowd maybe it's time to leave}}}}}

*****************************

""When I was in my first IFB, I got rebuked for hanging out with too many nonbelievers. I was witnessing to them but was told hanging out with pagans at the coffee house would get me in trouble. I talked this out with the pastor there, but it is something I remember. While these people were kind to me in that particular place and setting, I was not conforming very well and breaking the ""unwritten rules"". ""

{{{{{I ignored those rules and kept the pagan war protesting friends, actually I was far closer to those folks then the fellow Christians}}}}

***************************

""...some people DO suffer under the false judgments of ""Christians"" who are seeking cruelty first and trying to elevate themselves over on people. I've dealt with the 1 Tim 5:13 type of women. They prey on the vulnerable, as they gossip about your troubles. Prayer lists in churches often are used for the ""pity patrol"" list as they shake their heads, ""Poor Marie getting a divorce...Why won't Sally lose weight?....Jenny has cancer..... I was even made an object of pity in one church when my husband had lost two jobs in a row, one from an economic lay-off and the second from a deceitful boss. The hooded eyes and clucking tongues wearied me. In the last church where I shared some recent troubles during a prayer session, the reaction seemed to be horror. I turned red. Saving face came first in this place and there was no real sharing among the congregation beyond the weather. ""

*****************************

""Some will pray the right and correct way but often sharing troubles in some of these churches just makes you fodder for the gossip mill. I have realized with horror, status runs the show as it does everywhere else. They flat out ignore the teachings of Jesus to put the poor man at the highest seat at the dinner, and the King and Queen of the Mountain games are still very much in vogue. ""

*****************************

"" I have been severely hurt by the long line of women with haughty eyes looking down on me, with their ""perfect families"" and advice that tells me I am a ""bad person"" for not achieving a certain status in society. I am tired of liars too. In many ways a Christian is more in danger from a false Christian then an honest non-believer. They oppress us.""
**************************
""However, there seems to be a new breed of “Christian” out there, that is more about control, meanness, and no love whatsoever. As the liberals say “proto-fascists”, [1]they are not too far off the mark, when calling these behaviors out. Some “Christians” seem to have reach zeniths of cruelty and nastiness that even ordinary people in the street could never dream of.""

****************

""So many churches beyond their wide array of false teachings, show the same poor fruits, places where Oprah-esque “best life now” false theology is sold to the suburban upper class demographics, and endless seminars and lines for “leadership training” prevail. In the land where humbleness has been set aside, everyone wants to be in charge!""

**********************

I guess I didn't like Christians even when I was in. One reason I deconverted is I never saw any evidence of the Holy Spirit changing anyone for the better. The Bible spoke of all this love, fellowship, and unity in churches, it was an absolute joke. I knew a few nice Christians don't get me wrong, especially some much older ladies from the Silent Generation, but they were personalities that diverted from the norm. I had to face facts too, that among born again and evangelical Christians, I never felt ""accepted"", and close friendship was very rare with any of them. Christianity turned me into a prig too, and I think of the social losses I had from being a Christian today and damage done to relationships that otherwise would have been positive. There is meanness in Christianity. I mean look at this stuff I wrote, I was in it, and believed the gospel and STILL SAW THE CRUELTY.

7usaxs,3,2018-02-02,Torn about distance caretaking; venting.,Tea2223,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/7usaxs/torn_about_distance_caretaking_venting/,"Earlier in January my dad (60yo) was diagnosed with small cell esophageal carcinoma. SCEC is apparently very aggressive and very rare (about 1% of esophageal malignancies). After all testing we've confirmed there are cancerous cells in his esophagus and the lymph nodes on both the left and right side of his neck. SCEC is staged simply as ""limited"" or ""extensive"". Since the cancer has spread outside of the esophagus we're in the extensive stage. 

Surgery isn't an option so we're doing three days of chemo every three weeks until April and radiation five days a week. 

The doctors have told us prognosis is generally pretty poor. Generally, one year is how much longer a patient has, give or take.

Surprisingly despite this, my dad seems pretty okay. His voice sounds rough, he has a cough, and he has a little trouble swallowing but he seems to be getting around okay. The first round of chemo is done, so naturally he's feeling a bit rundown, but thats the side effects of chemo.

The huge hurdle I'm facing is that I am 24yo and moved 600 miles away a few months back for my girlfriend's internship. I was planning on going back to school soon and am finally in a position to do so, but I'm torn whether I should be planning to move back in the near future or focus on myself first. I want to be there to help but I'm not sure if that's a premature jump. I've seen others warning that it's not always wise to put your life on hold. 

We've agreed as a family that should this become a losing battle, I'll move back home temporarily to help my mom with care taking, getting my dad's final affairs in order, and helping my mom sell the house and such afterwards.

 My girlfriend supports this fully, but I hate having to be apart. Should that be the case she'll be visiting my family and me often, but it will still be a frustrating situation that we have to deal with. 

Most importantly I want to spend time with my dad. He seems to be doing impressively well given the diagnosis, but I know things can turn ugly quickly with this disease and I want to be there.

I just feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place: focus on finally advancing myself and getting an education now that I am able while my dad's condition seems stable or put everything on hold in case the situation gets bad quickly.

I guess this is just a rant about how hard this is as a family member and son. Sorry if my thoughts seem scrambled. Thanks to anyone reading.

7usrra,71,2018-02-02,What makes most jobs in the US suck these days??,DerPhilosoph,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/7usrra/what_makes_most_jobs_in_the_us_suck_these_days/,"Is it incompetent managers that don't know their ass from their elbow? (Like seriously, how did that person make it into management?!?) Is it the constant pressure to do things cheaper, faster, and better? Is it that one or two coworkers in your department that can yell at interns (something I've witnessed before) and are generally grumpy/easily angered all the time, but basically can't get fired because they are too valuable?

Is it the cliques or social circles in the workplace? 

Is it not enough vacation time?

Not enough pay for the duties performed?

The disposability of everyone below the board or corporate levels?

The lack of loyalty between worker and company?

Is it the blatant nepotism where a manager's son or daughter always seems to get a position, be an intern, behave in any manner or be as incompetent as possible and not get fired?

7utee6,1,2018-02-02,I've [21M] been in relationship with my gf [21F] for over a year. I feel like she isn't interested in me any more.,mr_meeseeks7,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7utee6/ive_21m_been_in_relationship_with_my_gf_21f_for/,"I met my girlfriend when I was doing my intern-ship in a different city and we clicked instantly. We had the same outlook on quite a lot of things of interest to us and thus went out quite often for the 6 months I was in her city. Things seemed to go well for the first couple of months when I moved back and we both were comfortable with the long distance thing. One thing that irked me though, was that most of the time I was the one to initiate conversation. 

Coming to the more recent times now, I feel like we're not doing well together. We don't find a lot of things to talk about. I've been busy with my projects and also, trying to find a job now that I'm into my final year of college. I haven't been able to call her for about a week but she hasn't bothered to know my whereabouts. This concerns me. When I call her at the end of the week, she appears to talk very normally like everything's fine, but doesn't show a lot of concerns about me or why I didn't call her during this time. 

Now I can't tell if she's still interested in me or wants to move on. I'm still in love with her and want us to be together. But I don't know how to bring this up with her. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I've been away from my girlfriend for 6 months, and now she doesn't seem to be interested in me. How do I confront her regarding this."

My name is Parth Krishna, and I am on my way to one of the most cliched thing parents make their children do, engineering (although i chose this).

Jokes apart, I am pursuing my graduation in computer science from PES University, and currently, in second year. I am proficient in Python, and I know HTML, CSS and basics of JS.

I am looking to intern in companies, be it on-site or work from home.

Interested people, message me.
Thanks."

-----------------------

* [They play this](https://youtu.be/RljdyXeft04). Not that it’s remotey funny or anything but it is nostalgic for anybody who used to go on twisted humor and ebaumsworld and stuff like that back in the day 

* Opie says he is [ready to pass out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHI2I53gjIE) because he doesn’t have any “melk”. They come back from break and Opie is furious about the fact that he couldn’t get milk. He says his blood sugar levels were dropping drastically and he may actually pass out. He was furious because the intern got the milk from Duane Reade, and he yelled at Jimmy off air. 

* [Patrice does a spot saying he knew jimmy was gay before anybody else did](https://youtu.be/JqO5m3P8K0Y?t=1h58m10s)

* While in DC, they meet some other jocks and on air talent from XM, including Kimmy from XM kids. She plays some songs from her channel, which leads to them to playing and becoming obsessed with ""Bananaphone""

* Intern Noah says he made a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND9LIO2rPH0) with an older Swedish producer.

* O&amp;A play a clip of a gay guy from American Idol named [Matthew Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUnk1FDPeko&amp;feature=youtu.be). It's pretty remarkable how this guy was ridiculed and made to feel shitty on national television, unlike today where he'd be a national icon.

* Martini Steve reveals the origins of [Ramone](https://youtu.be/XmYrwTN1Css?t=1h47m57s)

* Jay Mohr appeared in Page 6 after being seen with Nikki Cox. They’re all surprised given how doting he is with his current wife, but Anthony said he saw him anally fucking a black girl back at WNEW. 

* Jimmy first mocks Bob Kelly for saying [""schmarmy""](https://youtu.be/XmYrwTN1Css?t=3h24m8s)

* High pitched Deedee from XM Kids participated in a stupid “read news articles with news ticker in the background” bit until the listeners email awful shit to the Kids channel and management stops allowing her on the show

* Before they leave for their New Orleans trip it is revealed that Jimmy's tickets for the trip were never booked. Jimmy is irate and insist that because the ticket was purchased late and because the make up ticket is not first class he doesn’t want to go anyway. He insists that it isn't out of spite but purely on principle, and that there is no way he is going. The Monday show from New Orleans opens up with Jimmy at third-mic. 

* During one of the New Orleans broadcasts, Jimmy complains that there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom of his two-level suite

* All they really do on air in New Orleans is throw beads at people walking by below. Opie throws some at a handicapped man in a scooter and whenever he hits somebody with beads he points accusingly at Jimmy, which pisses Jimmy off. Opie justifies throwing at an old man by saying he doesn’t discriminate and everybody is “deservent” of a bead throw.

* Ant says he saw a group of black guys targeting white couples and intimidating them and it gave him a deep sense of rage and made him want to just say nigger at them. He adds that he never throws that word around in his regular day but sometimes you gotta dig for the most powerful deepest insult you can say and you don’t wanna hold back.

* Opie recounts stories of random tourists in New Orleans who were throwing up in public. But he keeps referring to it as ""power booting"" and he says the term ""power booting"" so often that it’s fairly obvious that he heard somebody else use the term recently, thought it was cool slang, and wants everybody to hear how cool he sounds when he says it. 

* Ben Sparks is mocked as a guy who constantly is gossiping and claims that he saw Tom brady doing coke at a club in Boston 

* The boys are now doing live reads again, which XM initially did not have them doing. 

* Anthony is obsessed with the Michael Jackson trial and is completely certain he will be going to prison 

* Jim goes on an extended rant over his “mealy Apples” that he keeps being served by interns. They get new intern Travis in studio briefly and tell him to go elsewhere for better apples 

* A caller who works for infinity broadcasting calls in and says he heard it’s almost assured that Opie and Anthony will be doing Mornings at KROCK but Opie dismisses it 

* Ant describes a childhood incident in which a nude 25-year-old (not Buzz) coaxed him into her bedroom for sex, at which point her husband jumped out of the closet with a shotgun. The entire thing was set up to scare Anthony as a prank but he didn’t fall for it.

* Tamara Green accuses Bill Cosby of drugging her at a restaurant and taking her to her apartment and assaulting her decades prior. Corey Feldman claims he isn’t sure if Michael Jackson molested him or not in the 80s. Both stories leave the boys assuming they’re opportunists who are seeking fame. 

* Anthony calls out Opie for repeatedly calling Flavor Flav ""Flavor Flay""

* Jimmy admits that he was gonna join a gang called The Lords as a kid 

* A jock from the Boneyard channel who calls himself Cool Guy has been talking shit about the O&amp;A Show on the air, causing Jimmy to write an open letter on Wackbag calling him a phony and a “fucking faggot”, to which Cool Guy replies that he is a family man with kids and isn’t serious about all this. The boys also mention that on the Wackbag board there is a sticky called Immobilization Guidelines, which serve as a sort of 'rules of engagement' for how the sub will attack other shows, news organizations, and public figures. 

* Noah the intern quits on on February 15, following a call from his father called to the company after the show. The boys claim Noah enjoyed the airtime and aren't sure why he's gone.

* [A great Jimmy laugh](https://youtu.be/AABRmMzO9N4?t=24m57s)

* Lots of callers and posters on message boards will say something shocking, and then once they start describing it they end up leading into a plug of an upcoming Jim Norton gig. There seems to be an escalating battle to see who can provide the best bait to pull off this gag.

* In a discussing about a Post article featuring a woman who is offended by others staring at her breastfeeding in public, Opie says ""Let’s be honest - it’s hot"", to which both Ant and Jim immediately say ""Ugh no that’s disgusting."" This, combined with the fact that Opie has admitted to finding pregnant women sexy, in addition to his longstanding open desire to be a father, and his contentious relationship with his mother, has led me to believe that he has incredibly deep and complex Oedipal issues that may be a key source of his existence-consuming narcissism. 

* The phones don’t work and Opie gets so upset that Anthony sounds audibly anxious. Opie snaps and gives out corporate suit Kevin Straily’s email and yells at the listeners to go after him 

* [The gates of Central Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gates) are mocked

* Opie says that the Grammys “fail in comparison” to the VMAs

* They have Adam Levine of Maroon 5 on the phone and they toy with him and do their usual fucking around. It’s funny, but it does make you realize why actual celebrities weren’t interested in participating with the show after a while

* I’m gonna need somebody to confirm for me that the guy who has been posting diss tracks on this sub is NOT the same as [this guy here](https://youtu.be/FoApTnrqVmU?t=2h51m23s)

* [I think this was “Billy” Burr’s first XM appearance. With Charlie Murphy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6whQxoqL50&amp;t=16s)

* What are we doing to celebrate black history month? Ant: ""I’m only using one lock on my front door""

* Opie lies to Deacon Jones during an interview about his age and says he was born in 1965

* They’re live from Los Angeles World Poker Tour, where Anothny will be playing. Joe Rogan is there and he talks about DMT and Terrence McKenna and Doug Stanhope and mushrooms, UFC, floatation tanks, Randy Couture, Vanderlay Silva, Tito Ortiz, BJ Penn within about 30 minutes.

* [The Ed Asner interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctz0SgJUsIA)

* [Interview with Lemmy from Motorhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_X2bZ3j2iM)

* [Gangsta Fag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM0kURU_oCA)"

7uv6jt,4,2018-02-02,Overtly Competitive Premed,increasedmonoamines,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7uv6jt/overtly_competitive_premed/,"Most people that know me understands that I am a premed with a low GPA. There is a recent graduate in my university who continues to question my every move. For privacy, I’ll call her Sarah. Sarah is a recent graduate in a contracted major with a near 4.0 GPA, two SHPEPs, multiple shadowing opportunities and ECs.

Sarah would ask me every other month on whether I have taken the MCAT or what ECs I have completed. I’ll explain to her how I’m still studying, searching for a test center, and what volunteer opportunities I’ve done or plan on doing. When I ask her a question about what she has done since graduating last year, she would ignore me.

I continued to respond to her messages. For example, she was seeking my advice on whether she should join a non-paid internship at our local hospital. I explained to her my biochemistry research project involved in the internship that may result in a publication. However, Sarah was interested in my project knowing that her project may be clinical based research. I advised her that she should purse knowing her intentions. Later, she had a Facebook post about a paid Yale University clinical research internship. I did not know about this opportunity, but apparently she was deciding along with the other internship.

During our last one sided conversation, I asked her again when she planned on taking the MCAT. She had responded that she has not taken it and will delay medical school indefinitely. Out of concern, I asked her if everything is okay? She chose to ignore me again.

I am not jealous of Sarah’s accomplishments. She has done very well for herself to succeed this early in her life. What I don’t understand is why she constantly has to keep tabs on what I am doing when she is a much better candidate than I am. We aren’t exactly friends. I’ve asked her to be co-President with me in a premed group due to her professionalism when she was still in our school. We worked well together until she told our club coordinator that I was causing her anxiety and used her for her contact list. Although the rest of our E-board did not feel that way.

I feel that Sarah is secretive in her accomplishments to better herself during application season. Whereas I am willing to help people in finding ECs, shadowing opportunities or do well in the university.

Does anyone else have a Sarah in their life? How would you handle this situation?"
7uvnnm,33,2018-02-02,The saga of AnimeAssassin: how it began,CastielGalafran,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/7uvnnm/the_saga_of_animeassassin_how_it_began/,"TW: sexual, emotional, financial, psychological abuse

I made this account specifically to post this story because I think it would be therapeutic for me. I left my ex, who I'll dub AnimeAssassin, in June 2017. We would have gotten married right around now, and thank fucking god we didn't. Instead, I now get to regale you kind redditors with an action packed tale full of neckbeards, forbidden love, family drama, and a batshit mom. Be warned. I have a lot of stories. 

The tale begins when I was 21, back in the fall of 2015. I was a Junior in college, majoring in physics, modeling, competitive ballroom dancing, and running a mentoring organization at my university. I had just gotten back from spending the summer working a prestigious internship at a particle accelerator and started on a new research project at my university. I was living rent free with my parents, which had its ups and downs. At the time, my parents were extremely controlling. They loved me and gave me many advantages in life, but they were struggling to reconcile with the fact that I wasn't a little girl anymore. And I was wanting desperately to find my own path, spread my wings, and seek independence. I was also harboring the trauma from past sexual abuse by an older teacher when I was a child. I hadn't sought therapy yet.

At the time I was on the university's ballroom dancing team. I'd just joined and was extremely insecure about my dancing ability. A few weeks into the semester, I dropped my original partner because he was acting stalkerish and threatening my friends. I was also dealing with two guys in the physics department harassing me at the time, so I was in a pretty vulnerable place. I had a huge crush on a grad student in my research lab (he is an important character so I'll name him Doge). Doge was an ex professional marathoner, mountain runner, and nordic skier. You'd never know he was a huge jock though. He was your typical sweet nerd, humble, chatty to a fault, and oh so niave. We became friends quickly and found ourselves talking for hours in the lab rather than doing any work. Doge was a refreshing refuge in the midst of the creeps who were invading my life, and he would happily walk me to class and my car every day. Of course, I was convinced he was too good for me. And, to make matters worse, we worked in the same lab. 

I needed to kill this crush fast. 

Then, with almost perfect timing, AnimeAssassin entered my life. He was a scrawny, fedora wearing engineering major with a loud voice and brown eyes that held more than a hint of desperation in them. He had just joined the ballroom team. When we danced together in practice he'd stare up at me with those big brown eyes (I was taller than him in my dance shoes) and smile. Just smile. I felt uncomfortable with him at first. He was too eager, his words too well chosen, his expressions too calculated. He reminded me of a puppet acting at being a real boy. There was a disconnect that I couldn't quite put my finger on. He would send me endless facebook messages complimenting me, calling me pet names, asking me to lunch. But perhaps I was being too quick to judge. He was a nice guy. He said he was a nice guy. I didn't want to be the pretty, popular bitch who never gave the nice guy a chance.   

So on a Tuesday after practice, I talked to him privately. I told AnimeAssassin that while I appreciated his compliments, they were a bit much. He looked horrified and apologized, telling me, ""I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted to be upfront about my feelings for you."" I reassured him that he hadn't scared me and that this talk was not a rejection. I just needed to take things slowly and start out as friends. He told me I was worth waiting for. 

I cried as I drove home. After dealing with those three guys harassing me and the sexual abuse from my past, being told that I was worth waiting for meant the world to me. Maybe I had finally met the man who would give me the patience, the space, the time I needed. Maybe this was it. I told my friends about our conversation and they were thrilled. They'd been with me through my previous relationship with a guy who constantly pushed me to have sex and were just as happy as I was that AnimeAssassin seemed willing to take things at my pace. 

That Friday we went over to my best friend's place. AnimeAssassin wanted me to come to his house to watch a movie, but I wasn't comfortable being alone with him yet. So we sat and watched my friend play fetch with his yappy, demon terrier. Our conversation drifted and flowed with almost as much ease as the ones between me and Doge. We talked about dancing, school, our hopes for the future. He told me all his exes had cheated on him. I told him mine would pressure me too much and that's why we broke up. He mentioned he had a large Italian family with six siblings and I smiled, musing that it must be nice to have a large family. I only have one brother. He got quiet. 

I asked him what was wrong and those desperate brown eyes got a faraway look. His too-loud voice lowered. His skinny shoulders slouched and he confessed, ""It isn't nice. My mother is a narcissistic bitch. I hate her. She's abusive."" My heart sank. He looked like a hurt puppy and I wanted to save him. I can't stand to think of a child being hurt. I wrapped my arms around him and told him I was sorry, that it wasn't his fault, and that we could talk about something else. But he was too deep in memories now. He rambled about the ways his mother was manipulative, how his little sister would chase her around the house with a knife, how his father was an alcoholic who would beat on the mother, how his entire life had been an anguished mess of abuse and psychological torture. He said he never wanted a relationship like his parents. He promised he'd never be like his father if I was never like his mother. 

The next night we went to a country music concert. I didn't like country music but his roommate gave him the tickets for free and he promised it wasn't a date so I agreed. We sat on a blanket in the grass. He crept closer. Arm around my shoulders, arm around my waist, hand on my hips. I told myself to stop scooting away. I had to be nice. He knew I didn't want to move fast and he was a good guy. He'd respect that. AnimeAssassin asked me if I wanted a beer. I told him no, that I don't like to drink, but a water would be fine. He smiled and walked to the vendor area. His roommate Jake was with us and while he was gone I asked if AnimeAssassin was a good guy, a safe guy. Jake assured me that he was the most noble, good hearted person he knew. So when he returned with a massive cup overflowing with some foul smelling, alcoholic slushie and thrust it toward me, I told myself he must not have heard me when I said no. I apologized and told him I didn't want to drink, and those puppy dog eyes returned. 

""But I got this for you."" he said, ""It cost a lot.""

Guilty, I smiled and drank. 

Jake left. I don't remember where he went. I just remember AnimeAssassin holding my waist, then wrestling me, then I was on my back and he was on top of me. The alcohol had made me giggly. I cracked some dumb joke. He looked down at me softly. I asked him what he was looking at. He said, ""You're the most beautiful girl I know."" Before I could respond, his mouth was one mine and he was kissing me hard, passionately, and as much as I wanted to push him off me I forced myself to kiss him back because he had just called me beautiful. Men didn't call me beautiful. They called me sexy, baby, slut. A man had never called me beautiful. I owed him that kiss at least. 

I was his girlfriend after that. I don't think I ever agreed to, but he was so thrilled with me that I couldn't bear to say no. I refused to be the shallow, pretty bitch that wouldn't give a nice guy a chance. And I needed a distraction from Doge anyway. A week after the concert AnimeAssassin texted me and said he wanted to start traditions with me our grandchildren would carry on. I felt creeped out by that, and was just about to text him to slow down when he texted that he loved me. He wanted to marry me. I felt like such a rotten person for not feeling the same way. This guy loved me. I was an unloveable, awkward slut. Who the hell was going to love me? 

We went on our first official date the following week. By this time we had only been kissing. I made it clear to him I didn't want to have sex until marriage and he told me he felt the same. I explained my desire to wait came from the trauma of being abused, that I wanted to form a close bond before being vulnerable in that way. His reasons were because God said so. But whatever the reasons, when we went on that date I felt safe. We were at the state fair, I was wearing a beautiful red dress, and I let myself feel like I was in a romantic movie. He held my hand and took me on rides, bought me fair food, won me a stuffed animal. It was perfect. I was on air. For the first time in my life I felt loveable, like a princess or the ever desired main character of all those sappy movies we grew up on. He gave me a promise ring that night. No one had ever given me something like that before. I felt special.

He was supposed to drive me home after that. But he wanted to stop by his place. As we drove he began talking about his alcoholic father and that bright eyed, laughing boy I rode the ferris wheel with just minutes before became angry, steely eyed, driving erratically. I asked him to slow down. He sped up. He told me how he had to knock his father out to protect his mother. But it wasn't his father's fault. His mother was a ""fucking retarded bitch"". She instigated things. She was manipulative. She made his father hit her. AnimeAssassin confessed that once his mother made him so angry he attacked her himself, chased her into the garage, ran his first throw her car window when she tried to drive away. He asked me if I forgave him for that. 

By the time we got to his place he was crying. I walked him inside, holding him, comforting him, assuring him that he can't blame himself for how he reacted as a child. He made me coffee and calmed himself as I drank. Then, somehow, we ended up in his bedroom. i don't remember how. I don't remember how I ended up on his bed, him on top of me, kissing me, feeling my breasts, pulling my dress off me. I told him to stop. He told me to trust him. My throat tightened and I felt my phone buzzing beside me. My mom was calling and if I just picked up it could stop here, but I couldn't move. I said nothing as he pulled off my underwear. I was naked in front of another person for the first time. He kissed me. He stuck his fingers in my vagina. I wanted to move his hand away but I had no control of my body. He pounded his arm back and forth like a jackhammer. It hurt. Then somehow my body twitched and my privates felt warm. That was my first orgasm. I had never even masturbated before. He held his fingers inside me, smiling triumphantly, watching me as I forced a smile. 

I know I could have broken up with him then. But that fall I didn't know rape could happen like that. I thought I was just a prude. If I didn't want it why didn't I pick up my mom's call? Why didn't I say something? Why did I just lay there like a corpse? Why did I orgasm? I put my dress on and kissed him goodbye and drove home. 

And that was how it started. An insecure girl who thought she wasn't good enough for love danced with a desperate-eyed boy. "

7uw4ty,0,2018-02-02,How hard is it to pass MMI for MD guaranteed place at unimelb?,LordUnicornFarts,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7uw4ty/how_hard_is_it_to_pass_mmi_for_md_guaranteed/,"Hello!

As a high-school leaver who still hasn't figured out what to do, I'm freaking out right now. I received an OP1 last year, but the only thing that's keeping me back from choosing unimelb's guaranteed entry program (by doing bachelor of biomedical sciences, getting 75% WAM and passing the MMI) is the difficulty of the MMI. I currently have a choice between University of Melbourne's guaranteed entry program and Griffith's school leaver program (bachelor of biomedicine --&gt; MD).

Currently, all the information that I have is that the MMI passing conditions is 50% average score across all 8 stations and getting over a cut-off score for 5/8 stations (don't know what score it is).

With this information, I can't decide if going to Unimelb to do the guaranteed entry program would be a risk I want to take. How easy is it for applicants to pass the MMI?

Also, I heard that with the guaranteed entry pathway (99.00+, not 99.90+), it's only possible to receive FFP for the MD. Does this mean that I won't be able to receive guaranteed internship?

Thank you.

We had the same outlook on quite a lot of things of interest to us and thus went out quite often for the 6 months I was in her city. Things seemed to go well for the first couple of months when I moved back and we both were comfortable with the long distance thing. One thing that irked me though, was that most of the time I was the one to initiate conversation. 

Coming to the more recent times now, I feel like we're not doing well together. We don't find a lot of things to talk about. I've been busy with my projects and also, trying to find a job now that I'm into my final year of college. I haven't been able to call her for about a week but she hasn't bothered to know my whereabouts. This concerns me. When I call her at the end of the week, she appears to talk very normally like everything's fine, but doesn't show a lot of concerns about me or why I didn't call her during this time. 

Now I can't tell if she's still interested in me or wants to move on. I'm still in love with her and want us to be together. But I don't know how to bring this up with her.

  **tl;dr**: I've been away from my girlfriend for 6 months, and now she doesn't seem to be interested in me. How do I confront her regarding this"

A lot has happened since Day 0, and man I gotta tell ya....it has been hell.

I am always trying to improve myself and NoFap has probably been the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 

I added a weight training class to my semester so I could finally break my gym stigma. I have it twice a week and my stigma still hasn’t really gone away. I also do a seven-minute cardio workout every day. I don’t use elevators anymore. I walk up and down seven flights of stairs, minimum, every day. I have also been taking three mile walks three times a week. 

I have not really gotten any “superpowers”, yet. But I am noticing certain “enhancements”

1. My senses have gone up a bit. One day I passed this one girl and I could still smell her parfait from three yards away! My eyesight has gone up a bit also. 

2. I have more energy now. It has come in handy during weight training.

3. More time to focus on my studies now that I'm not milking my snake's venom.

4. My skin has gotten healthier. I wasn't ridden with acne or anything, but the quality of my skin has become ""cleaner.""


I have not noticed an increase in ""attraction"", but I did lock eyes with this one girl the other day and she smiled at me prompting me to smile back. But I gamble she was one of those ""nice girls"" who smiles at everyone to be polite. Maybe I'm too blinded by my pessimism to notice, I'm not sure. 

There has also been ONE adverse effect.


1. Violent episodes. I don't have IED (intermittent explosive disorder) or anything, but man when I got angry, something inside of me just....erupted. It only happens when I'm alone, I don't ever want to make a scene. These violent episodes rarely happen but last night was without a doubt the most violent one by far. I swear I have NEVER felt such a rush of rage before in my life. I just started to think about everyone who ever bullied me in my past and what it would be like if I fought them. I then started to punch myself in the face, like I was trying to test how hard I hit. The punches just kept getting harder and harder as time passed. I just kept thinking that my punches were too weak and that the person(s) I was fighting wouldn't feel a thing. Eventually, I started to bang my head against the wall. After a moment of.....head banging, my anger started to subside. I left a huge dent in the wall and there were traces of blood. Speaking of blood, my face was full of cuts and bruises. It looked like I got in a fight with a freight train. My knuckles were swollen and bruised. I even started to spit out blood. 


It has been really hard to resist my urges right now. I am beyond stressed out right now. I completed my MCAT a couple weeks ago and I still have a plethora of work to do. My University just keeps on piling the paperwork. I also have an internship that I have to go to twice a week. I hardly get any sleep anymore and I barely have any time to myself. When I do have time to myself it is when I get meals. 

Cold showers help every now and then. But honestly, the only thing I have ever felt I got from them is a sudden increase in my pulse.

But hey, I guess I like a challenge. 


Here's to the next 45 days, and BEYOND!

7uxz4c,1,2018-02-03,Job Offer at $6k more.,Moronthanoff,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7uxz4c/job_offer_at_6k_more/,"So, I've been at my job 2 years next week. I came from a 1 year job before that, and I need some advice on how to/whether to accept the offer.

**I graduated State school with a degree in Business Management and Marketing in June 2015** after about 15 years in Food Service. In March of the same year I interned at a F500 Co until graduation when they offered me a FT job as a Treasury admin. **I was doing the full job of a Treasury Analyst, but they were only paying$13/hr**. I tried to negotiate when they offered me FT after 3mos as an intern, but they said no, same rate or pound sand. They called the job ""Treasury Admin"" even though it included heavy research and negotiation abilities. As in, ""why didn't you negotiate a better price for X contract?"" I might have had I not been paid$13/hr...

**I left F500(nowF300) for a privately owned finance company, where I started at $16/hr +incentives**. I have gained responsibility quickly, and am now making $21/hr + bonus. In 2016 I made $34k, last year (2017) I made $48k. **In 2018 I expect to easily clear $55k after a raise and bonuses.**

**My supervisor when I started at Finance Co got a Director level position in September at our local Credit Union**. They started her as ""Asset Protection Manager"" at around $110k + bonuses. She had previously been making about$90k including bonuses.

**Previous supervisor called me up to offer me a job at ""$62k""** starting, as ""Recovery Coordinator"". I will be directly under her, making $6k more than I am on track for this year, but I have a dilemma.

**Dilemma is**, I know I will be making $70-90k w/in 3 years if I just stay where I'm at. My company has a military sort of structure where you can apply for a raise/title after so much time in your current position. Again, I can get to $70-90k in the next 3 years easily, doing exactly what I'm doing now. I wouldn't even have much more responsibility. I would go from Credit Officer to Credit Manager to Assistant Branch Manager doing exactly what I'm doing now. The underlings who would do what I asked because I am an ""Assistant Manager"" already do what I ask them to do because I'm good at what I do and ask them for reasonable things already. I truly believe all that would change is Title and Pay, I would just be expected to produce more. And I think that would be cake.

**The new position** is being offered $62k + bonuses offhand, as in, before any negotiations. The position is more focused than my current position. Whereas I am currently underwriting/collecting/remarketing used cars, meaning I approve loans, collect on them when past due, and Reposess/Remarket(sell) them when they go bad, the new position is solely remarketing, as in selling repossessed assets for a Credit Union.

*The good and the bad:*

**Good:**
More money now. Less stress. All business to business, not dealing with consumer complaints. Private Office vs BullPit office.

**Bad**
Not underwriting. Pidgeon-holing myself? Upward Mobility in industry/in Credit Union?

**So...** I'm mostly worried about carrier prospects as this is a very specialized job, and my ability to negotiate salary/options for upward mobility in the company - 2 things I know I've got at my current job.

**Another Factor** is my wife and I are buying the retail stores (2) she manages. We have taken out a $75k loan against our house, and a $250 owner carry loan. To pay off the purchase will take 3 years, with my wife paying herself a salary of $52k/yr. After they are paid, we expect to net another $100k/yr from the stores. This being said, I may be a bit macho, but I need to have my own career even if my wife is making $150k, and making half that ain't nothin to huff at!

**My wife says*** it is important for me to be less stressed over the next few years as she is going to have a lot on her plate. I'm currently leaning towards the new job, but need some input. 

Thanks in advance for any input."

I’m gonna get right to it. I recently ended a serious romantic relationship of 6+ months and have found myself skidding back into a painfully familiar pattern of using food, weed, booze, and porn/sex to cope with the void of loneliness and pain that’s left in its wake.

So last night: the short version is that I pawned my 8-year-old daughter off on my folks so I could have the night to myself, had a beer at the office (beer cart brought around by the interns), bought a bottle of Crown Royal Regal Apple (what!?!?!) after work, and proceeded to drink most of it whilst eating half of a pizza, and then, with a few drinks in me, went BACK out to hit up Burger King for three bacon double cheeseburgers, a medium fry and a slice of Oreo cheesecake.

Question: WHO DOES THIS!?!?
Answer: I do when I’m sad and lonely and can’t muster the willpower to keep fighting the urge.

This is my official cry for help and accountability. HALP!"
7v0fp0,3,2018-02-03,M4M - the young Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7v0fp0/m4m_the_young_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Other kinks! https://m.imgur.com/MTINyO2"

7v0q31,1,2018-02-03,[M4F] Hopeless romantic goofball seeking literate partner for sickeningly sweet role play,PicklesTheRealtor,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7v0q31/m4f_hopeless_romantic_goofball_seeking_literate/,"**Everything here is 18+**


So, I'll get this out of the way quickly, I'm really just looking for some folks who write well and can provide additional fun things to keep the role play going along. If you can do that in a couple of paragraphs, perfect, short and sweet is always fun and usually makes things go faster. If you'd like to write 6+ that's also fine, I adore details and it gives more insight into the character's actions and thoughts. What I'm trying to say here is I'm fine with whatever! As far as writing style if you prefer first or third let me know and we can go with whatever you're more comfortable with!

Now, onto the actual meat of this whole thing. What I'm looking for is just a fun and entertaining role play that starts off with two people probably awkwardly getting to know each other as it grows into a relationship. This could happen in a ton of different ways and depending on any particular pairing you might have in mind that could change how things can start or change drastically. I'm open to pretty much anything, but I prefer playing a somewhat awkward and goofy fellow who probably doesn't have much of any real experience with ladies. I think I've gotten pretty good at that kind of character, also it's definitely, totally, for sure not from my own awkward first hand experience. 

As for actual role plays I'm open to pretty much whatever honestly, though do keep in mind I heavily prefer playing the kind of character I stated before. I promise it's not always awkward, he tends to transition into just a sarcastic, teasing goofball fairly easily. Side note, I fucking love sass. If there is one thing I love more than boobies it's wit and sarcasm and someone that can put up with quips and other goofy things that tend to come from my characters. So I guess what I'm saying is I love a strong independent woman who don't really need no man but can't help but enjoy the company of this goon who won't stop trying to make her chuckle at inappropriate times.

For particular pairings though I'll list out a couple and bold the character I would enjoy playing;

- Teacher x **Student**

- Boss x **Intern**

- Journalist/Bandmate x **Rockstar**

- Best Friends

- Nearly anything incest related (I really just like the taboo and heavily prefer to play pairings as the younger of the two characters such as a mother x son or older sister x brother)

- Celebrity x **Childhood Friend** (Or enemy depending on how you'd like things to go, also could be a real or fake celebrity. Whatever you prefer!)

- Roommates / Neighbors

I do have a few ideas but I would love to hear what you have in mind for any pairing you might be interested in. I love brainstorming and throwing ideas around and coming up with fun little twists and turns and stuff. As far as the actual dirty stuff I'm fairly vanilla, which I suppose this prompt may have given away. I'm not opposed to anything save for snuff, gore, and scat so I suppose those are my limits. I've already kind of stated the things I like, pretty much anything like kissing, cuddling, teasing, all that kind of stuff is 100% up my alley although I know that seems like it's not around much when everyone around here wants to fuck a guy with a giant dick until their insides have been completely rearranged. Which is fine! I just hope there's also a few people out there who would like to at least start things off a bit more tame and I'm certain we can work our way up to things like that!

Well I suppose I've been rambling long enough so I figure I'll do my best to keep from doing it anymore. I will add just one last thing if you'd like to use a celebrity as your character, or a rule 34 character, or even set something in a different time period or universe feel free! I'm open to exploring all kinds of things and love seeing what people come up with and where we can take it. Also also, I adore Pokemon and I'd enjoy some kind of role play set in that universe as well (I had some idea for some weird apocalypse type role play that we could add some kind of 'us against the world' kind of angle to for a more romantic thing I suppose) but really anything is fine! I hope to hear from some of you soon! I do have to leave soon but I'd love to get something set up, that and it'll help get me through work."

I really really started to like him but he works a lot, goes to school full time and on top of that has another internship type job. It had caused us to butt head a little bit about him not being able to hang out and really get to know each other and start something.

We kind of just ended it today. He said he wants me in his life as a friend until we can restart and be more than that, but for the time being he can't continue to try to be serious when he feels like he's disappointing me because he's so busy.

So my question is: am I being dramatic, and should I try to be friends and see if it goes somewhere, or should I just end it and try to get over him because I'm worth more than being friends and waiting around for someone. Please help. "

I am a sophomore in college and it is my dream to develop software for rockets. I want to start getting some experience now but I don't know where to start. My questions are:

Do you guys have to understand the physics of rockets and how they behave in space and Earth in order to create optimal software?

What language do you guys mostly write in? I would assume C++ but I have no clue. 

How did you first start getting into the space industry? 

Do you enjoy working as a SE for NASA? 
What experience did you have before landing a job at your company?

Sorry if that is too many questions but I really want to go into space exploration as a software engineer. I would like to start trying to gain  experience now so I could potentially land an internship and grow from there! Thanks in advance!

I currently am a senior planning on graduating in May, will be receiving a BS in ChemE and as well as a BS in mathematical sciences. 

I am scared about my lack of job prospects. I have not done an internship or a co-op. I have a solid gpa (3.8+) and have had some limited undergrad research at my school. 

I have not considered a co-op because scheduling classes for the math degree is hard to make the pieces fit together. 

What is your all's advice for what my best bet is? Keep applying and be hopeful? Or try to go to grad school next year? 

I will answer any questions if needed for helpful advice, thanks in advance "

I'm curious what others would do, but here's some info on me if you're curious: 

I'm going into my second wedding season with the business. Previously I managed a medium sized studio where I shot about 25 weddings/year and the studio as a whole shot about 200/year. So, although I'm not new to the industry my business itself is young.

In 2017 I grossed about $65k. In 2018 my goal is $80k and in 2019 I would like to bring in $100k (before taxes and expenses). For me this means shooting more and consistently shifting my pricing upwards. Right now I'm probably at the high end of mid-range in market. 

Some of my ideas: 

- Put money directly into Google Adwords, WeddingWire, or some other advertising (I'm already on The Knot and find it worthwhile)
- Hire an SEO/brand management/consulting company to direct website and brand growth, AdWords, whatever (I assume I would only be able to afford this on a smaller scale with that amount of money)
- Bring on a paid intern to help manage my social media, work with me on magazine and blog submissions, help with minor office tasks, maybe culling, being a sounding board to my ideas, etc. 
- Start working with a business coach
- Spend on education (this is low on the list as there are so many free options)
- Spend on gear, software or equipment (again low on the list because I don't feel I'm in need in those areas)

What would you do? "

People typically spend ~4 years getting a degree and it's pretty shitty to insult their achievements or be an elitist. It's even sillier imo because you're not some CS god graduating from MIT or Harvard with big 4 internships.

This subreddit is already a massive CS circlejerk and I don't want people in other programs to feel as if this subreddit is an unwelcoming environment for them.

As far as writing style if you prefer first or third let me know and we can go with whatever you're more comfortable with!

Now, onto the actual meat of this whole thing. What I'm looking for is just a fun and entertaining role play that starts off with two people probably awkwardly getting to know each other as it grows into a relationship. This could happen in a ton of different ways and depending on any particular pairing you might have in mind that could change how things can start or change drastically. I'm open to pretty much anything, but I prefer playing a somewhat awkward and goofy fellow who probably doesn't have much of any real experience with ladies. I think I've gotten pretty good at that kind of character, also it's definitely, totally, for sure not from my own awkward first hand experience. 

As for actual role plays I'm open to pretty much whatever honestly, though do keep in mind I heavily prefer playing the kind of character I stated before. I promise it's not always awkward, he tends to transition into just a sarcastic, teasing goofball fairly easily. Side note, I fucking love sass. If there is one thing I love more than boobies it's wit and sarcasm and someone that can put up with quips and other goofy things that tend to come from my characters. So I guess what I'm saying is I love a strong independent woman who don't really need no man but can't help but enjoy the company of this goon who won't stop trying to make her chuckle at inappropriate times.

For particular pairings though I'll list out a couple and bold the character I would enjoy playing;

- Teacher x **Student**

- Boss x **Intern**

- Journalist/Bandmate x **Rockstar**

- Best Friends

- Nearly anything incest related (I really just like the taboo and heavily prefer to play pairings as the younger of the two characters such as a mother x son or older sister x brother)

- Celebrity x **Childhood Friend** (Or enemy depending on how you'd like things to go, also could be a real or fake celebrity. Whatever you prefer!)

- Roommates / Neighbors

I do have a few ideas but I would love to hear what you have in mind for any pairing you might be interested in. I love brainstorming and throwing ideas around and coming up with fun little twists and turns and stuff. As far as the actual dirty stuff I'm fairly vanilla, which I suppose this prompt may have given away. I'm not opposed to anything save for snuff, gore, and scat so I suppose those are my limits. I've already kind of stated the things I like, pretty much anything like kissing, cuddling, teasing, all that kind of stuff is 100% up my alley although I know that seems like it's not around much when everyone around here wants to fuck a guy with a giant dick until their insides have been completely rearranged. Which is fine! I just hope there's also a few people out there who would like to at least start things off a bit more tame and I'm certain we can work our way up to things like that!

Well I suppose I've been rambling long enough so I figure I'll do my best to keep from doing it anymore. I will add just one last thing if you'd like to use a celebrity as your character, or a rule 34 character, or even set something in a different time period or universe feel free! I'm open to exploring all kinds of things and love seeing what people come up with and where we can take it. Also also, I adore Pokemon and I'd enjoy some kind of role play set in that universe as well (I had some idea for some weird apocalypse type role play that we could add some kind of 'us against the world' kind of angle to for a more romantic thing I suppose) but really anything is fine! I hope to hear from some of you soon!"
7v4bsf,4,2018-02-03,"Applied for one position at a company, received an offer for a different position thinking it was for the first position",dvyq62ndjc,AusLegal,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusLegal/comments/7v4bsf/applied_for_one_position_at_a_company_received_an/,"I'm currently a university student, and I'm required to complete some industry experience (i.e. internship) as part of my degree, meaning I have to go find a job that meets certain criteria set out by the university.

While searching for a suitable job, I came across a position (let's call it ""Position A"") that I quite liked. I read through the Position Description (PD) and it was perfect. I applied for it by emailing the hiring manager a copy of my resume and cover letter, had the interview, and received an offer a couple of weeks later. Yay!

Shortly after, received the contract from the company. I noticed that the contract had my position down as ""Position B"" instead of the ""Position A"" title that I had expected. This was the first red flag. ""Position A"" and ""Position B"" have very similar sounding names, so I just chalked it off as one being the ""official"" title. I'd mistakenly thought the two position titles were one and the same.

The second red flag was when the contract said that the person I would be reporting to, was different from the person listed in the PD. Again, I just chalked it off to there being a change in leadership in the department.

It wasn't until I actually started working and had my duties explained to me, where I realised something was wrong. The duties that my manager has expected of me were completely different to what I remember was written on the PD I used to apply.

Initially, I thought it was just a simple mix up with the role assignments, so I emailed the hiring manager and asked about it. The response I received was that ""candidates were put forward for multiple roles within the same role type"", meaning that I was deliberately assigned a role I didn't explicitly apply for.

Is this common? I've heard of people getting offered positions they didn't apply for, but they were usually told that they didn't get the original position they applied for, e.g. ""you don't have enough experience for this senior position, but we'd like to offer you a job for this junior position instead"". In my case, I was never told that I didn't get the position I applied for, so I just assumed that my offer was for ""Position A"". To me, it just sounds a bit like false advertising in that my duties and responsibilities don't match at all what was given in the PD. If I'd known that I would've gotten ""Position B"" over ""Position A"", I wouldn't have accepted the offer and just continued looking for another job.

I can't quit the job because I'm unlikely to be able to find another internship as most companies have already finished hiring. I've spoken to my university and ""Position B"" still meets the requirements for the industry experience so I can still use it, it's just I don't think I'll be able to enjoy it as much since I'll mostly be doing stuff I'm not really interested in.

Do I have any legal standing here, or is there really nothing I can do since I've already signed the contract? If I escalate this up to HR, are they be more likely to side with or against me?

TLDR: Needed to complete an internship as part of uni. Applied for a position, ended up being assigned to a completely different position within the company. Possible false advertising? Can't quit the job because I'm unlikely to be able to get another internship in time."
7v4cis,9,2018-02-03,Going to Jakarta for my internship soon and I have a few (maybe silly) questions.,Throw4w4y94,indonesia,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/7v4cis/going_to_jakarta_for_my_internship_soon_and_i/,"Hi guys! This is the first time I'm on this sub so I hope this is allowed. Also, sorry for the long ass post.


I'm a Dutch girl who is going to Jakarta soon for my internship. I have never been to Indonesia before so I am excited!  However, I have a few questions and I hope you don't mind answering them.


First things first, I know that Indonesia is a muslim country although I don't know how religious it actually is. The thing is, my parents are Turkish and muslim and naturally, I also was a muslim for many years. However, I left Islam officially a few months ago.


 Ok now the actual question: I really don't know if I should keep this fact away from people? Obviously I won't shout from the rooftops that I'm an ex muslim, but when someone asks, I'd actually want to tell the truth instead of hiding this fact  like I already am here in The Netherlands. I think it would be nice to just be myself for once, in a country far far away from everyone I know.


However, I don't want people to judge me or anything for this fact. I'm not saying that people will do that, and I feel like they wouldn't care and you guys will also tell me that, but just in case. If there is a possibility of judging, I'd rather keep it to myself. So do you think I should? I'm sorry if sound ignorant.


Also, what about clothing? Is it normal for people to walk around in shorts and tops? I don't want to wear it and then get stared at, I'm already kinda shy and awkward, don't want eyes on me haha. And I'd like to respect the culture and religion so I don't mind adapting. 


I think these are my weird questions for now, if I have more, would it be fine to ask? Thanks in advance!



Edit: thank you so much for all the answers! I read everything and it was really helpful. I guess I will have to think about what to say because some said pretend to be Christian or atheist or a muslim who is not practicing. Thank you again!

7v4jix,19,2018-02-03,The Mad Hatter Series - Who is the Red Queen? [a long post],DoormatDormouse,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7v4jix/the_mad_hatter_series_who_is_the_red_queen_a_long/,"Yay, my first flaired post! Thanks mods for flairing her even though she's not that bad compared to most moms here T_T &lt;3

So, I got a *lot* of comments on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7qkguo/how_to_bring_up_wedding_costs_to_a_jnmil_that_has/) asking the question in the title. I realize now that my [initial introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/67be97/a_rant_about_the_mad_hatters_mother_the_red_queen/) may not have been enough.

So here's a post about the second-worst woman in my family, my maternal grandmother. (The first worst was *her* mother, but I only knew her once she was in her 90s and had lost a lot of her evil due to feebleness)

---

The Red Queen is a short, round lady, but she's well-put together and reasonably well dressed. She wears light makeup, always coifs her hair (and jokes that hers looks better than Jay Leno's, who wears a weirdly similar style or at least he used to), and wears an appropriate amount of a sensible perfume. She has a sense of humor, understands social cues, and tells appropriate, interesting stories. She's actually interesting to talk to.

Really, on the surface, she's a totally normal grandmother. If you didn't know better, the questions she asks on facebook would seem harmless. ""Where's your internship?"" ""How's your mother?"" ""Glad things are going better. I love you""

But Red Queen is a goddamn iceberg. The surface means almost nothing. And no, this isn't just me being paranoid. Every question is asked with several intentions behind it. But that will turn into me venting about the dumb shit she's pulled recently, whereas I hate her mostly for past things and the recent ones just seal the deal.

When Red Queen's bitch mother died (the men in this family seem to die earlier than their wives--wonder why? hmmm) she insisted in her will that the kids could only sell the family farm if all 4 of them agreed. The 3 boys looked at the farm, agreed it wasn't worth it, and wanted to sell. Red Queen saw all the land and thought 'it'll be worth something someday!' and insisted they keep it. It's been such a money pit ever since that her oldest brother is barely afloat and can't afford to live anywhere *but* the farm. He's almost 80 and takes care of a goddamn functional farm alone. I'm honestly shocked.

Red Queen and my maternal grandfather divorced when Mad Hatter was small. His main comment was, ""I love you but I cannot live with you."" I think he was the one that initiated the divorce, but Red Queen might have because he was an alcoholic. I've heard mixed stories to be honest.

Red Queen got custody, and followed visitation agreements for a while. Then she got bored of being a single mom after about...4 years? So she dumped Red Queen and her brother at her own mother's. The mother that abused RQ and 2 of her 3 brothers so badly that they are mean and bitter and hateful and just miserable people. The third brother was an oops baby that was only 10 years older than Mad Hatter, and he was the GC. He's Mad Hatter's favorite uncle, and for good reason. He is genuinely nice.

Red Queen told her kids, ""Have fun with [their name for grandma], I'll be back soon.""

Unlike some moms on this sub, she did come back...**eight months later**. With a strange man and five other children.

""I'm back! And this is your new step-dad and your new siblings. By the way, we're moving. Pack your things.""

They moved in with the step-family immediately. Mad Hatter has lots of fond thoughts of her step-siblings to this day and does not understand why they don't include her in anything or talk to her anymore. They never really accepted her as part of the family, because Red Queen made sure they always knew they were all *step* family.

This stepdad was...okay. For a while. Then he started being an abusive fuckhead.

This man had a guard dog that hated all people. He abused it and caged it all day so it would be angry and mean.

Naturally, preteen Mad Hatter was afraid of it.

So what was Stepdad and Red Queen's reaction? Red Queen insisted that she get to know the dog. Stepdad's solution was to have Mad Hatter stick her hand into the dog cage and not take it out until she was over her fear of the dog.

She got bit a few times.

Aside from that, Mad Hatter and her brother got the belt regularly for things that weren't worth being beat.

Nowadays, if Mad Hatter talks about anything from that time that involves her abuse, she clearly parrots something she was told at the time from Red Queen. ""No, I can't talk about it. If I talk about it then it happened, so I mustn't talk about it."" The dog story is the only abuse story I know of, but I know he was worse.

She divorced this dickweed, claiming spousal abuse, then married at least once more. I'm fuzzy on if she married three times or four. When I was young she had a boyfriend who was close enough to the family that we visited his farm and got presents in the mail from him. He was my grandpa as far as I was concerned. I remember Red Queen telling me that she wanted to marry him. I asked him why he didn't marry her, and he said ""Because Red Queen wants my farm and I want to make sure it goes to [Son's name].""

So this was the first time I knew something was weird, because I didn't understand why almost-step-grandpa wouldn't want Red Queen to have something of his.

~~~

Red Queen never means a thing she says. There is always like 2 underlying meanings behind what she says. Texting her is exhausting. It's like the Mad Hatter but worse.

""Oh, I just don't know if I can get you any Christmas presents this year. I am on a fixed income with my pension, after all"" followed by ""But look at my photos from my mission trip to Egypt!"" or seeing the posts from my cousins with the gifts she got them. ""I just don't know if I can make it to your graduation--that's kind of a long drive."" vs ""Oh, I just flew back from [cousin]'s high school graduation out in [West Coast State]. I'm recovering from pneumonia and bronchitis but I just haaaad to be there for her!""

etc.

She's told me before that she makes friends with the forgotten folks at the old folks' home she volunteers at--the ones with no family or no visitors. How sweet, right? 

Except when she not-so-subtly implied to me that she does it hoping they'll leave her stuff in their will since she was nicer than their own children.

On Christmas she complains ""ohh woe is me I have to visit with people from the old folks' home and their families in order to *have a family again*. It's so nice to have a family to visit."" when all we want is for her to tell us if she's coming or not. To put in any kind of effort at all. She's stopped asking what we want for Christmas and just sends gift cards. The worst part is, we've done the same. So Mad Hatter is all up in arms about it because ""we're just exchanging money! There's no gifts involved anymore!!""

Red Queen's ""I never see you. We should do lunch or something next time I'm in the area"" is always followed a few months later by ""Oh, I was in [city 2 hrs away] for 6 weeks taking care of [Her One Actual Friend] cause she's in hospice. I'm back in [her state] now."", only to later be followed by ""Why do we never see each other? I'm your only grandmother...""

And this problem all stems back to when I was a toddler.

Red Queen was overbearing. She lives 4 hours away from my parents, which meant regular visits with her only-at-the-time grandchild. Eventually she started the classic JNMIL problem of 'you don't know how to parent, but I've been a parent so I know better'. I was a difficult baby--I cried almost constantly because I was fussy and anxious. Red Queen thought she could fix that, that Mad Hatter was bad at mom-ing somehow.

I'm hazy on the timeline, but after escalating bullshit, eventually my dad sent a 'stop being a piece of shit or else you're out of our lives' letter.

A normal response would have been to back off, reassess your behavior, apologize, and tentatively try again.

Red Queen's response was to go scorched earth. She fucking framed the letter and hung it in her entryway hall as a reminder of how much we hated her. She didn't contact us for at least a year. This was probably when we started visiting her house instead, which I was old enough to remember. I also remember vividly the last time I visited her house. I was 12. I've tried to visit her a few times since then, but she comes up with excuses.

It's been at least 20 years since that letter, and she still insists it's still hanging in her hallway. She still references it as if it still applies to today. That we still want her out of our lives. ""Well, I never know if I'm allowed to see Doormat because of that letter you sent..."" I was like...3 when that letter was sent. Red Queen believes that no one can ever change, so that letter is now and forever an exact representation of our feelings.

But unlike many JNMoms, she is perfectly capable of acting like a decent human being. She has actual friends, she does good things for others (even though I think she does them so other people think she's a good person), etc. But when she's in the area she doesn't let us know until she's home again, because 'well Mad Hatter clearly hates me, because I have this letter from her husband so I should just go away forever, right?' with the usual uncompromising black-and-white problem solving that is common in the Dormouse family. ""I can't do X? Well I guess I'll go fuck myself with a knife."" essentially.

But yeah. I hope this can clarify at least a little bit for who the Red Queen is and why I hate her. I'm forgetting a lot of instances because I only see her once a year now and I am actively choosing to not care about her anymore. My FGILs are more of grandparents than she is. My dead grandparents are more grandparents than she is, including the 2 I never met because they died when I was a toddler. Red Queen has not felt like a grandmother in years.

Mad Hatter isn't innocent in this either. She would drink too much every Christmas to get through the visits with her mother, and become belligerent and obnoxious. It hurt Red Queen to see her daughter drink so much--she claims she left Mad Hatter's father because he was a drunk--and it hurt Mad Hatter to be so unable to understand her mother that she would drink to pretend like everything was okay.

The first time I brought Mad Hatter and Dad to my future ILs for Christmas, it was the first actually *happy* Christmas they'd had since I could remember. There was no stress. No ""will Red Queen show up"", no ""will she call and ruin everything"", nothing.

And now I'm planning my wedding ((note: I talked with DF and we agreed to push it back to 2020; I'm 400% less stressed about it now)). If I do not invite the Red Queen, then Mad Hatter will suffer for it for the rest of Queen's life. And the women in this family seem to be preserved by spite, so I expect her to live another 20 years as is, more if I spite her like this. Mad Hatter deserves to have a few years of her life with the ability to get out from under her mother's judgmental shadow. But a plus side of wedding shit is that Red Queen will know no one there other than my parents. She acts like the perfect loving grandma in front of other people. So that's a saving grace. Crowds play into her need to look good.

...And I'm pretty sure my wedding will be the last time I probably ever see her, since she refuses to come for Christmas anymore. I have mixed feelings about this. If she would just make up her mind one way or the other on how to behave toward us I'd be fine. It's the flip-flopping, passive-aggressive bullshit that makes me sad.

**tl;dr** - Red Queen is my maternal grandmother and she sucks eggs"

It is with great interest that I submit my application. As a Senior at the University of San Antonio. I bring with me my writing, computer science, and mathematics experience, the capacity to lead change, and previous internship experience in software development, with technical skills in JavaScript. I am confident given my skillset a willingness to learn that I would be an asset to the team.
 
Reading through the job description, it struck me that in order to be effective; the employee would need to possess superb writing skills. In the past, I have worked part time a newspaper producer at my school. Which required the ability to be able to write in Spanish and English.
 
One of the most important qualities I take pride in is time management, a quality which was vital in turning in articles. A lot of the work I had done was under the supervision of numerous project managers that were pressed to meet certain deadlines. The stress and feedback they placed on staying ahead of schedule forced me to become more efficient and time conscious of the work I contributed to the overall project.
 
Finally, I believe that I would play an important role as an employee. I would be delighted to discuss my qualifications with you at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

7v5fu7,1,2018-02-04,My bf (27m) just broke up with me (23f) and I don’t know what to do,callmekitty247,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7v5fu7/my_bf_27m_just_broke_up_with_me_23f_and_i_dont/,"Fair warning this is going to be a fucking book so tyia for reading. 

So I’ve been dating this guy for the better part of two years. We broke up once last year for a month or so, and got back together the next time we saw each other. We’ve always had really good chemistry, amazing sex life, and generally a good relationship. We never got into fights, had the same friends, similar interests, etc. literally a great relationship all around. The only thing that we never ever would talk about is the bf/gf titles. 

For 95% of the relationship, I lived 3 hours away at school. He would visit me, and I would come home and see him pretty frequently. He’s not much of a texter, so we would talk a little during the week and then FaceTime Sunday nights. Everything was going SO WELL. 

This past fall was my last semester in college, I am completely done other than my internship that I’m currently on. In October/ November, I noticed that he was acting better, and taking more of an interest in our relationship. He tends to lean towards the out of sight out of mind mentality, which I get because his work is stressful. Anyways, he was talking more about our future together, and making a genuine effort and it was going so great. The light was at the end of the tunnel, we were finally going to live within 15 minutes of each other and it can be a real relationship. FINALLY. 

Well fuck me because I only got accepted to one internship, and it was the perfect one! The only downside is that it’s out of state. So instead of being 3 hours away driving, I’m now 10 hours away driving. The last time I saw him was in December, and that’s when I told him I would be gone for 5 months, but we talked about flying back and forth to see each other. I thought we were fine. When I moved home from college, he was back at his home so I wasn’t going to see him before moving to my internship. I noticed that we started talking less and less. I wouldn’t hear from him for days, I was always the one reaching out and texting him. Then we FaceTimed after I got settled here and he wouldn’t talk much, didn’t really have anything to say. 

I asked him when he wanted to come visit and his response was “I’m not traveling for awhile.” I lost it. I started asking why he wasn’t into it anymore and why he wasn’t talking to me or anything and his reasoning is because he’s not “boyfriend material”. He claims he always puts me in the back burner, and he can’t force himself to be in a relationship if that’s not what his brain wants. That was a couple weeks ago. 

I just talked to him again tonight to try and understand where he’s coming from because I am completely baffled. He said his heads just not in it, and he can’t force himself to be in a relationship. None of it is my fault and there’s nothing I can do to help him.  I’m struggling so hard because he is the first person I’ve ever been in a legitimate relationship with, and had legitimate feelings for. I’m so lost as to what to do, ESPECIALLY since I’m so far away and this has all happened over text. 

Part of me thinks he has season depression, but doesn’t know it? And that’s why he’s giving up on trying. When we stopped talking, it was around this same time last year. I want to literally do anything to not lose him. He means the world, and then some to me. I’ve never used the “L-word” to describe how I felt towards a man, but I think I feel that for him. What do I do?  "
7v5pzd,176,2018-02-04,The dividing line between friendship and romance,dirtyboy12345,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/7v5pzd/the_dividing_line_between_friendship_and_romance/,"My best friend Luke (fake name obviously) met spring semester of sophomore year of college in a required programming course for our major. While we knew each other in the sense that we knew each other's names, we weren't friends. There wasn't any animosity; we just didn't interact. I did think he was pretty attractive though but dismissed it.

The next semester we had many of the same courses. He and I became part of a good group of friends in our major that did work together and partied together. Luke and I wound up together a lot. He was on my level in the major - not a genius but not a dumbass, just a bit above average. We shared a similar background and we just clicked really well (we still do) and he was an all around good guy and a really good friend.

I worked out he was straight. He carried himself as straight and had had a girlfriend up until sometime over the summer before sophomore year. I watched the way he looked at people while we were out and about. He had eyes for the ladies. 

-side note: if you want to figure out if a guy is straight or not, see how he reacts to people in passing. Most guys don't think about who they check out if they don't know they are being watched; it's telling who catches their eye.

I committed the most cliché of clichés and developed a huge crush on him as time passed. I remember the first time I realized it and I thought I was stupid then. Reading into every text, conversation, look, or glance as a sign he might be interested. He met a girl, Erin, at a party spring semester junior year and they started to be fuck buddies. She finally gave him an ultimatum - let's date or I'm done. He chose to date her. I was conflicted. I was partly jealous because now I had to share and couldn't stupidly pine after him but mostly relieved because now I could really put the crush behind me; there was no chance anything could happen now. The next two years went by and everything was really good. I was over it and directed my romantic interests elsewhere.

Luke and I stayed at the same college we completed or undergrad to complete master's degrees. One of our friends, who was a year behind us, graduated the spring semester of our first year of grad school. In celebration, we went out drinking. We all got really drunk and ended the night back to our buddy's place; our places were pretty far from downtown so staying there made sense. We put our much drunker friend to bed. I went to the bathroom, chugged some water, undressed to my boxer-briefs and undershirt, and crashed on a mattress that my buddy had in the floor in the corner of his room. Luke went to the bathroom as well. (I've wondered why my buddy had a bed and then a random mattress in his room and I asked later but never got a clear answer as to why but I digress...)

I laid down on my side on the half closer to wall facing inward to the room. I could feel myself quickly slipping into sleep. I felt Luke return from the bathroom and lay down on the mattress. I was so tired that I didn't even think about it. Then he said ""come here"", grabbed my arm, and pulled me onto him into a snuggling position. It was very intimate. The instant shot of adrenaline coursing through my veins drove out any tiredness that I had been feeling.

All those feelings towards him that I thought were gone all came rushing back. I don't think that I had ever been so attracted to someone than I was in that moment. It wasn't lustful wanting but a deep passion for someone who I shared an already deep bond. I felt safe and warm as he held me close. The smell of his cologne and natural scent was intoxicating. My head was nuzzled in his chest and I could hear his heart beating. He intertwined our legs and was stroking my hair gently with his left hand and holding my left hand with his right - our fingers interlocked - his thumb slowly stroking my hand. I could feel the bare skin on his legs against my own; he’d undressed to just underwear and an undershirt. I was so happy but confused at the same time. 

Should I push this? I couldn't decide if this was platonic. If it were, he was sending some serious mixed signals. I don't see how that could not have been confusing. Maybe snuggles could have been platonic but all the other stuff made me doubt that. I repositioned my right arm behind his neck and settled in. I wanted him to know that I was ok with the intimacy too. My heart was still racing. I decided what I was going to do. It was now or never.

I moved my left hand and broke the clasp. I moved it up closer to his face and slowly stroked his cheek with my thumb. I slide up slightly so our faces were closer. I opened my eyes and I could see from the street lights filtering in through the blinds that his were already open looking at me with a mixture of sleepiness, contentment, and caring. We stared into each other's eyes. I have always thought his eyes were beautiful - aquamarine and seemingly always dilated pupils. I moved my face closer to his and I could feel his breath in my face. I kissed him gently on the lips. 

I heard him inhale sharply through his nose. He began to return the kiss. First gently, but it got deeper and deeper. We made out for what felt like hours. He was a really good kisser. We started grinding on each other trying to stay somewhat quiet since we weren't alone in the room. There was little between us – just our undergarments. I could feel his hard dick on my leg as we grinded against each other. I repositioned so that I was more on top of him and we kept grinding and making out. It kept going like this till his breathing became more ragged and I felt his dick begin to pulse; I knew that he came and that sent me over the edge. I slide back down so that I was half on him in a snuggling position. Now, I was tired again. I could hear Luke breathing like he’d just been running, but he slowly calmed and we both fell asleep.

Early in the morning, I woke to being spooned from behind. I adjusted slightly and could feel his semi-hard dick on my butt. I desperately needed to pee and I extricated myself from Luke. I looked over and our buddy was still sleeping on his bed lightly snoring.
Upon getting to the bathroom, I opened my boxer briefs to find my dick glued to the fabric with cum. Peeling my dick off the fabric, I quickly peed and took a paper towel from the linen closet, wetted it, and cleaned up the best I could. I’d have to deal with it later. I pulled my underwear back up and looked in the mirror. Luckily my underwear hid the cum stain fairly well unless you knew to look for it. I went back to the bed to find Luke still sleeping. I considered whether I should just leave; maybe it would be better if Luke didn’t wake next to me. I dismissed it though; I didn’t regret what had happened, so I reinserted myself and went back to sleep. 

A few hours later, I woke and he wasn’t in the bed anymore. I looked over and our buddy was still sleeping. I dressed in case he woke. I didn’t see Luke’s clothes from the night before. I went to look for him. He was nowhere to be found. 

I went back to the room to collect my wallet, keys, and phone. I saw the blinking message light on my phone. There was a message from Luke:  “Had to leave. Erin will be here later today. Need to get ready.” I then felt guilty. Erin. In all that happened, I never once thought about how what Luke and I did would affect her. We didn’t have sex, but I would consider what happened to be cheating. I wanted to talk to Luke; the semester was over and we had a few days left before he and I were supposed to head out of town to go to internships for the summer. I knew Erin would around for a while, but I hoped that I could find a time where we could talk privately.

I sent him a message back: “Np. Let me know if you need help packing up before you head out.” I looked at the bed to make sure there was nothing questionable for our buddy to find. I tried to wake him to say goodbye but he wouldn’t rouse; I sent him a simple text saying: “thanks for letting me crash. Let me know if you want to get food later when you wake up.” I departed for home.

Firstly, thank you so much to everyone on this subreddit, I've been lurking for a few months.

I'm currently an intern at an ISP and have been studying for around 4 months, covering a chapter a week. The stuff I do at work definitely helped me along the way. Generally, the test was fairly easy. Cisco will word the questions really weirdly to try to throw you off. A few questions were, in my opinion, beyond the scope of ICND1.

The resources I used were: Lammles's book, CBTNuggets, and most importantly Boson's practice exams. I can't stress how good they are, I'd say they're about the same level of difficulty as the exam itself. Yes, the price is rather steep but they're invaluable. 
I didn't use Odom's book as I found it a little dry. I did, however, use the practice questions that came with the CD in the book. I also regularly did the review questions in Lammle's book. 

Personally, I'd recommend starting off with CBTNuggets. Jeremy Cioara's enthusiasm is contagious. Unfortunately, the videos don't go deep enough and won't be enough to pass the exam. Try and combine resources where possible and remember to do practice questions, practice questions, practice questions.

Now onto ICND2!

7v77wk,1,2018-02-04,Website SEO Check-Ups,scoutingboard,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/7v77wk/website_seo_checkups/,"We deal with over 200 brands, but are not an SEO company, but have a lot of expertise with it. We had an intern go through all of the brands we work with and check their website using an SEO checklist that we made internally by two of our SEO experts, and found that about 9 of 10 sites had major SEO issues.

We sent out an email with our checklist included, and got an amazing response. This is not part of our core business, so it was just an extra effort we made to help out our brands. We found that most brands set up their website years ago and didn't do nearly enough analysis on how to get their site noticed.

SEO checklists are easy to find on Google. If you market a brand, you should take the time to find one that has been published in the last year. You can filter your Google search by date, so don't use an old checklist.  After speaking with a lot of the brands, here are some additional notes:

1. Most brands don't have a master keyword or phrase that they have targeted to do well when people search on Google.
2. For brands that produce posts about their brand to help bring in traffic, the posts are most often too short and don't target any keyword or phrase.
3. Very few sites think about site structure and how their menus / categories / directories, etc. are configured.
4. Sites that weren't on a platform like WordPress or similar are more often than not not showing up well on mobile and other devices. Also, a lot of WP sites use old themes that don't work well on mobile devices.
5. A lot of brands post on social media platforms such as Twitter and FB, but they don't engage with friends and followers very often.
6. Only a handful of the over 200 brands engaged in any backlink plan. 

Again, there are many excellent free SEO checklists that you can find for your site, with a new year, it is a good idea to do a full website and social media checkup!"

So basically for my last semester of school, I chose to do an internship. I managed to get my my internship at a really good studio and they even are looking to hire after. 70% of people working there were interns (and 90% of those from my school). So that was something good to attain while severely depressed.

Unfortunately my depression is getting worse but I've been trying to overcome it for once. Anyways, I had an appt with my pdoc and he asked my how my internship was coming along cause he heard I got a good one and I said it's going well. Only issue is I have to wake up at 5am and I get home (not even sleep) at 7:30pm because it's a 2 hour commute and I need to leave extra early because transit is unreliable.

(Oh, how I wished I was privileged enough as my fellow interns to have Mom and Dad pay for a car and my insurance.)

His face just went surprised and he reluctantly was like ""Uhhh, that's not really good for a mood disorder"" but didn't argue and dropped it 'cause he knew he couldn't really do much about it.

Thing is, I absolutely know and agree. For a while now I've agreed but I also am trying to look on the bright side that it's at least getting me into a routine of prepping food and being responsible. But I can't change where I live and this would be an excellent opportunity for me. Plus I need it to graduate my 4-year program that I'm on my 5th year right now.

Not blaming him or anything, just found it funny like, ""lol I know but what can you do?"" Haha.

Anyone else have a similar situation where their employment, or means to survive/succeed is basically unhealthy due to stress or amount of sleep. But you know, you can't really do anything about it? I'm sure I'm not the only one."

I hope you can help me with some problems that I am facing right now. 

But lets start at the beginning.

I am currently in an internship at a very nice company and they want me to penetrate a Firewall from the Company Sophos. This is for my last semester project. 
I set up vulnerable host machines that are connected to the firewall through LAN and WLAN. I started with internal tests with an established foothold in the Network, but I am now supposed to attack through WAN. 
Now I am a little lost, because I only learned my ""skills"" inside of networks. My goal is to attack the firewall with anything I can and incrementally increase the security until I either cant continue or get through the highest security. 
The Firewall WAN connection ist completely unprotected with no NAT so the public IP that I of course have is the IP of the firewall. 

So my questions are:
1. Is there a way I can scan and attack the hosts through the Firewall by routing my traffic somehow? If I know the public IP of the Firewall and the internal IP of the host?
2. Are there any other forms of attack that I can do that have a high form of success?

I am allowed to use Social engineering exploits and so on because the Project is not about how an end user protects their devices, but how good the firewall protects the devices. 

I already got through the lowest security with a kali multi/handler payload. But that probably wont work with increased security. 

I dont want to dissapoint them.

About me. I am studying an IT Network degree and used Kali to some extend, am okay with Python if needed and know most of what there is to know about IT networks. 

If you need more info or if this is to much to ask, let me know. Also I am not a native english speaker, so sorry for bad grammar and language in general :D

Thanks in advance"

""Good afternoon, I today I would like to respond to the allegations that I committed executive overreach during my last tenure as Governor. During that time I released 4 Executive Orders, all of which I felt were pertinent to our Commonwealth. In this speech I would like to explain my rationale for these orders, and why I believe I was perfectly within my means to enact them.""

""My first Executive Order, [Executive Order 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelNortheastState/comments/43ydhx/executive_order_11dedication_order/), dedicated the Northeastern State Route 907C, otherwise known as the Shore Parkway to Former Governor Sviridovt. I considered Governor Sviridovt a close friend, and him selecting me as Lieutenant Governor gave me my first chance to serve in an executive capacity. Previously, Governor Sviridovt dedicated an Executive Building after the first Governor of the Commonwealth ben1204, and I had hoped to simply start a tradition of naming buildings, highways, or parks after previous Governors, however I  will admit I was naive on this front.""

""My next order was [Executive Order 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelNortheastState/comments/443e0f/executive_order_12_a_day_of_remembrance/), or a day of remembrance of President Lydon B. Johnson. This order was based on one written by Governor Romney to remember President Reagan, not only that but it is  nearly identical in wording. President Johnson is someone who I admire greatly. From his accomplishments on Civil Rights to his vision of a Great Society, his leadership was an inspiration to all and why I wrote this Executive Order. Additionally, the main intention of this order was to give our executive branch workers a much needed break, alongside with recognizing a great President.""

""The Minority Advisory Commission, or [Executive Order 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelNortheastState/comments/448aqc/executive_order_13_minority_advisory_commission/), was one I thought would help in identifying minority needs that otherwise may go unnoticed.  This commission was established to advise the Governor on matters related to the concerns of minority communities, with the Commission authorized to make recommendations of paramount concerns, educating citizens, and expanding and strengthening cultural ties. I am most proud of this Executive Order because of all it does for our minority communities. As a minority, I have sometimes felt that my views were underrepresented, and for that reason is why I wrote this Order.""

""My final order, or the [Gun Crimes Task Force](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelNortheastState/comments/44dpim/executive_order_14/), established a Joint Task Force to prosecute gun crimes that was led by the Attorney General. The Task Force was comprised of state and local law enforcement and prosecutors, the Atlantic Commonwealth Police, along with federal partners. It was mainly issued to authorize the Attorney General to coordinate Criminal cases against firearms law offenders. It would also trace guns that were used in violent gun crimes, and banned firearms in executive branch agency buildings, unless worn by Law Enforcement.""

""My intention was to ensure that any criminal using a firearm in a violent crime would be caught. My coordination with law enforcement ensured that everyone was on the same page, and that everyone understood my intention with this order. Not only that, but establishing norms that nearly every other state has. I will not apologize for making this Task Force, and it did not go after Law Abiding citizens. I am strongly in favor of our Second Amendment, however I am sure everyone will agree violent criminals should not have firearms.""

""I hope this explanation helps understand my thinking in drafting these Executive Orders. I had no malicious intent, and only wanted to help our citizens. All of my Executive Orders were based on well researched topics and were loosely based previously established one. The reason for the fast timeline was to ensure my vision would be properly carried out. As some may know, my appointment was to cover for Governor /u/sviridovt after his appointment to the House of Representatives. Although it was a short time, I am grateful to have been able to serve and implement these Executive Orders. I hope that my next tenure as Governor will be for a full term, and that I could fully implement my vision for the Commonwealth.Thank you for listening,  I hope everyone has a wonderful day, and make sure to VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS TOMORROW!

7v8u6w,83,2018-02-04,Maybe a summer apart will do us good,dirtyboy12345,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/7v8u6w/maybe_a_summer_apart_will_do_us_good/,"This is the continuation of the previous story linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/7v5pzd/the_dividing_line_between_friendship_and_romance/).

As I left from my buddy’s place, I checked the timetables for the buses on my phone. Of course, the next bus wouldn’t be coming for another half hour. It was only a 20 minute walk back to my townhouse and a nice May day so I decided to walk home. I always hated how the town seemingly emptied out the day after the semester ended. The sleepy college town I had been calling home for the last 5 years was mostly the college, so when students weren’t around, it was empty.

The walking was good for me. Give me some time to clear my head. I had gotten what I wanted all those years ago, so was I happy about it? I think ambivalence would best describe how I felt in that moment. On one hand, I got the sexual release that wanted, but at what cost? In our 4 year friendship, we had never come close to what had happened then night before. I wasn’t sure how a make out and grinding session would change things.  Above all else, I didn’t want to lose his friendship; I relied a lot on it. I knew more about him than anyone else in my life and I told him things that I’ve never told anyone else either. 

And Erin. Fuck me, how that complicated things. While she and I were “friends”, our relationship was pretty superficial meaning if Luke and her were to break up, we probably would cease to interact. I liked her well enough and I think she liked me too, so I felt especially shitty. She could be difficult at times, like really difficult, but she didn’t deserve to be cheated on. I wasn’t going to pretend like it was her fault that Luke returned my advances. He clearly wanted to; I didn’t force him to do anything. 

I neared home and I could hear the TV through the open windows. Someone was home. I walked in through the door and my roommate was cooking at stove. He turned to look at me and smiled.

“You look like hell. I take it y’all had a good night then? You didn’t come back.”

“Fuck off, but yeah it was a good time. Luke, Peter (he’s the guy I’ve been referring to as ‘our buddy’), and I had a good time downtown.”

“Sorry I couldn’t meet up with y’all. Anything interesting happen?”

What a loaded question that was. If he only knew what had happened between Luke and me.

“It was pretty standard. Peter got super drunk like he always does and we basically had to carry him back.”

“Sounds like Peter. If you want some lunch I making some pasta with some ground beef I added. It’ll be done in a few minutes. I’m trying to clean out my stuff from the fridge before I leave town.”

“Thanks. I’ll take you up on that, but first I’m going to take a shower and wash the bar and hangover off.”

With that, I went upstairs. If you’ve not experienced walking around for an hour with cum encrusted underwear and groin, it’s unsurprisingly uncomfortable. I stripped down in my room, grabbed a clean towel, and hit the shower. I washed up. The dried cum was hard to clean off. I don’t keep my groin shaved bare – too much hair – so my pubes were really matted. The cleanup I had done earlier wasn’t all that helpful. I finished up and changed into short and a t-shirt and headed back downstairs to eat some of that pasta. I began talking to him about what he schedule was for the next few days.

“When are you leaving?”

“Tomorrow morning sometime. I need to get to Nashville tomorrow by 2pm before the leasing office of this apartment complex closes at 4pm. I want to give myself some buffer.”

“Oh that shouldn’t be too bad.  It’s only like four hour to Nashville from here, right?”

“No, it’s like six, so I’m going to pack up my car tonight.”

Perfect I thought, I will have the place to myself most of tomorrow. Maybe I’ll be able to talk to Luke alone before we both head out of town.

I spent the rest of the day packing my clothes and gathering what things I’d need to take with me. Luckily, where I was going that summer was only three hours away from where I went to school. I periodically checked my phone, but I didn’t hear from Luke the rest of the day. I wasn’t uncommon for us not to talk for a few day; we weren’t that codependent, but this time around, it made me antsy. I talked to my roommate about dinner and he told me that he had asked Luke if he and Erin wanted to join us somewhere for dinner. However, Luke said they wanted some alone time since he would be so far away from Erin that summer. His internship was in San Diego. Hence my concern to talk to him before we went our separate ways. The remainder of the day passed and still no Luke.

The next morning I saw my roommate off and wished him safe travels to Nashville. I had done most of my packing the day before so I went for a run. I returned from my run to a message from Luke. My heart skipped a beat.

“Hey, do you still have my black tie? I thought you gave it back, but I can’t find it.”

I looked in the closet and sure enough, I had it over the hanger with my suit; I’d borrowed the tie for an interview a few months back and forgotten to return it.

“Yup. Still got it. I can bring it by. When do you leave?”

“I’ll just come by on my way out of town. Like 2pm. That work?”

“Yeah, see you at 2.”

I packed my car in preparation for leaving the next day. I looked at the clock – 1pm – enough time to eat and shower before Luke showed up.  After showering, I was staring at what little clothes I had left in my closet. Why was I agonizing over what to wear? I wanted to look casual, but not disheveled. I finally settled on khaki shorts and a college themed graphic shirt. I grabbed the tie and went downstairs to wait. It wasn’t too long till I heard a knocking at the door. I opened it to see Luke standing there. His face was inscrutable, but damn, did he looked good.

He came in. I picked up the tie and then he began to speak.

“I was wondering where that tie went. I thought I had lost it or something. I’m glad I remembered that you borrowed it.”

“Yeah sorry for not returning it sooner.”

“Don’t worry about it.”

We both knew that coming over for the tie was a pretense. After a pause, Luke began to talk.

“Listen, what happened the other night shouldn’t have happened. I don’t know what came over me. I’ve never done anything like that before. I feel like shit, dude. I never expected that I would cheat on Erin with you of all people. You’re my best friend. I don’t know what we were thinking.”

I knew what I was thinking because I had it bad for him and being given that opportunity, I didn’t want to pass it up.  However, right then was probably wasn’t the best time to tell Luke that my feelings towards him weren’t 100% platonic.

“Luke, I know how you feel. I feel terrible when it comes to Erin. She doesn’t deserve to be stepped out on. I’m sorry that I let things get so out of hand; I’m guilty of letting it happen too, but I want you to know that this doesn’t have to change anything about our friendship. It was a onetime thing and we can just put it behind us.”

“Maybe I guess. I mean we made out like really went at it. It wasn’t some little drunk peck on the cheek. My tongue was in your mouth. And I fucking jizzed myself grinding against you. I had a huge dried load in my underwear. I don’t see how that’s not going to change our friendship.”

This was going poorly. Clearly he was still very mixed emotionally. To be fair, I didn’t exactly know what it meant to our friendship either, but I just knew that I didn’t want to let this be the thing that ended our friendship. He continued to speak.

“I don’t know how to handle this. I’m not sure why I even came. I thought maybe if we saw each other face-to-face… I just don’t know. Fuck dude, I just need to go. I got to get back to my parents’ house. I have an early flight out to San Diego tomorrow.”

“Luke…”

He grabbed me by the shoulders and looked me in the eyes.

“I have to go. I can’t be here anymore. Maybe a summer apart will do us good. We’ll talk.”

“Luke…”

With that he rounded on his heels and left. Leaving me standing there in a state of shock. I stood there just staring at the door. I don’t know what I was hoping for – for him to come back through the door or that I would wake up and it would before this all happened. I stood there holding his black tie in my hands.

I've [F18] been crushing on someone [M19] for the past 7,5 years. For the first few years, I assumed it was just some crush. I was still really, really young and had other things on my mind at the time. I got as far in getting over him, that I was crushing on other people and not necessarily thinking of him until we started hanging out allot more again. This was around year 3 in the crushing-timeline.

It was great. He is great, but for some reason, I was terrified to make a move. I don't know why (maybe because I have no idea if he is actually interested in me or if I'm just a coward and afraid of rejection) but I just never did. He got really busy and we never saw each other at school anymore so our friendship kind of faded out. This was at year 5 in the crushing-timeline.

The following 2 years were busy school-work wise and apart from the occasional lunch together, maybe a gym class and him sending me star wars memes here and there our contact was minimal, which did not change anything about the fact that I was still crushing on him hardcore. 
(At this point can you still call it ""crushing"" or should I just label myself as ""obsessively infatuated""?)

Fast-forward to summer last year. We finished high school. I went straight off to Uni, while he was finishing up an internship. 
During the summer I met a girl, we hit it off and started dating. It didn't work out though because a) I kept comparing her to HIM (which is kinda psycho and completely unfair to her) and b) because we had some irreconcilable differences. So that was my first attempt at a relationship and a total bust.

Recently we've (him&amp;I) been texting again and have tried to meet up on a few occasions, which is kinda difficult if not properly planned, as I am studying in the next town over.

I would really appreciate some advice at this point because this whole thing is still confusing the hell out of me. I know my relationships are being affected by this ""crush"" (e.g. even if I try hard not to I will eventually compare him/her to HIM), I regularly dream about him and he is on my mind for a large part of the day. Whenever I talk to someone about him IRL all I ever get is ""just get over him"". Which is not helpful at all (see: the last 7,5 years).

The next logical thing would probably be: just tell him (that you are obsessively infatuated with him. but preferably in other words). But how do I do that if everytime I try I am suddenly mute? And is that even a good idea?

So @ the lovely Reddit community: please help.

TL;DR My [F18] crush [M19] of 7,5 years is affecting current relationships. Do I tell him? If so: how do I do that? If not: how do I get over him?"

Now he wants to meet up [x-posted from r/advice]",throwaway_against,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7v9fgz/f_early_20s_former_m_30s_mentor_kicked_me_out_of/,"So, I'm going to make this as vague as I can and still get the gist across, because it's a pretty unique set of circumstances and I don't want to attach identifiers. Throwaway, obviously.

I first met...let's call him Alex... the summer before my final year of college, when I was on a work placement in his office. He works in an office that's dominated by women, and in an industry that is increasingly so. We stayed in touch after my internship for more than a year, and I graduated and I went to work in my hometown. He was there for me when I had a terrifying experience being stalked by a former client, and suggested that I move to his city and try to break into work in the same industry there. I trusted him, we were close, and there'd never been a hint of anything improper. I wanted badly to get out of the city I was in and keep my whereabouts unknown to my stalker, and his city is definitely a great place to break into our industry. He said I could stay on his couch for a little while while I got my feet under me.

When I arrived, things got weird fast. Alex advocated on my behalf while I looked for work, and eventually told me that he had feelings for me. When I respectfully rebuffed him -- saying that it wouldn't be appropriate for us to have a relationship while I was dependent on him for housing and without an income of my own, he said that he just wanted to support me, but slowly grew hard and mean and then stopped speaking to me at all-- he'd come home from work and immediately close his door. We eventually got into a fight, and he kicked me out of the apartment, into a strange city. I didn't have much money or any friends there. I called a friend from college, sobbing, and her friend-- a total stranger, and an angel-- came and picked me up. I got very lucky that day. I stayed with the friend's friend and eventually found a cheap apartment and restaurant work before landing my current job.

Alex and I never had any kind of a romantic relationship. He's older than me and important in our field, which is somewhat public-facing and has been one of the areas affected by the #metoo movement. I got a foothold here on my own and am doing very well for myself, but we know enough of the same people that I have run into him at a party more than once (we didn't acknowledge the other's presence). A few days ago, almost perfectly on the anniversary of the fight and subsequent expulsion, I got a text message, saying that he's sorry for the way things happened, he'd be happy to meet up, but he understands if I don't want to.

I am torn. On one hand, he behaved like an ass, and I am pretty certain that he wants to smooth things over to protect his reputation as I am in this industry, moving up, and not going away, and kicking a vulnerable young woman out of your house because you're mad she doesn't want to sleep with you is a bad look. On the other hand, I'm going to keep running into him whether I want to or not, and pragmatically, it seems like it could be something more easily handled head-on to prevent drama.

Reddit, what should I do? I haven't responded to the text yet.

tl;dr-- former mentor kicked me out of his house a year ago because I wasn't romantically interested; now wants to have coffee. [edited for formatting]

Are the programs rigorous? Specifically Electrical Engineering? I’m also interested in Mechanical, Civil, and Computer Engineering but was accepted to EE. I’m graduating in the top 6-7% of my high school and was hoping GMU would present a challenge but not be unnecessarily difficult.

How is the school regarded among employers? If I graduate with a decent gpa, join some engineering clubs, and do a couple internships will I be able to easily find a job upon graduation? I know you guys can’t tell the future but was hoping you could give me some information about job prospects. 

Also if you guys can give me any tips about things to do while in school or things that you wish you had done I’d highly appreciate it.

Thanks

Most of our relationship has been long distance except for those first couple of months, and now we're looking at closing the distance this week. He's planning to drive over from Ohio and then stay with me for about a month until he finalizes his own job/housing situation.

After 6 months of long distance, I'm so excited to see him more than every few weeks and be able to cuddle with him all the time. But I'm also very nervous about transitioning our relationship from long distance to living in the same (tiny) apartment. Is this normal?"

I'm looking for a job now as a Front End Junior Developer but it's quiet hard. All they want is Senior Developer. No jobs here in Switzerland as Junior. And it's quiet depressing when you hear, how fast people get jobs but it's not the case. I only got invited once, it went great, but then he says they want to take someone else and it's was an internship, not even a job or so!

What should I do? How long were you looking for a job? How much applications did you send?

How can I [24F] break this cycle and start to rely more on myself?,chickennuggetbutts,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7var1y/depression_and_relationship_codependence_how_can/,"I feel tired, sad, and almost hopeless lately. I would never commit suicide, or harm myself, but this constant sadness and mood swings are really weighing on me. I cried most of the day today (for no good reason) and this really isn't like me... but I just feel so stressed lately. 

I rely on my partner a lot, but I feel he's getting tired and is starting to shut me out (which I understand, being in a relationship with someone who has mental illness can be exhausting). I'm in grad school, working 40-50 hours a week between my internship and job. I don't know what's going on, but I'm struggling. I'm so scared about having to find a job when I graduate. I feel like I'm becoming unhealthy co-dependent on my partner, since most of my family is in a different state. He has been patient with me, but I rely on him for reassurance a lot, especially when I'm alone. 

Part of the reason is because we don't get to spend much time together. We both have night classes and work a lot. When we have free time together, we end up doing homework. I realize relying on this guy is soooo unhealthy. Does anyone have any coping strategies they are willing to share? "
7vavjb,2,2018-02-04,"Planning a vacation with my [20/F] boyfriend [21/M], tension over budget",emzz1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7vavjb/planning_a_vacation_with_my_20f_boyfriend_21m/,"Okay, so this is my first time posting anything on r/Relationships, so here goes. My bf and I have always talked about wanting to travel, do things like roadtrips, and visit other countries, ever since a few months into our relationship (we've been together for about a year and a half now). About a month ago or so, he brought up the idea of traveling out of the country, as this is his last year in school and he wants to be able to leave the US before he goes into the workforce. 

I was very excited about this, because to me, it seems like a big investment to want to travel with someone to a foreign place miles away from home, especially to my boyfriend, who has never traveled anywhere outside of the US before, and I was honored and incredibly happy that he would want to go with me. However, there is a big discrepancy in the way we want to plan this vacation, due to the difference in our available budgets. He, being a senior in college, has had paid internships the last two summers, and has built up a savings of over $10k. I have not had such luck, with just a part time job both during the summer and now during school, but with other expenses I have had, barely have $1k in my savings. 

I mentioned this when we first started planning, and he didn't really say anything, other than the fact that he wanted to split the cost of vacation evenly. I figured that, since he wanted us both to pay the same amount of money for the vacation, that any budgetary decisions would be mostly on my end, as my budget should be the limiting factor here (obviously, I can't pay anymore than I can afford). 

However, today, when we were talking about places we wanted to visit, I brought up the money thing again. I told him that I was happy to go wherever he wanted to go, given that I could afford it. To me, it seemed that somewhere like Norway or Croatia was probably out of the question. However I know there are certain places in Europe you can travel for cheap, especially if you buy the plane tickets in advance and do some searching, and don't eat out every night. 

However, he got really upset today, because to him I think I made him feel like it wasn't ""his"" vacation anymore. We came up with lists of countries we wanted to visit, and we decided that we were going to try and narrow down the countries we were going to visit. I told him that the budget was going to be one of my concerns, and he seemed to lose all interest in the vacation at that point. A few more minutes of arguing/trying to convince him that I would take his wants into consideration, but if I couldn't pay for it I wouldn't be able to go, or he would have to contribute a couple hundred dollars, he got very upset, and just straight up ignored me and left the apartment. 

What do I do? He gets mad often but then quickly gets over things, but tends to hold grudges/negative ideas in his head, especially if things aren't going perfectly to his plans. How can I explain to him that I really do want to vacation with him, but we might not be able to go anywhere he wants to/do everything he wants due to money, without ruining this whole vacation? Should we even still try to go? Should I tell him to go by himself or with friends? I need some advice, I feel bad, like I'm holding him back, but I literally cannot go if it's too expensive. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have much less money than my BF, and my monetary limitations combined with him wanting us to split vacation costs 50/50 are causing quite a bit of tension and fighting between us. What do. "

7vb142,0,2018-02-04,Questions about a quick sub taper to get off dope.,horrorfannj,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7vb142/questions_about_a_quick_sub_taper_to_get_off_dope/,"So I've been using daily about a bundle of dope for almost a year, with a few weeks within the year taking sub to try and quit. 

I have a little more than a 8mg strip so probably about 12 mg total.

1) what's the best way to go about a taper? I want to do it in the shortest time possible to make it as easy and painless as I can. 

2) after tapering, if I do it right, will I really have any physical symptoms ? In the past I've had minor aches and low energy but the worst was the cravings.

3) what would (in your opinions) be the worst thing I'll have to deal with? I know the depression and lethargy will be the main culprit but I'm mainly concerned about physical stuff. 

4) if I do the taper right, am I going to have to deal with RLS or can that be avoided? That's my biggest concern because I honestly cannot stand the restless legs. My girl hates it as well and she thinks I'm already through the process so I don't want to be kicking her at night and tossing and turning ... I'm not worried about not being able to sleep really.

5) if I do have some minor aches, what can I do to alleviate them? Just Tylenol and such? 

6) is there anything to help combat RLS if I'm stricken with it once I'm off the sub? I just really fucking hate it. 

7) after I'm through with the taper and all I need to function and do stuff. I have school and an internship and I need to be able to function well at these things. I can't take time off or anything so I want to make sure I'm alright. 

8) I don't WANT to do this but if I end up having a bad day for RLS or something would using a small amount of dope to alleviate it put me back to day one and make me have to withdrawal for a week and start the process over ? Like I said I do not want to do this but hypothetically if I used one day would it fuck everything up in the physical standpoint ?

9) how long til I start feeling ""normal""? Last time I tapered was at a rehab and I did a 10 day taper but I started at 16mg and went down to 2mg on the last day of it and i didn't really have any physical symptoms, it was more just a lack of energy and the mental stuff like depression and anxiety. 

Sorry about all the questions but I just wanna do this right and I don't have the option of going to rehab or taking a few weeks off to get myself back to normal.

TL;DR- I need to taper with sub and I want to do it in the shortest amount of time possible. If I do a taper over a week or so, will I be able to function as a person and do all of the stuff I have to do without feeling too uncomfortable? The mental stuff is fine I can deal with that. I just don't want to be physically sick because that makes it really hard. Also, will I face any RLS if I do it correctly and if so what can I do to manage that? 

I just want to taper off of the sub and get back to normal. I'm ready to be done. "

7vbegn,1,2018-02-04,Attending NSLC vs. Other Options?,nite1133,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/7vbegn/attending_nslc_vs_other_options/,"Alright, so some of this is a bit complicated, but I could really use some direction on this.

Recently, I got an NSLC invitation in the mail, as I’m sure many of you did. I had selected a mostly STEM and some Arts stuff on my College Board application thing a while back, so I got the Engineering packet, and the Game Design course listed seem really interesting, since I’ve taken a couple summer camps for it in the past, but want to learn more. The packet also made it seem like it covered quite a bit, and had some good opportunities to learn more about the industry and college life.

However, last summer, I attended a game design course at a computer science camp, which was instructed by an owner of a local game/interactive-computer-stuff studio. I already kind of knew the software we were using (Unity), and I had been programming in JS for about 4 years at that point, so it was pretty easy to get a grip on the new language (C#). Because of this, I got quite a bit further than the other students (not trying to brag, it was just more of a beginner course than I had thought when I signed up), and the instructor offered me an internship-type of thing at his company that summer or the next, though I had to decline that summer because there was little time left before school started, and I had other prior commitments.

So I’m trying to decide about weather to attend the course at NSLC, or do the internship. I’ve been reading around online, and the NSLC seems, to me, to just be a glorified summer camp? I’ve also heard that attending it doesn’t really improve the odds of you getting accepted more than any extra-curricular, and that getting the college credit requires a lot more money. To anyone who has attended this before, is it worth it? 
Getting an actual internship in this field seems, to me, like a much more valuable experience than attending NSLC, especially since I could get actual connections and business opportunities out of it. By the way, I also have a couple other offers for summer internships, but this one seems the most interesting to me, so if it doesn’t work out, there are several others I could try.

Am I wrong about NSLC? What do y’all think is more beneficial for me to do with my summer? Any experience or recommendations you have would be much appreciated.

7vc9ta,1,2018-02-04,[M4F] Hopeless romantic goofball seeking literate partner for sickeningly sweet role play,PicklesTheRealtor,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7vc9ta/m4f_hopeless_romantic_goofball_seeking_literate/,"**Everything here is 18+**


So, I'll get this out of the way quickly, I'm really just looking for some folks who write well and can provide additional fun things to keep the role play going along. If you can do that in a couple of paragraphs, perfect, short and sweet is always fun and usually makes things go faster. If you'd like to write 6+ that's also fine, I adore details and it gives more insight into the character's actions and thoughts. What I'm trying to say here is I'm fine with whatever! As far as writing style if you prefer first or third let me know and we can go with whatever you're more comfortable with!

Now, onto the actual meat of this whole thing. What I'm looking for is just a fun and entertaining role play that starts off with two people probably awkwardly getting to know each other as it grows into a relationship. This could happen in a ton of different ways and depending on any particular pairing you might have in mind that could change how things can start or change drastically. I'm open to pretty much anything, but I prefer playing a somewhat awkward and goofy fellow who probably doesn't have much of any real experience with ladies. I think I've gotten pretty good at that kind of character, also it's definitely, totally, for sure not from my own awkward first hand experience. 

As for actual role plays I'm open to pretty much whatever honestly, though do keep in mind I heavily prefer playing the kind of character I stated before. I promise it's not always awkward, he tends to transition into just a sarcastic, teasing goofball fairly easily. Side note, I fucking love sass. If there is one thing I love more than boobies it's wit and sarcasm and someone that can put up with quips and other goofy things that tend to come from my characters. So I guess what I'm saying is I love a strong independent woman who don't really need no man but can't help but enjoy the company of this goon who won't stop trying to make her chuckle at inappropriate times.

For particular pairings though I'll list out a couple and bold the character I would enjoy playing;

- Teacher x **Student**

- Boss x **Intern**

- Journalist/Bandmate x **Rockstar**

- Best Friends

- Nearly anything incest related (I really just like the taboo and heavily prefer to play pairings as the younger of the two characters such as a mother x son or older sister x brother)

- Celebrity x **Childhood Friend** (Or enemy depending on how you'd like things to go, also could be a real or fake celebrity. Whatever you prefer!)

- Roommates / Neighbors

I do have a few ideas but I would love to hear what you have in mind for any pairing you might be interested in. I love brainstorming and throwing ideas around and coming up with fun little twists and turns and stuff. As far as the actual dirty stuff I'm fairly vanilla, which I suppose this prompt may have given away. I'm not opposed to anything save for snuff, gore, and scat so I suppose those are my limits. I've already kind of stated the things I like, pretty much anything like kissing, cuddling, teasing, all that kind of stuff is 100% up my alley although I know that seems like it's not around much when everyone around here wants to fuck a guy with a giant dick until their insides have been completely rearranged. Which is fine! I just hope there's also a few people out there who would like to at least start things off a bit more tame and I'm certain we can work our way up to things like that!

Well I suppose I've been rambling long enough so I figure I'll do my best to keep from doing it anymore. I will add just one last thing if you'd like to use a celebrity as your character, or a rule 34 character, or even set something in a different time period or universe feel free! I'm open to exploring all kinds of things and love seeing what people come up with and where we can take it. Also also, I adore Pokemon and I'd enjoy some kind of role play set in that universe as well (I had some idea for some weird apocalypse type role play that we could add some kind of 'us against the world' kind of angle to for a more romantic thing I suppose) but really anything is fine! I hope to hear from some of you soon! I do have to leave soon but I'd love to get something set up, that and it'll help get me through work."

The best reproductive specialists, genetics and biologists of our clinic annually upgrade their qualification by attending various conferences, congresses, symposiums and workshops in different parts of the world. Thanks to professional development programs, our doctors have unique opportunity to get up-to-date information about new products in the ART field, and also to share their own experience and achievements with foreign colleagues.
The most significant international events, specialists of our clinic visited in 2017, are:
•	January 2017 – 2nd World Congress on Reccurent Pregnancy Loss (Cannes, France) http://2017.wcrpl.com/
•	March 2017 – International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (Brussels, Belgium)
http://www.intensive.org/
•	June 2017 – The Fetal Medicine Foundation (Ljubljana, Slovenia) 
https://fetalmedicine.org/
•	July 2017 – ESHRE (Geneva, Switzerland) 
https://www.eshre2017.eu/
•	September 2017 – European Congress of the International Society for the Study of Hypertension of Pregnancy (Berlin, Germany)
http://www.euroisshp2017.com/
•	Ocotber 2017 – EAP Congress 2017 (European Academy of Pediatrics) (Ljubljana, Slovenia) http://eapcongress.com/
Moreover, at the EAP Congress, the pediatrician of the ISIDA clinic, Maria Krepak, gave a poster report ""Assessment of the health status of children born with the help of in vitro fertilization"". In her report, Dr. Krepak drew attention of foreign colleagues to the special importance of monitoring children born thanks to ART programs. She also encouraged leaders of the European Academy of Pediatrics and the organizers of the «European Academy of Paediatrics 2017» to support in every way the collection of data on the health status of children born through the use of assisted reproductive technologies.
Also, it is worth mentioning, that this year, specialists of ART department in the ISIDA clinic underwent internships at the REPROMEDA (Czech Republic), ORIGIO (Denmark), REPROART (Georgia) clinics, while pediatricians, neonatologists and obstetrician-gynecologists underwent training at the Kaplan clinic (Israel).
Participation in these international events has a positive effect on the activities of the clinic in general: new technologies and methods of treatment are being introduced, the overall medical strategy and the level of quality of the services are improving. The knowledge and experience gained in 2017 will help our specialists reach new professional heights and give invaluable happiness to an even greater number of childless couples.

I angrily tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves. For a moment I’m reminded of some Asian girl whose name I’d already forgotten. She was prettier when she cried.

I sigh loudly – more of a growl – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns there any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows **Front desk**. The message is brief: *maid on the way up*.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing when guests arrive is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

7vf6tn,2,2018-02-05,My [27/F] boyfriend [28/M] just doesn't care about anything and I'm beyond frustrated.,imattwerk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7vf6tn/my_27f_boyfriend_28m_just_doesnt_care_about/,"I hate that I even have to post this, but I'm so frustrated and hurt.


My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 4 years. When we first got together, I was hesitant because I knew he didn't have a lot of ambition in life, and kinda was just coasting by. I'm the exact opposite.


However, I liked him. He made me feel comfortable and happy. He quickly became my best friend. While I was in college and taking internships, he was working full time at Starbucks (he did not go to school.) When I got a job offer to move to NYC (which was a dream of mine) I went, and he stayed behind. Eventually around 6 months after, he moved up and continued working at Starbucks. 


As you can imagine, it's hard to get by in NYC with a Starbucks salary (and I wasn't making enough to afford an apartment on my own.) So, I made him a resume and cover letter and started applying to jobs. I did this because he absolutely wouldn't, and any time I brought it up he'd flip out about it. Eventually I got him an interview, and he got the job there. He was finally making a salary.


Once he got his job, I immediately started looking for apartments. At the time, we were living in the living room of an apartment in a crappy neighborhood in Brooklyn. I was able to find a really great 1 bedroom apartment in an amazing neighborhood, and begged him to sign the lease with me. He begrudgingly did.


Fast forward to a year later, and now it's Valentines day... which is also our anniversary. I ask him what we're doing, and (surprise) he doesn't have any plans. I ask if he'd mind making the plans for us, and he pouts about it. I can't remember the last time he actually took me on a date/made plans in any way. I end up making our plans.


This weekend, my friend was visiting. I asked him if he could clean up/mop our floors before she gets in. He gets super mad and says I never stop telling him what to do. I tell him that the only reason I'm asking him to do it is because I've cleaned up every night for the last week (I work from home.) and I think he should at least help out. It turns into a giant argument over me being a ""bitch"" all of the time and belittling him. 


I think, in all honesty, I do belittle him and ask him to do a lot of stuff. I think deep down I do this because I DON'T think he's doing enough. It's genuinely hard for me not to constantly complain about him and his lifestyle, because it is the exact opposite of mine. I just want him to put in the same amount of effort as I do. I just want him to CARE. In every aspect of his life, he doesn't care. He's overweight, wears the same clothes he did in the 10th grade, and just makes no effort whatsoever. 


Over the weekend I told him I didn't think I could keep doing this anymore and his answer was just ""okay"" and that was that. He sat in the living room, and I was in the bedroom. I could see him on his phone and I saw that he was on Tinder. He'd already downloaded Tinder in the few hours I'd broken up with him.


As of now, we're broken up. I feel confused, frustrated and so, so, so lost. I love him very much, but I think I may just love the version of him that I WISH he was. I'm having an extremely hard time coping with this, and the thought of starting a new life without him. Before anyone suggests, I've talked about ALL of this with him tons of times. I'm very vocal about how I feel and what I want in life. He's always told me he'll ""try"" but this time he didn't even offer it.


Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Should I just give up, or should I try to do couples counseling?

7vf8al,1,2018-02-05,Internship abroad or not? (20-year-old college student),chiefadu,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7vf8al/internship_abroad_or_not_20yearold_college_student/,"Hey there,

Like many of you, I am fascinated about saving, investing, FIRE, and all the good stuff. Next year, February 2019, I am required to go on an internship at a company within the leisure industries \(hospitality, tourism, sports, events, and marketing\). One can choose to go abroad or stay in the country. Just as some background information, I am a Dutch student studying abroad in Denmark. Therefore, I am already overseas.

Although I like Denmark, I do not live in the most exciting town of Denmark \(1:45 hours by train to the capital, Copenhagen\). However, living costs are low in my town, which makes me able to save 1/3 of my total income \(salary \+ student grant\), which is roughly 800 euros. I invest 150 euros in mutual funds, 200 euros is set aside as a buffer \(even though I already have an emergency fund that will allow me to live for more six months in case of unemployment \- the Dutch government will not take my grant away at any time\), and I save 400 euros for holidays \(I will be going to China, Japan, and Poland this summer, hence the significant number\). 

My current balance sheet looks like this \(about 10000 euros, to make things simple\):

· 6&amp;#37; in my holiday fund \(because I paid for my flight tickets to Japan and accommodation this weekend. I paid the flight ticket in advance for my friend who will be joining me, and he will pay me back his part at the end of this month\);

· 35&amp;#37; in my emergency/buffer fund;

· 19&amp;#37; in several mutual funds \(80/20 stocks/bonds \- aiming to have a 90/10 stocks/bonds ratio this month, and two individual shares \(which is just 100 euros\);

· 17&amp;#37; in crypto \(I know this sub is not too fond of crypto, but still\);

· 23&amp;#37; in cash \(for bills, groceries, etc.\).

After this summer, I won't be going on a holiday for the remainder of the year, except for going to the Netherlands to see my dad once or twice, which is not too expensive. Therefore, I will have an additional 400 euros to save/invest, which is neat.

Now the real dilemma; I am considering to go on an internship abroad in Asia if possible. I am thinking of Japan, Korea, or China, although it will most likely be China because my best friend in Denmark is from China and has neat connections in the Shanghai area. This would be ""expensive"" because I would need to get a visa and get a new apartment \(although China can be considered as cheap if you compare it to Denmark, Shanghai is not the cheapest place in China\). However, I could also stay in Denmark \(or go to the Netherlands for that matter\), which would be an affordable/safe option. 

I am planning to become an Air Traffic Controller after I graduate in the Netherlands \(which is a different route from my current major\). Since the requirements to get in the ATC course are high/difficult, I would not be sad/disappointed if I would not be able to get in \(although it would suck\). For that reason, I am open to opportunities throughout my student career. Preferably, my internship would be at an airline, tour operator or something that has to do with airlines. However, I would take anything within the tourism or event management industry.

Overall, I am not sure whether to take the cheap/safe route and stay in Denmark or the Netherlands, where my buffer would not take a hit \(and therefore can save/invest more for the future\). On the other hand, I could use this unique opportunity I have and go abroad and perhaps find my dream job elsewhere \(which I, of course, could also find within Europe\), but spend more on it on the short\-term.

What would you suggest? Save/invest and stay in Denmark/The Netherlands or save money so that I can go on an internship abroad?

Cheers,

\-Chief\_Adu"

Okay so I have the 99 summoning cape and the modified headdress and some spirit charms, and i'm planning to get 75k crimsons.

I wanna know how many charms my 99 sum cape and headdress should save me over 75k crimsons (idc for blues). If i want to get to 120 they should save me about 6k crimsons. I'm asking this because i won't have much time to grind soon cause of internship and I just want 120 sum to be banked and ready for DXP.

75k crims and 4.5k blues will get me 74.5M XP and I need about 79.7m XP if you were wondering.

So he reached out to me to see me for one last time before we move away from each other (I graduate and he leave for his internship). He says that he just wants me to forgive him, and that he wants to meet to make sure I’m doing fine without him (so he can sleep better at night).

The first week after the breakup was the hardest for me and I practically poured my heart out to try to get him back. He did not want to get back together and I decided to go into NC to heal. The past week I’ve been suppressing my feelings subconsciously to cope, and managed to make it through (it’s an extremely stressful time for me, trying to juggle job apps, graduate school apps, and maintaining my visa status).

I know he’s guilty about breaking up with me but his explanation is that this is a selfless act from him (he says he “realized” that he is still attracted to me). He tells me, despite losing him, that I will be happier in the future. He also tells me to live a good life and forget about him even though the original reason for the BU was because he didn’t want to be in a relationship right now, and wanted to “to work on ourselves and figure out what went wrong”. So all in all, I’m pretty upset about this explanation because they seem like excuses to me.

I’m very conflicted and I know I still care about him, but when he reached out and tried to explain his own selfless state (being sick, unable to sleep due to loneliness), I told him to get away from my life and stop asking for my attention until he was ready for a relationship again. I later felt bad because it was probably his moment of weakness, but at the same time I didn’t think he deserved me to be there for him. 

Any advice/thoughts? :/ 

Maybe I shouldn’t have responded to him in the first place.

I worry however, as I don't really have a degree that screams ""I know math"". While I understand there are many many exams required to becoming a full actuary, I know most start as being assistants. Would I be able to find an assistant job with my degree and maybe one exam completed?

What would you guys recommend I do? Should I just find some other job and try the exams, or should I do what I can before graduation and apply for internships?

I'm going to apologize now for the wall of text. 

I'm a 23 year old male, residing in Southern California. I decided to become a cop about a year ago. I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half now, and after seeing how her family(a cop family) operates and being around a large number of departments and experiencing police week in Sacramento, have made it clear that I want to be an Officer or Deputy Sheriff. I will be finishing up my Bachelor's Degree at a UC in December. I applied to about 5 departments in January of 2017 but ended up withdrawing from all of them to finish my degree and because of marijuana usage that was way too close to application date, but it didn't even cross my mind when I applied, so when the pre-background investigation took place and the drug usage came up, I mentioned my usage and ended up withdrawing. 

Good:

No criminal record. I have a ticket that was dismissed from twelve years ago when I wasn't wearing my helmet and knee pads at a skate park. Didn't do that again. 

No driving record. No tickets, no accidents. 

Co-captain(2 years) and VP(1 year) of the Club Rugby team(there is no official NCAA rugby team at my school, but we competed against other teams). Ended up leaving the Club team because it became less about being competitive, and more about partying. I also played for the Local men's team at the same time as the Club Team, and I still play for the men's team now. 

Have worked at my current job for a year now, and when I go to apply I will at be two years. No room for advancement but I've been given more responsibilities. Also worked at another job seasonally for three years. Worked at the school gym for about 6 months. That was a set my own schedule kind of job, but due to my school schedule, rugby schedule, and the working hours that were available, I left because I wasn't really able to work more than 8 hours a month. Also worked at a restaurant as a busser/server, but left that job after I got extremely sick and started struggling with school.  All of my ex managers/bosses have stated they're looking forward to giving me a great review. 

Will have a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice. 

I drink extremely rarely(probably less than 10 times a year)

I have a life experience that makes me know for certain that I want a career in law enforcement. If the date 1 October means anything to you, you'll know what I'm talking about. 

Have experience with the testing process. Scored a well on the Pellet-B, PAT, and one of my two oral boards, so I know what to expect. 

Volunteered at an Animal Shelter for a total of 25 hours. Coached a youth football team as an assistant coach(Defensive coach mainly) for a full season. Am going to volunteer at the YMCA this summer, as well as volunteer with the department that I rode along with. 

Will have an internship at a police department by the time I graduate. 

Most departments around here don't allow ride-alongs unless you are currently in the background investigation with them, but I have been on a ride along with my girlfriend's older brother at one of my top choices and loved every second of it, so I will be going on more ride-alongs with them when given the chance. 

Bad:

My GPA is pretty poor. I'll probably graduate with a 2.7 GPA. I had two really bad quarters as a result of getting extremely sick. One of my roommates had mono, and I believe I got it as well. I was sick throughout the second half of my winter quarter, and through the first half of the spring quarter in my junior year(so my grades were awful those quarters). I should have withdrawn my classes those quarters, but I didn't know that wasn't an option(my fault for not asking). As a result of this I was exactly 1 unit behind schedule and therefore not eligible for financial loans(each class is 4 units, and I was exactly 1 unit short, not one class short). So I ended up taking the following school year off because I was not able to afford it. Now I'm back in and have been doing well since then. 

I've smoked marijuana on two occasions, about two years ago. Stupid decision, but it's too late to change it now. By the time I go to apply I will be at 3 years. 

Moved around a lot through college. First year was in the dorms, second year was with some dormmates from freshman year. They smoked a lot of marijuana so I ended up leaving. Moved into a new place with some friends, and all they did was party and smoke both cigarettes and marijuana, so I left after a year there too. I don't believe that moving around a lot will be an issue since I was in college, but not sure. I have since moved back in with my parents in order to save money and get away from all the parties and drug usage(although my commute is about 50 miles one way, so I'm definitely not saving time). 

I have an ex-girlfriend with which the relationship did not end well. She was extremely manipulative and exploitative, and she was the one I ended up smoking marijuana with(she threatened to break up with me and sleep with my friends. Yes I know I should have broken up with her after that but it was my first real relationship). I broke up with her after about a month and a half or so, and ever since then she's been talking trash about me to all of my friends and pretty much anyone who will listen. I'm just worried she's going to slander me to the BI, or tell them that I either smoked more than I did, or that I abused her or did hard drugs or something(neither of which I did). 


Other info/questions:

If I'm struggling to get hired(due to whatever issues they find, drug usage being too recent,etc) I've decided to enlist in the Marine Corps or the Navy in order to make myself a better candidate. I will probably try to go the officer route, but I doubt my GPA is high enough. I'm fine with enlisting. 

Since my GPA is so low, do you think I should just self-sponsor myself through an academy and just do really well? or Should I just wait and hope?

Is there anything there that you feel will be an issue during my BI? Anything to make myself a better candidate?

Also worked at a restaurant as a busser/server, but left that job after I got extremely sick and started struggling with school. All of my ex managers/bosses have stated they're looking forward to giving me a great review.

Will have a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice.

I drink extremely rarely(probably less than 10 times a year)

I have a life experience that makes me know for certain that I want a career in law enforcement. If the date 1 October means anything to you, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Have experience with the testing process. Scored a well on the Pellet-B, PAT, and one of my two oral boards, so I know what to expect.

Volunteered at an Animal Shelter for a total of 25 hours. Coached a youth football team as an assistant coach(Defensive coach mainly) for a full season. Am going to volunteer at the YMCA this summer, as well as volunteer with the department that I rode along with.

Will have an internship at a police department by the time I graduate.

Most departments around here don't allow ride-alongs unless you are currently in the background investigation with them, but I have been on a ride along with my girlfriend's older brother at one of my top choices and loved every second of it, so I will be going on more ride-alongs with them when given the chance.

Bad:

My GPA is pretty poor. I'll probably graduate with a 2.7 GPA. I had two really bad quarters as a result of getting extremely sick. One of my roommates had mono, and I believe I got it as well. I was sick throughout the second half of my winter quarter, and through the first half of the spring quarter in my junior year(so my grades were awful those quarters). I should have withdrawn my classes those quarters, but I didn't know that wasn't an option(my fault for not asking). As a result of this I was exactly 1 unit behind schedule and therefore not eligible for financial loans(each class is 4 units, and I was exactly 1 unit short, not one class short). So I ended up taking the following school year off because I was not able to afford it. Now I'm back in and have been doing well since then.

I've smoked marijuana on two occasions, about two years ago. Stupid decision, but it's too late to change it now. By the time I go to apply I will be at 3 years.

Moved around a lot through college. First year was in the dorms, second year was with some dormmates from freshman year. They smoked a lot of marijuana so I ended up leaving. Moved into a new place with some friends, and all they did was party and smoke both cigarettes and marijuana, so I left after a year there too. I don't believe that moving around a lot will be an issue since I was in college, but not sure. I have since moved back in with my parents in order to save money and get away from all the parties and drug usage(although my commute is about 50 miles one way, so I'm definitely not saving time).

I have an ex-girlfriend with which the relationship did not end well. She was extremely manipulative and exploitative, and she was the one I ended up smoking marijuana with(she threatened to break up with me and sleep with my friends. Yes I know I should have broken up with her after that but it was my first real relationship). I broke up with her after about a month and a half or so, and ever since then she's been talking trash about me to all of my friends and pretty much anyone who will listen. I'm just worried she's going to slander me to the BI, or tell them that I either smoked more than I did, or that I abused her or did hard drugs or something(neither of which I did).

Other info/questions:

If I'm struggling to get hired(due to whatever issues they find, drug usage being too recent,etc) I've decided to enlist in the Marine Corps or the Navy in order to make myself a better candidate. I will probably try to go the officer route, but I doubt my GPA is high enough. I'm fine with enlisting.

Since my GPA is so low, do you think I should just self-sponsor myself through an academy and just do really well? or Should I just wait and hope?

Is there anything there that you feel will be an issue during my BI? Anything to make myself a better candidate?"

I currnelty work at an MSP doing a little bit of everything, but mostly working with *nix sytems.

I would like to leave for greener pastures, I don't quite like the MSP and would feel better back at an in house IT department( I think).

Was thinking of landing a Linux only job, but don't think my resume is up to par.

As for the resume itself, at first it was 4 pages, I trimmed it down to 2 by removing irrelevant experience. While at it I also removed my internship entry as it was only one month, however valuable. Don't know if leaving a line saying that full experience is available upon request and/or on LinkedIn is a good move.

Also, isn't the skills and competencies section a bit too big?

All criticism is welcome.

I started my own weight loss journey about a month and a half ago, and I’ve lost 12 lbs! I feel great and I’ve been incredibly proud of myself.... until today.

I have been very mindful about my calories since I started. I count them everyday, regardless of what I eat. It’s given me a whole new perspective on what I actually need to feel full and okay, as opposed to just eating blindly. Although I’ve been restricting my intake, I’ve still allowed myself to eat some junk food snacks here and there, as long as they are within my calorie limit for the day, which has worked out wonderfully for me because I don’t feel as tied down by a “diet” as other methods have made me feel before.

But today, I had a really tough day at work. I’m a student intern at a local high school, and my cooperating teacher and I don’t get along very well at all. So, not only is teaching tough, but they make it 10x worse. We had an argument today, and the students weren’t responding well to me, and everything I had planned went badly. So, I ate. A lot.

Now I feel terrible and kind of heart broken because I had been doing so well. Does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement? I feel like I’ve thrown a wrench in all my progress."

I need some work advice. Sorry if its a little bit too long.

I started a summer internship last May and I did so well I stayed over and I'm still here. I love the company, the environment and everything related to this place. Because of how great I've done, they offered me benefits, 401k and even PTO. It's been a crazy ride but I am so glad to be here. I work 40hrs a week, have my own office all while still being an intern.

Recently, they wanted to fire someone in our department and they decided to replace them with someone that is not in our field and had zero experience in our dept. Although I was kind of annoyed that they didn't think of me for the position, I let it go. Then, I got the news that they were going to hire someone else for the same position that they hired the other person. So two people for just one position. This really freaked me out since they explained to me what this outside person would be doing and it sounded exactly what I thought I would do right after graduation.

I spoke to my manager about it and explained my insecurity and asked what I would be doing right after I graduated. She explained to me that I will have a long career path here and that I should look into the different job titles I want to hold here and we can discuss it with each other. I would have to leave the current office I have to accommodate the employee that has zero experience with our dept.

I got really bummed and started applying to other positions and got a phone interview with a company that would basically hire me now and by the sounds of it has a great opportunity of growing within the company.

I'm torn now on what to do. I love my current position, coworkers, and job but I'm unsure of what I will be doing in the future and by the looks of it it will take a long time to grow with this company. The person that started before me has told me how hard it has been for her to grow and even more to get the pay she deserves. Although I am really happy right now, I want to know what to do for what would benefit me the most long term.

The other company will interview me in person tomorrow and are looking for someone to start ASAP.

What would you do in my situation? I know I don't even have the job but would like to get some advice before the possibility is even there and I have to give them an answer."
7vil0a,1,2018-02-05,Worst years of my life,privatjoey,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7vil0a/worst_years_of_my_life/,"You know, a decade ago I had a great job, I was traveling, I had a great relationship, things were really looking up for me. Then 2010 hit and slowly everything started to go south.

Since that year, life has been garbage for me and I wonder what I did to deserve such a rotten existence.

In 2010, my job's managers started to act really shitty toward me, as if they were jealous of my skills. Taking away important assignments, second-guessing me, and behaving outwardly racist.

By 2012, they were clearly treating me like I was nothing more than an intern. That same year, I lost my father.

In 2014, I get laid off from that job and drift for several months. Later that year, I land a temp job that turns into something permanent for several thousand less than I was making.

I then learn that my mother's health has taken a turn for the worse and doctors diagnose her as terminal. She stays strong and lasts until May 2015. 

After my mom passes, my job starts to act really nasty toward me. And they use a mistake I made to drive a screw into my spine, threatening to fire me. I hold on as much as I can. My depression over my mom's death and job stress causes me to lose weight. 

A friend refers me to a new job, which I land. I begin to think things are looking up, but the job is with a really crappy, unstable company whose executives are idiots. They wind up selling it to some investors who have no idea what they are doing and drive it into near oblivion and in the process they lay me off. This brings things to about May 2017.

Job prospects are few and far between. Only three significant job interviews have come up. One was for a company I had no respect for, so I didn't mind not getting that job. A second was for a company that would have worked well, but they ""ghosted"" me until I bugged the hiring manager's secretary into forcing him to contact me, but only to tell me ""fuck off, we hired someone else.""

A couple months after that, I lose my sister. The third loss in my immediate family within five years. 

Near the end of the year, through a headhunter, I manage to get another interview with another major company and this goes as far as the headhunter calling my references. Almost there, right? WRONG!!!

They string me along for nearly two months only to have the headhunter tell me they're ""passing"" on me. Assholes. Of course, because these dickwads are afraid of lawsuits, they won't give me any type of feedback.

Through all this, my savings are being eaten up quickly, I can't afford anything anymore, I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent next month. It just doesn't seem like my luck is going to turn around. I feel like the whole world is my enemy and I am so fucking alone.

These are the worst, most unhappy years of my life. I guess I should be thankful I have my health and most of my marbles upstairs. I hope to God those aren't the next to go. 

I wish I could just catch a break. Why am I stuck here in this place?"

I am going to college now for computer science in Montana, my wife and myself, and our two kids (2, and 5 months) are living in the dorms currently (729 a month) and our only real income is my GI-bill housing allowance, (1200 a month) which I only get while I am actively a full time student. I can not attend class this summer, and plan on finding a job, but the dorm room is rather small and we need to move out.

Daycare in our area is not a very good option, as we are kind of fearful of trusting strangers, there has been three cases of molestation within different daycare's in the area. My wife stays home with the kids, and I attend school full time, working internships on the side where I can. (I am a computer science major, primarily focusing on software development.)

I have been trying to find a place for 2 months, and was hoping to use my student stipend and taxes to move us into a place, however there is absolutely nothing here that we can afford. I am worried me may be on the road to being homeless, we have no family we can rely on here (mine in Ohio) and my wife's family are just alcoholics and abusive.

I have been trying to do my best, to keep things moving forward and be optimistic. But I don't know what to do now. I am honestly afraid I will be homeless by summer. I feel like I am losing control on everything.

We recently moved out of a trailer (owned by one of the major three property management monopoly in the area) and they forced us to pay double deposit (a total of 1800) and then after our lease expired, we cleaned the place and moved into the dorms. They took the deposit + charged us 500 dollars. We filed a complaint, but nothing was done. That was 1 and a half year ago.

We have a bankruptcy behind us recently too, and I just don't know what I can do. It feels so hopeless. I feel like I am failing as a dad and husband.

I don't want a hand out, I want a solution. What help is there for people like me, veterans with families, who need options. I just need to be able to keep a roof over their heads long enough for me to graduates (2 years) I have started to re-budget our income, but with it being Internships and VA payments, it's so hard to predict...

Any help is good help."

Turns out she is a really cool girl, I find her attractive and she has a great smile, but I think she is one of the shy ones. I think she likes me too (but you can never be sure haha). We've talked about our education, our hobbies, turns out we like similiar things and that she grow up in the same part of the country as me. I think we clicked. But I tend to click with almost everyone, so could be just that there is sympathy on both sides.

We were never alone, as we worked together there were always other people around. We had our single moments, but still it was at work and people were here and there. One time, me and some actors were going for a drink and I asked her to join us. SHe did. But again, could have come on her own accord. We talked alomost exclusively and sometime later she left.

I got her number and now I dont know how to proceed. Any Dating advice and tips, where to go or what to do. Is she into me? How do I find out? I think I am really bad at this. I guess I missed tons of moments with girls (friends atleast say this) but most of the time I dont really care or think like 'oh shit, could have been great something, but whatev'. So I am very oblivious.

tldr: great ideas for dates needed for a girl i did not see alone yet. also, i am as oblivious as a stick when ti comes to gauging interest and attraction.

Edit: I don't know exactly how it happened but when we were drinking she invited me to a watch a play - or we talked about it and decided that we both want to go. I don't know. "

Girls are given the advantage in everything be it college admissions, internships,there are even girl exclusive internships, etc. Teachers also seem to favor girls for awards. For example, there is an awards ceremony in my city where every school sends a nominee. For our school there is a kid who applied for technology, who started the robotics team, took 2 AP computer classes,does all of the lights and sounds for our theatre program, and got the only internship ever to a , multinational, credit card processing company in our area. But he,a guy, didn't win. The person who had won was a girl whose only qualification was being in a club called girls who code. How is this not blatant favoritism

Edit:  I thank you for all of your responses and have a greater sympathy for the girl now, and many of my words were a little bit extreme, but one place I did not exaggerate was the girl's accomplishments . And this though is simply not true. Literally all she has done in the field is the aforementioned club and I even overplayed,it as the club only met once last year.

Mainly because I’ve been keeping too much anger with myself and everyone else around me. I have dealt with self harming and attempted suicide a couple of times in the past. Tried meditation but it didn’t work for me. Perhaps it was because I wasn’t doing it right, I resorted into lifting heavy weights to channel my frustrations instead of hurting myself. 
I’m turning 23 this year, still stuck living with my family and acquired no skills. I’ve struggled with self esteem a lot. I blamed my family for being overly protective and strict, not allowing me to explore the things I want to do and I now have limited opportunities. I no longer blame them, I needed to understand where they were coming from. I’ve done my internship not too long ago (for my semester break) and I felt that I wasn’t good enough looking how other interns had done much better job than I have. I experienced social anxiety that I’ve gotten all sweaty and was at the verge of breaking down  when I was pushed to speak with clients. 
I’m trying to learn non attachment from the things and people around me. Also, later in future when I leave my family, I don’t want to come go back to them. I felt that they’ve locked me up long enough and shunned me out from everyone. I’ve listened to Ajahn Brahma and practised it, works for awhile before falling back into my old habits.

**Totalist**
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has reported that the Revolutionary Finances are low, so the Chairman and Party secretary orders a robbery on a reactionary bank. To do so he creates a the Committee for the Armed Robbery and Requisition of Reactionary Resources. Half the committee is purged on the spot for reactionary tendencies and the other half of the committee is purged after failing to rob the bank. The Committee is disbanded and the people starve.

**Syndicalist**
The National Bank Robbers Union proposes in the General Union Congress the plan of robbing a bank, they compete with the National Pickpockets Union and the Con Artist Union for the prize.  Eventually the National Bank Robbers Union breaks into the bank, only to have the National Construction Union and the National Banking Union oppose the breaking of a window for entry. The robbery is bogged down in debates and never happens.

**Radical Socialists**
The Welsh Union, currently being invaded, decides to rob the Irish National Bank for funds. So the Decentralized Central Committee of Wales brings all of the people into a great commune to vote on the issue. The money in the bank is to be evenly split among every living being within the boundaries of Wales. Anyone who said anything about using the money to defend the country against invasion was of course shot for authoritarian bias. The Great Proletarian Robbery of Ireland occurs with great shouts of BREAK THE CHAINS, followed by the Welsh Union capitulating.

**Social Democrat**
For some reason your country elected the SocDems, and since SocDems are SocDems they want some WELFARE, but they don't want to tax the poor, so after taxing the rich at 100% for five years straight there are no more rich people. So parliament decides to rob a bank, after being mired in debate, the vote passes with a narrow majority. After a carefully selected and vetted team embarks on their dangerous heist, the Totalists seize control.

**Social Liberal**
Given that Whole Foods tends to be expensive on the salary of a Yoga Guru the SocLibs decide to rob a bank. After agreeing on robbing the most evil, vile corporate bank they can find they find the SocDem's amazing robber team and sets them loose. After several heist movies-worth of shenanigans the robbery pays off, the money pays for another few dozen heads of cale before the people are broke again.

**Market Liberal**
After the formulation of the robbery the Market Liberal quietly sneaks off and gets a job at the bank. The MarkLib sells out his thieving SocLib and SocDem compatriots in exchange for a position as CEO. After this he creates a shell corporation in the Cayman Islands and funnels all the bank money over there. By the time anyone else comes to rob the bank all the money is gone.

**Social Conservatives**
In order to pay the weekly church tithe the SocCons decide to rob a clearly Syndicalist bank, of course owned by Italian immigrants. The heist works, except for half of the team ditching after feeling bad about stealing. The other SocCons then hire some more immigrants and use the money to start a new religion, using the newly hired labor to produce cheap texts for their new faith.

**Authoritarian Democrat**
Some bright young lad decides that those banks should SHARE THEIR WEALTH with the common folk. He organizes a group of ex-military soldiers to stage a heist, the heist goes off without a hitch however the man who started the entire operation keeps all the money and insists on using it to buy votes.

**Paternal Autocrat**
King Roland wants to hold a jousting tournament, but his coffers are empty after the last few rebellions and wars for de jure claims. He tells his trusted duke to rob a bank for him. The Duke tells a trusted knight to do it. The knight tells an honored squire to do it. the Squire tells a peasant to do it, the peasant decides to rob the bank. The peasant gets five feet until he is swindled by the MarkLib into joining him as an unpaid intern.

**National Populist**
Things are not going well as the country is struggling in the 2357th War of Patriotic Offensive Self-Defensive Determinist Conflict of Righteous Vengeance and thus the IMMORTAL DICTATOR needs more money. As all of the fighting age men are dead and/or dying he conscripts several old men to rob a bank. The conscripts make it five steps before they too are swindled by the MarkLib into becoming unpaid interns."

We are both college students, and we live in small two bedroom apartment. I had trouble making friends in college, and when I met her she quickly became my best friend. She has also said the same thing about me, but now I'm unsure. It was said while she was drunk, but another time as well when she was sober. She got back from an internship in the fall, and it felt like our relationship changed. She seemed more distant and less willing to hang out with me. The only method we hung out is when we would have a smoke on the patio, now there are weeks where I only talk to her for about for maybe a hour or two in total. It just really hurts because it didn't feel like this before and, we're suppose to be best friends right? She used to want to smoke and hang out all the time, and now I have to ask and it is almost always a no. It's not that I want to smoke, I just want to hang out with her.

My feelings about this could be because I have feelings for her, and they've only grown stronger over time. I didn't want to say something too early because it could ruin our living situation and our friendship. However, she is graduating in five weeks and now I need to say something. I've been trying for the past five weeks, but every time I think it's a good opportunity something happens. Either I chicken out, or she gets a call or something. It just feels like I never have an opportunity because we never hang out, and when I do ask, she is always busy with work or school or something else. It is honestly making me severely depressed, and giving me mood swings. I'm happy when we do hang out, but on days where we don't talk, and I barely see her I get depressed. When multiple of those days happen in a row, I just barely want to get out of bed in the mornings and all I want to do is sleep to get away from these feelings. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but just had to get this out there."

My advice to entry level candidates:

* Start working whatever you can get ASAP, to show that you can pass exams while working.

* Aggressively seek relevant work experience while working. 

* Network with actuaries within a reasonable driving distance. It would help to know a person at the company for when that position opens up.

* If you start studying early you can pass two prelims in an exam season. This can help differentiate you from other candidates.

The only thing is that they are all public accounting positions (Big 4) and I have no interest in working public. I have always wanted to be an industry accountant. In my accounting club, literally nobody even cares to think about industry accounting and always overhype public. 

I’m going to the event because I know the value of having public accounting experience on my resume and would rather intern during college rather than do an entry level position after I graduate. It wouldn’t hurt to go and network. When I go to the event, should I fake it and tell them that I plan to work in public? What kind of questions should I even have for a networking event with Big 4 firms? 

On a side note, does anybody have any advice for me for some things I should make sure I do for an industry accounting career path? Or if it can be done without public? What kind of internships should I be looking for if I want to stay in industry?

In case anybody asks, I plan to get my CPA and my MAcc


Thanks

7vltcq,31,2018-02-06,"20 years old, got started late being an adult, have a few questions on what to do",faf20yohmp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7vltcq/20_years_old_got_started_late_being_an_adult_have/,"Hey guys, I've lurked here for a while, and I have finally decided to post a bit about me and to see if i can get some help with a few of my questions.

Ok, so here is the basics of my current situation

20 years old, Been employed 4 weeks, $9 an hour before taxes, just started a bank account with $220, with $25 in savings, rest in checking.

Work situation: ok, so my work situation is kinda odd from what seems normal, but I'll try and explain it.

I started working at a local computer repair store in my town. I have known the owner for 10+ years. I started ""working"" there a few days after thanksgiving, but was working as an unpaid intern up until January 15th, where i was put on payroll for $9 an hour. I spent about 100 or so hours working as an intern before they put me on payroll. Right now i am comfortable working for $9 an hour, as the arrangement I made with the owner is I offered to work as an unpaid intern to learn the job until one of the current employees planned to quit. I knew that one of the current employees planned to quit early 2018, and i now have an exact date, which is end of march. For my first two weeks, i was working six hours a day, five days a week, but now they have me at four hours a day, five days a week, since they said they are unable to keep payroll up for me for what i was working. I have yet been able to talk to my coworker as to how much he is currently making working there, and that is a future goal so i know what i should expect when i go full time at the end of march.

So my first question is, what is a respectable hourly wage for an entry level job working as a computer repair tech?

I also just opened up a bank account with a credit union in my area. I chose that because my grandparents have accounts with the credit union and I was able to get a free savings and checking account through them, since I am a family member. Like i said, i currently have $220 (pretty much almost all of 1 of my first weeks worth of a paycheck) put into the account, with the minimum $25 in savings to have an account, and the rest in checking. I am currently waiting on my debit card to arrive. The credit union I have a bank account with does have a credit card, and I would like to get a credit card, so I can start using it rather than cash to get my credit score started, but I was unsure if signing up for the credit unions credit card was the best option.

So my second question is, what should I do about getting a credit card, which one is best for me? what precautions do I need to take when looking for and signing up for a credit card? Did i make the right choice setting up an account with a credit union rather than a standard bank?

So, as of right now, the money I am making working 4 hours a day is more or less spending money for me, and i plan on getting actually situated once I start working full time at the end of march. I am setting some of what i make now aside, and plan on putting it into my saving account as a emergency fund, but like i said, the money i make from now till the end of march, i haven't made any long term goal for it. I have reliable transportation, reasonable insurance costs for my age, and the option to buy a vehicle from my Dad at just the expense of registration. If y'all have any more questions, I'll do my best to answer them.

So my third question is, what am i doing right? what am i doing wrong? What advice do you guys have for me, so i can catch up for the two years (18-20) that i just straight up wasted?"
7vmcow,14,2018-02-06,I need closure (not completely on topic),throwawaypsycho80,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/7vmcow/i_need_closure_not_completely_on_topic/,"Yesterday was a day, not only was it my birthday but it was my cardio check-up day (every year) for my heart condition (from birth)... I'm stable.

I had requested to meet with the head of department (because I know he is open-minded) when booking the appointment to discuss a few ways to improve my treatment. Instead met with an intern who threw all my carefully researched ideas out (I am in the medical field myself) the window whilst two female trainees were giggling in the room while checking their phones.

So here I was discussing also very personal issues like, whilst I can have sex etc... as soon as women (and ""healthy people"") find out (which they sooner or later) they ghost me or flat out tell me ""sorry it's too weird I'm afraid you are going to die while we fuck"" (which is one of the least likely way I'd die but ok). 

My ex left me because of my health calling me a weak pussy in my back when talking to the guy she cheating on me with. 

This with the giggling trainees still in the room...

Intern did keep one of my ideas (of course claimed it was his ...) but still, that's only one out of like 10, and not the most critical one.

I was hoping for some form of closure, some sort of clear path... And as usual I am left questioning.

Ironically, its snowing today, and it very rarely snows...

""This is a bit of an odd scenario but here goes.

I'm an intern at a company working in IT and I've been assigned to figure out how the company should handle leasing Apple devices to a school. Now, the regular way of doing things I suppose is using Apple DEP/ASM so that the school can manage their devices efficiently (preconfigured/VPP/etc). That works great when selling devices.

The issue here is that once these devices are returned to us from leasing, we will sell them to another company that in turn might want to use DEP/ASM. From my understanding, you can't disown an Apple device from one DEP account and assign it to another (like you can with an MDM). Or am I missing something?

What I've gathered is that we have to use an MDM only, but that would prevent the school from using VPP. VPP would obviously be very benificial for a school, or any organisation really. The alternative is to manually configure every device, clearly not the most efficient way.

Any suggestions? I appreciate any advice because I'm walking in circles here..""

7vmsps,1,2018-02-06,Help developing beginners workout plan,PvttJebus,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/7vmsps/help_developing_beginners_workout_plan/,"Howdy Lose It!

First I'll start with my weight and goals. I'm currently 427lbs. My short term goal is to get under 400 and long term is to get closer to 200. 

I started my weight loss journey last month. I spent January developing better habits like drinking water a lot more, almost entirely cutting out pop and buying a scale. I have also started to keep a hidden blog. So a couple times a week I will write a draft post and once I'd get far enough into losing weight I will post them all. I used to do it daily but I haven't had the time.

Last week I started a new job. As I commute I get to work way earlier then needed so I go to the gym across the street every morning. 

I spent my first week doing cardio to build the habit, bit I quickly learned just cardio is not helpful, but detrimental. So I have been starting to add in weights.

I figure as people here have had success they can give advice for what workouts to do and when. I would hire a personal trainer as I had one who was amazing but as a intern I don't make any money and they are expensive at. 

So just to lay it out easier:
- I go to the gym 5 days a week for 45 minutes to an hour. 
- I need assistance developing a workout routine and am open to any and every suggestion. 

I look forward to what you all suggest! "

Feedback: 
- Does it unfold as a story and keeps you engaged until the very end?

- Have I covered all the aspects that you want to see in Case Study or is it missing something? Consider this from a perspective of a recruiter. I'd be applying for Summer Internships.

- How do you guys do the user research part when there's not enough time(Hackathon Projects specifically)? Do you go with personal bias or try to look over the internet, how people are doing things in successful applications?

- Any UI/UX related feedback? Something that you would like to suggest to improve the app experience. I have linked a Marvel Prototype on the post.

- What do you think about the overall idea? Should I pursue it and take this project forward? or dump it like other hackathon projects.

I know I have asked a LOT of questions and you guys probably won't have time for it. So I'd appreciate if you can go through the post and at least answer one of em. It will help this noob designer improve. And you will earn some good karma and my best wishes."
7vnsv5,1,2018-02-06,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Ronnes over het onder verscherpt toezicht plaatsen van Woonstichting Vooruitgang uit Sassenheim,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/7vnsv5/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_ronnes_over_het/,"^(Vragen van het lid Ronnes &amp;#40;CDA&amp;#41; aan de minister van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties over het onder verscherpt toezicht plaatsen van Woonstichting Vooruitgang uit Sassenheim &amp;#40;ingezonden 16 januari 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1. Kunt u bevestigen dat de Sassenheimse Woonstichting Vooruitgang in de gemeente Teylingen recent onder verscherpt toezicht is geplaatst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dat is correct. Hiervoor verwijs ik naar het persbericht van de Autoriteit woningcorporaties &amp;#40;Aw&amp;#41; van 19 december jl.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2. Kunt u tevens bevestigen dat het bij de stichting al een half jaar hommeles is en dat de Autoriteit Woningcorporaties afgelopen zomer al constateerde dat de governance van de woonstichting tekortkomingen vertoonde?  
&amp;nbsp;    
4. Kunt u bevestigen dat de Autoriteit Woningcorporaties &amp;#40;de Autoriteit&amp;#41; medio 2017 al een interventie bij de woonstichting Vooruitgang heeft gepleegd? Wat was de aanleiding voor deze interventie en waaruit bestond deze?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op 2 en 4:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Aw heeft een governance-inspectie uitgevoerd in maart 2017 en daarna een interventie gepleegd op 16 mei 2017. De Aw heeft daarin de corporatie opgelegd dat zij een verbeterplan moet opstellen en uitvoeren. Dit verbeterplan had met name betrekking op de gesignaleerde tekortkomingen in de governance.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3. Welke tekortkomingen vertoont de governance van de woonstichting precies, welke oorzaken liggen daaraan ten grondslag en moet vastgesteld worden dat de directeur-bestuurder van de woonstichting, in strijd met de statuten van de stichting, de Governancecode voor woningcorporaties niet heeft nageleefd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
5. Welke redenen liggen ten grondslag aan het opstappen van de complete raad van commissarissen van de woonstichting Vooruitgang?  
&amp;nbsp;    
8. Waarop is het verschil van mening tussen de directeur-bestuurder en de raad van commissarissen van de woonstichting gebaseerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op 3, 5 en 8:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De voormalige Raad van Commissarissen heeft eind maart 2017 aangegeven dat sprake was van een fundamenteel verschil van inzicht tussen raad en bestuurder over de ‘governance’ van de corporatie, hetgeen de Aw ook heeft geconstateerd. De zorgen en twijfels van de Aw betroffen in eerste instantie de relatie tussen bestuurder en Raad van Commissarissen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Eind oktober heeft de voormalige raad conform artikel 29 BTIV een melding gedaan van ‘een onoverbrugbaar geschil tussen het bestuur en de raad van commissarissen’. In de optiek van de Aw bestonden er fundamentele verschillen van inzicht tussen raad en bestuurder met name over de wederzijdse taken, verantwoordelijkheden en bevoegdheden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De voormalige Raad van Commissarissen heeft per brief van 8 december 2017 aan de Aw onder andere het volgende aangegeven: “Er is onvoldoende zicht op oplossingen binnen afzienbare termijn.” en “Gelet op het geheel van omstandigheden, achten wij het niet zorgvuldig en niet passend onze zetel als raad van commissarissen aan te houden.”  
In haar verantwoordingsgegevens over 2016 heeft de corporatie aangegeven dat de statuten zijn nageleefd. De naleving van de governancecode maakte geen onderdeel uit van de uitgevoerde governance-inspectie. De Aw toetst op de vereisten uit de Woningwet en niet op de naleving van de governancecode van de sector voor zover dat niet raakt aan de wettelijke vereisten. Naleving van de governancecode wordt door de sector zelf gedaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6. Is het waar dat de Autoriteit vindt dat met het opstappen van alle leden van de raad van commissarissen de problemen eerder verergerd zijn? Deelt u die visie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7. Is het u bekend welke verergerde problemen de Autoriteit hierbij op het oog heeft en wat de overwegingen van de Autoriteit zijn om de woonstichting nu onder verscherpt toezicht te plaatsen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op 6 en 7:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het opstappen van alle leden van de Raad van Commissarissen is voor de Aw reden geweest voor het instellen van verscherpt toezicht. Ik acht dat een logische stap, omdat het wegvallen van intern toezicht bij een corporatie een ernstig feit is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9. Kunt u bevestigen dat, in lijn met de statuten en het Reglement werkwijze voor de raad van commissarissen van de woonstichting Vooruitgang, de raad van commissarissen toezicht dient te houden op het doen en laten van de directeur-bestuurder en deze zo nodig kan schorsen en ontslaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de statuten van Woonstichting Vooruitgang is de toezichthoudende taak van de Raad van Commissarissen en de bevoegdheid van de Raad van Commissarissen tot schorsen en ontslaan van het bestuur geregeld. Het Reglement werkwijze voor de raad van commissarissen gaat wel in op het gegeven dat de Raad van Commissarissen toezicht dient te houden op de bestuurder, maar niet op schorsing en ontslag.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10. Waarom heeft de raad van commissarissen niet besloten om de directeur-bestuurder te schorsen of te ontslaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De voormalige Raad van Commissarissen heeft een voorgenomen besluit tot onmiddellijke schorsing van de bestuurder genomen en is daarna opgestapt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
11. Hoe kan het dat bij een substantieel verschil van opvatting over de governance tussen de raad van commissarissen en de directeur-bestuurder, de complete raad van commissarissen opstapt en de directeur-bestuurder aanblijft? Wat vinden de Autoriteit en u van deze &amp;#40;omgekeerde&amp;#41; gang van zaken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is een eigen beslissing van de RvC geweest om voltallig op te stappen. De Aw vindt deze gang van zaken ongebruikelijk en ongewenst.  
&amp;nbsp;    
12. Worden op grond van de statuten van de woonstichting de leden van de raad van commissarissen benoemd door de raad van commissarissen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, met uitzondering van de situatie van ontstentenis en belet waarin de gehele Raad van Commissarissen is weggevallen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
13. Zijn er tijdelijk drie kandidaten benoemd in het kader van het intern toezicht? Zo ja, door wie zijn deze kandidaten aangezocht en benoemd, nu de raad van commissarissen in oude samenstelling al eerder voltallig is opgestapt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de statuten van de corporatie is opgenomen dat bij belet of ontstentenis van alle leden van de Raad van Commissarissen de bestuurder de Minister belast met de zorg voor de volkshuisvesting verzoekt tijdelijk te voorzien in intern toezicht &amp;#40;hierna: ‘tijdelijke voorziening”&amp;#41;. Deze tijdelijke voorziening dient onder andere zorg te dragen voor de formatie van een Raad van Commissarissen. De Aw is gemandateerd om te voorzien in tijdelijk intern toezicht en heeft op 9 januari jl. drie tijdelijke intern toezichthouders aangesteld voor een periode van drie maanden. Hun namen zijn: mevrouw N. Boudrie-Poll en de heren prof. dr. mr. G.D. Minderman en mr. A.L.M. Vlak.  
&amp;nbsp;    
14. Wat vindt u, terwijl de woonstichting Vooruitgang onder verscherpt toezicht is geplaatst, van de mededeling van de directeur-bestuurder aan het gemeentebestuur van Teylingen dat het een interne kwestie betreft?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De directeur-bestuurder heeft aan de Aw aangegeven dat hij zich niet herkent in deze en dat hij over het opstappen van de RvC in openheid heeft gecommuniceerd met het lokale bestuur. Uit het feit dat er een interventie heeft plaatsgevonden door de extern toezichthouder, kan reeds worden geconcludeerd dat het om meer gaat dan een interne kwestie. Het intern toezicht ziet er onder andere op toe dat de belangen van stakeholders &amp;#40;met name gemeente en de huurders&amp;#41; voldoende zijn geborgd en met name om die reden acht ik het wegvallen van het intern toezicht ook een externe aangelegenheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
15. Wat vindt u van het feit dat de directeur-bestuurder, op grond van zijn perceptie dat het een interne kwestie betreft, weigert aan het gemeentebestuur van Teylingen volledige opening van zaken te geven over de exacte gang van zaken bij de woonstichting?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bestuurder heeft aan de Aw aangegeven dat hij zich niet herkent in de weergave in de vraagstelling. In algemene zin acht ik het van belang dat corporaties openheid en transparantie betrachten naar hun stakeholders zoals gemeenten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
16. Deelt u de conclusie dat vanwege de publieke taak van de woningstichting snel volledige openheid en transparantie noodzakelijk is, nu huurders en het gemeentebestuur van Teylingen, door de opstelling van de directeur-bestuurder, belangrijke informatie die hen direct raakt, ontberen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De bestuurder heeft aan de Aw aangegeven al zo te handelen en zo ook te blijven handelen. Een dergelijke handelswijze ligt in de rede. De Aw zal hier ook op aandringen bij de corporatie en waar nodig handelend optreden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
17. Onderschrijven u en de Autoriteit de opvatting van de directeur-bestuurder dat “deze bewaking niets met de bedrijfsvoering te maken heeft en er ook financieel niks aan de hand is. Integendeel, Vooruitgang is financieel hartstikke gezond”? Zo nee, wat is dan uw oordeel en waarop is dat gebaseerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Aw kan bevestigen dat er op dit moment geen sprake is van zorgen omtrent de financiële positie. Het verscherpt toezicht komt met name voort uit de governanceproblemen en het wegvallen van het intern toezicht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
18. Op welke wijze kan gewaarborgd worden dat de financiële continuïteit van de woonstichting Vooruitgang op korte en lange termijn gezond is, de plannen voor de sociale woningbouw in de gemeente Teylingen niet in het gedrang komen, de huurders van de woonstichting zich geen zorgen hoeven te maken en zij geen gevolgen zullen ondervinden van de gang van zaken bij de woonstichting?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Aw heeft ervoor gezorgd dat is voorzien in het intern toezicht bij de corporatie. Dit intern toezicht gaat tevens zorgdragen voor de formatie van een nieuwe raad van commissarissen. De financiële positie van de corporatie geeft op dit moment geen aanleiding tot zorgen. De corporatie is gehouden tot het opstellen en uitvoeren van een herstelplan voor de governance van de corporatie. Deze aanpak moet ertoe leiden dat huurders geen nadeel ondervinden van de ontstane situatie.)

I am going to go ahead and list the accomplishments that I have that I think are important, and I will list some possible paths I could take.  Any feedback will be appreciated, and I can give more info if it is needed.  Thanks for the help in advance.

First off, I have never had any trouble with the law.  I have never been stopped by an officer even for something like speeding.  I have never taken any illegal drug or drank any alcohol illegally and never plan to do either.  

I have a solid work history, including things like working at a locally renowned food joint known for good customer service and hard work, a regional supermarket also renowned for great customer service, and am currently working an internship in my field of study (Informatics) with a real company doing real work in my field of study.  

I am a volunteer youth minister to two parishes in my state for two years, where I work with high school students to help them learn their value and overcome unfortunate life situations (which vary from depression, crime as both former perpetrators and victims, and self-harm/suicidal thoughts).

With those things out of the way, I want to list some possibilities for the future I have been considering.  
     
* I really do not enjoy college, or campus life in general.  I have contemplated that since my target agency opens applications to 20 year olds, I would possibly attempt to apply this summer when I turn 20.  I am confident in my ability to handle the physical aspects of the academy.  This would mean that I would obviously not finish my degree if accepted, and I am curious to know how this could potentially affect my chances of being moved into a specialized unit later on.

* I finish my bachelor's degree and then decide to apply, obviously increasing my chances of getting hired.  By this time I would be 22 and therefore able to apply to basically any agency in my area.  Is it considered bad or difficult to be hired at a different agency then move to my target agency later?  Also will this affect my chances of entering a specialized unit at my target agency?

* I somehow finish my masters, how much would this change the things from the previous situation? 

Again, thanks for reading this.  I know its a wall of text, so thanks for spending the time to help.

A team of authors is assembled to write this book.  Half of the authors are immediately purged for attempting to add reactionary themes to the book.  Six months after it is released, several figures who have been purged are removed from the Second Edition, and all First Edition copies are burned.  This process continues for the subsequent editions until the Revolutionary People's Justice Commission decides that the entire book is Reactionary.  All authors involved in writing it are purged.

**Syndicalist:** The Authors Union and The Illustrators Union are actually able to collaborate successfully on a book, although the Illustrators Union suffers from weeks of infighting because of a faction refusing to draw anything but Ducklings for the remainder of the year.  Then, the publication industry is put on standstill for months because of a debate by the Typesetters Union and the Bookbinders Union.  Finally, it is printed, but it barely clears a vote before the Booksellers Co-Op, which had supported the Duckling Faction of the Illustrators Union.  The First Printing Sells out, but there are no subsequent Editions, as the Typesetters Union and Editors Union are ground to a halt over a three-year dispute over Font Sizes.

**Radical Socialist:** A writer comes up with an idea for a book.  His commune debates vigorously for hours on wether the themes of this book is reactionary.  Then, the debate is restarted, as one member of his commune needed to take a bathroom break and thus missed 90 seconds of debate.  After months of this, the commune decides that books themselves are authoritarian, as the Author presumes he can impose themes and ideas upon his readers.  The book never gets published.

**Social Democrat:** An author applies for a National Artistic Grant so he can take a break from work to write his book.  He then suffers from writers block for 11 months and dashes off some garbage in the last month.  The book is printed as a measure to keep Bookbinders and Typesetters in work and putting money into the book.

**Market Liberal:** A 10-year-old Child Writer in Bangladesh is given $3 a day to write a Novelization of the new Reboot of the Starkrieg series.  He is then fed to the hounds for violating the NAP by making a grammatical error.  A million paperback copies of the novel are then printed by totally voluntary, consenting unpaid interns in Indonesia, and shipped around the world, where they flop, along with the Starkrieg reboot, because the last attempt to reboot Starkreig had flopped five years ago.  These unpaid interns, in printing an unpopular book, had violated the NAP, and are thus fed to the hounds.

**Social Liberal:** Same as Market Liberal but the main character of the Starkreig reboot is a woman.

**Social Conservative:** Why would we need any new books?  We have all the books we need already.  It's called the Holy Bible.  Now be careful, or we'll start to think you're a heretic.

**Authoritarian Democrat:** You write a book.  The Government only agrees to publish it on the condition you vote America First Union Party in 1940.  Then, Pelley comes to power, declares literacy a tool of Satan, and executes you.

**Paternal Autocrat:** Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV commissions a chronicle of his heroic deeds.  He asks a loyal noble to write it, who asks a loyal knight to write it, who asks a loyal squire to write it, who asks a loyal scribe to write it.  Only 500 copies, most of them incomplete, are ever produced, as the at the request of the Friars Guild Shaddam IV has banned the Printing Press so they can still copy every book by hand.

**National Populist:** As the GLORIOUS LEADER approaches victory in the 10,932nd WAR OF RIGHTEOUS CLEANSING OF THE DOMINION OF THE TRUE ARYAN VOLK, he demands a book be written about the Struggle of the ONE TRUE RACE against the (((dark forces))) that are aligned against them.  Because there are no young men left, an old writer is ordered to write the book.  He is then executed via meathook because a phrenological examination has revealed racial impurities.  Another old man completes the book.  But then the GLORIOUS LEADER hates it, as it implies the ONE TRUE RACE has (((weaknesses))).  He decides the author is a (((subversive))) and executes him.

I am having all kinds of trouble getting in to the field.  I have had many interviews, including with the state police.  Most/all of them want experience with practical examinations, which I have none, other than in school.

I have seen in older posts to contact local police departments and their computer crimes units.  I have also tried this, and they said they do not do internships due to child exploitation.  It is getting frustrating that I have been graduated for almost 6 months now and cannot even get an internship. 

I do understand that I do not have any experience in Digital Forensics, but most internships require that one is currently pursuing a degree, in which I am not, I already have my degree.  But, even so, I am willing work an internship (paid or unpaid).  I am willing to travel anywhere for my first job.  Any advice for a struggling Digital Forensics graduate?"

Long story short, I’m 24, I just came back home (I live with my parents in France) after a semester abroad in Canada. This was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, it made me grow as a person and more importantly allowed me to live independently, far away from my N-dad.

Now that I’m back, I’ve made it very clear that I intend on moving out in September once I finish my masters. I had a plan laid out: finishing my dissertation, saving up (I’m currently broke because of my exchange program) and moving abroad again to another country either to work or do an internship, once I have enough money. Needless to say both my parents reacted very strongly. My dad said that I wasn’t “allowed” to do this, that it was against our cultural values (we’re of Moroccan background). Yesterday, he said that if i didn’t change my mind about this, he would disown me. I calmly responded, saying that it wouldn’t affect my decision whatsoever and that my mind was made up. That it was unfortunate of him to react this way but that I was an adult capable of making my own life choices. He stormed out and iced me out, before calling me again today saying that I’d better change my mind or he would kill me. I said I would call the police if he didn’t stop. He then decided to take my state allowance (which I’m entitled to) for the upcoming months, since it is originally transferred to his account. My mom sided with him and said I’d better get this idea out of my head.

I’m currently broke and depressed. Coming back from abroad already felt like a death sentence, now I feel like I’m trapped in a home and a town I absolutely hate after living a dream for the past months. I’ve had severe panic attacks over the past few days and I don’t know what to do. "
7vpp6j,8,2018-02-06,Staying at home and feelings of uselessness,BeenBeans,CatholicWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicWomen/comments/7vpp6j/staying_at_home_and_feelings_of_uselessness/,"Earlier before I got married, I was concerned about choosing to become a stay at home mom/wife once blessed with babies. However, now, I seem to be stuck in a limbo in which, I don't have a job lined up (just graduated and am looking, but all previous work opportunities either from internships or interviews fell through due to geography reasons. Though not that I didn't try. Heck, I flew to Alabama for a 3-day interview the morning after our wedding.) Also am not pregnant yet. 

This resulted in me being at home for the past 3 months of marriage. Initially, it was fine. I cook, clean, do hobbies, and visit my parents or friends. But my husband comes from a family that encouraged everyone to work (wife/husband, kids as soon as they hit 14, etc). And we've had arguments where he doesn't feel that I am contributing enough, while he wakes up early everyday to go to work and feed the both of us. 

While I am job hunting right now, I came from a completely different family and culture where my mom never worked. My dad even discouraged me from working while I was in school. So, it's been kind of an adjustment for both of us. But after hearing hubby's complaints, I can't help but feel like I really am not doing anything useful and start feeling guilty that I don't wake up at 7am everyday or that I didn't clean the house enough one day. 

It'd be great if I could start working soon, or become a full-time mother. But I don't have either in my hands at the moment. I'm planning to apply to volunteer for the Little Sisters of the Poor in the area and a local animal shelter this month. But, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing if a job or a baby isn't something that's within the nearby future. 

I suppose I never thought about this before because I assumed I would either be pregnant or working right now. Added with the fact that my mom has always stayed home and that was never a problem for my dad. But, I feel this added pressure to show my husband *I've done something*, so I don't feel guilty. 

I don't know if I need to just apply for retail/waitress jobs so I can start occupying my time. Or if what I'm doing now is enough and we are just experiencing adjustment pains of different cultures. Has anyone else felt this way? 

Thoughts appreciated. "

7vpvxi,7,2018-02-06,NYC dress shopping experience recap,randomthoughts85,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/7vpvxi/nyc_dress_shopping_experience_recap/,"I was in NYC for a few days for my grandad's birthday, and went dress shopping with my mom and little sister. We went to David's Bridal, BHLDN, and Kleinfeld, in that order. 

We went to David's Bridal in Long Island City on a Saturday afternoon. First of all, there were no chairs at all for anyone to sit on, which was odd because I went to a David's in Toronto and that salon had seats. I brought out the stool from my dressing room so my mom could sit, and my sister stood the whole time. 

For those of you who have never went to David's, the stylist will ask you what you like, then allow you to look at the dresses in the store, then she will pull the ones you like and take it to your dressing room. From there she will put one dress in the fitting room at a time, without undoing the zipper/buttons. It was a bit busy and sometimes when I came out of the dressing room, my stylist wasn't around so I had to wait a few minutes for her to come back to pin me and zip up the dress. 
Some of the dresses were lovely and a bit different from the ones I tried in Toronto, but there was one I really liked, the [Galina SWG772](http://img.davidsbridal.com/is/image/DavidsBridalInc/SWG772_IVYNBCHAMP_SIG_PROD4_023?$plpproductimgdesktop_3up$). Unfortunately the sample at this store was larger and torn, so my family didn't see it in all its splendor. Most of the sample dresses looked worn, dirty and kind of torn. 
My mom tried on a dress that she liked but we left there without buying anything. 

Next we went to BHLDN, UES location on Tuesday morning. We got there about 15 mins late but there were no problems and our stylist Laura was such a sweetheart. We were shown dresses and hen offered water before we went to the dressing rooms. She was so helpful and genuine. She was in the dressing room with me, took each dress off the hanger, unzipped and unbuttoned everything and then helped me fit it up. We talked about the details of each dress and then I went outside to show my mom and sis, who were comfortably seated on a sofa. The dresses I tried on were in pristine condition, with the exception of the Ariane. It was such a great experience. Afterwards my mom and sister went to browse the other dresses and every salesperson we encountered were so helpful. 

Our last appointment on Tuesday was at Kleinfeld. We got there about 10 minutes earlier and were asked to wait. The waiting lounge was pretty full and I didn't notice anyone in the main salon. After about 15 minutes past our appointment time, someone came to us. We were led off to the smaller dressing area, which was a medium sized room with 3 chairs. It was kind of a tight fit with 3 of us and 2 stylists. There was a robe for me to wear in between dresses so that was nice. I showed the stylist and her intern my Kleinfeld pinterest board and when asked my budget, which was under $2000, she made a face and a rude comment, then said she'll see what she can do. Right way that left a bad taste in my mouth. FYI, Kleinfeld has a section on their website with gowns under $2000 and ALL of my pinned dresses were from that section. They went out and returned with 4 dresses, were my style. I tried on 2 of them and based on how I felt, I asked if I could see what they had in store. She led me to a room and I went through them and kept going back and forth showing her specific photos from pinterest and having her pull those for me. The intern was very nice and helpful, she unzipped every dress and held it for me to step into. However, they didn't pin all of the dresses to fit so I had a hard time seeing how it would look on me.

All of the dresses from Kleinfeld were very heavy, and I'm having a beach wedding, so I wasn't too keen on any of them, and it showed. My mom asked if I wanted to see dresses in the $3000 range, and I said not really. The 2 stylists left the room and came back not even 5 mins later with 2 dresses from Michelle Roth, a designer who was having a trunk show there. Then I met Michelle and she brought some more dresses for me to try. This was the first time that the senior stylist showed any enthusiasm during my appointment. I felt like they kept pushing me to buy the more expensive dress. Only when I had one of those on did she insist that I go out to the main salon (where they film SYTTD) and put a veil on me etc. 

So 3 appointments later, I still have no dress, but I have some contenders from each store. I'm back in Toronto and I'll make some dress appointments and hopefully I can find my dress with a decent price tag.

""-Increasing our social media and community presence. We’ve actively been sharing much more content, running paid ads (which we’re current A/B testing several campaign sets on Facebook) to drive traffic to our Facebook, Telegram, and the TLC product. We’re shifting focus away from Slack (including making all the necessary adjustments to our pages) to double-down on Telegram as our main communication channel while we’re updating the Reddit. One of our biggest issues is our bifurcated community, as those interested in WeTrust aren’t sure if the (closed) Slack, Telegram, one of the “Unofficial” pages that have popped up, Reddit, Twitter, etc. are where they should be engaging with us. As we scale certain channels up, like Telegram, we’re confident that this will help solve that issue. Expect more AMAs (including in major crypto communities) coming your way as well, with many being hosted as livestreamed video. We’ll also be moving forward with a referral program and giveaways (including Airdrops) to incentivize community members to share about WeTrust/TLC so we can expand our reach and gain valuable feedback.

Community is honestly the lifeblood of any blockchain company. We wouldn’t able to do this without the support of you all, so please know that everyone here at WeTrust truly values the fact that you’re even taking time out of your day to read through this today. While we can’t RT all of your posts or share every meme (especially if they pertain to coin value), you can be confident that we’re all seeing them and it’s helping fuel our growth.

-Press. We’ve been leveraging our connections at major national publications, networks, and influencer groups to ensure more regular media exposure is coming our way. We don’t want to list any features before they’ve officially been released, but we’ve already given interviews to one top publication in fintech and have a few more in the works. Even smaller mentions, like the CoinTelegraph hit from yesterday and this one from today that lists us alongside Coinbase and Ripple as the three rising blockchain fintech companies, are extremely helpful as they’re reaching those already active in the blockchain/crypto space. In that same vein, the AMAs we’re doing in active crypto communities on FB and Reddit are going to be a huge focus for us, so if you have any connections in these communities, please let us know on Telegram.

-Branding overhaul. A new Styling &amp; Branding Guide is nearly complete- and those revised branding elements (not just designs, but copy as well) will be applied to all of our social channels, sites, swag (yes, that’ll mean community swag giveaways, WeTrust shirts for those heavily engaged) , and more to ensure we’re conveying a more professional, established image.

-Events. We have several conferences that we’ll be attending in the coming months and for a few of them, we have arranged to be giving talks and/or maintaining a demo booth. We’ll also be hosting smaller events for influencers in San Francisco and have been approved to run our first within the next two weeks at The Node, SF’s private crypto club. We already have a few other local partners in the blockchain space that are eager to partner up for these more intimate events (at The Node, their HQs, WeWork, and with student groups like Blockchain at Berkeley). Given our close proximity to Stanford, we’re exploring sponsoring hackathons, lunch and learn sessions, and research projects with the Stanford GSB.

-Leveraging our advisors. Working closely with our advisors to leverage their connections/networks (for marketing, partnerships, etc.). For example, we’ll be back at the office on Saturday morning to sit down with Michael Casey (MIT Media Lab, CoinDesk) and go over our plan for 2018.
-Partnerships. Arguably the strongest marketing lift we’re going to see will come from partnerships, especially if those partners have large networks and are willing to help drive traffic our way (we hope to share some exciting developments soon). We’ve been in conversation with multiple other blockchain companies looking to build products on the WeTrust platform or integrate other aspects of our technology, marketing partners (often those also focused on social good) looking to run reciprocal campaigns, and global partners who can increase visibility for us in other ways through their addition of WeTrust/our tech onto their platforms.

It’s always been our primary mission to have our products serve the needs of the unbanked, underbanked, and those facing issues that make traditional financial services offerings a poor option. We’ve made inroads with several of these communities who we feel will be able to receive the most potential value from our product(s)- affording us feedback to better refine these product according to their specific needs while helping serve as case studies as we begin to expand to other groups.

-Strategic hires. Several PR teams are currently being evaluated and we’ll be onboarding interns from top local Universities to secure more bandwidth for our department leads and CoFounders.

-Having a plan. Since joining, I’ve drafted up a full action plan with clear milestones/defined goals. We’ve outlined how/where other teams members can be leveraged to assist with marketing, crafted posting/content schedules, identified the strengths and weaknesses in our marketing efforts to date, are actively giving structure and direction to our community and team of moderators, and have taken steps to maximize reach whenever one of our marketing initiatives is successful.

2017 was our year to build the team, products, processes, and structure of WeTrust. 2018 is our chance to step a bit outside of our comfort zone, making marketing, growth, and product adoption our top areas of focus."""

7vquhz,3,2018-02-06,Freshman Summer Internships - a few questions,JHG0,AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/7vquhz/freshman_summer_internships_a_few_questions/,"I'm beginning to look for internships for this summer (a little late - I know). 

1) I'm wondering what the best way to approach this is in terms of finding opportunities. Big companies (Boeing, NASA, SpaceX, etc.) are obvious, but how should I go about finding smaller companies to intern at?

2) Stipend/housing. I go to school in DC (and could stay there over the summer) and live in South Florida. I would be more than happy moving somewhere over the summer. For undergrads, is housing/transportation at least somewhat affordable/accessible? Do companies generally have some recommendations on what to do if you are accepted for a position.

3) Is there anything I can work on this semester to help make my resume better. By completion of this semester, I will have experience with MATLAB, AutoCAD, and SolidEdge. I also know Java, HTML, and CSS. Also involved with AIAA's Design, Build, Fly and will likely get machine shop certification at some point. 

EDIT: I also have a 3.52 GPA

Any advice would be appreciated. "
7vr7xd,7,2018-02-06,Husband possibly getting MLIS,lentimentall,librarians,https://www.reddit.com/r/librarians/comments/7vr7xd/husband_possibly_getting_mlis/,"So my husband is finishing his bachelors (interdisciplinary- mix of english and computer science) and is planning to go into our MLIS program. I'm very encouraging but today, I have so much anxiety. He's had a late start in life and doesn't have as much experience as he'd like in anything. We're financially 'ok' with family support and we're both working. He's in food delivery so that looks good with customer service, right?

He definitely fits the description of a librarian personality and I've always seen him doing it. But I'm afraid of him wasting any of his time on something that won't get him a career sooner than later. He's been there before and doesn't want to go through that disappointment.

He knows some computer sciences programming and HTML/CSS so he has a leg up there. He does not want to go into a computer science career. He's trying very hard to find any opportunities with our local libraries- volunteer, internship, shadowing, part time, etc. He's going to finish his undergrad, take the MAT and apply this year.

Should I be afraid of this career choice? We're willing to move anywhere for his job so, surely, that will help in the future job search? Should he get an MLIS with School Library Licensure? The program itself is affordable. There's other dual majors offered in the program as well.

What else can he do to strengthen his chances of getting a job in libraries (public, school, private, etc)?"

7vs7wj,1,2018-02-06,How can I [F20] help my bf [M20] through his potential depression,clickwait,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7vs7wj/how_can_i_f20_help_my_bf_m20_through_his/,"FTP LTL on mobile etc.
So my boyfriend has very big goals in his life, and measures his success by all these big things. For example, he's a Finance major and he feels like going to school will have been wasted if he doesn't get a big finance job and that'll just be a failure and be unable to be happy. But at the same time, he doesn't work very hard for these goals. Like he gets decent grades but not high enough to qualify him for the internships he wants, and he definitely could have done better in his class if he put in more work. Or he thinks his resume is holding him back but doesn't participate in anything new to put on it. 
The thing is, I have suspected that he has anxiety/depression for quite a while, and j think this is a big part of what's holding him back. He went to our University counseling office once last semester but didn't really open up to them enough for it to do anything. It took a really low point for me to be able to convince him to go so I don't know that I could convince him to go in again and be really open.
But all of this led up to a fight because he got into a spiral about how he's so far behind all his classmates in terms of professional experiences and such and how his GPA is so bad and how he's never going to get a job etc. And I wasn't the most sympathetic because he gets really sad about this a lot and never takes any steps to do anything about it, any steps come from me pushing. 
So how do I help him push through and find his will power and make progress towards his goals?"

7vsj29,0,2018-02-06,Roommate is a Hard Drug User POS who has Teamed up with Roommate #3 to piss me off,zedommerevil,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7vsj29/roommate_is_a_hard_drug_user_pos_who_has_teamed/,"**TLDR: Roommates refuse to change lease. One Roommate is a drunk/druggie who dared to insinuate I was irresponcible because of one single mistake with money**  

So, in July I moved into this townhouse with a couple roommates I met off craigslist. I was going back to school in a new city, so it seemed like a good fit. One roommate (T) had lived there for two years but his brother and sister who were sharing the house with him had moved cities.

T (who is 22/M) had found a third, who I will call L (24/M), who T knew vaguely as a friend of a friend. I am 35/m, so I knew there may be some conflict, but T was very mature and seemed very clean cut. No college, but a stable job. I never met L before moving in, but was told he was a server at a high end restaurant (so had weird hours), was pretty reasonable. I was told that L smoked weed occasionally, and drank more then T. But also that he was fairly decent.

Well, me and T got along okay for the first month or so, but from the get go me and L butted heads. When I signed the lease I made it clear that I thought it was for the school year, ending in June. I had plans to intern elsewhere after that. I read the lease and find that it was a year long lease (this was never told to me). I bring this up with the landlord and T/L, and while T and the landlord are okay with this, L is not, though he does eventually agree. 

We try and set up the meeting, but L's work schedule makes it hard for all of us to meet up and sign the new lease. So I assume he will take the initiative to set up a time. After a few weeks and no word on that front I ask what's up with it, and L tells me he was wondering the exact same thing. When I confront him over it, both he and T start complaining that neither of them had any issue with the lease, so why should they be responsible for changing it, they assumed I should be the one to deal with it. T offers to contact the landlord and see if the offer is still on the table and me and him could sign the new lease first and L could sign it when he was available. 

Admittedly, at this point I get heated. Mainly because I don't trust L to actually go through with it, and because it should have been L's responcibility to start. The next day T informs me that the Landlord is no longer willing to amend the lease, so I assume they just didn't want it amended and so pushed it back until it was no longer a choice.

Now, shortly after moving in it became clear that L was way more then just an occasional weed smoker. He is almost always high on weed, and his drinking is out of control as well. It seems like he goes out with friends and gets pretty drunk 2-3 times a week. My younger brother is a junkie, so granted I don't put up with alcoholism, or really drugs. I was ok with an occasional weed smoker, it's not a big deal, but excessive drinking and/or drug use of any kind sets me off. So I really wanted that amended lease, but even without it I was confident I could stick it out. 

Then two months ago I saw L's phone sitting out on the table. I checked it to find the time, but apparently he had unlocked it so when I hit the power button it went straight to a message thread in which he and a friend are talking about a party over the weekend, talking about a variety of hard drugs. They mention using cocaine, as well as Ecstasy, and 'passing around a shatter pen' which I assume is slang for huffing sharpies or something.

As I said, I have a no tolerance rule for anything above weed. Maybe there are decent hard drug users out there; I have never met them. So I confront him, in front of T just in case, pretty much saying that in my mind he has a month to find an acceptable subletter and move out. If he refuses I will contact the landlord and call the cops to both our house and the house he had the party at.

He just explodes on me, literally explodes yelling that I'm the one in the wrong because, ""Despite using drugs I'm actually able to be independent and keep the house in a good shape, and at least responsible enough to pay f*cking rent on time!"" To be fair, I was a few days late on rent once because my father, who is paying my rent while I am in school, forgot to transfer the money to me. 

I turn to T and pretty much say, ""See?"" T then basically tells me that L is right, and nobody is going to be kicked out, that I needed to get back on L's good graces or find a subletter myself because he wasn't going to deal with petty arguments and that, in his oppinion, L does a majority of the chores in the house and is a better roommate despite maybe being a bit too into partying. 

I'm about to contact the landlord and get the fuck out of here. Since that blow up a month ago it hasn't been getting any better. L is ignoring me, and seemingly bugging me even more. This superbowl sunday he got home at fucking 5AM, absolutely trashed. Lucky for me I have put up cameras out in the hall in case I need to take this to court, so I know this. 

I may or may not have called the plumbers to show up at 11AM the next day to fix an ongoing issue, so at least I got a little revenge!

I'm a junior in college and I was a visitor services intern last summer who has spent the passed month and a half applying to Student Trainee positions and Park Guide positions at nps sites all over the country. I'm expecting a wave of results soon just telling me if I've made it through the computers and I've been referred for a handful already.

How should I go about following up with hiring managers after being referred? Phone call? Email? Should I touch base at all or just pray for an interview? I've read conflicting opinions on this so I just wanted to know for sure. 

Also is it unheard of to reach out to a hiring manager after the computer rejects your application if you feel you can make a case for yourself?

7vth0u,9,2018-02-06,Where We've Been: A Follow Up,JBTalman,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/7vth0u/where_weve_been_a_follow_up/,"This is an update from a post a few months ago: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/7cr80d/well_where_have_you_been_how_our_last_week/

The initial merging of crews went about as well as expected. Despite both restaurants serving similar enough cuisine, our approaches were otherwise as different as they could be. We cooked and ground our own meats; they buy pre-cooked ""pork product."" Our prep included hand-breading, chopping, clarifying, caramelizing, and blending; their prep is merely stock. Most importantly, we used a flavorful cheese blend that was wholly unique; they use tasteless, imitation mozzarella. It goes without saying that our crew was a little uncomfortable with the new product.

After a few weeks the factions began to mix and meld some, after snap judgments wore off and spontaneous tomfoolery brought us some shared laughs. But another issue began to sort people into new groups: those whose toes felt stepped on by bringing in outside employees to serve over managers and those who misplacing blame in order not to be outranked by newcomers.

The most important member of the latter group is a FOH employee who maintained rank in the change. She openly flirts with the new GM, berates subordinates (from both front and back) for minor issues, and excludes herself from standards she sets for others. Worst of all, she takes credit where she can and deflects blame at any opportunity. While it's all behavior I can't personally stand, it seems to be well-received among the ownership/upper-management.

With all this to consider, I was the first to volunteer when they announced that there would be another location opening and a need to staff it. It seemed like a great opportunity to start fresh and get a feel for whether I was disappointed by the new product or the new team. Since that announcement, opening day has been pushed back multiple times and the debate on how to split the team across the locations has proven contentious.

One BOH supervisor was told he was going, no discussion. Luckily for him it was time to look for an apartment and one within walking distance of the new location was available (he doesn't drive and his day-by-day expenses prevent him from saving up). The delays in opening are nearing an overlap with his move-in date and he's anxious about the added stress of adapting to an unreliable public transit system. The consensus is that he's only being transferred because of the GM's dislike of his personality (his work ethic and knowledge are not an issue).

These issues all take a backseat to my biggest frustration. I'm a college senior set to graduate in a few months whose worked full-time throughout my education. As a result, I don't have an internship to tout on my resume which by all accounts is a major prerequisite in the field I'm entering. When I expressed this concern early on, the GM quickly promised that he would allow me access to social media accounts and work with me to pay for me to put together an IMC (blueprint for marketing strategy) while I finished college so that he could keep me around. Since our initial conversation he's made two mentions of it in managers' meetings where he lays out a big picture, long term goal that the owners have in mind. That big picture may as well be the train tunnel Wiley E. Coyote paints on rock faces.

I hate to throw in the towel on the remainder of my crew, but the more time I take to consider whether the nonsense surrounding me has crossed a line the more I begin to think it was crossed months ago.

I want to end this on a happy note though. About mid-January I got sick of the funk I found myself in and decided to make as much change in my life as I could. I gave up fast food, stopped drinking daily, and began reading more. As a result, I'm down fifteen pounds and would be up about a grand if it weren't for tuition and car problems.

End rant. Thanks for listening."

I was wondering if you guys had any advice about legal, business, marketing, etc. when starting your own death positive / sustainable death care business.  I post on here a lot (hi my names Andi) and as a 17 year old trying to grasp the possibilities of the death positive movement this page has been really helpful.  Everybody on here is so kind and willing to help and have shaped in my journey through the death world.  Anyways, I was wondering if I could get help/advice/questions/anything about a big project I'm working on.

I'm interning for a lovely company called Pahiki Eco-Caskets here in Honolulu.  I'm trying to put together a lot of projects for them including a green cemetery, a death positive education program (for both students, adults, hospitals, funeral homes, the whole shebang), and possibly even a funeral home much like Undertaking LA.  I know it's probably a little ambitious, but I can see a future of sustainable death practices and death positivity mixing and growing with the already abundant culture here in Hawai'i.  I may be young, but this is something I dream about and I want it to happen so badly and I want it to happen soon.  This is where I need help.

The two owners of the company I'm working for are understandably busy and my boss, Cortney is actually working two jobs so sometimes her energy can't be entirely devoted to Pahiki.  Hopefully as time goes on and this business grows she'll be able to focus on it more, but in the meantime things are moving along slowly.  I'm trying to be a good little intern and am attempting to do a lot of the research/planning for starting all of these things. I'm working on the content behind them, the planning, and even have been exploring some marketing options for us. Unfortunately, I am 17 and I've been having a difficult time starting these things.  If you guys have any advice, if you know people in Hawai'i who will be interested in this, if you have stories involving the death industry (here or elsewhere), if you want to do a collaboration with my company, or even if you have questions please send them my way.  I think like a lot of teenagers my first job is a big deal for me and I feel like I have been especially pouring my heart and soul into this so anything you guys want to comment or advice on is fantastic.  I may be small and I may know everything about the industry yet and that's okay.  I just want to try my hardest to make my vision come true and help continue this movement in my state.

7vu9bd,1031,2018-02-07,Taint my name so ill get you expelled from school (and ruin your life?),BroghanTaylor,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/7vu9bd/taint_my_name_so_ill_get_you_expelled_from_school/,"kind of long sorry also its 2am i know there are grammer/spelling errors i tried to get them all.

So this happened around 12ish years ago. I was in highschool a private one, that offered sports scholarships to the best players in the state to come here to play. So it was a very nice school. Alittle back stor  I was insanely popular my 9th and 10th grade year. I made varsity cheer leading my freshman year! which was unheard of because my school had a freshman team, a JV, and then varsity. I made it because i did competitive cheerleading/gymnastics for years outside of school. I also did pageants and alittle modeling... I went to 5 proms in those 2 years i was that dream popular. dating 11-12 graders went out with friends all the time i loved it.  I was pretty well liked I was also known that even tho i was dating order guys i would not have sex.

This was my 10th grade year I was dating this guy, lets call him Garen. Garen was a football player. I was the cheerleader it was like prefect couple. I would hang out with him after school at school a lot. My aunt who raised me was very strict so a lot of the time i would be like i have blah blah blah club after school come get me at 5 and i would just hang out in the school afterwards, which was allowed since there were so many clubs and stuff going on. He really wanted me to do things with him sexually. I never wanted to he didn't press it much, but he did press it enough i was questioning staying with him. One day a photo went around (this is right when camera phones were just coming out so they were kind of sucky) It was a top down and was a girls top of the head she had the same hair cut/style as me and she was giving him oral sex. You could tell it was him by his shoes. I doodled on the tops of his shoes one day at lunch. And he told everyone i gave him head and painted me out to me a slut. I called him out on it he was like well everyone things you are one now why don't you just blow me since everyone thinks you did it anyway. I broke up with him. but everyone laughed at me i was tarnished. It caused for about a few weeks a lot of people to join him and it made high school hell for me. No one believed me because they had picture proof. it got even worse because he started saying things like my dad didn't die and a car crash he killed himself to get away from me, because i was just a horrible daughter. Saying I shame my family and it became to much.

 None of my friends talked to me. Lunch i ended up sitting with 3 boys; one that didn't speak English well, one that every time he heard an airplane go by would try to stick his head out the window and see if he could tell what type of plane it was, and this guy everyone thought was a drug dealer/gonna shoot up the school because he wore a trench coat to school everyday (he was really cool actually). Anyway i wanted my life back I missed it. i had 2 ideas. I made a fake myspace (dating myself here arent i) and flirted with him a bunch i was playing a 8th grader coming into the school next year for cheerleading. He fell for it and they chatted for weeks and i got info from him. The girl who was in the picture was his cousins best friend who did it for 150 bucks. and he said some nasty things about me as well. Adding on to the dad killing himself thing to how i should just kill myself to save everyone at school from being near a nasty STD ridden whore i was.  I got all of it and printed it out. Went to the office and showed them one the bullying and the horrible things he said. Also told alittle lie saying this was my niece who was very interested in the school (not a fake account) and this is how he was showing the school in a very negtivie light which is a HUGE nono. He was bought down to the office and expelled 2 days later. During this time i also sent his mom all the nasty texts that he sent when we were dating to show what a gentlemen her son was. I heard this part was rumor that he got in police trouble because of the paying for a blowjob but im not 100% on that part. 

Things cleared up and i reliased i didnt want to be that person anymore so i dropped cheerleading and became friends with the ""geeks"" and finished highschool a year early i was over it. So i thank him for making me see that that girl wasn't me. 

After i finished college i was home visiting and went to go see a movie went to my local Wawa to get some candy since its cheaper I saw him working there. He looked horrible he got really fat and hairy and was just gross looking. He was so rude to me and i was just being so nice (like disney world taught me during my internship) That made him even ruder, so i went to his manger and told him about what happened (not the highschool thing just how he was treating me) just to rub extra salt in the wound i guess. I got a facebook msg from him 3-4 days later saying i ruined his life i got him expelled from school which made him lose his football scholarship to college, his mom kicked him out and he had to live with his alcoholic dad, and now he lost his job that took him years to get. I looked at his facebook had a laugh then blocked him. He tried to make himself look good with beautiful girls in his arms... they were his sisters and cousins.

Tl-Dr Guy made me out to be a slut got the whole school to hate me i got him expelled lose a scholarship his mom kick him out and his job many years later

Recently her roommate beat her and the boyfriend of her roommate just watched. She called me crying. I rushed to pick her up and helped her move out her stuff to storage. I took her to a couple of hotels that week and stood by her side for her court dates and helped her get to her second job. A few friends helped her by letting her stay. I couldn't because I live with relatives.

Eventually I helped her get her stuff into her new apartment and her mom moved in with her.

A week later things went sour with a girl I liked. She basically ghosted on me. So I kept to myself that weekend. I came to work to buy something I needed. My friend was there so I went to go see how she was doing. Seeing her felt good since I was depressed at the time. But she ignored me.

I messaged her the next day asking if she was ok. She told me she wanted to part ways and didn't feel like a friend anymore. She didn't feel the vibe anymore, even during that time I was helping her. She pointed out that day I came to the job saying she felt I was clingy because I showed up with no notice.

Pointed that she felt I got too close.

I didn't wanna argue so I said I was sorry if I made her feel uncomfortable. And I'll respect her wishes. So until New Years I completely ignored her. On New Years Eve, she paged my department, I answered and she was pretending she could not hear me. Even though I called that extension 15 minutes ago and another associate answered.

That night I went up to her and just wanted to let her know I wasn't mad and just wanted us to stop being dumb. I was being prideful and avoiding her because I didn't know what to say.

Before I could say much she told me I should talk to the manager. I'm like ""Why?"". And she tells me that he told her to let him know if I try to speak to her.

I look at her like ""Why would you do that? I didn't do anything to you"".

She ignored me and was just straight up cold.

I just looked at her shook my head and said ""Really?"" and walked away.

My manager came by and asked what was up with the two of us. I told him ""No idea. We haven't spoken in a while over a misunderstanding. I just wanted to talk it out and she does this."" Even he was confused because he knows that she went to me for help, and knows we were good friends. He just suggested to stay away. I agreed.

I think I'm just gonna quit that place. I'm almost done with my internship and will go full time soon. I feel stabbed in the back by someone I looked out for and was close with for years.

I really didn't expect for our friendship to be fixed but to go to that extreme? I spoke to another friend about it and they noticed that she changed since she went back on her feet.


 So still don't speak to her and now I completely avoid her. But it's agonizing. Just heard she started dating a new guy at work and she's all happy. Funny thing is she's always feigned for a BF. Firs time I met her she was head over heals over some dude in another department. He treated her like shit. I took her home one time and she saw a couple kissing at a bus stop and she was like ""Awww, I want that soo bad!"" Which was weird. Thing is she's told my co worker ""Guess what!I got a boyfriend!""

 Cool I guess. Yes it sucks. Because I'll admit, I grew feelings for her over that time. I just felt protective and wanted so much to help her more than I could. 

One weird thing happened when she came to one of the ails. She said ""Hey friend! Hey friend"". I looked back and she saw me. But IDK if she was talking to my co worker who was right next to me because she said his name after. Though it's weird because I never seen them talk(old guy). I just looked away. Still upset after what she did. If she was talking to me she would've put more effort. Friends say that she was just fucking with me. 

  Recently a friend told me she felt bad about losing me. It made me think. I just asked her to let her know I'm not angry at her. Nor am I resentful. Right now it's hard for me to even look at her because of what  she did.

   I have no hope that she'll come back though."

I managed to hold a job for 9 months (3 months is usually my cut off point), and I’m wanting to get back into work since my last job was an internship so it came to an end recently.

I’ve gone from not being able to function to being pretty high functioning, motivated to get working and keep going. I’m not suicidal, I haven’t self harmed in months, I have a wonderful boyfriend and wonderful friends and I’m actually working towards a career and sticking to it.

Despite all of this, I’ve been depersonalising frequently and really badly. It’s as though when I’m feeling good, I don’t feel real because I’ve never felt good before. Ever.

I feel good but hollow, if that makes sense. Like I’m faking my way through life so I don’t self destruct. 

It’s like when I’m not horrifically depressed, when I’m not pushing people away or doing things that I know will end badly, I just feel empty. If I’m not in some sort of pain I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel like I exist at all.

I almost self harmed the other day just because I felt like such a ghost, and I wanted to feel something because all I was feeling was nothing.

Is this what BPD does? If you’re not allowing it to destroy you then it just makes you feel like you’re non-existent, like you’re pretending to live. And if you do give in to it, you become this monster who hurts everyone around you in order to ultimately hurt yourself.

I’m just really tired of living with this stupid disorder. I hate living with it, I hate the stigma that surrounds it because I feel like if I mention it to people, they’re just going to hate me and think I’m an awful person. I hate that I don’t even know who I am, that I look back on my life and realise I haven’t got a clue who I am.

Ugh. Sorry this is so long but I’m really sick of being mentally ill and needed somewhere to vent."

ALL NUMBERS ARE CANADIAN DOLLAR.

I currently have 14k debt total.

1000 on visa;
2000 on 0% for 12 month card;
9000 student loans no payments for 12 months
1600 to my dad don't even know if i'll have to pay this.

My only monthly income come the summer will be my Cryptomining Rigs which make me roughly 750 a monthly. 

Am I okay? because I am always thinking about it. I have a tentative job offer from bank after the internship too but it is effeminately not on paper. 

Just worried about the future.

Appreciated."

I am an A&amp;P student currently, and I am in the process of applying for a paid summer internship at Duncan Aviation in Battle Creek, MI. I would like some advice on what to put on my resume, specifically because I don't have any real world experience since I'm still a student. My current job is at IT at the main college campus.

‪Fiona was anxious to start the second semester of her freshman year. So anxious in fact that by the time she left for her first class at 11am, she had already polished off the pack of cigarettes she had opened up and smoked five of the night before in the 2 hours after she woke up. She had a class at 11 and then 2 back to back from 1-1:50 and 2-2:50. She scheduled those classes back to back because it seemed like they'd help her with the accounting major that she was leaning toward. ‬

‪She opened up her second pack as she walked to her car to drive over to campus, and by the time she found a spot in the parking lot she was now about to be late to class. She had about 5 minutes to get to class, about a 8 minute walk away. She was very anxious and lit up a cigarette to calm her nerves. She walked as fast as she could as she raced to the Business Building where her Biology 200 class was about to start. She took a double drag as she opened the building door with a minute to spare. She held the smoke in her chest as best she could and let as much of it out as she stomped out her cigarette. ‬

‪She snuck in the back door of the room as the professor greeted the class. There was a syllabus on her desk and she noticed a small but gorgeous Asian girl sitting next to her. Fiona noticed smoke seeping out of her nostrils from her last lung bursting inhale and hold. ""Sorry"" Fiona muttered to the beautiful woman sitting next to her, when Fiona noticed her squirming in her seat as the smoke tendrils drifted in her direction. Fiona noticed that this woman had soft features and looked nearly porcelain, but she had long black hair that had some blonde highlights in it. ‬

‪The woman smiled and whispered, ""I'm only fidgety because it's been an hour since I smoked. I'm more jealous than anything."" ‬

‪The professor was reading the syllabus to the class so Fiona decided to write her new smoker friend a note. She wrote, ""Fiona Jones, Freshman, Potential Accounting Major, Marlboro Light 100s, 3-4 packs a day."" and passed it over. The other woman took the note, read it and smiled. She spent a second scribbling a note back and passed it back to Fiona. Fiona opened it and saw, ""Erica Wong, Junior, Business Major, Marlboro Menthol Lights 100s, 2-3 packs a day."" They smiled at each other and the professor droned on. Finally, just as Fiona started to realize how bad her craving was, the professor dismissed the class for the day. Fiona noticed Erica had already placed a cigarette in her mouth and pulled out her lighter. Fiona decided to do the same. ‬

‪The two smokers walked out of the building together. Both of them lit their cigarettes and double pumped. Fiona then realized she was dealing with a very sophisticated smoker who looked the part. Erica was wearing a black dress with a black cardigan. She was about 5'7"" and very skinny. She looked like someone who had been through a lot but managed to keep themselves together despite it all. She also dragged on her cigarette like she was never going to be able to smoke again. They both laughed out their torrents of smoke and said hi at the same time. ""Isn't that class a little advanced for you?"" The older girl said to Fiona. ‬

‪""It might be, but I got an A and an invitation to TA next year in Accounting 201."" Fiona said and took a drag. ‬

‪""Nicely done, I hope you don't think I was being presumptuous. Us smokers have to stick together and there are fewer and fewer in accounting firms every year."" Erica said while she began pulling a second cigarette out of her pack. ‬

‪""No problem, I'd say the same thing if the shoe was on the other foot."" Fiona laughed as she lit another cigarette. ‬

‪""It's really great to see another accounting major with a major cigarette habit. My parents told me when I started smoking that I was going to have a lot of problems with my career. But in all honesty, three VPs at the firm I interned at last summer smoked and I got offered a bigger internship with them because I was out there with them 4 times a day everyday."" Erica said.‬

‪""No shit?"" Fiona said, as she pulled on her second cigarette of her two hour break. ""My Mom always would say, 'Just smoke, if you do the job right, they won't care.' So I smoke, and whatever happens happens."" ‬

‪""My parents hate my smoking, they feel like it's me trying to forget my roots, like I could forget being homeless because my parents came over in shipping containers? I started smoking because it represented class to me. And now I love it and taught my little 15 year old sister to do it while I was home. I wish everyone would smoke, don't you?"" Erica said as she let loose with another stream of smoke. ‬

‪""Trust me, I'm trying to spread the smoking gospel as best I can. Look, I got another 2 hours to kill before my next class, I want to grab some coffee and chain smoke. You wanna join?"" Fiona said. Fiona figured she may have a lead on her entrepreneur, but wanted to make sure. ‬

‪""Lemme guess, you're taking Latimer at 1 for Business Structure? I got an A in that last year. I'd love to join, I have a great idea as to how to get more smokers on campus and I didn't know any freshman until now."" She pulled out a third cigarette and lit it. ‬

‪""Let's go, I want to hear all about this."" Fiona said as she started to walk to the Student Union. ‬

‪""So how'd you become such a prolific smoker?"" Erica asked Fiona who proceeded to tell her the whole story of squirreling away cigarettes as a pre-teen to graduating high school with a 2 pack habit and how all the free time in college got her to double that while the ladies got to the union and got their coffee before heading back out to smoke more. ‬

‪""Wow"" Erica said, lighting up another Marlboro Menthol Light 100 ""I thought my story was wild. I actually started smoking in college, but escalated quickly. My parents and I were dirt poor growing up, with us moving into places with a little bit of money my parents would get from odd jobs and stay until we were evicted. No one could ever tell unless they looked at my school records but I moved 40 times in our hometown in 16 years. Things finally got better when my Dad got hit by a bus. He's okay now but the city paid us 25 million after taxes because the driver was high, ran a red light and had worked a 23 hour shift to that point. So all of the sudden we were rich."" She lit up another cigarette as Fiona did the same. ‬

‪Huffing out her first drag she continued, ""So, we moved to a new town and started over. I was rich and new and it was wonderful. All the popular kids accepted me though I was brilliant. They all smoked and kept trying to get me started, but I was so scared of disappointing my parents that I never tried it. The second I got here though, I fell into 'The Asian Crowd' and they all smoked mentholated cigarettes because why fight stereotypes?"" She laughed and paused for another drag. ‬

‪Fiona jumped in, ""I'm a preppy white girl from the suburbs who smokes Marlboro Light 100s. I know the feeling."" She laughed out a 4 second drag she was holding in while she said it. ‬

‪""Fair point, anyway, I got drunk my second week in college and one of my friends have me a cigarette and that was it. Smoking took place of eating in terms of priorities. My parents gave me a 5 million of that 25 which goes to whatever I want since my room and board are paid for. I invested most of it, which has multiplied my 4 million into 25 million already. So I spend my money on smokes. My parents hate it but I can't get enough of my lungs being full of smoke. My sister was fascinated by my smoking when I came home after first semester, I told her to wait until she was 15, which she turned last month. So I got her smoking a pack a day already in 3 weeks. My parents will find out soon but they can deal. Smoking is the best!"" Erica said, she lit her 5th cigarette of the last 20 minutes and laughed. ‬

‪""That's awesome! I'm an only child, but I have a different way to spread the smoking gospel."" She put her 5th cigarette of the last 20 minutes in the corner of her mouth as she rummaged through her bag. ""Give me a second"" she said as bursts of smoke came out of the sides of her mouth. ""There it is!"" She said. She took a cheek hollowing pull on her cigarette for about 6 seconds and breathed in deeply. She blew out a long tight stream of smoke and said, ""I left out a small detail earlier, when I wasn't sure about you. My mom was a founding member of a sorority of smokers at her college and in starting it here. I'm allowed to invite anyone I want in so long as they are woman, intelligent and a smoker and meet one of 25 requirements. This letter is for you and will explain more details. You want in?""‬

‪""Yeah I do, I love to smoke and I know I'll be able to spread the word better this way, plus if we can find a way to make money out of it, I would love to help. Meeting is Saturday? What time?"" Erica said. ‬

‪""Yes at 7, details are in there. I'm so glad you'll think about it. There are some serious perks if you do join, I can guarantee you that. But I got to run to class. See you Wednesday? I'd love to do this again."" Fiona crushed out another cigarette into the overflowing ashtray on the table they had shared for the past hour and a half. ‬

‪""Sounds good to me. Have a good one, I'll give you my notes for Latimer on Wednesday."" Erica smiled as she sat back and lit up another cigarette. ‬

‪Fiona got up, lit another cigarette walked to class, ""Well I got my one, hopefully the other girls have some good luck."" She thought to herself as she started to walk across campus. ‬"

Advise me oh great ones.",higherpublic,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7vyvwu/need_to_buy_a_used_car_in_4_months_newbad_credit/,"Hi guys, so my car broke down a few months ago and it's been hell. My internship starts in June and its way too far to Uber back and forth. 

Altogether after saving by July I'd have maybe $7,500, out of the 12-13 I've determined that I need to buy a certified used car that's worth a damn. I'm going to need loan for the difference. I have 3-4 months to boost my credit for this purpose. At the same time, I'm not planning on having that loan for much longer than September, as my internship will be very high paying and I'd have no comparable income after. 

Facts about my credit: 

Score: 571 (Equifax &amp; TransUnion) 

-1 credit card, never missed a payment, 4 student loan accounts (still in school). All accounts in good standing, no missed payments.

-110% utilization on the cc, I know that this is killing me.

-1 deragotory mark which is a collection for a cell phone mishap for my mother that I never responded to. It's from Dec 2015 for $300. Is this worth addressing or keeping the $300 for the car?

- average credit age 2 years and 4 months. I have no one in my family who has good enough credit that can add me as an authorized user to boost this.

I've already taken steps to decrease my utilization by trying for a freedom. A hard pull, but not an immediate approval nor rejection so I will be calling the ReCon line and doing my best to get it approved. Also I've disputed a 2 year old PayPal hard pull I had no idea was on there. Obviously all that's left is to pay my CC in full.

Would I be able to get an auto loan for the remaining $6k difference if my down payment is so high? Is it even possible to get an auto loan for such a low amount? Would it even be possible for me currently? What about after 3 months of addressing my credit?

Any other advice? Thank you.

7vzodj,2,2018-02-07,I never should have followed my heart,sleepingfox17,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7vzodj/i_never_should_have_followed_my_heart/,"I hate where I am in life now. Everything within my body and soul is desperate to blame different people and situations, but I know deep down the only one I can blame is myself. Which is just so much worse. Self-loathing is detrimental and so difficult to escape.

Where did it all go wrong? Probably when I had the gall to attend college in London, England, instead of here in my ""home country"" of the US. Boy they do NOT like it if you went somewhere else unless it was bloody Oxford (it wasn't). 

If that wasn't bad enough, of course I had to go and be stupid and fall in love with some Dutch charmer who convinced me we would be together forever so why don't you move to the Netherlands after graduation? OKAY SURE. So I went and did that. Got a Master's Degree in the Netherlands because why not, but that was stupid because now I have a degree from some other ""foreign country"" which American companies are distrustful of. Unless it's Oxford.

So. MA obtained. How useless it is. Suddenly I am ""overqualified"" for things I was applying for but still ""underqualified"" due to lack of experience because, oh yeah, I was one of those LAZY idiots who didn't do internships because, you know, ""I'll just go with the flow, whatever, it'll all work out. I'm in love, nothing else matters."" I hate me.

Suddenly I move back to the US because my visa runs out. Get a job quickly as a temp. Something stable that could possibly become permanent, so of course I try and figure out a way to ruin it. How? Oh, well, the love of my life gets this wonderful job so he can support us both so why don't I come back over and stay with him on a relationship visa? OKAY SURE.

Move to NL. Great. This is great. I get to pursue my dream of authorship and work on my book(s) and travel and be in love and wow I'm in Europe, isn't life grand?

Two years later. ""Love of my life"" no longer finds me to be the love of his and can't take the responsibility of a relationship visa anymore and would rather schtup his 20 year old intern because I guess, at 26, I was suddenly too old for his boyish sensibilities. He claimed he wanted to be ""free"" to explore all the opportunities of his blossoming career without having to take anyone else into consideration. But I'm thinking it was mostly just the intern.

Back to the US. To North Carolina, where my sister is, because there will be less competition than California, I thought. Precious 26 year old me forgot that North Carolina has like a million universities within 10 miles of each other so the graduate competition is fierce.

So here I am. A pathetic 27 year old with less than one year of proper work experience who's been living in NC for six months and cannot find a job. Six months of applying and I can't even snag myself a retail job. 

I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I don't know what the hell I'm going to do or how I'm going to get out of this. I was supposed to be more than this by now. I am nothing and it hurts.

Moral of the story: DON'T DO IT. DO NOT FOLLOW YOUR HEART. Your heart is stupid and it will lie to you. Ignore the fluffy love stuff the media throws out at you. The love you have with your SO is not unique and will most likely not stand the test of time. Let it be a piece of you, not all of you.

Make something of yourself. Early. Don't fall prey to love traps. Hold on tight to your ambition.

Never, never, NEVER put yourself in the position of being dependent on someone else. Especially if he's tall, charismatic and too handsome for his own good. Such a specimen cannot be trusted.


So much regret. I don't know how I will get out of this. Online job applications filter me out, emails to HR are most likely deleted, and any I send in the mail are chucked in the trash, I'm sure. 

I am sad. I am broken. I did everything wrong in the eyes of society in terms of education and work experience... which is all that matters in order to solidify a place in said society. 

At least I have my cat. "
7vzq75,3,2018-02-07,Ndad ppits me and my GCsister against each other and I feel totally helpless,SouthernComfort77,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7vzq75/ndad_ppits_me_and_my_gcsister_against_each_other/,"I apologize in advance if this is not the most organized post.

Some background... I graduated from Northwestern this past June and moved in with my Ndad and stepmom in September. I didn't live with him in high school because he was engaged to another women at the time (not current stepmom) who had two kids of her own. His hands were full with them. Since moving in, I've been coaching high-school sports but obviously that's not a full-time job/what I want to do with my life.

It's been clear for a while not that I am the SG and my younger sister is the GC. I didn't know about this terminology until recently but GOD DAMN has it been eye-opening. For years, my Ndad has been launching emotional kamikazes my way. It started after his nasty divorce from my mom when he would rant to me about how awful of a person my mom is, how she took all of his money in the divorce, how she's a liar and ruined his life, and then he would tell me that I am exactly like her. I don't think it helps that I resemble my mom. T.Hanks. Literally, this started when I was 7 (when they got divorced) and I'm 22 now and he has not shown signs of slowing down.

I could choose from a library of cheap shots he's taken at me, like him reminding me I am getting less than my sister in his will, but I need to get the most recent episode out of my head which may very well explode while writing this.

Two nights ago, my dad sends a group text to my mom, GCsister, and myself. In it, he addresses me in third person like I am not there. Here's the text...

""GC, I'm so proud that you find work during down times as your Mom and Dad, albeit we worked during and through college. Something neither you nor SG did. But I give credit to you, GC, as you have worked part time during school and on vacations. GC, you have done well. Your mom and I both worked during college and post Med school. I have no doubt that you, GC, will find a job after graduating from South Carolina with at least a 3.95 GPA. But your sister, it's been 7 months since graduation and still no full-time job?! I am truly worried for her future. GC, you are doing well.""

A few things real quick... I worked every summer or got an internship, just like my sister. I am SUPER EMBARRASSED about not having a job. Also, I know it's really embarrassing for me to not have a job. I'm having trouble putting myself out there. I feel like my confidence has just been continually stripped away from me, but I know I gotta be the one to fix that.

Anyway... no one responded to that text. I feel like I don't have a place in my family. I feel like they all agree I am the black sheep of sorts. I'm really tired."

I enjoy computers and technology. I like excel and I just started taking IS courses for my minor. 

I don’t mind managing. I wouldn’t say I’m one to step up to lead a group but if I’m appointed I can do a great job.

I love organization and I’m obsessed with planners and calendars and to do lists.

I don’t enjoy finance. All my finance classes bored me and I don’t like the idea of working on Wall Street or the stress of being in control of someone’s funds or savings. 

I enjoyed the business law course we are required to take to some extent. I don’t mind research but not sure if I could do it as a full time job...

7w0xoe,0,2018-02-07,"My girlfriend got an onsite interview with Microsoft and is freaking out in a bad way, how can I help her through this?",A_random_programmer,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7w0xoe/my_girlfriend_got_an_onsite_interview_with/,"Throwaway because many of our friends know my account and she probably wouldn't like them to know this stuff.

Let me start off by saying my girlfriend (hereby known as Tammy) is the kindest, driven, and talented individual I've ever known. She really is very smart. She and all of our friends are Comp Sci majors and in our last year of College. Now, although Tammy is incredibly incredibly smart and motivated (the girl gets so much done all the time without anyone asking, it's insane) she has never taken well to programming. The rest of us are hardcore nerds and we all started a group that does a lot of work in a really prominent niche space in the tech world. We're all very talented, and we pretty much met starting a club that helps teach real world programming skills to one another. While we all spent most of our free time programming, Tammy spent most of her time doing the extra work that would help us in our own duties. I'd say she was so kind to a fault, something that was a bit of a stressor in our early relationship because she would simply never do anything for herself. 

So fast forward to now, we've all left those clubs and she's accepted it's time to focus on herself and she got herself an internship (it's really hard for Tammy to get jobs since she's not a citizen and the current Administration doesn't make it easier). She's chugging along well and doing her work and learning technologies like Angular, npm, and some simple node stuff. Pretty much standard front end work. I'd say she's behind the rest of us but she's making progress and not giving up. She's also the kind of person that is just a little bit proud when it comes to asking for help, which probably isn't the best mindset when it comes to learning programming. It's not a terrible thing but it does slow her down when she spends hours on a single issue instead of asking her many friends for advice/help. Tbh though I'm sure I was the same way when I started out so I can't really fault her there.

Now to what's going on with Microsoft. Tammy's family is utterly batshit. There's a ton of baggage she had to carry around and deal with because of her family and it's stuff that makes me grateful for my shitty childhood. Part of her array of problems she has to deal with is her brother and mom (her dad is out of the picture). Her brother is an incredibly smart, womanizing asshole who (with her mom) beats Tammy and constantly calls her on the phone to yell at her for hours. He's not a fun person.

Tammy's brother works at Microsoft and wants Tammy to work there as well so they can prove to outsiders that their family aren't failures (or something to that effect, they kind of abandoned their family -- and recently got in touch. Idk, it's a thing and I've learned that trying to understand the rational is about as useful as walking through a highway). See the thing is, Tammy desperately does not want to work there. Microsoft _maybe_ but only if she's as far away from her brother as possible in a different part of Microsoft. See the end game for her family is for her to graduate so they can all fly to where her brother lives and all live together. Tammy will be the house punching bag just like she is whenever brother flys in and she'll be married off right to someone that will bring the family glory. Aren't arranged marriages awesome? 

At the same time, even flunking the interview isn't a great option. She got the call maybe 15 minutes ago and from what it seemed like she was most terrified of having to go to where the interview was (it's an onsite interview in the same location her brother works, many many states away) and staying with her brother throughout this whole ordeal, who would undoubtedly make the whole experience beyond unpleasant. 

She seemed super unsure of herself when the call came through. She's incredibly bright and really good at math, but lacks confidence. I've tried to help her in the past when it comes to this kind of stuff but I have a feeling I'm just coming off as her brother. Overbearing and pressuring. Clearly these are not how I want her to feel but I still want to help her in some way. She's mentioned a few times that she isn't comfortable with coming to me for help on stuff and I'm not entirely sure why. I'd love some tips on how to prevent her from feeling that way as well. Or how to help her gain some confidence through this ordeal, or at least just making her feel better. 

Also for reference we're both in our early 20s 

**TL:DR** My girlfriend is getting super stressed out by her crazy ass family over a crazy awesome opportunity. How can I help her gain confidence in herself? Is it possible for her to ask to be interviewed in a different city to prevent being with her brother through this ordeal? "

Things were great for a few days, and then they slowed down mid-week. Last week was my first week of an internship, and I am so tired it's been hard to keep up with cooking/gym. 

Although I haven't been necessarily hitting my calorie goal every day or packing lunch as much as I want to be, I have been eating under maintenance and doing a decent job meal prepping since it's my first time, so I'm happy with it for now. 

I went to the gym reliably until the middle of the week, and then stopped. I went again today (I don't have a good scale at home so I waited to update until today as well). I was at a point that even though I was tired I still could get through a hard workout, which was great. The glitch was that my gym buddy got injured and couldn't go with me. I went two days on my own, but then trailed off.

All in all, I am so tired but I am doing well enough considering this is a lot of life style change stuff. Definitely areas of improvement that I can identify, but I feel good about it so far! "

Almost every recent incident of the Infinity Gems has led them on a path through Midgard, or as most of you may know it, the planet Earth. I find this peculiar. Our own politics have intertwined with two of the gems, the Tesseract and the Aether, both of which caused large incidents that concluded in New York and London, respectively. Loki's mind gem, once a part of his scepter, caused a large-scale incident with a self-aware security system in Sokovia. At first I assumed the stones might be tied somehow to Asgard, since these events were so connected to Thor and Loki. More evidence has shifted my theory.

I overheard Thor himself speaking of a similar aura he felt when he encountered the sorcerer, Doctor Steven Strange. He suspects there may be another stone in his possession, and this would match up with scattered reports of a strange event in Hong Kong; though our scientists involved in Midgard studies were not able to find any direct evidence. Some ancient texts in the old library pointed towards a very powerful artifact of an ancient mystic order that could potentially be an Infinity Stone. If so, it has been located on Earth for a very long time and without intervention from Asgard. We are waiting to ask Thor if the object looks familiar to him from his visit with Doctor Strange; the object is eye-shaped and that is currently a sore topic.

The only stone we have tracked that hasn't found it's way to Earth is an Infinity Gem referred to as The Orb, which sparked a massive battle between the Kree and the Nova Corps. Interestingly, however, it does appear that the conflict was solved by a group of mercenaries that was led by an Earthling named Peter Quill. This, for me, was too much of a coincidence as Earthlings are extremely rare in that part of the galaxy.

My hypothesis is that these Infinity Gems may have a connection to the Earth in some meaningful way. Every Infinity incident thus far has touched the Earth, or someone from it. My other thought was that perhaps the stones actively seek out one another, desiring to be linked due to some cosmic energy shared between them. Perhaps the Earth was just a convenient meeting spot for fate once a few of the stones happened to converge there? Could the stones be somewhat sentient in that case? Did The Orb intend for Peter Quill to reunite it with the other gems?

I need more information to confirm my theories, and much of what we had has been destroyed. If anyone out there has relevant information, it seems to be increasingly urgent that we solve the mysteries of these stones before they cause more massively destructive incidents on Midgard. There is a chance Asgardians will be calling Midgard home in the near future and we would all prefer that no spellbound robots drop our continent out of the sky (long story). 

Can anyone aid us in our research?"

Either you fucked someone you should not have or you fantasized about it. Late at night, lying in the dark, alone in your bed...

Guys, was it your wife's sister, or maybe that cute new barista with the amazing ass, or that slutty looking accounting intern, you know the one that always wears those tight skirts and high heels. If you didn't hook up with her you sure wanted to and probably rubbed out a few imagining her on her knees...

And ladies, you aren't immune either. Is it that personal trainer with the obvious bulge in his pants, or the UPS guy or maybe your new secretary with the nipples poking out of her white blouses. Did you lie i bed in the quiet and the dark and touch yourself while you though about him or her?

Send me a message and give me the dirty details...."
7w2356,2,2018-02-07,"I told my gf I'd move with her, now I don't want to",iirubixii,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7w2356/i_told_my_gf_id_move_with_her_now_i_dont_want_to/,"hi,looking to get some different opinions or maybe some advice on how I should go about talking about this in the softest way possible as this is something that would definitely make my gf cry for sure. 

my gf dropped out of nursing school on a whim. She claimed its too hard but all she would do is watch netflix at home while I study, so after i told her that she got super pissed and just said she wants to do something easier. she plans on going to school maybe next fall or spring, just wants to take a break and switch majors. The thing is she claims she hates our city we have lived in for almost 2 years and wants to move back to her dads. I go to uni that has different locations, one being an hour away from her dads without traffic.

I found out I could transfer my system but I have to jump through a lot of hoops (id take classes there that would transfer back to my home school up here, so not technically transferring as the degrees are the same). The main one is that I'll have to drive 13k miles in the two semester period. I also have a 13 week internship during the summer and if I lived at her dad's versus my mom or sublease, itd be an extra 7k miles so 20k total. I'll be in a car for an estimated 23 days out of all that driving where right now I don't even need to drive since I practically live on campus.

I already told her I'd move back and she said she was so happy but now I am feeling resentful of her because if she was more ambitious at school I wouldn't have to leave since next year is my senior year. shed have to drive if she transferred but no where near as much as me. I have an on campus job where I can study like 75% while I'm working since I work late night library shifts. I almost want to back out now but I feel like itd be tear down our relationship a lot. Just the driving alone makes me feel super bad, the state average is like .53 a mile so following that id be technically averaged about 10k in depreciation, gas, and maintenance from driving. The only pro is that she'd be happier mentally and I wouldn't pay rent but now I have to worry about a car, insurance, parking pass, driving, traffic etc...

I know it's in my best interest to just stay up here and finish but we already went as far as cancelling our lease for next year with my buddies who were all bummed out. I already feel like all we do every weekend is hang out with her family, why does she want to move back so bad? she's about to be 21 and I'm 21 already, my classes are getting super hard I already spend most of my day at school (c.s. major with a minor in math).

I already told her I'd move down with her and now i want to back out since I'm feeling resentful... I almost feel like she guilt tripped me into moving back with her cuz she knew I could transfer easily. The whole reason we moved up here is so that I wouldn't have to drive a car, not have a long commute, cheaper rent. much more affordable (I have 5 speeding tickets on my record) so liability insurance on an arbitrary 2000 toyota camry would be almost $100 a month (i already checked). Id rather throw money at my loans than worrying about upkeeping a car. I can actually save money. 

If I back out now I feel like she'd be resentful towards me cuz I tried to make it work then said no cuz it's in my best interest so she would have to stick around up here but I almost wouldn't wanna do long distance for a whole year cuz that would suck. (we have almost dated for 2 years). sorry I kind of just went on a rant but general advice on how to go about telling her nicely I wanna back out now or if I should just suck it up and deal with it."

7w29cd,2,2018-02-07,Should I (F28) ask my ex (M31) why he still texts me after 8 years?,loop_forever,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7w29cd/should_i_f28_ask_my_ex_m31_why_he_still_texts_me/,"Little backstory: 
___
Meet a guy in college and had a summer fling before he went out of state for grad school. Continued friendly and physical relationship, long distance, for a year, though we were not exclusive. He visited our home state a couple of times that year and we hang out and hook up. 

Before I move west to start my internship, I decided to visit him and impulsively I told him that I was falling for him. He was taken back and said he can't love someone who's a couple thousand miles away. I was heartbroken but he was right.

So I moved to a new city, did my internship, made new friends and started dating. We continued to communicate, like friends, the first year after my confession. We haven't really discussed what happened and I kinda compartmentalized all my hurt feelings. It was just to embarrasing to bring up. I felt like stupid kid hoping he felt the same way. 

The year after that I started dating my current partner and we've been together for 5 years now. He is also in a serious relationship of 4 years. We both live in opposite sides of the country. And the communication between naturally dwindled, except for random text messages I get from time to time. 

They're text messages of random inside jokes or whatever reminds him of us. Not you're usual, ""How are you? How's things with you?"". MY SO knows about this and he thinks it's his way of reminding me he's still alive and well, and just want to check up on me. He also thinks that my ex might feel some sort of guilt. 

I feel guilty because whenever he texts me it brings up old feelings (the SO is also aware of this) and it's not that I want to be with him. It's just hard to suppress old intense affection. 

I know he doesn't owe me closure, no one really does, but I'm tempted next time he text me to ask why does he still do. Should I just let it go? Or should I ask?

7w2a62,1,2018-02-07,(M4F) Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,u_LordLeblanc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LordLeblanc/comments/7w2a62/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."

7w2ziq,3,2018-02-08,Fuck. This. Shit. #2: Keeping myself accountable.,cieltolh,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7w2ziq/fuck_this_shit_2_keeping_myself_accountable/,"Over the past year, and longer, I've  often made new posts titled ""Day 1... again..."". So I'm not going to do that this time. If you check out my post history, you'll see a post I made a few days ago here in this sub.

I still feel all of that, obviously. But... I didn't make it. It sucks. I argued with myself today for 15-20 minutes after school about whether I should buy some more, and I succumbed to the desire to smoke. I'm sabotaging myself. I feel helpless as if I'm not in control.

So this post will not be deleted, neither will the last. Failures are an important part of the journey. To look back and analyze what didn't work. Etc. We shouldn't try to hide them... we need to learn to love ourselves and our worth and keep working towards building the kind of life and habits we deep down know we truly want. That's why we're all here... we KNOW that we can be better, and that's where we should start! We're only humans, so failing is gonna be part of this journey.

I've started writing a journal. Same thing there, I used to start each entry with ""today's the last day"" and then rip out the page when I failed. No longer. Whether it's on Reddit or your own personal journal, I think it's important to keep track of your feelings and moods, and just general thoughts about your day and life. This helps bring everything into your perspective and remember what it is you're after in life. It keeps pushing you forward from the last spot. Connects each day to the next. A bit abstract, but it makes sense to me.

Also, I've decided to buy a Gameboy. Now I realize this won't work for a lot of people, for any number of reasons. But I think everyone can find something similar, whether it's another video game, board/card game, online game, or some other activity that is personal/private and relaxing/non-stressful. 

I often feel nostalgia for my childhood and have always wanted to get a Gameboy. So now I'm doing it. It'll help me reconnect with that part of me; the younger, more imaginative and spontaneous character. But more importantly, I think it will help ease me out of smoking weed. Hear me out. It's unrealistic to think you can ""snap"" into a healthy and productive lifestyle from smoking daily -- it's just not possible! Habits take weeks to develop. And the ""groggy"" mindset + other side effects of withdrawal will be real and physically/mentally draining... and that can, for many, lead to relapse. Then we feel like shit because we ""failed"". 

Whatever your activity is, it can help distract you and give you something different to do each day. And it's a 100% guaranteed access to stress free time every single day. For me, a Gameboy can achieve these criteria. I don't have to leave my apartment and do anything grand immediately. For example, I don't have to expect myself the day after quitting to go join a club or activity (though of you're able/willing to do this then by all means, I'm only writing this from my perspective in which that would be difficult for me); smoking since I was 16 (am now 22) has severely affected my anxiety and any kind of healing/recovery process is going to have to incorporate a gradual increase of self-esteem. I'm just not realistically going to do something too uncomfortable immediately quitting.

So, with a Gameboy, I don't have to leave my apartment. But it gives me a genuinely fun and distracting activity to do after school or work. I don't have to get ""bored"" and decide to smoke to feel not bored. I love reading too, but that is something I fell out of over the last few years... that's a habit that will take working on. The Gameboy is IMMEDIATE. Think of it as the initial and emergency tool to help to quit from the beginning. 

Quitting is also a means to escape stress and crises. So when I think to myself after school or work that I have hours of reading, assignments, emails, and other stressful tasks to do... I just want that to go all away. While smoking masks that stress temporarily, it's going to sneak up on you and crash... and it'll be terrible. Happened to me a few years ago, failed an entire semester. Happening to me now too... needed extensions for two courses last semester and still haven't started those assignments, and I'm starting to fall behind on this semester's work. Not to mention graduate applications, transcript issues, summer internships, and relationship/friendship/familial issues. Even if it's overwhelming, the only way to get through it is to slowly start chipping away at it. Running away only makes that pile of stress bigger until it's unsustainable. Wake up!

So my ""emergency activity"" can help with this too. Instead of feeling like I have so much to get through and feel the urge to smoke to deal with it, I know I have something to break up -- the Gameboy. After an hour or two of work, I can do a break for fun and not even have to do anything remotely difficult. After the first few days, and the first few weeks, as I adjust to living weed-free, I'll slowly regain a clearer head, and feel healthier and stronger.

But that's the difficult period. The first few days and the first few weeks. That's where most of us need help to get through before even thinking of longterm goals and plans. So for me, my ""emergency activity"" is the Gameboy. It will fulfil some childhood nostalgia and distract me in a positive and fun way. And hopefully set me on the course to staying weed-free and on the path to productivity and fulfilment in other parts of my life. 

So that's it. Find something that can help you in the very beginning of quitting weed to actually help you stay distracted, uplifted, and stress-free/easy to do. I can't guarantee it'll work, but I'm going to try it and it would be interesting if anyone has thoughts on this or wants to try along with me and report on results.

Further, every morning I have been drinking a bottle of water (we lose a lot of water overnight and can wake up dehydrated) and meditate for 5 minutes. I refill my reusable water bottle every night and leave it beside my bed. Drinking it all is the first thing I do every morning. Also a quit tip, whenever you, if your urine is a deep yellow (and perhaps has a strong smell) then you're probably on your way to a headache and need to drink some water! 

Next, I meditate. I used to use Headspace but I can't keep up with the fees. A free alternative is Simple Habit. It's AMAZING. Many quick single-sessions for certain moods, and many ""packs"". I want to get up to meditating 10 minutes (and maybe one day 20), but the realistic goal for me right now is 5 minutes, which is a time limit Simple Habit has... most apps I've seen have 10 minutes as the minimum. At 5 minutes, Simple Habit is a great app to start this habit and then move on to other apps if you so wish. 

I meditate each morning before getting out of bed after drinking water. This has honestly helped a LOT to start my day on a good note. I honestly feel so much more at peace and relaxed that I can't help but feel positive and productive. 

I've read that doing your bed too, first thing, helps start you in a routine of productivity for the rest of the day. Can't attest to that as I'm not an expert, but I'm sure it can't help. The point is, water, meditating, and making your bed sets you on to have a productive and positive morning. You eliminate dehydration, you clear your mind, and you start your day with a productive routine. I think these are simple and easy things to do each morning to ensure you have the best start you can have. But again, this is my perspective and if something works for you I'd love to hear about it! The point of all this is to learn from one another and support one another to becoming the better versions of ourselves we know we can be.

Anyways, thanks for reading. To higher sights!  

Edit: I just want to say... obviously I have larger and more enriching goals than playing a Gameboy... but the point of this post is to talk about the initial period of time when you first quit. And it's a personal choice for me, so it matters even just a tiny bit.

ALSO. If you have certain tasks to do that take a long period of time, or just want to get in a productive mood and do a lot of things in your day, download the app ""Focus Keeper"". It uses the Pomodoro technique to keep you on track. Half the battle is starting, so once you get going, this app just helps to finish the run."

I'm a senior in high school, been programming to some degree since freshman year. Only been really serious about it in the past year or so, and I've mainly focused on Android/Android Wear because I tend to get really motivated to program when someone else's app doesn't work like I want it to. Next semester I'm going to college, Alfred State University (SUNY College of Technology). It was either that or go to the local college in Anchorage, which had a standard bachelor's of Computer Science.

Alfred State does not have a bachelor's in Computer Science, only an associates. Instead, they have a BTech in ""Information Technology: Applications Software Development"". While the CS courses seem par the course for a CS degree, the name is somewhat off putting, and it does not require Physics/Chem/a lot of Math like most degrees in the CS field do. However, the college is regionally accredited, seems to have a much better program than my local university, claims to have a 100% employment rate, and most importantly (in my mind) has guaranteed internships as part of the degree itself. Especially due to a scholarship that makes it incredibly cheap despite being out of state, I plan to go. 

I wanted to see what most of you thought in regards to the specific degree. Will most employers view it as suspect, even if you have experience through the internship (at a minimum)? How deep do employers usually look into degrees? Will the lack of higher math actually be an issue in most cases (It only requires College Algebra for Calculus)? If you see any potential issues, what can be done to minimize or  alleviate them?

Specifically with Android, it seems like no colleges have degree work specific to the framework, but will this degree be adequate for android development if I continue along that route? I've been trying to get into better practices with personal projects to offset the expected lack of android courses , but it's hard to know what's expected and what's alright to not know at first. I don't really want to just twiddle my thumbs through college, and then be unprepared upon graduation. 

Any help would be much appreciated, I don't know anyone in the field, and my parents never went to college full time (Just sporadic classes occasionally). It's a somewhat unique degree, if only by name, so the insight is tremendously helpful!"

I am an introvert and I had just a few friends in my school and college days. I don't like interacting with strangers and it takes alot of time for me to open up in front of others, infact I don't even like picking up calls from my friends when I am home and would reply them in text. The Internship turned out to be ok but the major negative feedback that I got from everyone was that I wouldn't communicate much. We had 10 members in the team being a startup and we all had our lunch together and while others used to chat I would sit in the corner with my phone in my hand. Even after 4 months I just bonded with 2 people and I am not even in contact with them anymore. I didn't even went with the team for the company trip. After a few weeks I felt like they started ignoring me altogether. I am now applying for full time jobs and I am worried that my introverted nature would again let me down. I would appreciate some advice on how to deal with this."

7w5miw,43,2018-02-08,My FMIL and my SO's bendy(?) spine,throwaway_25290374,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7w5miw/my_fmil_and_my_sos_bendy_spine/,"HELLO! LTL, FTP, throwaway for reasons, and all that jazz. I've been following this sub for over a year and I have to say that many of the wonderful JNMIL traits I've read about here I have witnessed. Part of the reason I'm posting this now is that I want to make sure that I'm not the one being ridiculous here. I also don't really post a lot to reddit so thank you in advance for bearing with me.

Some backstory:
I met SO when we were in college over a summer internship. He was about to start his second year of grad school in the mid-atlantic and I was a rising senior in undergrad in the Northeast. The majority of our relationship has been long distance, but we made great efforts to see each other, and would do so every three weeks at least. Our hometowns happened to be 1.5 hours apart (both in the DC metro area), so that made things easier too. About two months into our relationship, I had him meet me at my parents home and he got acquainted with my family fairly quickly. 
SO's parents are divorced, so it was a little more difficult for me to get acquainted with both of his parents especially while I was away at college. About five months into our relationship, I met his dad first - a very laidback guy who I could easily talk to. A couple months after that, I met his mother. I remember thinking she was a very nice lady and had nice conversations with her; for the most part, that was the case. However, I noticed some habits of hers that would make me think twice and have me weary about the future (SO and I had the talk and we are in it for the long run. We moved in together in May 2017 after both getting jobs in the same city in the Midwest and it's been amazing thus far).

So here's where I am feeling a bit iffy, guys. SO's mother (FMIL) has a lot of habits that I don't find normal at all. First, I realized that SO and FMIL have a weekly phone call on Sunday afternoons. I have no problem with this. However, sometimes SO and I go on weekend trips and don't have time to call anyone. If this is the case, SO has 5+ missed calls from FMIL. When he finally has a chance to call her (usually Monday morning), she usually complains and asks why he didn't call her back sooner. Maybe my parents are very laid back about me calling them, but they would never do this to me. 
Another thing is if he was in the DC metro area - this includes DC, Maryland, and Northern Virginia - no matter what, his FMIL expects him to drop everything and come have lunch or dinner. Even if he and I have plans, or hanging with my parents - she would call during and demand to see him. And, here's what gets me - she knows I'm with him and would not invite me. So he'd go. My parents would ask me why I didn't go and I would just shrug and say ""she didn't invite me I guess"".  Weird, right?

Anyway, she did something that happened recently that REALLY rubbed me the wrong way. A couple weekends ago, SO and I had plans to go to a party with some friends we haven't seen in a while. That afternoon before the plans, FMIL calls SO and tells him ""Hey honey, I'm in Midwestern City A. Let's meet for dinner."" We live in Midwestern City B, which is 2.5 hours away from Midwestern City A. And you know what? HE CANCELS ON ME AND OUR FRIENDS AND GOES. WHAT?! Didn't even suggest to reschedule the plans with our friends, and bring me, just goes BY HIMSELF AND DRIVES 5 HOURS ROUNDTRIP. I was so livid, when he came back late that night I was in tears. I have a conversation with him about how I feel disrespected in multiple ways by both him and her. How I feel like we are partners now and she needs to realize that, and realize that he can't just drop everything and go to her whenever she asks! It was a long talk about it, but SO told me he would work on it. So yea. I'm sure I'll be back with more updates if you guys care... haha. She's coming to visit and stay at our place for a WEEK in April (she booked the flights and called SO a week later saying ""HEY I'm coming this week, see ya then!"")... 

So am I being ridiculous? Sensitive? Are my worries warranted? I know this post was basically just me rambling so I apologize."
7w5sfl,1,2018-02-08,My boyfriend [24/m] thinks I'm [20/f] immature. What is needed to grow?,avengedsevenfold23,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7w5sfl/my_boyfriend_24m_thinks_im_20f_immature_what_is/,"Any advice on what maturity is and what a mature person says/does? What kind of character do they have?

**Boyfriend of a year thinks I'm immature. I don't see why. It's threatening our relationship because he feels like dad and I don't feel like an equal. I feel like I accept his flaws and work on them with him way more than he accepts mine. He holds me to high standards. If I don't meet them, I'm not impressive. I'm a basic good person.**

The reason I ask about maturity: My boyfriend is frustrated with me because he thinks I am not as mature as our peers. This is causing huge fights in our relationship. It makes him feel like a dad. It makes me feel like he's looking down on me and not an equal in the relationship. 


**The problem is, I don't see how I'm immature.** I may be energetic (sports and diet give me more energy) and look young (natural baby face), but I don't think that makes me immature.  
I have asked him to explain how I'm immature. He has said things like my work ethic is bad. I don't understand. **I am pretty organized.** I have a 3.8 GPA, graduating with a bachelors at 19, green belt in judo, run track, a marketing internship with the university athletic association, taught myself Korean, lived on my own in Korea for a year, got full-scholarship, go to a great university, put effort into everything I do, and thousands saved in the bank. The typical stuff.
**I'm also a reasonable person. I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong** I support him in everything he does. I always try to do the right thing in any situation. 


**However, I'm still immature in his eyes. I have questioned him further. He says he doesn't know why I'm immature compared to others at our college. He says he can see it in them.** This doesn't give me anything to work with. Slowly but surely, our relationship is going down the drain because he thinks I'm immature and I'm not sure why. **He said he has only seen this maturity in flickers. He hopes to bring that out more in me. He said he is hoping I'll develop.**


We have been to couples counseling before, and I honestly feel like giving up. **He goes through phases where he loves me so much (making me feel great) and phases where he puts me down (making me feel worthless and like he's doing this little girl a favor). In the bad phases, he always gets irritated with me quickly and accuses me of not doing enough (in trying to develop).** 


**He also makes it seem like putting me down is a favor because it will motivate me to grow. He will tell me my character is not impressive. That I'm just a baseline good person with all these I've done and accomplished and say he loves me at the same time.** I'm not even sure I want to grow to be with someone like that or if I think his complaints are even valid. **If I'm really immature, sure, I want to grow.** However, I don't want him to benefit from that growth. I'm starting to become apathetic to even him being around.



The only valid thing I can see is, sometimes, I get stressed out about how much stuff I have to do. That is not very often though. He is guilty of the same thing. I feel like I accept his flaws and work on them with him way more than he accepts mine. He holds me to high standards. If I don't meet them, I'm not impressive. I'm a basic good person.


**I remember once**, he had a really long day at school (7am to 5pm). I only had one class that day. In that class, my teacher brought candy canes from his home he wanted to get rid of. He gave them to us. I don't eat candy canes, but I knew Jordan didn't get to eat since he was gone all day. I decided to take the candy cane to his classroom (which was in the same building as mine) and hand it to him quietly before his class started. I walked to his class room, placed it on his desk, and left without saying a word. Later, he told me **it embarrassed him** I did that. **He said to everyone else, it made me look immature and like he was dating a little girl.**"
7w5ugc,30,2018-02-08,Twitter Storm Marvel and Capcom directly for change! Get your voices heard!,OctopusIncorporated,mvci,https://www.reddit.com/r/mvci/comments/7w5ugc/twitter_storm_marvel_and_capcom_directly_for/,"A few days ago, MvCI was trending on twitter because of the EVO upset. That is the type of change that can actually make things happen for the game. Companies do not like public attention that paints them in a bad light. It’s the only way to speak in the language they understand: money. 

It’s time we forced a response from the higher ups on this game. Show them there are players (and therefor cash) that they are ignoring. I am 100% certain this is possible if we are loud enough. The problem is getting loud enough. You see, I don’t have a big twitter following and I don’t use it at all personally beyond FGC stuff because I got burned out on it...from running a corporate social media account at my old job. I hated it, but I learned a lot. And there’s one thing I’m certain of, it’s someone’s job to listen. 

I am exactly aware of how much it is someone’s job to sit on social media all day and monitor what people are saying,  respond if needed, and report it back to some senior advisor.  Tools like Mention and other programs make it so these things get noticed. Someone checks in with that intern at least once a week if not more. And if that person keeps getting flooded with questions about the game, across multiple accounts, their boss is going to get flack if it keeps happening. Why? Because CEO’s and other higher ups do not like hearing a backlash isn’t being controlled, and they are on twitter too.  They definitely hear things.  I am almost certain Marvel has been ignored because we haven’t been loud enough. 

So what can you do? Here’s a list of people to @ and mention. Make it known that you are disappointed in the lack of support for the game, the lack of announcements. Use the MVCI hashtag as much as possible. Let them know there are tons of fans willing and waiting to give more money, time and support if they will do the same. Do this daily. Heck, send them a good morning and good night message about it. THE KEY IS TO NOT ALLOW THEM TO KEEP IGNORING THIS. Please feel free to add to the list. Game devs and production teams have twitter accounts. Movie studios know that they have game tie-ins. All of the people that we need to talk to are real people just sitting on social media. Let’s make it happen. We usually have a couple hundred people active on this sub, and if we can mobilize more popular FGC members, those with big follower counts, we can show up on the bigwigs’ radars. Enough is enough.

I also have been working as a part-time TA at the MAcc program at my university for about 2 years now. 
In my daily interactions at work I have become pretty familiar with the curriculum we offer for graduate students and a certain insight into some of the classes; most of the students end up doing a Tax concentration and prepare themselves to get enough knowledge and credits to take the CPA exam by the time they graduate. Students have the opportunity to graduate with a focus in Financial/Auditing or Tax accounting. 

Anyways, I still have a few more semesters to finish my undergrad but I don't really know which route to go. Any advice on this? I have began applying for some internships to do during the summer or even next fall.

**VENOM**

* Oct 2018
* psychological thriller/sports drama
* rated R
* under two hours and $50 mil budget

Eddie Brock is [a senior at a high school in Queens.](#s ""No more Tom Hardy unfortunately, but hopefully you will think it's worth it by the end."")

A two-time state champion wrestler, with eyes on becoming a police officer.  The film opens with Brock breaking up a fight between another senior and [a smaller freshman named Peter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/7w7mds/fixing_venom_by_finding_its_place_in_the_mcu_a/ ""Spider-Man has been an important part of Venom since the beginning...let's keep it that way."")  Although he has won a scholarship to NYU for wrestling, Brock needs help with his biology grade to graduate.  When Peter finds out about this, he offers to help and they strike up a quick friendship.

&gt; A dirty drug

Meanwhile, Brock is hiding something.  He has slowly become addicted to an ability enhancer known as Venom.  Rumored to be [reverse-engineered from alien tech](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/7w7mds/fixing_venom_by_finding_its_place_in_the_mcu_a/ ""There's a number of places such tech could come from in the MCU, such as the serums used in The Incredible Hulk or whatever was used to make Winter Soldiers, but this one ties it in neatly with the setting and plot elements from SM: Homecoming.""), it grants the user superhuman strength for a few minutes at a time.

The drug is expensive and Brock finds himself winding in tighter and closer with a dangerous crowd.  His suppliers tell him about an underground wrestling circuit where he could earn extra cash...but Brock is prohibited from participating by his enrollment at NYU.  They offer to give him Venom for free and to hide his identity on this circuit if he agrees to wrestle for them, promoting their product.

Ultimately, Brock risks his scholarship to get the extra cash, donning a black and white outfit that covers his face...becoming Venom.

&gt; A dirty job

He’s a hit on the circuit and is quickly earning thousands in cash every week.

After a few weeks of this, Peter suddenly stops showing up to tutoring sessions, seeming to always be too busy with something.  This begins to unsettle Brock, who needs the help badly.  After a particularly painful, hard-fought match, Brock goes off the handle and lashes out against his suppliers.  He nearly kills one before calming down.

&gt; Selling his soul

Long nights on the circuit are getting to him.  Occasionally, Brock finds himself hallucinating from the Venom.  One night he spots a mugging and, with his superhuman strength, he easily overpowers the attackers.  This time someone dies.

When he tells his suppliers about what happened, he is surprised to find that they are furious, because both they and the muggers are employed by [the same guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/7w7mds/fixing_venom_by_finding_its_place_in_the_mcu_a/ ""Kingpin foreshadowing?""), who runs most of the neighborhood.  They tell Brock to look the other way if something similar happens in the future.

&gt; Cashing out

Frustrated and wanting to get out of the circuit, Brock confronts Peter about never having time to tutor and they have an argument.  Peter apologizes and they manage to bring it together just in time to help Brock cram past finals.  Brock is thankful and offers Peter good cash in gratitude.

Peter is flabbergasted, and Brock tells him what he’s been up to, inviting Peter out to his match the following week.  $2000 to anyone that can last two minutes in the ring against him.  Peter tells Brock that he doubts his aunt and uncle would let him go out in that neighborhood, and is clearly in awe at how much money Brock is earning.

He invites Brock over to his house for dinner the night before the match.

&gt; Dogfight

Over the next few days, Brock’s suppliers stop giving him Venom and he becomes increasingly unstable.  His main contact tells him to come to the ring at four, saying it’s “the big day.”

When Brock arrives, he is told that he is there for a demonstration.  They give him a large dose of Venom, and he suits up in the locker room and sits on a bench, waiting for more instructions.  As he sits and waits, he notices the camera in the corner of the ceiling turn on and rotate towards him.   Then he hears scratching at the door...it flings open and a pack of hounds rush in.  They set upon him and [a long and brutal fight ensues.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/7w7mds/fixing_venom_by_finding_its_place_in_the_mcu_a/ ""this is NOT a reference to Hulk 2003, it's just a coincidence haha"")  Ultimately, Brock wins.

The camera shuts off.  Moments later, the door opens again and Brock is congratulated on a great demonstration.

The suppliers inform him that his fight with the dogs drove up the bids significantly.  As they begin to clean up the dogs, Brock tells them that he wants out of all this after the next match.  They agree, saying that this has been good business for everyone.  As Brock gets back into his regular clothes, he overhears their plans to meet later that night for a massive purchase.

Pretending to go home, Brock waits outside the building and tails them to their hideout.

&gt; Cleaning up

Now running late, Brock finally makes it to Peter’s house for dinner.  Laying on the charm, Brock manages to convince Peter’s aunt and uncle to let him go to the match.

After dinner is over, Brock stakes out the hideout house.  Donning his suit and taking several doses of Venom, he cuts power to the house before heading inside and taking everyone down.  Desperate to go clean and move on, he destroys their entire supply of Venom before burning down the house, starting with the papers and computers.

The next night, Brock arrives at the ring.

One of the suppliers shows up, frazzled, asking him if he heard about what happened.  Brock says no, and the supplier tells him that the supply was hit and they have no more Venom.  Brock asks if they know what happened and the supplier shrugs, saying that most likely one of the bidders figured out where they were and stole everything.

Brock tells the supplier not to worry and says he will do the match clean today.

&gt; Not so easy

Brock heads into the ring, but is surprised by an early contender.  Small and scrawny, going by the name of Spider-Man.  Brock launches himself forward again and again, but Spider-Man is too nimble to catch.

With the clock winding down, Brock begins to taunt Spider-Man and it works.  The [red and blue figure](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/7w7mds/fixing_venom_by_finding_its_place_in_the_mcu_a/ ""great chance to show of the cloth Spidey outfit too"") flings himself at Brock and he gets ready to win, but then...Spider-Man lifts Brock over his head and slams him down hard on the mat in a shocking display of strength.

Brock has the wind knocked out of him and he feels a sharp pain in his side and back.  In a whirlwind of pain and panic, Brock is helped off into the locker room by two of the suppliers.  Spider-Man celebrates his victory with the promoter, not seeming to notice how seriously Brock is hurting.

&gt; Wrapping up

On the way to the hospital, the suppliers construct a cover story, saying he was hit by a car while crossing the street.  The make a deal...they won’t tell NYU or the authorities anything if Brock doesn’t say anything either.  Brock agrees.

A few days pass before Peter shows up at his bedside.

While they talk, Peter begins to cry.  Brock says he is sorry, having heard that Peter’s uncle was shot soon after dropping Peter off at the match.  Brock says it is his fault for inviting Peter at all, saying he never should have invited anyone to that part of town.  Peter just looks down and shakes his head.

Then Brock tries to cheer Peter up by reminding him that he’s been selected to go to Midtown Sci and Tech in the fall and he won’t have to worry about bullies there.  Peter manages a smile.

&gt; A fresh start?

During his weeks in the hospital, Brock finally breaks through his addiction to Venom.  Even though his injury ensures he will never be able to wrestle again or have any chance of being a police officer, NYU stands by his scholarship.

In the fall, Brock starts his internship [in the biology lab](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/7w7mds/fixing_venom_by_finding_its_place_in_the_mcu_a/ ""he interns for Dr. Curt Connors""), working towards becoming a forensic detective."

I'm currently taking all the pre-requisites for the major and was planning to transfer hopefully sometime during sophomore year. My technical GPA isn't a 3.2 as the website recommends but after I finish the pre-reqs, I am estimating it'll be around 2.7-3.1 (I'm averaging well in most of my pre-reqs aside from physics). 

I was still gonna apply for the transfer but if I don't get in, would it be smart to keep taking computer science courses in CLA and try to apply junior or senior year or just find another program that offers a BS in computer science at a college that I am able to get into?

 I know that a BA in computer science is still good but I wanted to apply to an internship that requires a BS and wanted to avoid the language requirement for CLA.

 Also are there any other factors other than GPA that will improve my chances of getting into CSE?

So, the church I attended had interns from all over the world, usually about 3-6 at a time for a year. They usually help out with events, setting up youth nights, and whatnot. What my church did was rent out an apartment to house the interns, so we all called it the intern house. All the past interns have said they experience little weird things, nothing of concern, and they would share it with us sometimes. The girls had their own studio they would share in the back patio above the garage, and the boys had the upstairs to themselves, since 2 of the permanent residents are guys.

One night, a couple of friends decided to sleep over and watch a movie night, and did we choose the wrong movie, as things got worse from there. We decided to watch paranormal activity (not sure which one). In the movie, there was a little child who names his imaginary friend Toby, which turned out to be an evil entity. Jokingly, we all named the ghost, ""Toby"" as well; just to scare the girls and other students who would come around for our weekly ""boys night"". Were we dumb to do that. After that night, things got worse. 

Just to give you an idea, the upstairs had 2 smaller rooms for the permanent residents; one for David (my best friend) and one for Adam (David's childhood friend) as they both worked for the church, so they live there, and take care of the house during the summer when the interns were gone. So whenever I spent the night, I would stay in the master bedroom, where there was a bed and a bunk bed, and the bathroom. I have no idea why I chose to sleep here after experiencing activity very often.

This is my personal experience. At night, before bed, I would go shower, and brush my teeth in the public bathroom David and Adam shares, as the first time I used the master bathroom, I got scared. When I showered, the toilet flushed itself; nothing alarming, but still weird nonetheless. It freaked me out a bit, like I said, I'm a pansy when it comes to t his kind of stuff; I tried to finish my shower quickly. Now, I've read somewhere that if you acknowledge entities, you feed it, and it gets stronger. I'm guessing this was the case. After I started freaking out a little and rushed my shower, some stuff fell off the counter, and at that point, I said f-it, I washed all the soap off, grabbed my clothes and towel, and ran to David's room butt-naked. I explained to him what had happened, and he laughed at me; same with Adam. So we all just hung out in Davids room for a bit until we all went to bed. Now, I'm the type of person who hates sleeping in complete silence, so they had a room fan, which I turned on to make some noise; sometimes, it would turn off by itself and be unplugged. This was when I lost my shit. The door would open and close, and the toilet would flush itself again. I was not having it. Like what every man would do, I grabbed the blanket from the top bunk, and made a fort and played Christian music, while playing Rise of the Guardians on my laptop to help me fall asleep. I love that movie for some reason, maybe because it was what helped me get through the dreadful nights. And every single time I slept over, the same things would happen, and after a while, I just got used to it, as they became a routine for me.

Eventually, I moved out of state, and came back to visit after 2 years. This is where things got crazy. These were not experiences from me, but it's what Adam had told me. When I came back, I had told David and Adam that I missed the intern house, and I mentioned Toby as a joke as well. Adam had this look on his face as if I had said he-who-must-not-be-named. David kind of shrugged it off, not really caring. 

This is what Adam said had happened. There was this girl living at the house in the girls' studio by herself as there were no interns at the time. Whenever she would be alone, she felt as if something was watching her, maliciously; she never liked staying there by herself. Whenever she was in her room, things would get knocked off. This time, it apparently felt angry, not like how it did in the past. One day, she started walking out and there was a loud sound, and things fell off dressers, like in movies. They had one of those heavy rear projection tv's everyone had in the early 2000's, and it apparently fell off the stand right after she walked by. She was so scared, she cried and called the pastors. 

When they came in the house, they all shared a feeling that something evil was in the house, so they exercised the whole house, and things were okay after that. They said that the entity got power from being acknowledged and how everyone gave it a name.

As Adam explained all this to me, I was looking at this odd-looking frame he has; it was like a picture frame, except it was a box and had 2 little sailor dolls in it. I looked at how weird it was, and to my surprise, one of the doll's arm moved. I asked Adam if anything strange happens after the exorcism, and he told me the only thing he experiences anymore, were the dolls in his box, and how they would move from time to time. 

If any of you guys are experiencing anything out of the norm, don't give it a name, or acknowledge it, as it'll get stronger."

7w9z1u,7,2018-02-08,My girlfriend loves me a lot. I cannot reciprocate it and feel like im ruining the best thing I will ever have.,Throwawayhg52,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7w9z1u/my_girlfriend_loves_me_a_lot_i_cannot_reciprocate/,"So this might be long and I apologize for that. I (23M) have been together with my girlfriend (22) for over a year. It was rough conditions for developing a relationship, as I studied abroad for half a year during the first year of our relationship and after being home for half a year she went on her study abroad trip and we broke up before that. Our plans for the future involved a lot of different countries. As we were from two different neighbouring countries, studying in the same country. But the future plans was 2 study abroad trips and 2 internships, all in different countries. 

She's always been very lovely, pulling her hand through my hair, comforting me through all my problems, helps me and generally surprises and does all sort of small Things for me. She is this amazing, attractive person that keeps on giving. I dont know when it happened, but I started to feel like we were continuing in the same routine and running out of topics to talk about. We were watching movies, having sex and doing the same Things and I had this feeling like a rock in my stomach sometimes and missed spending time with my friends. 

Why can't I appreciate what she is doing. Why do I feel like there should be more to it? Im overthinking everything. Shouldnt we be possible to enjoy life just the two of us and never run out of topics? Shouldnt I be able to just accept her love and wanting to return it?  Shouldnt I be happy for all the time we spend, rather than thinking about that its possible to spend too much time with each other?

After we broke up, she returned to my home country after 5 months and as we kept contact we decided to meet up. It was all nice and we still desired each other, but after sleeping one night and seeing her eyes look at me with love and stroking my hair and kissing me everywhere I panicked. All the old issues came back to me and I didnt sleep at all that night. She comforted me through everything(I was the one crying) and told me its just not the time and maybe not meant to be. 

She asked me if I could just run with it and see If I can develop the feelings for her which I want, and even though its all that I want, my gut tells me its unrealistic. Im afraid of failing to love her and hurting her. Why cant I accept the love and intimacy with her? Why am I afraid of it getting dull, boring or such and hurting her again? When I can have a girlfriend that scores high in everything and never would let me Down, why cant i appreciate this and love her back? 

She said she accepts the reality of me not loving her at the moment but hoped that I could develop it with time, is this possible, given how I have felt before and that we are going to face long-distance Again? I however, fear that this is just something she tries to say to convince me to try. 

We decided to breakup. Initiating a no contact rule this time, unless for emergencies. I can't stop thinking about that I let the perfect girl go because of some personal problem of mine. I didnt see myself in a relationship anytime soon after we broke up the first time, and I still have a hard time doing it. But I am letting the perfect girl get away, because she deserves more than what I can offer. I have a Deep feeling that I am going to regret it and never find a girl like her. Wish my brain could just enjoy what I have instead of fearing about it being ""right"" or ""not"" or something better might be waiting. Cant imagine anything better.

tl;dr: Girlfriend is very infatuated with me. I'm not sure if I feel the same, but I also just might no be capable of accepting or reciprocating love.

Edit: I decided to give it some time. I dont know why I feel as I do but I hope time will make things clear. Thanks for all the thoughts and suggestions. It helps more than you might think."
7wa0vo,4,2018-02-08,I just got a job offer from the company I intern for. How should I structure my salary offer?,TheMajesticMoose08,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7wa0vo/i_just_got_a_job_offer_from_the_company_i_intern/,"I just started an internship at a small solar company a little over a month ago. Yesterday my boss told me that he's very impressed with my work and he wants to hire me at the end of my internship (about 3 months from now). 

Today I talked to a coworker who is the #2 person in the company to ask him if a salary of $45-$55k is reasonable (I currently make $16/hour as an intern). He said that's reasonable but what he recommends is that I propose to my boss a lower base salary (around $45k) and the opportunity for quarterly bonuses, plus he wants to train me in sales and give me the opportunity to earn commission. He said it will help me stand out in the company, will drive me to succeed more by setting clear goals, and that next year, if I play my cards right, I could be making upwards of $100k. 

Do you think it would be wiser to negotiate a higher base salary with no bonus/commission opportunity and have a lower but guaranteed income? Or do I take my coworker's suggestion and have a lower guaranteed income but set myself up for the opportunity to earn much more?"

I'm currently preparing my application for KGSP and I'm pretty anxious to know how my chances are looking.

Here are some stats about me:
I'm from the U.S. Got my Bachelors in Computer Science. GPA is 3.8. No internships/ publications / extra curriculars.

And I did an exchange program with Korea University for 1 year then I went back to Korea and did the 10 week intensive Korean language course at Sogang Uni for Level 1 (passed with all A's)

I was planning on applying to the SKY universities. Do I have any hope in getting the scholarship?"

My very carefully laid out plan this year didn’t go very well. Following two injuries, I had an extraordinarily difficult time finding *any* hands-on medical experience. I only just this week found such a job after almost a year of looking. I have 320 internship hours as of now and that’s pretty much it for experience. 

I’m working as an MA now to rack up more hours and also work extra to catch up with credit card and medical bills, so between that and studying, I don’t know if I can find volunteer opportunities soon before application cycles begin, especially since even volunteer positions where I live are very competitive. 

TL;DR: Do I need volunteer hours? Do they have to be hands-on, or should I opt for the more available administrative volunteering work?"

So far from what I’ve noticed on Glassdoor as well as Boeing careers, there are less entry level job postings for the Puget Sound area compared to lower COL areas like St. Louis, Oklahoma City, Charleston etc. which is confusing given that the Puget Sound region is Boeing’s biggest site by far in terms of overall employment and sheer size. 

I know a lot of the interns go into the ITCFP rotational program and a lot of entry level jobs are filled internally before they’re even posted outside externally so this could partially be the reason why, but I also read online that Boeing has been actively trying to downsize and move high paying IT jobs from higher COL areas like Seattle/LA to lower COL areas.

Too often you hear politicians promise you the moon, then they go back to Washington ignore your voice, and spend all their time contributing to the corruption that plagues our nation.

Well, not me.

I’ll tell you exactly what I’m going to do if elected:

I will go to Washington, and enter those hallowed halls. The assembled representatives will look at me scornfully. A chuckle will waft throughout the chamber, as they prepare to consume yet another foolish idealist, and continue in their depravity.

But as the vultures gather, I will stare them in the eyes, and whisper, almost inaudibly: “jobs”.

Then the laughter will stop, and a hush will fall, all at once. Outside the animals will be silent, and the sky will seem just a little bit darker.

Then I will unleash my true power.

I will yell “WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES” in a voice like an earthquake. 

Then, the words spoken, chaos will be unleashed: the fourth rider shall gallop across the sky. The sun and moon will rise again, and merge together. It will rain, snow, and hail, all at once, as the heavens wail in anguish.

The earth will shake and fissures shall tear apart the foolish edifices of forgotten fools, a wind will rush through, scattering the parchments that once represented the hubris, of those who would call themselves the greatest nation.

And I will laugh. At their weakness, at how they quail before my power.

“HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA”

And the fire will rise, everywhere, springing impossibly from every overturned desk, and every broken dusty corner.

Then as the symphony of madness reaches its climax, and the chorus of a thousand dying interns reaches its fever pitch--

A lone figure will appear, from nowhere.
His hair flows like a golden mane. His eyes cut through every falsehood, and possibility of weakness.

It is Donald Trump. America’s true savior. Your only hope.

Unable to fathom any challenge to my power, I test him:

“WE NEED TO HONOR THE VETERANS WHO KEPT AMERICA FREE”

A invisible path will be carved towards him, through the wreckage. It will cut through man and rubble alike.

But my unseen fury, upon reaching your champion, will be stopped. He will smile, his massive body like a sculpture, made manifest of muscle.

And for the first time, I will feel fear.

Then his lips will open, like a flowers petals, and he will speak:

“Jina”.

Then the world will be righted again. The politicians will be restored to their desks, still cowering with fear. Then humbled, I will take my place among them, and prepare myself to be just another cog in a great instrument, played by mighty hands, weaving a symphony of restored American greatness.

Therefore I urge you to vote for Bernie Sanders and the Democrats in 2020, so that together we will defeat the corrupt old order and the new bright hope alike, and plunge the world into darkness.

Thank you.

I tell myself ""you couldn't get into a top 100 school, do you really think you're smart enough to do this?"", or I dredge up another one of my countless failures and use it to try and justify why I shouldn't bother.

It's not that I'm not motivated. It's just that for too long I've attached my self-worth to external validation, which I seem to have run out of now.

It gets worse: every time I see someone doing better than me - like if they landed internship or made it to a good school - it festers at the back of my mind, and despite knowing better, I use it as a hammer to bring down my self-worth. Conversely, when I see someone doing worse, I chalk it up to them having poor luck and me having all the luck in the world and yet not being able to do better.

How do I cope with this?

tldr; drowning into a negative spiral of regrets and comparing myself with others. Need help to get back on track."
7wcmbj,60,2018-02-09,Am i just VERY lucky?,Bretonn,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/7wcmbj/am_i_just_very_lucky/,"So, a bit of background, i've never wanted children ever since i was small. I've been a bit vocal about it during my teens but after a while i kept it to myself, mainly because it was nobody's business and the topic never came up. 

Recently, i've decided to get sterilized. And i've started talking about it with friends, some childfree, some childless, some with children. Never once was i bingoed (except for a drunk, possibly full of regrets young mom) and i was met with support from everyone. Childfree people are actually more numerous than i thought and non-childfree people all agreed that my choice was to be respected and that i knew myself better than anybody else did. That surprised me a bit, having read some pretty dumb conversations some of you reported here. Some people even took it as a cue to tell me about their own feelings about it. A 40 years old friend who's divorced with 2 boys on the autistic spectrum told me he wished he knew at the time that he could choose not to follow lifescript. 

So today i met with my family doctor whom i've known all my life (i was in class with his son at one point) to tell him about it. I never felt once nervous, even when i realized he was with and intern. I felt so sure, so proud and confident, which almost surprised me, being a most stressful creature on a normal basis.
His first reaction was surprise of course, but after that he just asked me if i was sure about sterilization. He told me some women chose not to have children but don't get sterilized. I made myself clear and he never once tried to dissuade me, never one asked my reasons for this. I mentioned that some people get a psychiatrist check and he told me he didn't think it would be necessary for me. 
Finally he promised he would ask around for gynecologists willing to sterilize a 24 years old woman, and mentioned it was very unlikely anyone would accept but he would try anyway. I'm not sure he promised that just to get rid of the subject and later tell me no one would be willing without having researched the subject. 

But i'm sooo happy with how he reacted, somehow i'm not surprised because he is a good person on top of a good doctor.

I do feel like i am in a childfree fairytale!!"

After the war [Sasuke got back on good terms with the leaf and set out on a journey.](https://imgur.com/a/1NVUP) Sasuke went on this journey for two reasons, one of which was for [his atonement.](https://imgur.com/KNdvoEi) Sasuke did a lot of foul things as a kid, granted he was much younger, less wiser and ultimately misguided. Still, he inflicted some serious damage and caused plenty of pain to the shinobi world. So he decided to travel the world to places where his hands or [his name created conflict, offering help to correct the mistakes he made in the past.](https://imgur.com/EYl7hu7) Sasuke couldn’t afford to make another mistake. Even though his darkness was defeated, Sasuke(and Naruto) failed to get rid of it. [Sasuke still has darkness brewing deep inside him,](https://imgur.com/a/PpahP) ‘A violent impulse that ate into reason slept within his body.’ Back during the start of the 4th war, Kurama knew [Sasuke' darkness couldn’t be erased](https://imgur.com/a/btnR5), and that still holds true in his adulthood. As for now Sasuke feels he has things under control. Still, Sasuke also knows that getting consumed by darkness again and reverting back to his former self can happen at anytime; all it would take is a moment of [weakness](https://imgur.com/uuU6owN) and [confusion,](https://imgur.com/a/1NVUP) Making more connections increases his chances of falling into darkness, so journeying is something Sasuke must do alone. This allows him to learn about his momentarily suppressed violent nature, [so he can control it.](https://imgur.com/a/pQbYN) Which leads us to the other reason for Sauske' journey. 

The second reason for Sasuke' journey was his desire for information. [He wanted to know more about the shinobi world and about kaguya.](https://imgur.com/a/ZILkh) Sasuke was bothered by the story of Kaguya, and questioned the things she did. He couldn’t understand why she would need to create a white zetsu army, if IT was meant to be the start of a peaceful era. So he used his travels to also learn anything and everything about the nature of the world he’s in, and hopefully get closer to understanding Kaguya' reasoning for why she needed an army. His information usually came in the form of [his communications with the leaf and allies](https://imgur.com/a/FTxjn) about ongoing/current [affairs.](http://sendvid.com/yxv8f5uz) 

My Prediction:

Just as Kaguya' perception changed as she became the rabbit goddess, I believe Sasuke' will continue to change as well as his character evolves. I believe that as the progenitor of chakra, Sasuke sees a link between Kaguya' actions and his own darkness. I believe Sasuke is looking for a way to reach Kaguya' home world to further understand the ways of her and her clan, intern learning about the darkness inside him. I also think that by Sasuke taking Boruto as his student, hes making yet another connection which will ultimately test his control over his darkness. I believe that Sasuke' journey will lead him down one of two paths:

1. Learning to control his darkness and in a moment of confusion loses sight of what’s important. 

2. Failing to control his darkness and in a moment of weakness gives in to his impulses, again becoming consumed by it.

and in doing so, he will become part of that which [Boruto is prophesied to dispel.](http://sendvid.com/j1wwk4pq) Sasuke will die by Boruto' hand, it will be Jiraiya Vs Pain 2.0, but the teacher is the bad guy this time. Ok maybe **NOT ALL** of that will happen, this could just as easily be the setup for the Naruto vs Sasuke rematch we've been waiting for. Still, like most of my predictions, I do believe this outcome is possible. Mostly because it's been decades since Sasuke was saved from his darkness, he's nearly doubled in age. In that, he is long due for another test of his impulse. 

######**Open Questions**
Will Sasuke ever learn to control his darkness? Why or why not?

Why would Sasuke take Boruto as a student if he knows the danger of his darkness could creep up on him? 

What do y'all think of this?"

I'm a 22 year old dumbass who can't for the life of himself seem to grasp the concept of moderation.

Its been like that for a long time, ever since puberty I guess. Started smoking weed and drinking. Never had a drinking problem but dabbed and ripped bong about ten times a day for three years straight and smoked a bit less for two years before that. Not a single day sober. I smoke cigarettes too if that means anything.

I'm at university and am doing OK academically but I literally never go to class. I am about to graduate and hopefully get a relatively high paying job in this part of the world (I find out in a week if I nailed the interview/assessment centre). But for the past four months I have been doing coke about twice a week. And it's never a line or a bump. It's fucking half a gram every time. I know that's nothing to a lot of you but I get the worst comedowns. Ever since I stopped smoking weed (started getting paranoid) I have had anxiety. Like medically diagnosed, .25 mg lorazepam whenever I'm climbing up the walls. 

But I'm out of benzos and where I live you can't get them. And I just did a shit ton of coke and I'm not sure what to do tmrw when I wake up. 

Am I falling into a trap? Am I justifying my immature and addictive behaviours via the ""never gonna be this young again"" excuse? Because I feel like an absolute shit human being. Every single time. It's not worth it and yet it must be if I keep doing this to myself. For what it's worth I also lost what was left of my internship money (£1500) about a month ago gambling - again, addictive personality?

If one person reads this it was worth the wall of text. Thanks guys. I'm not really sure what I'm asking but some guidance would great"

Well so much for my first serious attempt to contact a Rogue Korvax Hacker, via the Pirate Underground. The idea being to find and recruit someone capable to help locate and extract stolen memories held by the KVC within the Convergence.

I am not even going to blame Muu for what transpired. The Echo of the First Spawn warned me of the risks involved. I ended up, for a time, chained once more to a filthy dungeon like bulkhead. The grim location of my incarceration inside a battered old Freighter that I suspect usually makes its living trafficking wretched pirate caught slaves. The developing situation feeling far too much a plot rerun based on older log entries. 

The only Korvax I managed to meet acted more than a few chips short of a motherboard. The Metal Head keeping threatening to vivisect me and my Atlas Suit to reveal the deep secrets of Traveller nature. I am not sure I believed  the threats. The machine talked way too much - interestingly usually only jabbering on in front of its non Korvax colleagues - yet it got around to cutting far too little. I am naturally not complaining about the lack of harmful surgery - far from it - but the prevarication seemed odd.

Muu reckons our recent experience firm proof that some supposed Korvax Rogues are not what they seem. Some self professed digital rebels in fact deep cover Convergence Agents keeping a direct scanner on problematic miscreant factions from within. Whilst most pirates factions oft seem less than ethnically diverse groups being primarily one species or another I have discovered it can be different behind the front line contacts that most Travellers habitually encounter.

With reflection, when my Vy’keen Interns, (via our sketchy backup plan), broke me out, the extraction operation all went a little too smoothly being almost uniquely without incident. A suspicious chap - such as myself - easily believing some insider was glad to be rid of both Muu and Me from their premises. Although it may have been sheer luck both the initial placement of guards and the confused direction of their responses post alert too, too readily aided the cleanliness of our escape exactly as if some agency was directing our removal in a manner that ensured we suffered no further impediment or damage beyond another small dent in my already battered pride.

***

*I fear the KVC may have deep reasons to avoid my Suit Systems ever being examined by a skilled third party, some of their KVC interventons in that Clean Room probably exceptionaly illegal and unethical under their own species: rules, regulations and codes of conduct.*

***

Those sneaky Korvax, sons of science, you just never know what is really looking at you from behind those shiny faceplates. Then again I have met other members of other species that although - seemingly - far more biological felt the same spooky way. Potential Echo transference between bodies seems a big issue out here that cannot be easily ignored. Out here a wise Interloper accepts little of any presented species surface as the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

##I have, without question, witnessed plenty of doutful identities according to my log entries.

Maybe the whole operation this time around was a setup another time wasting ruse designed to make me quit my line of enquiry. I still think the Korvax Victor Company are monitoring me closely possibly having installed spying links directly into my Atlas Suit when I was under the sway of their Nanite Clusters in that cursed Clean Room. Is Muu now working for the KVC too? Could the age old Gek personality be enslaved or partially overwritten to be more pliable to KVC needs and desires? The once slavemaster now shackled to servitude? I guess that would be ironic.

***
*** 

*Sometimes I feel so very alone, somedays it is hard to trust anyone or anything within this deceptive reality. On a bad day it feels as if the Great Machine only exists to fool me with distractions from anything real. Yet there are moments when I am eager for every distraction when I just drink it all in as if dying of thirst. Accept or resist, be at peace or struggle for some deeper understanding. Of course, understanding can arrive from letting go and accepting too.* 

*Maybe I feel too much, sometimes feeling seems both the blessing and curse laid upon us Travellers. We exist arguably to feel and process these manufactured realities thus perhaps it is no surprise that sometimes it waxes almost too emotional there is no easy escape from that fact.* 

***
***

It is hard to forget that those Clusters could have done anything to us. I wonder if a leap to a new Galaxy would reset us in a good way even if that meant another loss of memory and finding myself again only through my Anomalous Channel logs - that loop - that unbroken cycle of loss and almost artificial remembrance... Still, never say never, perhaps it is time to push on to the next one maybe that leap of faith will break me free to realms of pure wonder with less angst. 

***

*Oddly some other Travellers seem able to almost ignore their habitual memory loss as if it is just a part of their nature - I sometimes wonder - why I feel and wax a little different in my obsessions. Are our differences just the product of the Atlas during our creation juggling the simulated DNA of our iterations? Are we all just singular experiments in variety as sometimes the creatures I discover appear to be randomised test subjects?* 

***

As to flying away again as a solution, have I become too enamoured of flight as the ultimate solution to every ill that I percieve or imagine? Perhaps I race ever further away from the seat of truth towards merely enticingly beautiful delusions. There are some that claim the answers only rest in Euclid. I am not so sure about the Euclid theory but since there is presently no going back I will continue onward.

Luckily it seems possible that the Prime Atlas Traveller Protocols must trump all other - lesser - amendments done to us wanderers unless of course said changes are in part, or in whole, directed by Atlas in the first place only in this instance via that Korvax Corporation as agents but I do not think the last is so. I think everything is getting more complex because the Atlas is failing and so its control over the fate of both individuals and factions is on the wane. I - believe - the life Atlas once created is becoming evermore sapient, more questioning and independent too thus you come upon Gek for example in dread of the End Time staring at a lesser nested simulation within the mightier mechanical simulated reality of the Great Machine on their data pads in inconsolable terror.

##Attempting to reconcile with mortality is often far from easy for the sapient.

My conjecture being that only creatures truly self-consciously aware and somewhat independent of the wider process would feel such angst at their potential ending otherwise it would mean nothing. For mere slavish tools following naught but function life and death is the same just part of their cycle of being as agents of the Great Machine that is everything. If the non-Traveller folk merely act as turning cogs and spinning wheels they feel nothing beyond what they need to feel  -I do not think it is so - not anymore. I find a strange sort of hope within the wider evolution of mind due to the Great Machines failings.

If I had any say in the matter, I would like to save Atlas and its works but also preserve the growing independence of those developing minds too - perhaps I seek for far too much.

Beantwoording Kamervragen van de leden Sjoerdsma en Sienot &amp;#40;beiden D66&amp;#41; over protocollen op de werkvloer na meldingen van seksuele intimidatie  
&amp;nbsp;    
Geachte voorzitter,  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hierbij beantwoord ik de vragen van de leden Sjoerdsma en Sienot &amp;#40;beiden D66&amp;#41; over protocollen op de werkvloer na meldingen van seksuele intimidatie. Deze vragen heb ik ontvangen op 26 januari 2018.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven welke gebruikelijke protocollen in werking treden als iemand bij Rijkswaterstaat melding doet van seksuele intimidatie of pesten op de werkvloer?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zodra een signaal bij het bevoegd gezag is ontvangen, treedt het Protocol Integriteitonderzoeken Rijkswaterstaat in werking.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien het signaal gaat over ongewenste omgangsvormen en de melder tevens slachtoffer is, bekijkt de bedrijfscontroller met de melder of het signaal als melding behandeld wordt volgens dit protocol, dan wel als klacht doorgezonden wordt naar de Klachtencommissie ongewenste omgangsvormen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deze Klachtencommissie opereert onafhankelijk en is ondergebracht bij het Expertise Centrum Organisatie en Personeel van het Rijk &amp;#40;BZK&amp;#41;. Per klacht wordt een commissie samengesteld. De commissie adviseert direct aan de Secretaris-Generaal die een besluit neemt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het komt ook voor dat er geen melding wordt gedaan bij het bevoegd gezag, maar dat een medewerker zich wendt tot een vertrouwenspersoon. De taken van de vertrouwenspersoon zijn eveneens neergelegd in een protocol.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met de maatregelen die onder de aanpak van psychosociale arbeidsbelasting &amp;#40;PSA&amp;#41; vallen? Zo nee, waarom bent u hier niet mee bekend? Zo ja, op welke wijze wordt binnen Rijkswaterstaat uiting gegeven aan deze maatregelen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, deze maatregelen zijn mij bekend. Rijkswaterstaat werkt actief, binnen alle lagen van de organisatie, aan het voorkomen en wegnemen van arbeidsrisico’s op het gebied van PSA, werkdruk, ongewenste omgangsvormen, agressie en geweld. Dit in overeenstemming met de Arbocatalogus Rijk waarin is opgenomen op welke concrete manieren de werkgever bescherming biedt opdat er veilig en gezond gewerkt wordt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zo worden bijvoorbeeld risico’s geïnventariseerd en geëvalueerd &amp;#40;RI&amp;E-cyclus&amp;#41; op de eerder genoemde thema’s, wordt gewerkt met gedragscodes en instructies en vindt scholing plaats van leidinggevenden en medewerkers. Daarnaast is het thema vitaliteit prominent vertegenwoordigd in de Mens en Organisatie strategie van Rijkswaterstaat.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het u bekend dat het beroepsrisico dat het meeste voorkomt bestaat uit werkdruk, agressie en geweld door derden en ongewenste omgangsvormen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, dat is mij bekend. Zie ook de beantwoording op vraag 2.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze geeft Rijkswaterstaat vorm aan het ‘stimuleren en faciliteren dat bedrijven preventieve maatregelen tegen ongewenst gedrag nemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Rijkswaterstaat heeft een actief integriteitsbeleid waar iedereen de mogelijkheid wordt geboden om misstanden &amp;#40;veilig&amp;#41; aan te kaarten. De medewerker kan daarvoor terecht bij zijn leidinggevende. Daarnaast heeft elk onderdeel een integriteitscoördinator, een bedrijfscontroller en is er een uitgebreid netwerk van meer dan 40 vertrouwenspersonen, verspreid over het hele land.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Van leidinggevenden wordt verwacht dat zij integriteitsrisico’s en ongewenste omgangsvormen tijdig herkennen, benoemen en vervolgens op de juiste manier aanpakken. Zij hebben de taak dilemma’s in alle openheid te bespreken en een goede en veilige werksfeer te bestendigen. Ook tijdens het jaarlijkse personeelsgesprek tussen medewerker en leidinggevende wordt aandacht aan integriteit besteed. Waarbij de handreiking integriteit in het personeelsgesprek van mijn ministerie als leidraad kan dienen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vanwege het belang dat mijn ministerie hecht aan integriteit wordt ook elk jaar ‘de week van de integriteit’ georganiseerd. Iedereen wordt dan van harte uitgenodigd en aangemoedigd om hier samen met collega’s tijd voor vrij te maken en met elkaar te spreken over omgangsvormen en integriteit.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op het intranet van mijn ministerie is uitgebreide informatie over integriteit en ongewenste omgangsvormen en hoe daarmee om te gaan snel en gemakkelijk te ontsluiten. Zo zijn er bijvoorbeeld factsheets te vinden, specifiek over pesten en ongewenste omgangsvormen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze bevordert Rijkswaterstaat dat werknemers bij iemand terecht kunnen wanneer zij zich onveilig voelen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik verwijs u hierbij naar het antwoord op vraag 4.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke bescherming is er op de werkvloer voor de werknemer die een melding maakt? Bestaat er een standaard protocol dat doorlopen kan worden? Kunt u bijvoorbeeld aangeven of het gebruikelijk is dat de werknemer die een melding plaatst wordt verzocht enkele dagen niet op het werk te verschijnen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
De protocollen zoals in vraag 1 aangehaald zijn van toepassing. Uitgangspunt is dat een medewerker die een melding doet geen nadelige gevolgen van zijn melding ondervindt &amp;#40;Protocol Integriteitonderzoeken Rijkswaterstaat&amp;#41;. De Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens geeft regels die bij het doen van onderzoek naar een vermeende integriteitschending in acht moeten worden genomen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ook in het Besluit instelling Klachtencommissie ongewenste omgangsvormen Infrastructuur en Milieu is neergelegd dat een klager in zijn positie als medewerker geen nadeel ondervindt van het te goeder trouw indienen van een klacht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is zeker niet gebruikelijk dat een medewerker na het doen van een melding verzocht wordt een paar dagen niet op het werk te verschijnen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
In hoeverre kunt u aangeven of het wel eens is voorgekomen dat werknemers bij Rijkswaterstaat tegen hun zin in langdurig zijn ziek gemeld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er is sprake van langdurig ziekteverzuim als iemand langer dan zes weken ziek is. In de wet Poortwachter zijn de rechten en plichten van werkgever en werknemer ten aanzien van de re-integratie vastgelegd. Het ziekteverzuimprotocol van Rijkswaterstaat is hierop gestoeld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Als de werknemer het niet eens is met de ziekmelding kan hij zich wenden tot de bedrijfsarts. De bedrijfsarts adviseert vervolgens het bevoegd gezag in deze. Als de werknemer het niet eens is met het oordeel van de bedrijfsarts kan hij dat oordeel laten toetsen door een commissie van drie geneeskundigen of een deskundigenoordeel bij het UWV vragen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven in hoeverre het wel eens is voorgekomen dat werknemers door de bedrijfsarts volledig arbeidsgeschikt worden verklaard maar dat Rijkswaterstaat ervoor kiest om werknemers niet toe te laten op de werkvloer? Indien u hier wel eens van op de hoogte bent gesteld, kunt u aangeven op welke gronden u dit wenselijk acht? Indien u dit niet wenselijk acht, kunt u aangeven waarom dit toch is voorgekomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het komt incidenteel voor dat er sprake is van situatieve arbeidsongeschiktheid. In het algemeen wordt deze term gebruikt voor werknemers die naar strikt medische maatstaven geen beperkingen hebben van fysieke of psychische aard, maar die door dreigende psychische of lichamelijke klachten toch niet naar hun werkplek kunnen terugkeren. Het gaat dan bijna altijd om de situatie waarbij de arbeidsrelatie verstoord is en de werkgever van mening is dat daadwerkelijke werkhervatting om die reden niet mogelijk is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke sancties bestaan er op Rijkswaterstaat indien privégegevens &amp;#40;zoals medische gegevens&amp;#41; van medewerkers worden verspreid?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op grond van de Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens kan de Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens een bestuurlijke boete opleggen ingeval er sprake is van onrechtmatige gegevensverwerking.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke manier worden externe partijen betrokken bij mogelijke conflicten en/of verschillen van inzicht op de werkvloer? Kunt u aangeven welke stappen worden doorlopen voordat een externe partij erbij wordt gehaald? Zo nee, waarom kunt u dit niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het Protocol Integriteitonderzoeken Rijkswaterstaat biedt de mogelijkheid om een onderzoeksopdracht uit te besteden. Dit kan aan de orde zijn als de aard van een schending zodanig is dat hiervoor de specialistische kennis intern ontbreekt, dan wel als een kwestie dermate gevoelig is dat het inschakelen van een terzake deskundig extern bureau aangewezen is. Daarnaast kan de omvang van een onderzoek aanleiding zijn voor uitbesteding.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ook de onafhankelijke Klachtencommissie ongewenste omgangsvormen heeft de mogelijkheid zich door deskundigen voor advies bij te laten staan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij &amp;#40;dreigende&amp;#41; arbeidsconflicten of verstoorde verhoudingen wordt in de regel  onderzocht of mediation tot een bevredigende uitkomst kan leiden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
In hoeverre is het bovenstaand geformuleerd beleid de standaard en wordt dit in alle gevallen nageleefd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het bovenstaande geformuleerd beleid geldt als standaard en er wordt naar gestreefd dat dit in alle gevallen wordt nageleefd, echter soms kan er naar bevind van zaken worden afgeweken wanneer de specifieke aard van een kwestie daarom vraagt.  
&amp;nbsp;

7wg55y,52,2018-02-09,I met GM Brandon Beane today,sand_jigga,panthers,https://www.reddit.com/r/panthers/comments/7wg55y/i_met_gm_brandon_beane_today/,"
I thought you guys might enjoy this story, it’s not much of one but I thought I would share it with you guys.

I attend the University of North Carolina Wilmington and today we had UNCW alumnus and Buffalo Bills GM Brandon Beane come in and speak to us about his come up in the league, his past career with the Panthers, and his current one as general manager of the Buffalo Bills. His story is truly amazing, he came up from nothing with zero connections within the league. Working his way up from an intern to manager of football ops to assistant GM to GM and getting the Bills to the playoffs for the first time in 17 years in his first year as GM of Buffalo. 

Quite an impressive resume if you ask me. Anyways, as most of you know the Bills aka Panthers North have had a habit of picking up our players and coaches so after his lecture today (where he told us some pretty cool stories during his time in Carolina) I went up to him and said something along the lines of, “Hey Mr. Beane, I just wanted to thank you for coming to campus and talking to us about your career and how to jump start our careers in Sports management. I know it’s your job to find the best available players but man, can you please stop taking our panthers?”. It took him by complete surprise, He laughed and said “Sorry man that just how it goes sometimes” and gave me a pat on the shoulder. 

I was partly joking and partly serious but either way it was cool to see him come back down to NC and show some love. 

Do y’all think the Panthers missed out on a potentially great GM in Beane? Given the situation we’re in now.

Yet I am concerned with how to explain this to the client in a way that will be well received.  I was given some good pointers, but  I am just interested in hearing even more opinions about how you would approach this and what you might say that will be understood without coming off as me making the decision on my own.  I want the client to feel part of the process and not like I am just making an executive decision.

Also, I need to tell the client on the phone when I call to confirm the appointment so that the spouse is not brought to the appt. for no reason.  I don't feel like this is the best way as I'd rather explain it face to face.  Any pointers on how to bring that out over the phone?"
7wgeb3,18,2018-02-09,The first part of Watzkes interview with the F.A.Z. in English.,ben13022,borussiadortmund,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/7wgeb3/the_first_part_of_watzkes_interview_with_the_faz/,"„ Those who strike, will sit on the stands.”

Hans- Joachim Watzke, BVB- chef, talks about the resultus of the latest transfer drama, the nonsense of Monday games and solidarity from Hoeness. 


- With all due respect: In the last weeks and months one could have the impresion that Borussia Dortmund is blowing up in your face. 

No, certainly not. But if been through in a situation as ours in the last 12 months, where you have to master so many difficult situations, then it is clear that it is getting restless. 
But Restlessnes is in principle not in the DNA of BVB.  There is a intern unity in the club. But it i salso true that exreme events as the Bombing and the inglorious transfer drama of Aubemeyang and Demebele did cost us substance. 

- With Aubemeyang and Dembele there were two topstars that have striked themselfes of their contracts. Goalkeeper Burki criticised the Fans- and with that the core of the BVB identity and business Model. The Dortmund Spirit has disappeared. It is questionable if the fall of the team, from the top, can be stoped.  Last October the BVB stock was at 8,36 Euro, now it is only 5,78- more then 40% less. What should we begin with? 

First thing first- and then we can come to the individual points. Ich have once again looked at the Uefa- ranking. We are placed there in the Top Ten between Manchester City and Manchester United. That is not a poor starting position! 13 years ago we had a 75 million revenue, we had about 200 million debts, we didn’t have an own stadium and we were standing before the fall into insolvency 
This year we had a half billion revenue, we don’t have any more financial liabilities, the stadium is ours again, and we have a solid amount of money on the bank. 
When it comes to sport in this decade, we have always played internationally, we have won two German leagues, we have won two German cups, we played in numerous more finals, we played in the final of the Champions League and we played in the Champions League six times. Nowadays we are for sure not where we would like to see ourselves, but we are just one point after the second place in the Bundesliga. You are right that it could happen, that we would miss our season goal for the first time. But therefore to talk of a “fall of the team”, then we are talking of a “fall of the team” on a very high level. I truly experienced different times at Borussia Dortmund…

- No one is undermining your success. But striking players, even if the bring millions, are poison for the BVB identity. 

You are right there. When the transfer window finally closed last Thursday, I had to say some very, very clear words to the team, to put them back in their place. I think I was never as clear before.  

- Uli Hoeness said, that all this would not happen at Bayern Munich. Their players can’t play this kinds of games as Dembele and Aubemeyang. 

He extra called me  and told me he was misunderstood. He actually wanted to support us with his statement. 

- That didn’t work out very well.

Uli Hoeneß  told me, and that was also the quoted in some newspapers, that he
actually meant that Bayern would have an easier job in such a situation, because they are not on the on the Stock exchange.  Let’s leave it there. I hope and wish them, that Bayern won’t find themselves in such a position. We will see how it will end, if FC Barcelona will make a great effort to get a Bayern player. But now I would like to come back to us: We have bought Dembele for 15 milion Euros – and then we get an offer, that could give us 148 milion Euro. This is a magnitude, that we as an company on the stock market, have to weight very cearfully. Uli Hoeness is not wrong there. Especially, when a player behaves that way, strikes, leaves the country, and is out of our control. 

The sum was too big, to just say: We will put you on the stands for a year. Yes, the fact that we are on the stock exchange is a disadvantage, when it comes to such big sums. Nobody could have predicted in 2000, when BVB got on the stock exchange, that a transfer could bring twice as much capital as the whole years revenue at the time or be as expansive as a whole new stadium.

- It is impossible that your fans will tolarate how BVB deals with striking players.

Rightly! Taking the ethical and charakter factor, then the Dembele case was catastrophe.  Then again Aubemeyang assured us that he will stay at Dortmund, also as a reaction to the Dembele transfer. But I think, he also thought that we should be grateful to him. He decided against a very lucrative offer 2016, when Hummels, Gundogan and Michitarian left us. I think there is some truth in it. It would be an enormous blow for us, if we would sell him too at the time. We also had that in mind this transfer period. That is one of the reasons we made it easier for him this time. But we did it mostly, because we had this feeling: that it will never work out again with “Auba”. Not with the fans, not with the team. There was a lot destroyed, because of his behaviour. The sum of 64 millions was in the end not as high, that it was the only factor. 

- The players know now what to do, if they want to leave. 

I told the team on Thursday, very clear: The next player that want to do this, will fail enormously. He will have a massive problem. Even with us on the stock exchange. The next player who will try to put us under pressure, with his restrained performance or even strike will not go through- and will sit on the stands. Everyone knows that now. This is a public announcement and this is what I stand for! 
After Dembele and Aubemeyang there is a superior club concern: We have to get back a better structure in our whole team.  

- Can the fans still belive in the slogan „Echte Liebe”(True Love)? 

The cases of Dembele and Aubemeyang where a huge blow in this case. 
But I didn’t have a feeling with Aubemayang, that with selling him, we did something against our supporters.  It was done, mostly in in accordance with them. The fans couldn’t handle the created chaos anymore. Nevertheless: It is crucial, that Borussia Dortmund will reinforce the sport stimulating working hygiene. Again: This will not happen again! Ok, what was your second point?

- Your goalkeeper Roman Burki critised the fans after the 2:2 home game.

He critisied a few of tchem. But what he have done was stupid. A misstep. He knows that. The game against Freiburg was something special. The people came already nervous because of „Auba”. I had the feeling that they wanted to whistle and boo him to the ground, but they were restrained because of the team. There have been some applications, that no player, playing in the BVB shirt should be booed, that i also why it was so moderate. But, yeay there was a bad feeling with everything and we played the worst game till December. Burki reaction was wrong.

- Point three: The spirit of the team is not longer what it was. 

I think you are right. But: We are still in the Top 10 of Europe. That is actually more then is possible. But with the success the expectation of the fans are getting bigger.  Our teams from 2011 and 2012, which won the german championship, were for sure not as good technically us our team now. But they had the best spirit that you can imagine. That is the next point we have to manage: We will need a team calibration in Sommer, and deepending on the development of the season even a significant one. Micheal Zorc, knows my opinion and my expectations. 

- The fall of the team from the top, our four point seem to be not stoppable. Or do you think that the latest 3:2 against 1.FC Cologne was a turnaround ?

I hope that it can effect a turnaround. I saw a team with absolute willingness to win. I would like to especially praise, even if I don’t praise individual players that often, André Schürrle.  There were phases in the game where we played pretty good football. Even last season we had to fight till the last games for the Champions League qualification. This season I also see good chances. Although Peter Stoger doesn’t have a Dembele, a Aubemeyang and till now a Marco Reus. He had to play in some games with a 17 year old on the left forward postion a 19 year old on the right forward position and a 18 year old in the center. But I still predict: That with a fit Marco Reus this month, we are capable to start a chase for the top teams. 

- In what position on the table do you see BVB, after one win and three draws in the year 2018, at the end of the season? 


Peter Stöger is still unbeaten in the Bundesliga as a BVB coach and got twelve points in the last six games. From what I know, only Bayern got more point in that time period. A two point average is normally enough for a Champions League position. And exactly this is our aim and our expectation. 



- Point five: The table and the share price are not lying. At the stock market you went 40 percent down. You don’t only have fans but also investors at your club. 

About half of the share capital is in the hand of five, six big investors. They are completely satisfied. When I started, the rate for one share was about 2 Euro.   We even had a time when it was under 1 Euro- a Pennystock! The 8,30 summit was a summer hype because of the Dembele transfer. One year ago we were at 5,30, now we are at 5,80 Euro. The fact is: The stock price, and that bothers me, is focused more on the current sporting process then at the long term process.  In the last seven years we had a surplus of about 200 mln Euros after taxes.  For me it is crucial: That most of the investors, that started with us in the last years,  have made good money with us. The are getting every year their dividend.  But the interest of the investors is not my main concern. Even Uli Hoeness needs to understand, that we are not a joint-stock company but a GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA. That is an enormous difference. In the consequence, I am just a employee of the club. And it is completely clear that the club is in charge. I try to harmonise the interest of the investors and the fans. I am on no side. I am standing between them. 

- What is the club policy regarding the exploding markets and the extreme commercialization of football?

We need to achieve a unity between the fans and the club as well as a unity between the fans an the team. We have a higher aspiration then most of others in that regard. That means: We need to get new financial resources through internationalisation, but we can’t make a policy against our 10 millions fans here in Germany. 

- What does it mean specifically?

We will continuously fight for the 50+1 rule. As long as there is no opponent of the rule, that will explain me in a coherent way why we should abolish it, even if the two most successful clubs in the world, Real Madrid and Barcelona are 50+1 clubs, I will further fight for its existence.  
We need to talk in the  league if the Monday games, besides if they are indicated by Europa League games, are really necessarily.  

Borussia Dortmund will start this discussion. I feel a very big aversion against them. Without Monday games we would, from 2021, get two or less million euros every year. 
A big unity with our fans is something far more important for us. Also there it is valid for Borussia Dortmund: back to the roots!

What's your experience as a software engineer? I'm currently an undergraduate student at U of I Computer Engineering and I'm interested in working for Sales Force.

I initially heard of Sales Force from my cousin who transitioned from a small start-up company to Groupon because he had experience with Sales Force. I have friends who graduated and have full time offers from the company. Since I've worked for multiple jobs that pertain to customer relations, I thought it would be interesting to work on developing a CRM.

Another question: what are some tips you can offer to land an internship here? PM me if necessary! I am currently a sophomore undergraduate."
7wguzg,18,2018-02-09,"„Those who strike, will sit on the stands.”, long interview with the CEO of Borussia Dortmund, Hans-Joachim Watzke. [in English]",ben13022,soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/7wguzg/those_who_strike_will_sit_on_the_stands_long/," „ Those who strike, will sit on the stands.”

Hans- Joachim Watzke, BVB- chef, talks about the resultus of the latest transfer drama, the nonsense of Monday games and solidarity from Hoeness. 

- With all due respect: In the last weeks and months one could have the impresion that Borussia Dortmund is blowing up in your face. 


No, certainly not. But if been through in a situation as ours in the last 12 months, where you have to master so many difficult situations, then it is clear that it is getting restless. 
But Restlessnes is in principle not in the DNA of BVB.  There is a intern unity in the club. But it i salso true that exreme events as the Bombing and the inglorious transfer drama of Aubemeyang and Demebele did cost us substance. 

- With Aubemeyang and Dembele there were two topstars that have striked themselfes of their contracts. Goalkeeper Burki criticised the Fans- and with that the core of the BVB identity and business Model. The Dortmund Spirit has disappeared. It is questionable if the fall of the team, from the top, can be stoped.  Last October the BVB stock was at 8,36 Euro, now it is only 5,78- more then 40% less. What should we begin with? 

First thing first- and then we can come to the individual points. Ich have once again looked at the Uefa- ranking. We are placed there in the Top Ten between Manchester City and Manchester United. That is not a poor starting position! 13 years ago we had a 75 million revenue, we had about 200 million debts, we didn’t have an own stadium and we were standing before the fall into insolvency 
This year we had a half billion revenue, we don’t have any more financial liabilities, the stadium is ours again, and we have a solid amount of money on the bank. 
When it comes to sport in this decade, we have always played internationally, we have won two German leagues, we have won two German cups, we played in numerous more finals, we played in the final of the Champions League and we played in the Champions League six times. Nowadays we are for sure not where we would like to see ourselves, but we are just one point after the second place in the Bundesliga. You are right that it could happen, that we would miss our season goal for the first time. But therefore to talk of a “fall of the team”, then we are talking of a “fall of the team” on a very high level. I truly experienced different times at Borussia Dortmund…

- No one is undermining your success. But striking players, even if the bring millions, are poison for the BVB identity. 

You are right there. When the transfer window finally closed last Thursday, I had to say some very, very clear words to the team, to put them back in their place. I think I was never as clear before.  

- Uli Hoeness said, that all this would not happen at Bayern Munich. Their players can’t play this kinds of games as Dembele and Aubemeyang. 

He call me extra call me ensuing and told me he was misunderstood. He actually wanted to support us with his statement. 

- That didn’t work out very well.

Uli Hoeneß  told me, and that was also the quoted in some newspapers, he
actually meant, that Bayern would have an easier job because they are not on the on a Stock exchange.  Let’s leave it there. I hope and wish them, that Bayern won’t come in such a situation. We will see how it will end, if FC Barcelona will make a great effort to get a Bayern player. But now I would like to come back to us: We have bought Dembele for 15 milion Euros – and then we get an offer, that could give us 148 milion Euros. This is a magnitude, that we as an company on the stock market, have to weight very cearfully. Uli Hoeness is not wrong there. Especially, when a player behaves that way, strikes, leaves the country, and is out of our control. 
The sum was too big, to just say: We will put you on the stands for a year. Yes, the fact that we are on the stock exchange is a disadvantage, when it comes to such big sums. Nobody could have predicted in 2000, when BVB got on the stock exchange, that a transfer could bring twice as much capital as the whole years revenue at the time or be as expansive as a whole new stadium.

- It is not possible that your fans will not tolarate how BVB deals with striking players.

Rightly! Taking the ethical and charakter factor, then the Dembele case was catastrophe.  Then again Aubemeyang assured us that he will stay at Dortmund, also as a reaction to the Dembele transfer. But I think, he also thought that we should be grateful to him. He decided against a very lucrative offer 2016, when Hummels, Gundogan and Michitarian left us. I think there is some truth in it. It would be an enormous blow for us, if we would sell him too at the time. We also had that in mind this transfer period. That is one of the reasons we made it easier for him this time. But we did it mostly, because we had this feeling: that it will never work out again with “Auba”. Not with the fans, not with the team. There was a lot destroyed, because of his behaviour. The sum of 64 millions was in the end not as high, that it was the only factor. 

- The players know now what to do, if they want to leave. 

I told the team on Thursday, very clear: The next player that want to do this, will fail enormously. He will have a massive problem. Even with us on the stock exchange. The next player who will try to put us under pressure, with his restrained performance or even strike will not go through- and will sit on the stands. Everyone knows that now. This is a public announcement and this is what I stand for! 
After Dembele and Aubemeyang there is a superior club concern: We have to get back a better structure in our whole team.  

- Can the fans still belive in the slogan „Echte Liebe”(True Love)? 

The cases of Dembele and Aubemeyang where a huge blow in this case. 
But I didn’t have a feeling with Aubemayang, that with selling him, we did something against our supporters.  It was done, mostly in in accordance with them. The fans couldn’t handle the created chaos anymore. Nevertheless: It is crucial, that Borussia Dortmund will reinforce the sport stimulating working hygiene. Again: This will not happen again! Ok, what was your second point?

- Your goalkeeper Roman Burki critised the fans after the 2:2 home game.

He critisied a few of them. But what he have done was stupid. A misstep. He knows that. The game against Freiburg was something special. The people came already nervous because of „Auba”. I had the feeling that they wanted to whistle and boo him to the ground, but they were restrained because of the team. There have been some applications, that no player, playing in the BVB shirt should be booed, that i also why it was so moderate. But, yeay there was a bad feeling with everything and we played the worst game till December. Burki reaction was wrong.

- Point three: The spirit of the team is not longer what it was. 

I think you are right. But: We are still in the Top 10 of Europe. That is actually more then is possible. But with the success the expectation of the fans are getting bigger.  Our teams from 2011 and 2012, which won the german championship, were for sure not as good technically us our team now. But they had the best spirit that you can imagine.

Micheal Zorc, knows my opinion and my expectations. 

- The fall of the team from the top, our four point seem to be not stoppable. Or do you think that the latest 3:2 against 1.FC Cologne was a turnaround ?

I hope that it can effect a turnaround. I saw a team with absolute willingness to win. I would like to especially praise, even if I don’t praise individual players that often, André Schürrle.  There were phases in the game where we played pretty good football. Even last season we had to fight till the last games for the Champions League qualification. This season I also see good chances. Although Peter Stoger doesn’t have a Dembele, a Aubemeyang and till now a Marco Reus. He had to play in some games with a 17 year old on the left forward postion a 19 year old on the right forward position and a 18 year old in the center.

Charles.

Last time I checked [FAQ of Yours.org](https://www.yours.org/faq/) was quite vague about how exactly users are supposed to pay for contents and  other services.  

IIUC, from explanations from Ryan and one of his users, when you access Yours.org you download javascript that needs access to your BCH wallet.  When you decide to vote on a post, for example, the javascript issues the proper BCH transaction for a total of $0.25, that pays the proper fractions to the author, to early commentators, and to Yours.org.

The security risk of that arrangement is obvious: a hacker or malicious worker at Yours.or could hack the javascript so that it wipes clean your BCH wallet, or leaks your private keys to the bad guy.  

That of course is the same modus operandi of Blockchain,Info's wallet (remember their RNG bug that made private keys easily guessable?) and of other wallets out there.  So it is secure, in the bitcoiners' sense of ""secure"".  

That user says that he is aware of the risk, and therefore has a separate BCH wallet in his ""on-line"" computer, with only a small amount of coins, to use when visiting Yours.org.  ""Naturally"", the website does not mention the need for that extra ~~birdbath~~ wallet.

PS. I filed a form S-93-A for Yours.org, but my budget allowance is nearly exhausted and the folks at the Intel Dept are overloaded because of all the recent developments.  So all I got was a Level 6 Surveillance Operation: an intern will check the main Yours.org forums once a week.  Oh well."

[Edit: I should have added a caveat that I realize most of you are ok in your jobs and careers - that's not what I'm talking about, even if I realize you obviously have your own losses; if you're able to get what you want and be self-sufficient in one or two areas of your adult life, like making friends or mastering a career, consider yourself lucky, you're magnetic or convincing enough elsewhere to get some things you want from life.]

Their housing. Their friendships. Their skills and experience. Their relationships, of course, but it's so much deeper now. I never imagined being in a relationship even as a kid. I'm an ugly, unphotogenic stunted adult now and even though it brings me incredible pain, I can't stand meeting new people and I'm at an age where most people I'm interested in would give me a second thought on a dating app.

...And you need a story to tell about yourself. I don't have one. I think I used to have laughable, mild passions, but now those are gone. 

I was a floater - until high school I didn't really have friends that I was close to or that would admit it in the open. I'm sure some of you are familiar with it - if you get in trouble, no one is there, and you're low on a friend list. 

And as life goes on, you're ""low"" on the list of every acquaintance you make, every family member, every group you try to be part of. Middling at your very best, in a club, a class, your major. Nobody special. Nobody particularly well-liked, at worst, and there'll come a price for that.

I know a girl who worked for a white shoe law firm as a corporate paralegal for years while in college (how? I'll never know - I don't even know how the fuck she went to class) before a music label took her on as a manager. She has no background in that industry - her writing and her ability to talk about it was enough. Plus, of course, she was pretty. I can't imagine someone I want to work for hiring me and keeping me. 

I know another that's creative director of Ogilvy Worldwide overseas, having majored in Chinese language and art/calligraphy. She's a hot little rocker chick. She always seemed like that type of person at school. One of those people you can tell will go on to do magnificent things from 8th grade on, but realistically - it's one of the most prestigious advertising agencies on earth...I can't imagine what how a person with that major and lesser grades would have fared. 

I know so many people who are just good at what they try, and the reward is ridiculous connections and internships and ascending a ladder to easily from one great company to the next, the ability to change paths, the ability to move. 

The common thread is this - *they* have great jobs and coworkers that love them and if they decide they want something, want to know or be with a person, want a crowd or a scene  - they have the goods to get there, eventually. 

But those are people fill every office, are every recruiter, ever supervisor, every boss. 

Meanwhile, in all that time - I have no employable skills, seven years after graduating from my horrible major - I made no friends in college. And now in every office I temp in for 13/hour, I'm surrounded by 25 year olds who seem to have come of age in a completely different world. Experience a completely different one. My own brother, in truth, is one of them.

And then I look at the guys and girls who founded my offices - they're people my age. If they're nonwhite, they look lifted from a Benetton ad. 

It's just...simple. Other people wish for things, and get them. 

I've failed every competitive endeavor or been passed over for every group endeavor I've sought after.

Other people build up their resumes and experiences, learn transferable skills they carry with them to opportunity A, B, C, to networking pal X, Y, Z - we take whatever shitty opportunity we can get. Or I do. 

And the worst thing is, if you're a certain age or a certain time of person - it'll probably always be that way. You're competing for that sweet entry level role with someone who is naturally smarter and more talented than you, who puts in 50% of the effort you do for all the results, who is bringing the years of having been *liked* and trained and chosen with him/her - and they're younger. 


My life is a fucking joke, a waking nightmare. It's incredibly isolating. I can't bear being around my high school acquintances anymore because of it. I have to lie constantly about my life to not depress people; those that have a vague grasp of what's going on think I'm a piece of shit. 

This is all I think about anymore and when I look at my friends' lives and how easy it seems their own ability just to build careers was - I wish I were dead. 

And the same rules to apply to having friends, realistically; to any part of human happiness you rely on others to bestow. To luck. 

If you relate, I'm listening. 

Those of you working probably have the same feelings about your coworkers' lives and relationships. As the only temp in offices and likely the least skilled, lowest paid person where I am, I get that too. I feel like the ape sent to Mars, surrounded by 25 year olds who can do everything short of coding, who have been working in offices just like the one that would never hire me for a role for...five years. Six. And who all have work friends are *comfortable* and feel they belong where they are. 

I might as well have been dead for the last 7-10 years.

7wi9a2,7,2018-02-09,Spider-Man: Field Day,jockstrappington,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/7wi9a2/spiderman_field_day/,"I've seen multiple posts about ideas for sequels to Homecoming, and I really feel like throwing my 2 cents in, mostly in hopes that some executive will see it and film it. Here's my dream Homecoming Sequel:

**CAST**

Keeping in the trend of the first MCU Spider-Man film of a mentor Avenger helping Peter understand his role as a superhero (Iron Man in Homecoming) I want Black Panther to be a costar in this sequel. Black Panther is about to KILL at the Box Office, and the character is going to become way more popular, making his presence in a Spider-Man film a guaranteed home run. Also, seeing as Iron Man's role in the MCU is going to start becoming very limited (if he even survives Infinity War pt I and II) it would make more sense to have a different character teach Peter. Not to mention Chadwick Boseman has just started in his contract with Marvel and is likely going to appear in many more movies following Black Panther's skyrocketing popularity.

So you've got your mentor Avenger, now for the villain. I think, also following in the footsteps of Homecoming, it would be a good idea to use Kraven the Hunter. Not only have we not seen this character in live-action before, but he is a perfect contrast to Black Panther as a savage poacher/big game hunter in Africa.

**STORY**

My plot would be simple enough for the sequel, and the movie would start with Peter just finishing Junior year, still shaken from the events of Infinity War, excited for rest and relaxation over the summer. Seeing as his Stark Industries ""internship"" has fallen apart thanks to Thanos, Peter would be looking for work to help support Aunt May. Yes, she is struggling for money, and she doesn't want Peter using his powers for money, maybe have her bring up Uncle Ben for fanservice, blablabla, who cares. 

So, we have Peter get a job at the Daily Bugle and our old favorite mustachioed menace, J. Jonah Jameson, is raunchy as ever, doing whatever he can to tarnish Spider-Man's name.

Cut to a montage of awesome action sequences with Peter fighting various classic Spidey foes and getting footage all the while. Lizard in the sewers, Rhino in the streets of Manhattan, maybe even the Kangaroo for a good laugh. *Note all these villains are genetically engineered, but Peter has no idea where they are coming from. Where they're from isn't relevant to the overall plot, but the fact that they are animal-hybrids is* He gets amazing shots using a high-tech setup, and makes quick work of all the villains using his suit's various gadgets, showing his new skills with the tech.

So Peter sells all his footage to the Bugle, and to no one's surprise, Jameson uses it to make Spidey look awful. Peter is glad to be informed by Ned that he is still very popular on social media or something like that (I have cut down Ned's part because his character doesn't serve much purpose at all.) Peter makes bank, May is happy, and she says Uncle Ben would be proud.

Cut to a mansion somewhere in Africa, where we find Kraven the Hunter returning from a great heist, with the plunder revealed to be Hear Shaped Herbs. A butler interrupts him to give him ""another update from the States"", showing him an article that says something along the lines of ""Animal-Men Running Wild in the Streets of New York!"" with a picture of Spider-Man punching Lizard right in the jaw. Kraven would smile, saying something about there finally being a prey worthy of his skills.

Cut to Peter doing some High School summer stuff (I don't care what, something humorous with Ned and Michele probably, they have to do SOMETHING in this movie I guess.) Later on Peter would be doing patrols when he discovers a burglary taking place in broad daylight. He makes quips and takes care of the bad guys easily, but discovers they weren't actually robbing anything. It was a trap laid by Kraven! However, Peter's Stark Suit easily let's him evade this, taking Kraven out and delivering him to the authorities.  

Later that night, when Peter continues his patrols, he discovers a big deal going down with many heavily-armed bad guy types. Before he can even move in however, he sees Black Panther take down at least a dozen men by himself. Peter jumps in, making use of his spider-drone to incapacitate men, making various jokes the whole time. He then asks Mr. Black Panther Sir why he's in New York (if they haven't officially met by now then Peter fangirls a bit.) T'challa then reveals a crate nearby to be filled with Heart Shaped Herbs, stating that they stole them from Wakanda and delivered them here, though there should be more. He also makes a comment to Peter about how he is too reliant on his technology instead of his natural abilities. ""Stark might have built that suit, but he did not build the man inside it,"" or something along those lines. Peter dismisses him and swings home.

Time passes, and we see Peter do more summer-fun things, more Daily Bugle things, comedy relief with Ned and Michele/MJ and Jameson blablabla. Then, we see a scene of Kraven being transferred when one of his guards murders the other guards all around him! He removes a mask, saying something like, ""Sergei, Sergei, I can't always bail you out you know."" Kraven's half brother, the Chameleon has broken him out, and Kraven wants revenge at his public embarrassment. His half-brother tells him to do as he pleases, but he won't be helping him next time.

Cut to a Kraven training montage!! complete with Heart Shaped Herb steroid injections and buffing out

Cut to Peter fighting more crime one day, even more reliant on his technology, with a massive dependence on Karen. Soon he finds himself in another trap set by Kraven, but this time its different. He expected it, having heard about the hunter escaping weeks ago. What he doesn't expect is Kraven to be so much stronger, and we see the hunter overpower Peter and knock him out.

Cut to Peter waking up, asking Karen where he is, to no response. He finds that he is no longer wearing his regular costume... instead he is wearing a black spider-suit! No, it is not the symbiote, but we learn that Kraven has given him this new garb, as he saw it fitting that he should die in ceremonial black (insert joke about Kraven knitting him a costume.) Also, Kraven wanted to level the playing field and take away his tech. 

Soon Peter realizes his suit is not the only thing that is different... he is in a jungle! We soon find out that Kraven has brought him to a ""better hunting ground"" in Africa (I also considered the Savage Land, if anyone actually wants dinosaurs in the MCU.) So about a 1 hour/1 hour and a half into the movie, we leave New York to find Spider-Man in unfamiliar territory, without his suit.

Peter is informed by Kraven he only gets a ten-minute head start, then he will be hunted, like the Most Dangerous Game but with superheroes. Peter is scared shitless. He runs terrified through the jungle, seeing various exotic animals (or dinosaurs if it IS the Savage Land.) Kraven eventually catches up to him after 10-15 minutes of running and hiding. Kraven beats a tech-less Spider-Man to a pulp, talking about how he has been such a disappointing hunt. But just before he lands the killing blow, he is attacked by Black Panther(!) who we find out has been tracking Kraven. Spidey watches in a haze as Panther gets the upper hands and subdues Kraven. Turning his attention to Peter, T'challa starts to try talking to him when Kraven sneaks behind him with a poisoned blade, something he says he's been saving (this shows how Kraven has no honor.) Peter calls out in horror as he watches Panther seize up, his body entering paralysis from the poison. ""He will make a much better prey,"" Kraven says, as Peter blacks out completely.

Peter wakes up to pitch black. He realizes he is in a coffin, six feet under (a not-so-subtle-wink to any Last Hunt fans out there.) He has some sort of breakdown, but collects himself, much like in Homecoming when he lifted the rubble off himself, and breaks free. 

He tracks down Kraven later on, and finds him in the jungle about to kill Panther. In a similar fashion to how Panther saved him, Peter strikes down Kraven, relying on his strength and instincts and spider-sense to do so. After an awesome fight, Peter has Kraven all wrapped up (no killing him) and attends to a recovering T'challa. ""Blablabla mercy to the dishonorable natural strength and spirit blablabla themes blablabla.""

T'chala gives Peter a ride back to the US and drops Kraven off at a more secure holding facility. Peter wraps up storylines with JJ and Michele/MJ and Ned. He dons his Stark Suit once more, having found it with Kraven's things. He says goodbye to Karen, and thanks her for helping him become strong on his own. He then de-techifies the suit a bit, returning to a more classic Spidey state.

**POST CREDITS**

1- Some comic relief from JJ and/or Ned
2- Kraven in his more secure facility, yet again having one guard kill another and take off a mask, revealing himself to be the Chameleon. ""I thought you weren't going to help me again? blablabla"" Kraven is confused when Chameleon opens his cell, AND another one. ""The first time was because we are family, this time, its business. And what makes you think I'm here for JUST you?"" The Rhino, the Vulture, and Kraven then accompany Chameleon out, teasing an appearance by the Sinister Six for the third film in the MCU Spider-Man trilogy.

7wiku4,8,2018-02-09,I’m [22/F] not sure how to continue this LDR with this guy [23/M] I’ve been seeing.,s_lnt,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7wiku4/im_22f_not_sure_how_to_continue_this_ldr_with/,"So we met on Tinder a few weeks ago in Korea. I was completing and internship, and he was there for a work trip. We went on 2 dates, and everything went well. Before we went back to our respective countries, I told him that I might be going to Japan (where he’s at) for a 3-month internship at a university. 

We ended up talking about where we’re going to go from now, and both expressed our desires to see each other again. As such, we’ve been constantly texting since then, sending daily PG photos, and the occasional call.

I’ve gotten confirmation over the past week that I’ll be going to Japan in March. However, we no longer text like we used to over the past few days - as in we keep missing each other. I’ll text him at night, he’ll respond in the morning, and then I’ll only be free to respond after work again. Not sure if we’ve just gotten ourselves into a mind game of “since you took x to respond, I’ll take y.”

My wish now is to continue talking until we can meet again and see where it goes, and yet I’m unsure of how to continue this."

Everything has been really quiet lately, FH is loving life at FAIL's- He's currently helping her plan a museum trip for her students- and I keep myself super busy between school and my internship and other things. 

However, I was speaking to Reichstag today and she was reminding me that I haven't done any of my 4 required visits, aside from holidays with her. (Holidays are the usual, plus her birthday weekend.) I was totally baffled, she used to talk about these ""required"" visits when I was younger, but I never took her seriously. 

She also reminded me that I can plan with my older sister if we want to visit her and my little brother at the same time, or if we want to do our visits separate. Uh, sure, Mom. I really want to take a week off of school and my internship to listen to you berate me about everything under the sun and remind me how I have to thank you for being so intelligent. 

I haven't told her yet how far the school is that I'm planning to transfer to when the time comes. But she has stated before that she'll be like HER mom, aka my grandmother and spend a month at all of her childrens homes. Who wants to be the one to tell Reichstag that the difference between her and my grandma is that my grandmas kids actually liked her, and that my grandma has made amends with each one of her kids, INDIVIDUALLY for the things she did? And THAT'S why grandma was so welcome in their homes for extended periods? 

She also believes I'm not moving to Washington, and loves to laugh about how when I first started thinking about moving there, I mentioned that she hates the cold and probably wouldn't be coming to see me. Like, no, Reichstag, I wasn't joking. I'll force myself to deal with the cold just so I can see you even less, and make sure FH doesn't have to deal with your abusive shit. 

Anyways, I had a great week, and FH and I agreed on our favorite baby names if/when the time for babies comes. Having super cute names and imagining them with FH's chubby cheeks is warming me up slightly to the idea of any babies. No baby rabies over here yet though! Just some fuuunn. 

Hope everyone enjoys their Friday night, and staves off the baby rabies. "

7wjmxo,2774,2018-02-10,Is salary really that much of a game-changer?,RobertReloaded,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7wjmxo/is_salary_really_that_much_of_a_gamechanger/,"Summary in the EDIT, final decision at very bottom paragraph.    

I'm having a hard time deciding if I have a bad misconception of how important salary is in the long run. Here's as brief as I can make it:    

Recently obtained BS in electrical engineering. Manufacturing company I interned for is offering me $73k with a $12k signing bonus, however, I would rate the work a 5/10 and it has nothing to do with what I really want to do-- **PLC's and automation**.    

I've recieved two other job offers from a larger and smaller PLC company that does exactly what I love... PLC's, controls, automation, machine programming, etc. However, I've found their offers to be weaker at around $65k. This is pretty average for beginning EE's like myself I've discovered.    

Ideally, I'd like to snag the signing bonus (contingent on working for a year) and finish up some of my intern projects,working at the manufacturing company for a year, and then leave for a PLC company like the two I mentioned.      

Am I selling my soul for a one time payment from the manufacturing place, which won't make a big difference in the long run (almost 20k...)? Will this just hinder my progress in the engineering fields I actually enjoy? How about looking bad to future employers for only working at a company for a year?     

I'm new to financial freedom and large salaries, so any help in making this decision is appreciated. I've been lurking on posts and the sidebar about starting my 401k and such. Thanks!!        

***

Edit: Thank you for all the comments and advice! Although I am not responding to everyone, I promise I've been reading every comment and will continue to do so this weekend. I'd like to post a summary of the most popular points in this thread so far, for the curious and people in similar situations:    
    

Advice FOR higher salary position:    

*A big jump on your 401k/savings plan can turn into a lot of money for retirement.    

*More money in the beginning of your career means a lot compared to 10 years down the road.    

*Higher salary gives more room for negotiation with companies later on, however, the difference field of experience won't necessarily make you more valuable than a college graduate for example.    

*Time is money, and if work is just work, than the better compensation gives you more for your time and allows you to enjoy personal time more.    
    
    
Advice FOR lower salary position:    

*Doing what you like in a job is very important, and in a situation like this you get into the territory of diminishing returns.    

*Job progression happens fast, and the experience in a desired field makes a 10-20k difference negligible in the long run.    

*Better personal interest in a job gives more room for progress and better opportunities based on meaningful work.    

*As long as you're financially comfortable, having a more enjoyable life can make life better in general and prevent stress and soul-sucking day-to-day involvement.    
   
There are a lot of other factors I've been considering and have evaluated each companies benefits as well.        

***I've decided to take the majority's advice and go with the PLC/Automation company. I'm still waiting to hear about their offer negotiation but I will likely end up taking whatever their final offer is. The experience and quality of the work seems like the more important aspect this early in my career, and I would recommend the same to anyone in a similar position. I appreciate all the comments, especially considering I got a great mix of educated responses on financial strategy as well as fellow engineers in similar fields.

2.Should I do an internship before I go off to university and if yes, what kind of company would be best to choose for it?

3.Do I need a masters degree to be able to go in development or is a bachalor enough?

4.Is it necessary to study robotics or is a similar course (e.g. Electrical engineering and information technology with a focus on automation technology) just as good?

5.Does choosing a course in english rather then german bring any advantages besides being more qualified to work abroad?

6.Any tips for studying successfully?"

I’m graduating from Morehead State this May with a computer electronics engineering degree and I’m curious what steps or actions could I be doing now to potentially land a job by the time I graduate or shortly after? 

There’s a rather large city an hour away from me, which is Lexington, and I’m thinking that is where the jobs would probably be. We’re a suitcase college and there is absolutely nothing in this town except for this school. I also don’t mind driving, as I already have a 30 minute commute to work. 

We also have the Toyota plant in Georgetown where I would LOVE to get on, but I don’t know if I have enough experience where I’m leaving college. Unfortunately, I’ve had no internships due to this town being dead. It’s also pretty difficult to find anything computer-related around this area. (Also I suck and I should have probably tried harder but that’s for another day)

I’m working at Kroger right now 30 hours a week and living with my folks and I’m trying to be financially stable for once.

7wmd24,1,2018-02-10,"M4F Recolonizing Latin America, one puta at a time",ldnby92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7wmd24/m4f_recolonizing_latin_america_one_puta_at_a_time/,"*The Mandarin Hotel, Puta Cana, Dominican Republic, near future*

Ethan Brenthouse took a long, slow sip from his mojito, draining it down to the ice. He had to admit, as much as his preference was for American rye, the Dominicans made a damn good cocktail. He lazily signaled to a wide-eyed waitress, who quickly shuffled over.

""Another please, *mamacita*"" he sneered in his distinctive, privileged drawl.

""Of course sir,"" the young girl quietly responded, giving him a pained smile before hurrying back to the bar. 

Ethan sat back on his chair, folding his arms and listening to the waves of the Caribbean crashing into the white sand of Puta Cana Playa, just a hundred or so feet away.

It was good to be American again.

It was hard sometimes to process how much the country had changed in a few short years. Ever since the astonishing electoral victory of the Founding Father's Party in 2020, America had finally fulfilled its Manifest Destiny and become the Empire it always deserved to be. The red, white and blue juggernaut had steamrolled through Venezuela in 2021, crushing the socialist uprising and liberating the world's largest proven oil reserves. Across Latin America rebellions and left-wing insurgencies everywhere from Honduras to Peru were crushed by US-backed dictators using America-made weapons. And yes, the FFP had also built the big, beautiful wall on the Mexican border. The entire southern continent was now nothing more than one huge *maquiladora*, making American goods for next-to-nothing and pumping money into the glorious US economy. Places like the Dominican Republic had become veritable gold-minds for American investors. In the morning they could grease some palms, and displace a few hundred favela-dwellers to build a new luxury hotel for American tourists. In the afternoon, dine with corrupt government officials to ensure that US corporations could have monopolies on the country's natural resources. And in the evening, party with an army of Latina sluts, all desperate for a *principe blanco* to take them to the US.

Which brings us back to Ethan Brenthouse.

Tall, blonde, and chiseled from years of polo and lacrosse, Ethan was about to enter his final year at Dartmouth, and had decided to take the summer to ""intern"" with a venture capital firm down in DR - one owned by an alumni of his frat. Ostensibly Ethan was there to help find new, market-friendly investment opportunities for the growing and dynamic American market. In reality this just involved a lot of partying and drinking, for which Ethan would receive an extremely generous stipend and a job after he graduated with one of Washington's biggest lobbying companies.

Tonight, however, Ethan wasn't interested in business. He was interested in pleasure.

He had tried to make some vague promise to himself to stay faithful to his girlfriend back in Dartmouth over the month he was down in DR - after all he'd cheated, and been forgiven, so many times it was honestly farcical at this point. That changed his second night in Puta Cana however, when he found himself in a strip club's VIP room with some whore on her knees in front of him, head bobbing up and down. The women down here were just so...desperate and servile. Was it the Catholicism? Their sense of inbred inferiority? Or just the fact they knew 21-year-old Ethan was in possession of more money than they could ever dream of?

The waitress returned a deposited his mojito with a timid smile before disappearing. Taking a drink, Ethan's eyes scanned around the hotel's restaurant. It seemed the Mandarin had taken extra care to have plenty of eye-candy on display for their Western visitors, so Ethan wasn't exactly lacking for options. Waitress? Hostess? Classily-dressed girls, here all alone, who were likely hookers? One way or another, his privileged white seed would be flowing down some puta's throat tonight...
________________________________________

Hi there! Do taboo themes like corruption and raceplay turn you on? Do you want to explore the sick, dystopic side to American colonization? Do you want a well-written, eloquent roleplay that can be either short-term or long-term? Well then you're in luck. 

This is a story where, together, we craft the downfall of a beautiful, young Latina girl. Maybe she's a waitress, struggling to make ends meet, and sees Ethan as a ticket to the top. Maybe she's a student, wide-eyed by Ethan's riches, or maybe she's a high-class escort, surviving a dystopic world, who knows how to give boys like Ethan the Latina experience they crave. Whatever character you choose, it'll be one where Ethan gets to realize his innate superiority over the mulatto hoards of Latin America, fucking their women just as his country had fucked over their people.

I realize the prompt is quite dark but I'm far, far more interested in mental degradation and corruption than anything physical. I find it so much hotter when a girl forces herself to willingly submit to an arrogant guy then any actual rape scene.

If you're at all interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you!"

---

No one at work knows who I am. Not really. To them, I'm just the skinny, introverted, effette intern who does the photocopying and makes sure a pot of coffee's always on the boil. Most of them assume that I'm gay - I'm bi, actually, but my history of hetero behaviour is so minute I don't care to correct them - but if they knew who my current boyfriend was... Well, I wouldn't have a job anymore, that much is certain.

Now, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. 

To be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.

I first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.

You, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.

However, your owner was far from concerned. ""Happens all the time,"" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. ""Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.""

Needless to say, I was far from impressed.

Twelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.

I revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.

Come the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. ""Come on, man,"" he pleaded. ""It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you."" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.

No such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...

About a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. 

I strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.

I keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.

I don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.

And with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.

I've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.

I find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. 

The mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.

Our eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...

---

*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*

*I'm also open to incorporating a third, human character (male or female) that gets off on my living situation, with possible blackmail involved. That said, I'd prefer the story's focus stay with myself and my canine lover.*

*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*

*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*

*Edit: Please try and be creative, or at the very least informative in your reply. One-liners are... Less than ideal.*"

And then there is Smackdown. Oh boy. Do you remember those photo love stories in youth magazines in the 90s? Do you remember how they printed shocked expressions all over pictures? This is exactly how Smackdown feels to me whenever parts of a promo suddenly appear in terrible fonts all over my screen. Not only does it not add anything to the product, no, it is positively infuriatingly distracting and cringey to me.

We all know WWE sometimes seems to let their photoshop interns handle material (some preview pictures of wrestlers look nothing like the actual person due to softening hair with filters etc.) but so far at least that was single incidents.

How do you guys feel about it? Am I simply in the minority with this and sadly will have to accept that this is considered ""trendy"" and ""hip"" or do others see it similiar to me?

Cheers!"
7wnqo2,5,2018-02-10,Where to find mainframe internships?,MVSThrowaway,mainframe,https://www.reddit.com/r/mainframe/comments/7wnqo2/where_to_find_mainframe_internships/,"Hello! I'm a 3rd-year college student who's starting to look for an internship over the summer. The thing I'm most interested in doing by far is working with mainframes and enterprise systems- they're what I'm best at doing and what I enjoy the most. I've got Master the Mainframe experience and I'm minoring in Enterprise systems, so I'm not exactly short on experience academically, but I'm having a real hard time finding internship positions for these technologies. You hear a lot about how the big iron old guard is all at retiring age and people are aggressively looking for their replacements, but in the few non-IBM interviews I've had so far they tell you early on that they don't let interns or entry-level workers ever really touch the enterprise systems, if I'm lucky enough to find an internship at a place running mainframes period. My methodology has been going to school career fairs and following up on the websites they send me to, and also looking on sites like indeed, glassdoor, and monster searching for keywords like ""z/OS,"" ""mainframe,"" ""COBOL,"" ""MVS,"" ""OS/390,"" ""Enterprise computing,"" and all that jazz. I'm also up on the IBM z Job board and I'm in a few of their recruitment buckets, but two interviews with them both ended up as dead ends. I'm near NYC, too, and you'd think of all places there would be some demand there! Am I looking in the wrong places? Am I supposed to be starting out as a Java dev or a web dev and then maneuver my way towards mainframe work? Thank you for your help!

EDIT: Thank you all for your input, you're incredibly helpful!"

(US)",Dingleberg08,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7wnz3z/mechanical_engineering_student_with_15_years_of/,"As stated,  I am in the third year of a mechanical engineering major. I have been working at an internship for about 8 months making $15/hour.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a quick rundown of my debt:

Car Loan: $3437.60 with a payoff amount of $3420, 
terms of this will end in 14 months and I am currently paying $244.70/mo

Credit Card: $5121.57 interest rate of 10% APR (used this to pay for summer classes since FAFSA doesn't cover)

Student Loan: Subsidized $3400

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I work 24 hours a week and have been saving 30% of my net income for about $400/month. I have built an emergency fund in the amount of $2000 in my checking account and would like to begin to move towards saving/paying off debt since I live at home.

I will be receiving some scholarship money and want to put the entirety of it towards debt (roughly about $3750).

What would be the smartest way to use my money? I know it is typically smarter to pay off the loan with higher interest first which would be my credit card but would it be smart to pay off the car loan and be able to put my monthly payments towards my credit card?

In theory, I am thinking if I choose to leave my internship once I begin my senior capstone project, it may be beneficial to not have my monthly car loan payment of $244/mo.
If I choose to pay off the car first, it would be easier to maintain the lower minimum payments on a credit card versus the monthly car payment, although paying off the car would mean I would allow more interest to accrue on the credit card balance.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Sorry guys I am trying to become smarter financially and would just like to make the best choice.

Thank you in advance for your time!

———————-

As of today I seem to have reached a rock bottom point in my physical and mental dispair. I’ve come to realize that I’ve sermingly lost control inside of my head and am frustrated with the sermingly never-ending stream of things which are collectively bringing me down. I realize that this sub may not be the most appropriate place to post this. I am also aware that there are people out there who have it much worse than me in life. I truly do not wish to downplay their issues and if I somehow do I apologise in advance. I decided to write this post as a means of letting off some steam first and foremost, nothing else. 

A bit of background informatieon on myself would probably be helpful. I was born two months early and as a result I have a severe visual disability (I’m under the ‘societally blind’ treshhold, if that even exists in other countries). As a result I’ve gone to a special education establishment for visually inpaired people for the majority of my life. I’m currently preparing for my exams which are 1 1/3 years away, as well as trying to figure out what I want to do afterwards. Despite my disability I live a gererslly comfortabele lifestyle and try to focus on what I can actually do with my shitty eyes. 

Although my stint with depression-like symptones has been going on for quite some time now things really seem to have taken a turn for the worse last October. The short story is that my body was exhausted due to overworking myself, leading to some severe sleep deprivation. I sought out help and was hopeful that I could get back to normal within a few months. 

Fast foward to last January. My sleep and deriviative health issues had subsided a bit. As it turned out the issues were caused by a severe amount of stress which my body has had to endure both physically and mentally. Despite the over half a dozen persons - including multiple psychologists - I was largely the one who figured out the cause for my issues. In fact, over the last few months it has increasingly become clear that the bickering by the horde of professionals has actually worsened my situation. They have, for instance, started meddling in family affairs and created an ever-expanding rift betwern me and my parents on top of the already existing tension.  

As January progressed my physical and mental health started deteriorating rapidly again.  The sleeping issues have returned and I’ve sermingly started suffeting from migraines. My introspection has increasingly caused my moods to swing to the very worst of myself in public spaces, bringing with them all the negative effecte which come along with said displays in terms of peoples’ perceptions of me. I’ve become very emotional and started loosing motivation for even trivial things. I’ve become isolated from friends as they have started fistancing themswlves from the one with ‘anger issues’ or autism’. I generally have spiralled out of control it seems. 

The reasons for my apparent sadness/depression are numerous and far too complicated to explain in this post. They generally boil down to constant parental infighting hanging a  cloud of divorce over my head, reckless spending by one of my parents potentially causing me to not have enoigj money to pay for my future studies and in the worst case preventing me from getting a mortgage when the time comes, getting thrown around as the ’depressed one’ by friends and foes alike, becoming increasingly isolated in social circles, not knowing what I want to do with life coupled with my handicap making it even tougher (especially due to people treating me like I’m incapable of anything), and - above all - being frustrated by all the supposed ‘help’ I’m getting...among many other things. 

I realize that the issues I have outlined are by no means a sudden appearance. I think that the ‘stress’ I wrote of earlier has been acting as a maak or veil of sorts - telling me that something is wrong without letting me fully grasp the causes. But this is all speculation on my part

As I said earlier I wrote this primarily to blow off steam. Whether or not this will be of any use to anyone is another story. What I do know, however, is that something has to change. I have reached the point at which I fail to see sunshine in life. Yesterday was my last day at an internship. Despite all the positive things which I learned and did I felt useless and very sad after reflecting on it. And as of today I’ve even started getting sad over things which I can’t change. A simple case of getting paspoort photos turned into humiliation as my disability made starting straight into the camera next to impossible. Apparently it’s normal to treat near-adults as toddlers when such things happen. 

I really Just don’t know anymore.

I am a third year undergraduate student studying biochemistry and genetics who is proficient in a few coding languages. I am currently doing research in a molecular biology lab focusing on the basic mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis. This will be my second year doing research with my PI.
I've been looking at some internships at a few R&amp;D biotech companies. They are not in-state because I can't seem to find any that offer internships for summer. Maybe I am looking in the wrong places. I'm graduating in spring 2019 and for some reason I am afraid I won't find a decent job to pay off my debt; perhaps this is a normal feeling. I think the stereotype that life science majors are ""useless"" and ""unemployable"" is getting to me. I live in Texas and I can't seem to be finding any internships that are local. So I am considering to just continue working in her lab. On the same token, I feel like I would be leaving her in the ruts as she did open her doors to me at a time when the lab was low on funds and mentored me to be as experienced as I am today. She used resources on me to get experience. The internships would only be during the summer and I would join the lab again but summer is when I get the most progress done. I also plan to writing a thesis in the Fall/Spring of next year as well as a poster I want to present at a symposium the semester I graduate.
I will feel bad as I know most PIs (Idk if mine thinks this way) don't like the feeling of training people, only for them to leave. I don't think she would react in such way as I know she tries to be the best mentor she possibly can be.
I want to do wet lab stuff and only utilize my software and coding skills as a tool to enhance what I'm doing, rather than the other way around.
I will pursue graduate school but only when I think it's needed to raise the ceiling for myself, but first, I would like to work somewhere that well.
I'm planning to apply to large biotech companies for summer internships such as biomarin.
I'm not sure what I should do. Has anyone else has this type of experience? Is it even practical to move across the country for the summer to work 3 months and then go back? Is my fear irrational? Would having more time dedicated to one thing (being in lab) be more beneficial than having multiple experiences but not enough depth?
I'm not sure what to do."

As an additional benefit from this guarantee, the symbols now `Deref` to `str`.

This is powered by two new types, (currently named) `StringPool&lt;'a&gt;` and `PooledStr&lt;'pool&gt;`.  `StringPool` is built from a unique reference (`&amp;mut`) to a regular `StringInterner`. When you intern a string, you get back a `PooledStr` guaranteed statically by the lifetimes to not outlive the `StringInterner`. Specifically, each `PooledStr` is tied to the lifetime used to borrow the interner into the `StringPool`.

This relies on unsafe pointer work to avoid tying the lifetimes to the borrows to intern strings rather than the borrow to the backing string interner. As such, I'd appreciate you trying to break it / an unsafe audit if you've got the cycles to spare! (I'm still unsure about whether `Send`/`Sync` is ok to re-add.)

Hi everyone,

I wrote this because something happened with one of my collegue and it enrage me everytime I think about it...

My friend, you can call him Julien, found an internship in japan in a french start-up, but it was not the best opportunity : not paid, because of Japan's laws, and without financial assistance to pay bills. I mean, there's downside everywhere. But, These was not the worse...

The subject of this internship, however, was the dream ! Interaction with Japanese, English and french people.. Being in touch with new technonlogies. Responsabilities and oppertunities to travel in different places in Japan... 
And the internship was assumed as a trial period for a JOB ! Wow!!! :D

Julien get contact with the boss of this start-up , let us call him Kevin, really rapidly. Kevin said he was somebody ""open"". There was a good felling with this guy. And he was really reponsive to mail, phone call.

Julien start to do all the paper stuffs (get a VISA, fill the internship contract.. all that stuff), and he even met Kevin.
Kevin was reccomended in linkdin. It seems it was not a scam. :D

Everything was fine...

But..

Things started to being quite bizarre : 

Kevin asked julien to do a Tourism Visa instead of an Internship Visa. (""This will be more simple"" -- Kevin's word)

Kevin start to forget things and even forget to mail papers needed to complete the VISA (For exemple : it take 3 weeks to send a mail with 3 lines of words... 3 weeks!!!!!!!). 

Hmmm....

And then, we found a website ""**dont-work-with-kevin.com**"" (name is change for privacy) The website is quite recent, not really indexed in google...

... 

Oh, no...

...

Inside here was descriptions of how LOTS of people had really bad experiences with Kevin:

* He is a selfish man who can employ, (whithout paying) people to get his work done. 

* He play a lot of the ""can you pay this? The company card's not working"" excuses (80,000 $ stolen)... 

* Student's who worked with him have not, for the most, validate their internship... 

* He work at astounding schedules : This guy can send you emails at 2am to do work. And he can go at work at 4pm, with scratched clothes, claiming he had ""important meeting"". Of course, he will not hesitate to blame you if you have 5 min of late...

All the process described in this site was coinciding with the process of Julien's internship.. There's TONS (TONS AND TONS) of tchat screens showing how Kevin is toxic and not a professional. 

Too much informations, this website is not a scam...

*Tears, screams and cry my friends...*

We get in touch with people who made the website and talk with them a lot... A chance Julien found this site before he start the internship. They advise Julien to cease all the internship process.

Yesterday, Kevin start to blame Julien because Julien send him:
&gt; ""That's not a professional attitude to forget an important mail 3 weeks... And I have send you reminders mail""...

Kevin replied :
&gt; ""I have lot of work to do. You should not talk like this to your boss in Japan""..

Julien sent to kevin a wall of text describing the website he found, and that he want cease all communication with him!

That's sad : Kevin's company had good ideas.. But toxic people is what prevent the company to rise...

Today, Julien start to search another internship, but not in Japan, for now...

Julien has invested time and money into this thing... I want to tell people about this. And prevent people to fall in his trap.
Check for sources, testimony when you search a internship/job...

EDIT : Spelling errors... My bad...
EDIT 2 : Explaination of ""How you didn""t find this website before"""
7wpeuf,1,2018-02-10,Salt Lake Recruiting Advice,AuditAndHax,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7wpeuf/salt_lake_recruiting_advice/,"I’m looking for some advice on how to get recruited by a Salt Lake firm while in another state. So far, nothing I’ve tried has worked and the closer I get to graduation the more I’m freaking out.

About me:  
I’m 34 years old, about to finish my MPAc from a state school in Montana where I work as a TA and have a 3.7 GPA. I finished my undergrad with a 3.8, minors in Int’l Bus. and Chinese, and every kind of honor the university can give.  
After undergrad, I did a summer internship for the university bookstore’s accounting department.  
I have 16 years of experience in a huge variety of industries (I’ve worked in retail, customer service, manufacturing, construction, restaurants, bars, and the casino gaming industry).  
I’ve passed FAR (91), take BEC next month, and just scheduled AUD &amp; REG for May.  
As far as I can tell, I have all the knowledge, skills, and experience needed to make a kick-ass auditor. I’m doing everything right on paper, but still can’t get SLC firms to give me the time of day.

I’ve known since my junior year that I wanted to move my family to Salt Lake. I’ve spent the last few years researching firms in the area. I’ve taken my last two family vacations there, and both times I used the opportunity to meet with local firms to discuss opportunities and tour offices. The visits have all gone great, and I’ve walked away from the experiences very positively.

Unfortunately, that’s where my good luck ends. Only 3 regional firms with SLC offices recruit at my school, and those recruiters all come from other states (OR, WA, AK). I’ve met with several of them anyways and had on-campus interviews for internships senior year and FT positions last fall, but never get callbacks from the Salt Lake offices. It doesn’t seem to matter how well the interview goes, the Salt Lake firms always choose local candidates over calling me in. I was even contacted by one interviewer after SLC rejected my application; he couldn’t believe they didn’t bring me in for a round 2 and straight up offered me a position in his office if I decide to give up on SLC. Basically, I’m doing everything right on paper, but can’t manage to get my foot in the door.

Has anyone else dealt with this? Any suggestions on where to go from here? There are still a few firms I haven’t applied to, but I don’t want to resort to just emailing resumes. Waiting until fall recruitment isn’t really an option; I need to have a job by June when I get booted out of family housing. I’m afraid my only option now is to get hired at a local firm, work a busy season, and try to apply for experienced associate positions in a year or two. Anyone see a way around this?"

My fiancé and I are looking at purchasing a home in the next year (we are currently living with his parents pretty much rent free until I finish grad school next August, we are getting married this May). 

We know literally nothing about home buying though, and I am kind of lost as to where to start.

I am doing an internship right now and my supervisor suggested applying for a USDA Home Loan and buying before I finish graduate school to get a cheaper rate, but I am not sure how that’d work once I finish school and have a higher paying job? 

Right now we are making under the maximum income needed for the loan and we have decent credit (he has great credit, I have mediocre credit due to no open cards and student loans that haven’t come due yet). 

Our bills right now are around $210 a month total. We have been managing to save about $2000 a month out of the $3000 we usually make. I’m just not sure how to proceed with any of this or whether it’s even feasible to buy a house before I start contributing more money. 

Any input is appreciated!"

Two weeks ago I finally opened up a Roth IRA with TDAmeritrade and threw like $200 into it. I also have my direct deposit at work putting 5% into it every two weeks when I get paid (so probably about $100/month).

Now comes the point where I have to actually do something with it lol. I was reading into River Park retail funds ($RPXFX) last week, as they had something like 23% growth in the last year which looked very attractive. But I don’t want to just jump into it, as their minimum investment is $1k so I’d have to throw a lot more money into it all of a sudden just to get started.

Help! :)

Also, any other general financial advice you can give to someone in my position in life would be wonderful. I’ll be graduating into the tech industry, most likely staying with my current company but converting to full time. I’m estimating I’ll start out somewhere between 60 and 75k/year. And with about $25k in student loan debt that I’m hoping to get paid off within 12-18 months if I continue to live like I do right now and throw loads of money at my loans lol. "
7wqgj8,2,2018-02-10,Feeling Stuck...,Naasa21,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7wqgj8/feeling_stuck/,"I don't know how to really start this feed, and I am honestly having a hard time typing each word out. So here it goes...

I don't know what to do with myself. I know where I want my life at, but instead I find myself everyday distracting my mind from the stress going around me.

It all started when I quit my job at a company in which I was miserable working at because of how the CEO treated his employees. He felt it was necessary to see us as disposable and have anyone who would address this issue to volunteer to quit. After sometime struggling to pay my own bills and finding a new job, I moved back with my mother and younger brother. It wasn't even a week when she told me then that she was in a state where she was losing her house. I did however find a job after sometime... only to then lose it in 3 months. 

I constantly feel the pressure of being homeless as my mother keeps reminding everyone that we are at a state of losing our house as she is unable to pay her bills. It so bad that my younger brother dropped out of college to work. And because of this constant pressure, everyone is at everyone's throats. Like one instant was when I came back to my house after being gone two weeks, and it wasn't even two hours when I started to contemplate ending it after how bad everyone was fighting.

I also can't go back to college myself because I don't have the money to pay for it and I have hit the cap with my finical aid as my attempts at the necessary credits exceed what is allowed. And I know there is a lot of opportunity in retail, but due to my poor memory and social anxiety, I have a hard time keeping those types of jobs. It also doesn't help that we live in an area where getting a common retail job is harder than becoming an genetic engineer without a college degree.

The only thing I know I exceed at is working with technology, and I want to start at the intern level as a programmer. But because I am neither a student or have a degree, most companies won't give me the day or time. It sucks knowing that if given the chance, I know I can go far and beyond what is asked of me.

So now here I am without a job, unable to go to school, unable to chase the career path I desperately wish for, and not knowing what I should do. I feel stuck."

Have you ever seen Bojack Horseman? I recall an episode where Bojack decided he was going to be positive, he was going to accept life's blessings and be humble and jovial. It worked, he couldn't be sad anymore, he couldn't even act properly because he was just trying to be too happy. 

Even Diane, the only voice of reason at the time was fooled. 

But then something happened, his mother called and told him how nothing he does will ever make him whole, and its her fault and she's sorry.

He fell into a depression and then when he finally was alone, he cried in the arms of nothingness. 

That's how I felt. I didn't just decide one day to act happy, I breathed it, I acted in it, I faced all of my demons and allowed myself to feel happy. Then this toxic woman from Tinder came. 2 good dates, then a third one where an amalgamation of every woman who has mistreated me in life's actions just seem to pile up.

Insults without realizing it.
Using me for food.
Pretends to be attracted to me, but when I become sexually interested, she pulls away.
Focused on her ex
Shouts in rage when she is called out on her horrible behavior. 

I fell into a depression because of this. I'm 6""2, I go to the gym every day, I'm admittedly good looking and brilliant as fuck, I have abs to show for it, and I've been called entertaining and charismatic. 

But none of it matters to them.

The girls I want just don't seem to see me for what I do or what I am. 

It reminds me of this moment where a former friend of mine and I along with a few other friends were out to dinner. We were talking about dating, I told her about my preferences, I told her I didn't date girls with cellulite. 

She said: ""Fuck you, what makes you so special?""

I replied: ""Abs?"" 

she just snydely and stone-face replied: ""No. . ."" 

then I told her  : ""well, I'm smart?"" 

same thing: ""No . . . .""

She looked at me with a glare, I laughed it off and we went on with dinner. 

I messaged her later telling her that in hindsight, I see how what I said could have offended you, but I don't appreciate what you said to me.

She said nothing.

A few months down the line after facing more disappointments from not taking what I wanted, I just unfriended her because I didn't like her anymore.

She did everything people who failed me and hurt me in life do.

She's mediocre.
Insecure.
And uses her own wounds to justify her attacks on me and other people. 

She's toxic. 

And you know something? I don't have to brag, but if anybody who is overweight ever tries to ask me : ""What makes you so special?"" ever again , I'll just say : ""excellence in what I do."" and its the fucking truth.

I took a break from dating, because the rejection coupled with how badly the girls were treating me was becoming hella old hella fast. 

I'll just date again during the summer, because right now I'm legitimately too busy with my grades, my gym time and my internship for anyone else. 

But right now I feel so much rage again. 

It's a good thing, and a bad thing.

Because, before I was able to be calm in any situation.

Now, I find myself getting upset over petty things that wouldn't have phased me a month ago.

At least now when I go to the gym, I'm able to channel my aggression and anger at those B(****) into a 225 lbs bench press.

But, I remember my anger and how damaging it was to me and the people around me. . .

I get the final round technical interview for a summer internship I really wanted.  I took a break of my daily regimen to prepare for 3 straight days.  I completely bombed it.  I gave myself the next day off from my schedule as consolation.  That day turned into a week.  Then I was officially rejected and that seemed to cause a second wave a lethargy.  I feel like I am stuck in a funk right now and I want to understand why.  Am I making the rejection as an excuse for myself not to do work?  What are some tips you have to get back on track to pursuing your goals.  Thanks!"
7wrbrb,8,2018-02-11,"INFP Christian. Sad, Frustrated, Angry, Depressed. My Life.",ktack93,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/7wrbrb/infp_christian_sad_frustrated_angry_depressed_my/,"    As the title says, I am a host of all of those emotions, constantly, on a daily basis. Literally, from the time I wake til I sleep is nothing but regret and emotional pain. Day in and day out is just... miserable and empty. 

    My family are the only people that I am in constant contact with. I am a Christian and come from a mostly nominal Christian family (most of them talk the talk, but refuse to walk the walk). I take my faith very seriously (I was blessed with an internship at my church for a college age teaching position), and although I try to be very kind and patient towards nominal unbelievers, I am very intolerant of those who claim to be Christian, yet show that they aren’t by their unchanged lifestyle/heart. 

    *sigh* I have the displeasure of living with my grandparents, siblings, aunt, and mom (it’s a long, complicated story, don’t ask), all of which are loved very deeply by me, but seem to be very, very put off by me. This rejection has caused me to have an intensely deep addiction to pornography (shameful, I know) that my grandmother has told me to, “Stop talking about”, because, “No one cares to hear it”. Obviously, comments like that only further compound the problem (to the point where my confidence is so low that suicidal thoughts are a daily struggle for me), but then again, she (and pretty much everyone else I’ve talked to about this) doesn’t care, so...

    Apart from the family I live with, the rest of my family has a lot of issues (and resulting drama) that have weighed/are weighing heavy on my heart... seemingly to no avail. I’ve tried to stay out of the way, as well as be patient and understanding. I mean, I try to make myself available. I have a job, a little money, and a car, so it’s not like I’m a real burden on anyone. But no one really seems to care, but they all want to complain when I don’t have any of those things. So... yeah. It’s pretty terrible. I mean, there are people in my family that I have good and personal relationships with. But they live far enough away that we can’t see each other that often.

    But even then, in my family, you don’t show emotion without being bullied. You don’t call people on their offenses without starting a fight. You don’t talk about your problems with other family members unless you already have a good, solid relationship with them, but even then, those you open up to may use your problems against you at a later date. Intelligence and creativity are to be mocked and ridiculed, but not nearly as much as love and deep emotional connection, in my family. In my family, you don’t say you’re sorry, and then take active steps towards mending, you just say your sorry (in a half hearted manner, if you say it at all), and then move on. In my family, there are some who believe you’re not family unless you are biologically related (my dad and mom are both adopted). In my family, you agree with the dominant familial views/opinions, or, if you don’t, you don’t talk about it, unless you want to feel/be ostracized. In my family, if you are the son or daughter of one of our patriarchs/matriarchs who happens to have money, power in the work force, and/or a charming personality, you’re given a free pass. But, everyone else (me included) has to work their butt off just to get bottom of the barrel respect. 

    As one would imagine, there has been a repetition of emotional, verbal, and, on a couple of occasions, physical abuse done to me via family members that I love and once thought the world of. But now... now I can’t even think about/hear their names without feeling sad, angry, and anxious. I’m tired of being afraid all the time, but I have absolutely zero drive or opportunity to better myself. 

    As a Christian, I know what Christ would want me to do (cut off certain family members for the sake of my spiritual, mental, and physical well being)... but I guess... I guess I’m just afraid to do it. Not that I’m afraid to do as Christ commands, it’s just that I’m too caring to just up and leave even though I’ve been told to leave, by my grandfather, on different occasions (never mind the fact that my grandfather has told me on a few occasions that he considers my ex step dad, who abused me and my mom, a member of our family). However, there was one time when I actually went to live with a friend and his family for a few months before I inevitably moved back in with my family (again, it’s a long and complicated story, don’t ask) so maybe leaving wouldn’t be as hard as I think. But then again, the thing with my friend was for reasons other than getting away from my totally looney family.

    Now that I reflect on this post, I’m not really sure why I wrote this (venting, maybe?). Maybe I should’ve just kept this to myself. I don’t know. As an INFP, I know family can suck. So maybe this is just a reminder to Christians, INFPs, or fellow INFP Christians in similar situations that they’re not alone. Regardless, thanks for taking the time to read this novel of a post, and thanks for any input. Cheers."

And I gathered my guts and told her about my feeling. But she shot me down by telling that she liked me as a friend. And then things got awkward and we stopped talking so regularly we even fought a couple of times. It's been almost 2 year since we stopped talking. We talk once in a while and get to know about each other's life. But still I haven't gotten over her. I still have such strong feelings for her and I'm not able to move on. I shot down a girl who actually proposed me because I couldn't feel that feeling which I had for my crush. Sometimes my crush she behaves as if she likes me but sometimes she behaves like a total stranger with total attitude. Show I tell her about my feelings again or not? What should I do? 
7ws7j4,7,2018-02-11,Digital counters as averaging decimation filters,Ov3rpowered,DSP,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/7ws7j4/digital_counters_as_averaging_decimation_filters/,"Hey guys, 

I am an analog IC design intern and I work at a project which includes incremental Sigma Delta ADC. The Sigma Delta ADC digitizes a certain analog ratio into a high speed 1-bit signal. In the DSP there are two counters synchronized to the ADC, one of them counts to a fixed amount (for example 512) while the other one is enabled by the bitstream and therefore counts the number of 1's in the bitstream. The ratio of the number of 1's and 512 is equivalent to the average of the analog ratio during the conversion time. The counters output their values once every 512 samples, therefore they also serve as decimators.

My question is: how do I think about this system frequency wise? I've read that it is essentially a FIR filter, but as analog guy the FIR filters I know are the ones with the delay blocks and tap coefficients and which output data with every clock, while the counters in this case only output once in a long while. How would I even start describing the transfer function mathematically? I've been googling for some literature on this but every article thus far simply says that the counters implement a low-pass FIR and doesn't explain anything. I tried asking at my uni but no one seems to know or care. Can I get some pointers please?

Thanks."

So I have taken a job as new sysadmin. It's only me + a intern. Before I joined they have used consultants to do upgrades etc. but I'm cheap and I want to learn!
Everything is going great, but part of my focus on the job is security, so I want to know how to upgrade our cluster correct.

- 1 x vCenter server (virtual machine) 6.5U1
- 3 x DELL R430 running ESXi 6.5U1 (DELL ISO)

When upgrading my single ESXi homelab, I'm using this page: https://esxi-patches.v-front.de/ESXi-6.5.0.html but I don't know if I can do the same for the cluster?

Everything is production, connected to AD, so I don't want to mess it up.

Something tells me I need to upgrade vCenter first and then hosts, is this is correct? Also can I upgrade directly since It's a DELL ISO install?

If someone have a complete guide or something I would really appreciate it.

Thank you for reading my post, and probably stupid question.

EDIT: Thank you all for your replies. I think I understand it all now.

---

I have been dating my BF (let’s call him Bobby) for 3.5 years. We initially met in high school, but reconnected over social media many years later when we were both in university. I messaged him about some cool tech stuff he was doing (and wanted to learn myself!), and from there we continued talking. During that summer when I messaged, we both lived in the same hometown and started to hangout while living in the same city. Flash forward a few months to back to school time, we both went off to our different universities but decided to continue dating long distance. **I should note that our respective cities were only 70 miles apart.** We would see each other almost every weekend, with one of us commuting to the other’s location. This worked out fine for the first 2 years, as we were madly in love but also both very focused on our schooling and I found it nice to have a balance. Another note is that this is my 3rd serious relationship, and his first ever.


I graduated in April 2016, and soon after found my current full-time career (which includes benefits, paid vacation etc – I am not bragging, just noting how fortunate I am to be in this situation). I have been here for the last 1.5 years, and am very happy where I am in the city where I went to school. Bobby graduated over a year later in August 2017, and I was hoping now that he was done school that we could move in together (every LDR goal, right?). 


I need to sketch out our personalities/upbringing a bit here to try and create a full picture of our situation…. 

Bobby is a very creative type, but also very logical. He often appears scatterbrained and unfocused, but he always did really well in school and he is a very smart person. So many people have no doubt that he will succeed in life. He graduated in business and also did programming on the side. He had some really great intern jobs during university, and I was hopeful for him to return to one of these careers to learn more about startups (as he wants to be an entrepreneur). However after graduating, he moved back in to his parents house to live the “retired lifestyle” (their words- not mine). They cook for him, spoil him (give him free vehicles, take him on vacations etc), and support his lifestyle to be an entrepreneur at their house. He is also currently working at his father’s company, which is how he gets his revenue. 


I was raised in a household where my parents put a lot of pressure on me to succeed (immigrant parents). After graduating, I was explicitly told that they did not want me to move back home with them because I need to make it on my own. I have paid for my schooling, worked multiple jobs during university, and now can fully support myself and am paying off my schooling debts. I have been keeping myself very busy this last year, because at times Bobby has said I am not independent enough…. 
I currently work full-time, am taking business courses part-time, I play in an orchestra, and I volunteer and exercise at a gym. It hurts me when he says I am not independent because so many things going on in my life are not dependent on our relationship at all. 


I am trying to deal with resentment to my BF and his family for his current lifestyle. Part of me wishes I had a famiy that supportive (because who wouldn’t take that opportunity if that was their normal). But at times I also want to see him be more independent and support himself, because I truly believe he has the potential to do more. I also think it is fully possibly to work a full-time job, and also pursue other hobbies/jobs on the side i.e. he could work at a startup to learn the ropes, but also develop his own company at the same time. 

I love my BF, his family is really nice and gets along amazing with my family, Bobby has some personality traits I really want in a partner (no addictive tendencies- I come from a family of alcoholism), and I know overall he would be an amazing, support, loving, husband and father. 


**What I am really struggling with** is the fact that he doesn’t appear to have a plan to ever move in with me, or seem to want to move to my city. I do not want to move back to my hometown, and I do not want to currently give up all the amazing things I am doing here. He says that he just has “faith” that we will work out, but I need more tangible things to believe that (action plans). I also feel at times that he puts many other things higher priority than our relationship. As well, there are times I don't feel enough of my love languages being met (mainly words of affirmation) because is not an emotional person. 

I know that (stereotypically) guys take longer to mature, so he is likely just working out who he is as a person, what he wants to do, etc. but I feel like I can’t wait around forever for him to decide what he wants. I also anecdotally know a few people who have moved halfway across the country to be with their SO, or have given up so much to be with someone, but it feels like neither of us are selfless enough to do that for the other and it makes me question if we are truly in love enough.

I have had this conversation with him many times, but I am definitely more of the emotional person in our relationship. I do not like harbouring resentment or guilt, so I try to express (in the nicest way) how I am feeling to get it out in the open. Bobby however is not a very touchy-feely person, so he often just validates my feelings without offering anything about how he feels or resolutions to fix how I feel. Don’t get me wrong; he is the nicest, most genuine, person with integrity I have ever met. I just get frustrated with him not telling me what he is thinking or how he feels, not feeling supported in the things I am doing, not providing me affirmation (not telling me he loves me or misses me), and the fact that he is comfortable where he is being dependent on his parents and with no apparent plan to move forward together.

TL;DR Is not having a timeline to move in with your LDR GF normal for guys in their young 20s? Do I just be supportive in what he is doing and hope we will figure it out sooner than later?

We are very in love and want to start a family together as soon as possible. But I'm 2 years away from completing my degree program and would have to complete a 1 year internship after that. I currently live at home with my parents who support me financially and who are adamant on me finishing my program. 

My boyfriend and I have discussed marriage often but recently when it comes up he says he doesn't want to get married if I'm going to choose having a career over being a full-time mother, which I feel is fair. If we were to get married and start having kids we discussed that I'd stay home to raise them and he'd provide for us, so he doesn't think it's necessary for me to complete the program. I really want to finish my degree, but balancing life and school is becoming increasingly difficult and I'm just not sure it's what I want anymore. I want to start a family now, but I wouldn't have any support from my friends or family. I also like the idea of the additional security of having a degree of my own in case I need to work in the future. I feel like I'm torn between the two.

Have any of you made sacrifices for married life? What choice did you make and do you have any regrets? I would love to hear your stories, and any possible advice you might have."

been passively online on grindr and tinder and the like, just in case someone interesting pops up

There's this guy who wanted to meet on Friday. We've been corresponding over instagram (think we initially matched on tinder) for months now. We recently planned to actually hang out, but he wanted me to come all the way to him for a coffee date... I suggested that we meet halfway so that I could park in a garage at school that I pay for and spend only a definitive 20 rather than at least 40 minutes (and then paying a meter) commuting. This did not work for him as he would only accept walking 5 min from his building to a coffeeshop. He then sent me a string of passive aggressive texts saying ""ok"" ""well good night i guess."" ""enjoy.""

Talked to another guy last night that wanted to have coffee today. I was a bit tired and said yes because I thought it may make me feel better to have a decent human interaction. I woke up intending to go, but as it came closer to the time, I realized that I'm really not interested in him, am a bit listless, and had to apologize and tell him that I wasn't feeling up to it. I don't normally do that and I feel pretty bad about it.

I'm still weirdly hung up on a guy that I went on two dates with during autumn last year. The first date was perfect. He had heartmelting good looks, was stimulating to talk to, and had a sweet personality. He vocally confirmed/reciprocated the good thoughts that I had, which made me feel like things were headed in good direction, but kept canceling and flaking out on plans that I tried making thereafter. He tried apologizing for the flaking by taking me to a concert for a band that he knew I really liked, but then became distant again. Mixed signals from someone who I was so attracted to was too much of a burden to bear, so I changed my number. Had been intending to anyway because I used to give it away too freely in the past and would get weird people who I drunkenly sexted with years ago contacting me out of the blue. Anyway, I've gone through many exercises to stop thinking about this dude and he still pops up in dreams and I see his face when I wake up. It's garbage.

I've been resigning myself to my studies and my internship, but it has been difficult to get excited about them. On paper, I look like I'm doing better than I ever have before (got all As last semester taking some difficult courses), but every day I have to fight myself. Like really fight myself. I love to oversleep and stop eating when I'm blue. I'll randomly have a day or two where I'm productive nonstop and optimistic about my potential and my future, but it has never been sustained and I always crash down from it way too soon.

I frequently tell myself that I'm in a race to earn my freedom. Just to finish my degree with good marks so that I may get into a good grad program, ideally in a different and less lame city, and that the world will then be my oyster because I will be financially secure. It's the only thing that gets me by.

In the mean time, I think I ought to start going to the gym. I cook almost all of my own meals and my diet is excellent, but I've always been very thin and twinkish and am tired of getting disparaging comments about it flung at me.

Also think that I ought to find a therapist. I feel weird laying out my issues on my close friends, who are also very busy. I've resorted to venting on here, which is a signal that I really could use one.

thanks for listening!"

I was hoping to hear from folks here who may have had similar experiences.  I'm scared to post this, so please be gentle.

I have a looooong history of therapy, but when I moved away from my mom 2 years ago (she was a large source of my trauma), I thought I could finally work on my CPTSD in therapy.  After I moved, I found a trauma therapist, but she said I was too depressed to work on trauma, so I switched to a clinic that would provide medication.  After that I saw a few more different therapists, until recently I was transferred to one who supposedly specializes in trauma.  In our second session, she said that I had to improve my functionality before working on trauma.  After my earlier experience, this was very hard to hear.  

What makes me panic A LOT is that I've been working really hard since I moved to be functional, with therapy, medication, and life changes, and I just haven't been able to get very far.  Granted I'm not at my worst anymore, but I'm not doing great either.  I just really feel like it's CPTSD impeding my functionality.  I was really hoping to do EMDR with her.  I know it takes building up to it, and some discernment about whether or not it would be right for me.  However, I feel I need to try something different from the usual talk therapy modalities.

I know I'm expecting too much, too soon from therapy, but I'm just having trouble existing at my current state.  Like I said, I'm trying not to wait for outside help, I'm getting up and trying to do things even though my body feels like a pile of stones in a bag.  Yet, I feel as though my situation only deteriorates. 

(My therapist is also still an intern, which I didn't know, and that worries me as well.  Just given my extremely long history in ineffective mental health treatment.  Like I had known she was still in training for EMDR, but not for therapy in general.)  "

&gt; 
&gt; When 16-year-old Harshita Arora posted on Reddit about the crypto price tracking app she created the most she hoped for was a few downloads and perhaps some useful user feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, she was met with rape threats, days of online abuse, a deluge of hateful emails, tweets, and messages claiming that she had “plagiarized” the entire app.
&gt; 
&gt; “There probably isn’t a 16 year old girl at all, this whole thing was a scam with the wunderkind backstory to sell as many $0.99 apps as quickly as possible. Probably made the creator a few thousand from reddit alone,” one user wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; “The fact that minority ‘victim status’ seems to be the only real currency with people today is fucking surreal,” said another.
&gt; 
&gt; But Arora never claimed to be a victim. She only claimed to be herself, a self-taught designer, amatauer coder, and aspiring entrepreneur from a small town outside New Delhi in India.
&gt; 
&gt; Like a growing number of young Indians, Arora initially saw the tech industry and startup world as a way to potentially make money and escape her small town life.
&gt; 
&gt; She studied computer science in school, taught herself Adobe design software by night and, in 2016, decided to drop out of classes altogether and “unschool” herself in order to pursue a career in tech.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Within months, Arora had earned herself a prestigious internship at Salesforce in Bangalore. Shortly after that, she was accepted into an MIT summer program, where her and a team built and launched a new app within a matter of weeks.

I spent my college years in LA, graduated, completed internships and worked for almost 2 years as an Assistant Editor at a notable trailer house. Due to “life” I’ve had to relocate to the Bay Area. I’ve been applying for jobs and have gotten nothing in response. I mainly use LinkedIn and Indeed. It’s getting pretty discouraging to feel like I’m back at square one. 

I know there aren’t any real trailer houses here but I know there are other types of ad agencies in the area. What do most Bay Area editors work on? Are you staff or freelance? 

I’m teaching myself to be more of a jack of all trades in post production. In the trailer world where I learned, we had different departments for different tasks. I know that isn’t the case for most Bay Area Jobs. 

If any local editors would care to chat more about what they do or the path they took, I would love to hear from you. 

Thanks all.

I went to a non-prestigious state school and got an OK gpa, ~3.4 in my major. But I also have no research experience, as I spent all my time doing internships during school. I was never super interested in computer science but enjoyed it enough to spend the last several years of my life with it.

I've always had much more interest in Biology and Physics, and only didn't study these because I didn't know if I could find a job with them. I recently learned about computational sciences, and this sounds very interesting to me, and I'm actually really mad at myself that I didn't find out and push myself to pursue this a little during undergrad.

I have a few questions:

1. What is the best way to contact professors or find out about grad school programs? Should I reach out to current students or would that be inappropriate? Maybe a stupid question

2. What are the career prospects like for computational science? It looks like the demand is growing but that the actual # of jobs is pretty small.

3. I don't have a great GPA, and probably worse, I have zero research experience. What are some ways I could make myself more desirable for graduate programs?

I had financed the vehicle and owed more than the car was worth so after insurance paid off, I was left with the gap. Luckily I was smart enough to get gap insurance so I'm not worried about it getting paid off. 

Here's the problem. It's taking awhile for my lien holder to send me the last few documents I need to send to my gap claim. I requested them weeks ago and never got it and when I checked my account it had closed and they said it was in total loss. Of course, I've been playing phone tag with that department for a week trying to get info.

I am a grad student with a paid internship and with no car and in an area where public transportation or bike riding isn't an option, I'm having to pretty much Uber everywhere. I bum rides when I can but it's starting to add up. I go to school 2x a week (25.00 each way) and my internship 3x a week (20.00 each way). So yeah - it's starting to get expensive.

I have been car shopping but the last dealership denied me due to ""multiple reasons"" which they wouldn't state other than the open auto loan. My credit score isn't great, in fact it's pretty low, but since I've been to that dealership it's raised a few points. (FICO score 510, TU score 615: credit score is low due to one account worth $30 in collections that I'm paying off in the morning and an old credit card that I took out as a teen that I stupidly never paid that's reaching the 7.5 year mark).

Is there any way I can get a small car loan? I am looking at fairly cheap but reliable cars, all under $10,000. I have $1500 for a down payment but I'm dangerously close to dipping into that to pay for my transportation right now.

Would bringing in a letter from my gap company stating that they're working on my claim help? I'm I just doomed because of my subpar credit? I am trying hard not to have a co-signer but can get one if need be. 

Thanks in advance for any help!"

I did say my condolences and attended the wakes before (although I had to skip the funeral due to my family did suddenly fell ill at the same time). 

Recently, she has posted something about quitting her medical internship to accompany her grieving mother. I did texted here about ""I'm here for you"". I don't know what I did wrong, but it seems that she was quite angry with that statement (probably because I sort of ""missed the funeral"" before) and replied back ""No, you are not""

At this moment, I know that she is free to be angry whatever that may be. All I care about is how should I keep being supportive during this difficult time? Knowing her, she would stay angry for a very long time and might even cut off all ties suddenly.

Any suggestions?

Edit: It seems the conflict stemmed from the fact that my parents had somehow ""disallowed"" me from joining the funeral. From her other friends, they said that she was extremely disappointed about my parents' relative apathy for her parents and herself.

This is starting to get out of hand. That fact alone was nearly impossible to change. I've considered to stay away for a long time since my very existence tend to set her off in unpredictable ways. I am now feeling ambivalent. One one side, I'm worried about her and ready to help her out whenever I could. On the other hand, I think that she wanted to cut off ties with me for that very fact and I am extremely worried about that. Although, to be honest, I'm feeling very angry and appalled right now and I wanted to state that was not the intention of my parents to offend her, I completely understand that was the part of the grieving process and I intend to tough it out until it is done (how long that it may take I do not know)."

23F-167lb(76kg)-5'8(175cm)
Ive been losing and gaining losing and gaining since 2012, as you can tell, nothing has been sustainable(((( Im turning 24 this summer, and the fact that ive been postponing my life till I am 55 kg is scaring me. Redditors writing these kinds of posts seem to have tried ""everything"" to lose weight. So Im no different. I even was vegan at some point in my life. Recently have started CICO and IF (which results usually in binges on the weekend). There is just so much going in my head that i  dont feel like I want to get out of bed in the morning. Let me put my thoughts in order: 
first of all, my eating habits which are mostly episodes of binge eating and dieting, which causes acne (sometimes i wonder whats worse, to have acne or be fat; and usually my answer is having acne, cause i really want to enjoy going outside without makeup and am never able to do so). I wear make up, am pretty good at it, but the fact that im covering my face makes feel bad cause i feel like im decieving people around me(nobody cares really but still, however debatable). Second of all, I really want to have amazing life, enjoy waterfalls, travel, and go on adventures, be spontaneous and wild... I reckon i can do it only once I lost the weight and cleared out my skin, which seems to never happen((( 
Of course, i dont have a boyfriend. Cause im a shallow person, and no wonder i think everybody is as shallow as i percieve myself to be . You think, I'd be this harsh on myself with this whole weightloss thing  and eating disorders, suffering, being miserable, spending so much time on such a trivial thing like weightloss, my appearance just because of the possibility of settling one day with some mediocre guy to live our mediocre life happily ever after, just for for the sake of being in a realtionship and having a family?? No. Thats the main issue. The thing is, this doesnt allow me to grow, develop, overcome by BED and all this suffering in my life. And i think that all it takes is just losing weight, which in my case is +40lbs. I just know that Ill be gorgeous after all this fat is gone. Like jaw dropping. I now that. Like one of the VS models. I know it, cause Ive been there, i hv been slender with amazing skin. Theres a huge difference between those who have been overweight since childhood and those who gained later in life. I started gaining at university, which hindered severely my uni experience: i was depressed, self loathing, self hating hermit hiding from the world and opportunities just because i gained weight .. oh and subsequently  developed acne of course. So yes, here im, 23 years old. and i know theres so much potential of mine still not released(( and i think if not living to my fullest potential, what is the point of living mediiocre then((( Ive always been an all A student untill weightgain. Got my Bachelors, graduated from Law School from a very prestigious high ranking uni (my grades are pretty low though, whatever) Currenly i have a job. Its ok i guess, I enjoy it.
When it comes to my personal life, i'd like to reiterate, Im 23. Its not unreasonable, it'd be alarming if i it was the opposite, for a girl my age to think of relationships, love, marriage, especially considering that Ive never had a boyfriend (yeah Im a virgin so what). I have already found my potential husband. I mean, of course he does not know i exist YET. We were interns at this firm, but in different locations; every friday we had a conference video call with their office, thats how I saw him ( he saw me too, fat me, a.k.a. same current size me). It was in 2016, two years ago ((. Gooosh, im pathetic.WHATEVER. In my head, i feel like the Universe will make us meet one day and let us be together. I'm not crazy, i keep seeing 11:11 everywhere duuh. Anyway, I hope this didn't come out as creepy.
 But yeah, the point is that all i want and dream about is weightloss, and ironically, the Universe, God, divine spirits dont want to help get where i want to be in terms of my physical and mental health, beauty, hence success in life. Trophy wife is what I aspire to become, but unless i get my life together, which is my health, weight, eating behaviour, fitness, this will never happen and I'll be forever living my mediocre, average life knowing that it could have been so much more different, interesting, fulfilled, accomplished, colourful, bright had i somehow overcome my problems with food((( 
I am aware that I put so much importance on the appereance aspect. As I said, I fall for successful, fit, handsome man who have control over their lives. They are stable emotionally. I am a mess currently. I dont deserve that kind of person YET. If I want someone strong, I need to become one myself. This is how it works in my head. Being an emotional whining crybaby, who cannot control her emotions, would annoy anybody. I'm annoyed with myself. Tired( it lireally has been 6 years, im wasting my life, my youth, time, money (im crying) 
Pls guys, share what you think, I really want to know other perspectives.  
Looking at what I've just written, no wonder I am struggling with an eating disorder((

Possible roles for this include:

- I'm your boss's cocky business student son and I've got an ""internship"" as your manager and now think I run the place. You (and maybe a coworker or two!) lose your patience and corner me in my office...
- You're at your best friend's birthday party, but you'd much rather make a conquest of his slightly younger brother, right under the poor sap's nose, maybe even on his bed.
- Same as above, but I'm your best friend's boyfriend. He's a nice guy, but you've seen my ass and you know it's begging to be used by anyone but a nice guy.
- I'm a rich kid and you're a builder/repairman/plumber etc. I talk down on you, but you're more than confident in your masculinity and know just the way to shut me up.
-We're on the same course, and I've been assigned by the lecturer to help you study since your grades haven't been too good. Even if I'm not trying to act like I'm smarter than you on purpose, you're too horny to study.
- I'm a prince and you're my bodyguard, and you're getting tired of watching from behind as I get my way. You've seen the way I've glanced at soldiers, and you're going to show me how much more virile a ""commoner"" can be.

What if I pulled her into a quiet aisle and got her on her knees? Perhaps she might whip out my throbbing hard member and shove the full length of it down her throat? Suck and slurp all over it like a whore till my cum gags her and floods her cocksleeve of a mouth?

Perhaps you're that wallflower in college who's thirsting for a piece of that hot young stud who bangs babes like a fucking un-neutered rabbit. And oh yes, he's just stepped into the shower. Why don't you dash right in before he can lock his cubicle, yank down your shorts and bend over before him? Let him fuck you and stretch your tight pussy with his cock. Let those deafening sounds of your perky ass slapping against his thighs be your badge that you're the biggest slut around the school, and just milk his cock with that cunt of yours ever so gently as he groans and empties his cockload in. With a peck on the lips and you're off, with your cum-filled pussy soaking your panties as you go about your lectures and stuff.

Maybe I’m that sex-crazed manager who can't stop down-blousing my newest intern that looks like she's just stepped out of a lads mag. And I heard that right! She's working till late tonight to rush out that project that I got her to do alone. How unfortunate! With only both of us left in the office, I’ll bend her over her desk and pull down those panties of hers. I'm sure they are already dripping wet from her lustful thoughts of being turned into a cock-filled slut. Fuck her hard and fast as she stammers and struggles to form coherent sentences. Oh sorry, what were you saying about those Excel reports? Can't hear you, your cunt just feels too fucking good! I’ll fuck her till her thirst is quenched and I’ve myself a new cumslut that's willing to milk my tool all day long under the desk.

And there's you, ever so desperate for that long-awaited promotion! Your closest competitor is an old hag so she doesn't stand a chance. You have the keys of your lecherous manager's vacation home and he's heading there for the weekend, perhaps hoping to score with the Californian beach sluts. Why let him have his way? Why not let him open the doors of his sprawling apartment to the sight of a bound slut that is just begging to be used and filled. Tie yourself to the chair with nothing more than a little ribbon around your neck as you present yourself as a little gift. Spread those delicious stunning legs that go on for days and watch as he falls prey to his lustful desires and fucks you like a cheap worthless whore. Oh you love that don't you? That insatiable lust you feel as his fat cock rams hard against your cervix and turns you into a mindless cocksleeve screaming for more. Don't you just love feeling so sore as he stretches your holes beyond your wildest belief before he dumps every last drop of that gooey sticky reward all over your face and down your throat? Maybe he'll give you the position if you would just leave now and take a lap around the neighbourhood? Perhaps there might be someone who notices that mark of untamed slut-fuckery on your face and decides to take you in for himself?

Perhaps.

I am probably going to live there for 3-5 years as of now. 

I'm looking to either buy or rent and looking to find the potential pros and cons for each. If I buy, I would then rent out or sell it once I move.

Rent for a 1/1 would probably cost me around $1200.

The place I'm looking to buy is at around $120,000 for a 1/1, which the mortgage calculator shows would give me a monthly payment of about $1,000 (including P/I, HOA, Taxes and Insurance), after a $10k downpayment that my dad would make in exchange for partial ownership. We both have credit in the high 700s and neither of us owns a home.

I have no debt and am slated to start at $55,000, plus a $3,000 signing bonus. Before accounting for my side hustle, a $1,000 monthly payment would leave me with about $800/month left over based on my created budget, which I would use to build an e-fund, fund retirement accounts, etc. GF would move in once she's done in a year and help w that, but I know how that goes.


Would buying a house be feasible based on this info?


EDIT: Mom is also a RE agent so I would save on half of those costs."
7x31er,13,2018-02-12,(Remind me) why an accounting career is so great?,Throwaway02122018,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7x31er/remind_me_why_an_accounting_career_is_so_great/,"Why is accounting considered such a rewarding and quality career?

My brother graduated with a degree in Computer Science last year and got an 'entry-level' position as a programmer making $80k/year. He never is expected to work more than 8 hours really (even if he's stuck on a program or project), can come in whenever as long as he does his 8 hours, is allowed to wear whatever he wants into the office (he literally wears a hoodie and jeans), gets free breakfast every Monday and free lunch on Wed/Fri, he's also sponsored by his employer to attend special tech classes/seminars led by Microsoft employees etc. (meaning he gets PTO and travel expenses and everything paid), gets his own office WITH WINDOWS, has an amazingly comfortable and supportive looking chair, and this is just what I can think of off the top of my head.

So my brother is treated like a king in his entry level comp sci position, and this is just where he's starting his career...what comes next is probably only better! NO CPA EXAMS! Etc. I bring this up because I'm graduating this May w/ my degree in accounting, and have an offer for an audit position that I'll take up afterwards. Other than a previous AR/AP internship I have no real world perspective/detailed knowledge of accounting, so I'm just going off of this sub and other articles on the internet. But...even if you're not drinking ""B4 kool-aid"", why would you want to pursue an accounting career where you are expected to slave for the first few years, and then afterwards jump to a job where you're only making $80k or so (if you're lucky, and even then overtime and constantly busting your ass is still likely involved.)

I know she hates me and I hate her too so I wanted to get her fired. I made the normie fag give her admin access to the production repo and made her merge her code with the main branch. well, stacy fucked up and the whole system went offline for an hour before I rolled back the code to a previous version.

There was an investigation and I drilled (tehe) Stacyski in front of the CTO and other engineers I asked her all kinds of questions about our tech and made her cry. Told the CTO she needs to go and he agreed. But by the end of the day she said she doesn't want to continue any more.

Then on 2016 (when i was 20) i started smoking weed with my brother and some other friends in my house. It started with one day, and then 2 days, then on week days, and it kept escalating to a point where i was smoking weed 5 days a week or all days. I smoked before sex, smoked alone in my room before listening to music or watching a movie. 

It became a ritual for me, i stopped hanging out with friends, was doing poorly at work, at class i never payed any attention and failed 2 classes. All my dreams were gone, the things i wanted to do, my goals, i just wanted to smoke weed and chill the fuck out, put on some music and dance with some other friends that used to smoke with me, i just felt all the stress went away from me and everything was good and peaceful, everything i did was with weed at hand.

Then one day i woke up, like a click happened in my brain and asked myself what the fuck are you doing? you are going nowhere in your life wake up from this nightmare! dont lose yourself inside this, remember your goals, your family, your friends, remember LIFE! and just like that, just like that i woke up and said no more weed. it was fucking difficult at first, the temptation was EVERYWHERE, i was only surrounded by people who just wanted to smoke! all my universe was spinning around weed by that point and i hadnt realized it by that time; i just told everyone that i quit and eliminated them from my life right away, best decision ever! but still i was left with myself and i knew that someday i could fuck up. And i almost fucked up, i went to buy the thing AGAINST MY WILL (this is how powerful this is) and got it in my bedroom and i was just glazing at it, then i just said to myself  ¨dont betray yourself¨ i took the weed and threw it on the toilet and flushed the fucker out. Since that day i never ever touched the thing again. 

I GOT MY MEMORY BACK, im now doing BETTER at my work than before! attending clients way more professional (i work at a law firm) making way more money and acing all my classes! i even approved the hardest subject of my career! (only 3 out of 20 did) and didnt even cheated i just studied hard and was the best at class! got my social life back and im now being more extrovert than ever! talking to way more people than i did when i smoked weed, i even traveled to a foreign country to do an internship on the supreme court of the country and was the best at it! I knew i could do it and i did.

Different story with my bro thou, he got 200% more addicted than me, smoking was the only thing he did, my parents found out and got him into rehab where he spent like 4 months and now he is in the house but he is not the same, weed changed him but he is still there and i will lead him on the way so he can make it like i did.

People you can do it, just change your surroundings and eliminate bad people from your life, get new hobbies, remember what your goals were and the things you used to enjoy before this hell of a drug KEEP YOUR BRAIN BUSY and fill it with so many things so that weed gets out of there, if i could do it, im sure as hell that you can too. 

Im happy as fuck. My personal battle is against alcohol now and im already beating it.

If only I had a tiger mom or started a fake charity.

By Suzy Lee Weiss

March 29, 2013 6:31 p.m. ET

Like me, millions of high-school seniors with sour grapes are asking themselves this week how they failed to get into the colleges of their dreams. It's simple: For years, they—we—were lied to.

Colleges tell you, ""Just be yourself."" That is great advice, as long as yourself has nine extracurriculars, six leadership positions, three varsity sports, killer SAT scores and two moms. Then by all means, be yourself! If you work at a local pizza shop and are the slowest person on the cross-country team, consider taking your business elsewhere.

What could I have done differently over the past years?

For starters, had I known two years ago what I know now, I would have gladly worn a headdress to school. Show me to any closet, and I would've happily come out of it. ""Diversity!"" I offer about as much diversity as a saltine cracker. If it were up to me, I would've been any of the diversities: Navajo, Pacific Islander, anything. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, I salute you and your 1/32 Cherokee heritage.

I also probably should have started a fake charity. Providing veterinary services for homeless people's pets. Collecting donations for the underprivileged chimpanzees of the Congo. Raising awareness for Chapped-Lips-in-the-Winter Syndrome. Fun-runs, dance-a-thons, bake sales—as long as you're using someone else's misfortunes to try to propel yourself into the Ivy League, you're golden.

Having a tiger mom helps, too. As the youngest of four daughters, I noticed long ago that my parents gave up on parenting me. It has been great in certain ways: Instead of ""Be home by 11,"" it's ""Don't wake us up when you come through the door, we're trying to sleep."" But my parents also left me with a dearth of hobbies that make admissions committees salivate. I've never sat down at a piano, never plucked a violin. Karate lasted about a week and the swim team didn't last past the first lap. Why couldn't Amy Chua have adopted me as one of her cubs?

Then there was summer camp. I should've done what I knew was best—go to Africa, scoop up some suffering child, take a few pictures, and write my essays about how spending that afternoon with Kinto changed my life. Because everyone knows that if you don't have anything difficult going on in your own life, you should just hop on a plane so you're able to talk about what other people have to deal with.

Or at least hop to an internship. Get a precocious-sounding title to put on your resume. ""Assistant Director of Mail Services."" ""Chairwoman of Coffee Logistics."" I could have been a gopher in the office of someone I was related to. Work experience!

To those kids who by age 14 got their doctorate, cured a disease, or discovered a guilt-free brownie recipe: My parents make me watch your ""60 Minutes"" segments, and they've clipped your newspaper articles for me to read before bed. You make us mere mortals look bad. (Also, I am desperately jealous and willing to pay a lot to learn your secrets.)

To those claiming that I am bitter—you bet I am! An underachieving selfish teenager making excuses for her own failures? That too! To those of you disgusted by this, shocked that I take for granted the wonderful gifts I have been afforded, I say shhhh—""The Real Housewives"" is on.

I'm a second year Student of Fashion Design - studying in the city of Vancouver. Since September I've been interning at a local research and design firm to gain exposure to technical fashion design, construction techniques, and the real-world process behind bringing wild ideas to life...  
The studio where I intern is very tight-lipped about their outputs and involvements, however I am allowed to say that they have been quietly responsible for many of the innovations and products seen across the market - some of which I see posted quite regularly in fits here on Reddit. My roll is still at the utmost bottom of the ladder (see:gopher), however my mentors are incredibly supportive in including me in and teaching me the in-and-outs of the nuances fashion design.

I'm taking this online in hopes that of getting feedback/suggestions/criticisms as to what I should construct each day, at this point I've only a very vague plot of where to begin and what to make. (it was suggested that I start a Blog or Instagram account for this, but I'm a bit of a noob with the whole social media thing and creating/maintaining a website is a total mystery to me... however I've been lurking Reddit for a while now and I'm pretty sure I can handle this - please do let me know if I'm doing it wrong!)

My obsession with techwear has become clinical at this point, made worse by the simple fact that I'm a broke student very much unable to afford the level of craftsmanship in my attire which has come to haunt me. To try and fix this I've been saving every penny I can since this 30-day challenge was presented to me last November. I'm happy to say -with the support of my friends and family- I've been able to put together a small pot of funds that I can put towards financing 30-days of techwear design.

At the end of this project, I'd like to be able to assemble the 30-day log and the products created into a portfolio which I can use to find a job. I'm still very new to this but it's clear to me that technical apparel and accessories design is where I want to focus my ambitions and career. With any luck this project will be an appealing application for a design position with one of the larger industry players.

You can receive a job offer from a major accounting firm, only for your parents to say, ""well its about time"". You can graduate college only for them to say a mere congratulations. You can move out of their house and they won't even recognize. Those are just some of the examples of what I experienced as a young adult. Most of which are not normal. I still suffer depression to this day despite my successes. There were other parts of my childhood that were tough, like moving around several times within the first 14 years of my life, and struggling with learning disabilities, social skills, weight issues, etc. However, I was able to overcome those obstacles somehow. I also had to deal with occasionally critical and controlling parents who sometimes fought in front of their children.  "
7x6qhz,634,2018-02-12,What US Social Security Is Worth,caedin8,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7x6qhz/what_us_social_security_is_worth/,"I was interested in the formulas and math behind social security today. It is kind of interesting, and totally subject to change, but understanding the system at a basic level can help you on your path to FIRE.

**TL;DR**: There is a pretty significant advantage in hitting your qualification for SS benefits (40 credits). The next threshold to hit is the $895 AIME first bend cut off. The added value of working past that decreases substantially.

A few things first

*  There are positive and negative scalars that adjust your monthly payout between ages 62 and 70, with the base being 67. All numbers below assume age 67 benefits.
* You need 40 credits to qualify for SS income. You can earn up to 4 credits per year worked, and each credit requires some amount of income. You need to make a little over $5000 per year to earn all four credits in a year in 2018. 

The motivation behind this study is to determine how valuable SS payments are. For example, if your SS gives you $1000 per month, we can use the 4% rule and determine that the SS payment is worth about $300,000.

How is Social Security Calculated?

* If you have less than 40 credits, you get nothing.
* If you have more than 40 credits, your AIME is calculated by taking your average monthly earnings from your 35 highest earning years, adding zeros if necessary.
* You run your AIME through a formula similar to a tax table: Take 90% of the first $895, then 32% of the next $4500 or so, and then 15% for everything after that. There is a cap somewhere I think. The sum of these numbers is your PIA, which is basically your payment per month if you begin withdrawals at age 67.
* If you begin withdrawals at age 62 you get only 70% (for the rest of your life), if you wait until 70 you get 124% (for the rest of your life)

Great so that is how it works. Now lets see what each additional year of work really means for me (our example).

This is my social security earnings table pulled from the social security website, rounded, and context added.

Year| Taxable Income | Credits | Job
---|---|---- | -----
2012| $5000| 4 | Cashier
2013| $0| 0 | College
2014| $15000| 4 | Internship
2015| $31000| 4 | Programmer
2016| $72000| 4 | Programmer
2017| $83000| 4 | Programmer

So right now I am sitting at 20 credits, I am not eligible for social security. If I was eligible today, my AIME would be $489 per month, and the payout would be 90% of that, yielding $440 per month. This is worth about $132,000 using the 4% rule. Assuming of course I waited until age 67.

This chart shows the value at different age brackets: https://i.imgur.com/L4VUKea.png

Ok, so that is pretty substantial. With two years of working in a post college job, and some work done before I've ""saved"" $132,000 more *retirement dollars* than I actually thought. Wait, not really. I am not qualified for that money, so it technically doesn't exist unless I work until I hit 40 credits.

So if I work until I get 40 credits, it will take me (20/4) = 5 more years, or until I hit $5000 earned income in 2022 (adjusting for inflation as needed).

What will my retirement benefits be worth then when I qualify for them, assuming I make the same wage as 2017? 

Year|Extra Years|Monthly Payout|Value @ Age 67|Qualified|Value Add|
--:|--:|--:|--:|:-:|--:|
2018|0|$440.00|$132,000.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2019|1|$617.00|$185,100.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2020|2|$794.00|$238,200.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2021|3|$864.00|$259,200.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2022|4|$927.00|$278,100.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2023|5|$990.00|$297,000.00|TRUE|$18,900.00​|


When I finally qualify in the middle of 2022, i'll be eligible for $930 in monthly payments, or $280,000 in SS equivalent wealth. The key significant part of this though is that, my value added to my SS benefits allocation is actually $59,400 per year!

**How is this possible?** 

Because the final value at 40 credits is nearly $300,000 and I won't be eligible at all unless I hit 40 credits. So each year between now and 40 credits are worth an even share of the value. Theoretically in my last year, working that year will be worth all $300,000. The math is simple: if I work that year I'll have $300,000 worth of retirement income, if I don't I'll have nothing.

**Takeaway Number 1: Be sure you qualify for SS if possible. The savings are significant**

If you retire before you hit 40 credits, adding small part time work to get the credits needed, could be worth significantly more than your check from the actual job.

So what about after that? How much is each year worth once you've already qualified?

The system drops off quickly once you meet two thresholds, the $895 AIME cutoff (I hit this in my first 10 years), and the qualification cutoff.

You retain 90% of your earned income average up to that $895 value. After that you retain only 32% of each dollar up to about $5400 per month, and 15% over that.

For me personally, my value added drops to about $19,000 per year until I hit the upper threshold in around 2043, then it drops to about $9000 per year.

So you might be thinking, $19,000 that is pretty good per year. I might work longer. But remember this isn't the same as savings in today's money. This is the ""after growth"" value. It is what you would theoretically have at age 67, removing all inflation. Lets see how much money we would need to invest in the S&amp;P500 to get that same $19,000 for working one year.

I'll be age 32 when I jump down to the $19,000 per year threshold. At that time I'll be 35 years away from retirement.

My theoretical return on an investment, after inflation, would be (1.07)^35 = 10.68. 

So if we divide $19,000 by 10.68 we get our true equivalent savings rate: $1779 per year. Probably not enough to keep me in the work force.

Applying this method to the SS value added in the first phase (qualifying) and we can see effective additional savings of $5,000 or more.

**Takeaway Number 2: Social Security Benefits ramp down quickly after you qualify**

That pretty much sums up what I know. Please share corrections, and other knowledge I've missed.

20 Years of exhaustive experience, extensive exposure and exceptional expertise in the Student, Youth and Intellectual domains of ground and apex levels of the Telugu political arena.

I have offered incredible value addition through Inspiring youngsters at college and university level for Policy creation, Resource deployment, Process enhancement and enrichment along with contribution towards knowledge assets for both party and worker at Student Federation of India, National Students Union, Indian Youth Congress and Indian Ational Congress at the District, State, National and International Levels.

**Political Aspiration:**

Politics without a purpose is like a ship tossed by the waves, buffeted by the winds and reaching no shore, as such I have set my political pursuit to make myself a Statesman Madeth with a delicacy that atneliorates potentiality into performance, generating pinnacles of passion for the challenging, interesting, invigorating, interacting and iconoclastic Statesmanship in a vibrant and value embedded democratic nation like India.


My Primary and fundamental objective is to be a part of the leadership team in building competent political party by facilitating party development, designing and implementing the best practices, creating an energizing worker culture and engaging the party activist resource pool productively and effectively through my political skill sets assertively.


**Political Philosophy:**

The oak was once a tiny seed ... the flute was once a lowly reed....the statue was once a rugged rock.... Its change that changed them all. Change is the law of nature and nothing is constant except a constant change. Let its all unite our forces for that change that can challenge and champion the cause for the needy. Lets us all adapt, adopt and acclimatize to the change that takes its to better levels of societal understanding, faster ways of citizen interventions, reliable modes of leadership and trustworthy ways of public governance.

I personally feel that no stars decide our doom or glory. We decide if for ourselves. No destiny decides our dissolution or resurrection; we decide it for ourselves. No Gods kill us for their sport. We spin the plot of our tragic descent or triumphant ascent. We shape our destiny by our will. We are the greatest miracle and marvel in the universe. We do have come from heaven with power and the glory of the creator who scattered the stars into space, turned the grey Earth into rose sand, put songs into the souls of Nightingales. When we decide to win, we are just putting that power into action and letting our glory shine. When we are face to face with our awesome grandeur we realize that we can hitch our wagon to the star and can reach out to touch perfection. Our creative and intellectual potentials are unlimited and inexhaustible. Our burning pulsating desire for a definite goal, when anticipated can become the most powerful magnet that draws down success, when we believe that we can, we can even turn ashes into Gold.

7x7if7,42,2018-02-13,I don't really think Mitchum was right about Rory: My new perspective on her,othgg,GilmoreGirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/7x7if7/i_dont_really_think_mitchum_was_right_about_rory/,"Genuinely interested in a conversation here. I was very anti-Rory after seeing the revival, but I've had a bit of a change of heart. 

So, here's the thing. I get that people were disappointed by Rory in the revival and I was, too. But if we're treating season 6 and season 7 as canon... Rory was considered an asset by many people in the newspaper biz outside of Mitchum. The people at the Stamford Eagle Gazzette had lots of positive experiences with her. She's offered more than one job post-graduation and ends up on Obama's campaign trail. In the 9ish years between GG and the revival, it can be assumed she had a somewhat successful career given that her slump is throwing everyone for a loop. I don't think Rory was a natural born journalist, but I don't think she was a bad one, either. 

Mostly I just don't believe Mitchum knew enough about Rory at the time to make the statement that she ""didn't have it."" He's basing his opinion off of her few week performance as an intern, where she is wildly successful... as an intern. He seems to be upset at her for ""staying in her lane,"" so to speak, and not rushing to offer her opinions, but I doubt he'd ever read a single thing she'd written and I don't think it's a fair assessment based on her job position. Sure, Rory could have been more outspoken as an intern, but again, I think it goes back to her not being a natural born journalist, rather than an intrinsically bad one. Again, we see her have lots of success as a journalist specifically in s6 and s7. 

I also feel a little less irritated with Rory professionally when I think of the fact that AYITL was literally a year long. She's in this huge professional slump but on top of that, she's realizing that she's not really in love with, passionate about, or cut out for journalism anymore, which is all she's supposedly wanted since she was four.  She has these opportunities that either fall through or she just can't make work because she's no longer in the game... She's depressed, hopeless, and drifting, and while I still believe the story line would have better suited a Rory in her twenties, I also don't think it's out of the question that a woman in her thirties would have an identity crisis. She finds a new path with help from her family and friends and ends up writing a novel, and feeling content with it. And all of this happens within a year. I think the reason is feels like Rory is such an absolute failure (disregarding ASP's inability to let go of how she envisioned ending the series) is because we don't really see the upswing. We spend the whole time watching her make these awful decisions and then right when she starts to pull herself out of it, boom pregnancy credits. 

As a contrast, when she has her fall from grace in S6, we see her really hit rock bottom, then rise up and fix her mistake. It's more satisfying and palatable because we see just how much Rory has to work through emotionally to come out on top. In AYITL, which we've waited for for NINE YEARS, you only see her (out of character) mess of a life with none of the can-do spirit Rory tends to face challenges with. I also think everyone is allowed to have a bad time... sure, Rory was pretty obnoxious.. but again, the whole series takes place over the course of one year. It's not like it's a true four season arc; it just feels like one. And if we had been able to see Rory handling her pregnancy, I think it would have restored a lot of people's faith in her. I imagine that being the exact wake up call she needed to refocus herself. 

Anyway... I ended up not hating Rory the more time I've had to think about the story. I still believe ASP fucked it up and did Rory (and Alexis) a disservice, but when I try to view the story through the lense of canonical, OS Rory, rather than ASP's shit storm revival version of all the characters, I can understand and make peace with her story.

7x86p3,4,2018-02-13,Can a tumultous marriage be successful?,throwitawayhere25,Marriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/7x86p3/can_a_tumultous_marriage_be_successful/,"I strongly believe in the vows I exchanged with my husband, and I believe in lifetime partnership; however, I am so worn from a series of unfortunate events that could not be avoided. 

The first four years of our marriage was riddled with trauma, health issues, stressful moves to other countries and within our own, financial issues, and my resentment regarding my husband’s career a priority over my education/career. We visited several highly-qualified counselors who all expressed surprise at the resiliency of our marriage despite our uncommon circumstances. 

We were almost a upon our sixth anniversary when I accidentally saw a facebook conservation between him and his ex-girlfriend who was manipulative and destructive during their relationship +9 years ago. They were flirting and she mentioned phone sex when he deleted the messages and came downstairs to ask if I was ready for bed. Later, I checked our phone records and discovered he was calling/texting her somewhat frequently for at least a month.

The prior two years were difficult because he became too close to a mutual friend and lied about emailing/exchanging gifts with her. In addition, I experienced a serious health episode from an existing condition and he chose to return to work instead of helping me for the first week afterward to adjust. This occurred after we moved to another unfamiliar location for his career. 

Despite my issue with those past two events, I wanted to strengthen and maintain our marriage. He was unhappy and had complaints about my behavior and health problems. In response, I worked harder to find an optimal treatment plan, returned to college, and began interviewing for internships for my career field. 

I was surprised at his behavior to engage with his volatile ex-girlfriend, though I understood she was manipulative, I thought he could be honest with me about the situation. Instead he lied again, similar to the last two times, and I confronted him. Gradually, he told me the whole story but claimed nothing sexual occurred. After our discussion, I felt like I no longer wanted to be near/with him.

We lived in separate areas of our home and began therapy again. I told him I wanted him to see a counselor about his boundary issues and his unresolved feelings for his ex-girlfriend. He went to individual therapy while I prepared to move out. During this time I saw a few men and connected with one in particular. We became friends and he encouraged me by sharing similar problems he faced in the past. 

About six months later, my husband wanted us to reconnect again. I agreed and we began couple’s counseling. He improved his communication and became more helpful to me. Though he still disputes the serious of some of his actions, he accepted responsibility for his actions and felt terrible for the turmoil he caused.

It’s been two years since the incident, but my feelings are unchanged. Ever since that night, I feel like a part of me shut down towards him. I am honest, faithful, and work to maintain our relationship, but my heart isn’t in it. I thought maybe my feelings would change after date nights, therapy, and his new attitude. 

If I leave, I feel I would waste a 13 year friendship/relationship. We conquered a lot of struggles that a lot of couples could not, and my love for him did not falter until the last incident. But I feel I am unhappy, and I remember my friend’s encouragement that I could be alone if I wanted to be, or return to my husband, as long as I felt satisfied about my decision. There were times when I felt so low but we pulled together. Now I feel the disconnection growing each year between us. Maybe if I try harder I could change? 

Has anyone been in a stressful marriage that managed to resolve resentments/struggles and find their connection again?"

I am a IT Intern at a High School that provides Chromebooks (Acer C740 and C730) and Macbooks (11' Air, 13' Air, 13' Pro, 15' Pro) to each of it's students. Recently, Macbooks in particular seem to be disappearing. Are there any GPS tracking products (like Tiles) that would be small enough to fit into any of these computers? 

Also, our school participates in a program where the school will buy college textbooks for any student who takes college classes through a government-funded program. At the end of their semester, students return their books to the school, as we paid for them. We are looking for a resource (preferably open-source) were students could go to a web page and request a book from our inventory instead of going directly to the book store with a voucher and buying a new one. Do you know of anything like this? 

Thank you so much!

I am a junior year computer science major but the internship I currently hold is one of IT support. Since the first few weeks i have morphed into part IT and part web development for the company. I have been there for 5 weeks so far, working 40 hours my first 2 weeks and 15 the following 3.

During my initial interview, they made it clear that if performance was satisfactory, I would easily be able to extend the internship into the summer. My wage currently is locked at $13 an hour through my university program (Career Experience Program). I'm looking to talk to my boss about extending my internship into the summer, Morphing from IT into more heavily focused on programming since that's where my focus is (They are transferring into using SQL now and I think I would be involved on the back-end there). I'm wondering if I should look to be paid more since it is no longer done through the school. Also once the semester ends I will no longer have campus housing and will have an added expense of an apartment away from home. I'm not entirely sure how someone with my skills and position is usually compensated for a summer internship, and if so, how an intern wihout any real ground would approach a discussion about a pseudo-""raise"". any help is appreciated, thanks.

Projects are at the interface of systems biology and bio-medical research. In particular we aim on gaining new insights into the complex processes that regulate neuro-degenerative as well as -regenerative processes. In this project for a research intern or Master student we will use human Parkinson’s disease patient specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate complex three-dimensional models of the disease. In these models, phenotypes shall be identified and computationally predicted drug candidates tested. The project combines elements of stem cell research, neurobiology, preclinical drug development and high-content imaging. Successful applicants should have a strong interest in cell biology and neurobiology, especially experience in stem cell biology and/or high-content imaging would be a plus. We are looking for highly motivated candidates who share our passion for research, are interested in acquiring new skills and wish to be part of an international team.

However, my academic situation is about to change. In the fall I will be transferring to a public university to pursue a degree in computer engineering and I don't think it will be a good idea for me to continue working almost full time. I am in a unique situation which makes obtaining scholarships and financial aid during my first year very unlikely (or at least much more difficult) so I am almost positive that I will have to take out loans. 

The tuition at my university is just under $5,000 per semester. Because I am a transfer student, I do not yet know exactly how my credits will apply and how many semesters I will need to graduate, but I expect it to take anywhere from 4 - 6 semesters. Taking the possibility of summer courses into account, I'm assuming the max amount I would need to borrow would be $35,000. The average starting salary for computer engineers in my area is $65-75k. 

Is this a reasonable amount? I get a lot of anxiety about loans and finances, which makes me feel like this is just way too much. But I also wonder if that is just me being irrational. I do plan to pursue relevant, paid internships, but otherwise would  prefer to work as little as possible while in school so that I can really focus on my classes for the first time - but this makes me feel guilty because the only way I can do that is with loans.

Antwoorden op de schriftelijke vragen van het lid Özdil &amp;#40;GroenLinks&amp;#41; aan de  
minister van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap over het rapport inzake  
Voorinvesteringen en medezeggenschap in het hoger onderwijs &amp;#40;ingezonden 29  
januari 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Kent u het rapport van de Algemene Rekenkamer over voorinvesteringen en  
medezeggenschap in het hoger onderwijs?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, dat ken ik.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
Wat vindt u van de bevinding van de Algemene Rekenkamer dat slechts 280  
miljoen euro van de afgesproken 600 miljoen euro aantoonbaar besteed is aan  
de gestelde doelen bij de voorinvesteringen? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het onderzoek van de Algemene Rekenkamer concludeert dat het onduidelijk is  
hoeveel van de investeringen onder de definitie van voorinvesteringen  
vallen. Zoals ik ook in mijn schriftelijke reactie[1] op het Algemene  
Rekenkamer rapport heb aangegeven, kunnen we van het rapport leren voor  
toekomstig beleid. Bij de kwaliteitsafspraken moeten duidelijke afspraken  
met instellingen en met studenten worden gemaakt over de  
studievoorschotmiddelen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Overigens geeft de Algemene Rekenkamer in haar rapport aan dat de door  
hogescholen en universiteiten opgegeven 860 mln. in potentie ten goede komt  
aan de kwaliteit van het onderwijs. Van deze investeringen hebben alle  
studenten kunnen profiteren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘Nieuwe investeringen of nieuwe labels?’ uit  
2015, waaruit blijkt dat er toen al signalen waren dat de voorinvesteringen  
niet altijd nieuwe investeringen waren? Wat heeft uw voorganger destijds  
met dit nieuws gedaan? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Mijn ambtsvoorganger was bekend met dit bericht. In juni en oktober 2015  
zijn Kamervragen beantwoord over de berichtgeving rondom  
voorinvesteringen[2]. Het betrof toen onder andere de vraag of het bedrag  
van voorinvesteringen wel gehaald zou worden en hoe de rijksoverheid hierop  
zou toezien. Toentertijd gaf mijn ambtsvoorganger aan niet het signaal te  
hebben dat instellingen zich aan de voorinvesteringen onttrokken. Wel gaf  
ze aan dat de voorinvesteringen een afspraak was op sectorniveau en niet  
per instelling. Er konden dus verschillen tussen instellingen zijn; zowel  
qua hoogte van de investeringen als de inhoudelijke prioriteiten. De gemene  
deler was wel dat de investeringen gericht waren op versterking van de  
kwaliteitsverbetering van het hoger onderwijs.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Mijn ambtsvoorganger gaf ook aan dat de verwachting was dat op  
instellingsniveau de voorinvesteringen inzichtelijk zouden worden gemaakt  
en intern besproken. De medezeggenschap had hiervoor - vanaf het jaar 2015  
- het instrument van instemmingsrecht op de hoofdlijnen van de begroting in  
handen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Tot slot heeft mijn ambtsvoorganger destijds toegezegd regelmatig met de  
Vereniging Hogescholen &amp;#40;VH&amp;#41; en de VSNU te spreken over voorinvesteringen en  
uw Kamer eind 2015, op basis van de informatie van de VSNU en VH, te  
informeren over de gepleegde voorinvesteringen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Deelt u de mening dat de onderwijsinstellingen zich aan de afspraken moeten  
houden en nog minimaal 320 miljoen euro aantoonbaar moeten investeren in  
onderwijskwaliteit vanuit hun eigen reserves?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie ook mijn antwoord bij vraag twee. De Algemene Rekenkamer geeft in haar  
rapport aan dat 860 mln. in potentie aan onderwijskwaliteit is besteed.  
Daar hebben alle studenten van kunnen profiteren. Er blijkt nu  
onduidelijkheid te zijn ontstaan bij de verantwoording of dit  
voorinvesteringen waren. Deze onduidelijkheid wil ik voorkomen bij de  
kwaliteitsafspraken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Nu blijkt dat de groep studenten waar de voorinvesteringen voor bedoeld  
waren, namelijk de studenten die geen basisbeurs meer kregen en ook nog  
niet profiteerden van de opbrengsten van het studievoorschot, niet  
gecompenseerd zijn, overweegt u om deze groep alsnog te compenseren?  
Overweegt u dit te doen door bijvoorbeeld studenten die tussen 2015 en 2017  
begonnen zijn alsnog met terugwerkende kracht eenmalig 1000 euro korting op  
hun collegegeld te geven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voorinvesteren in de onderwijskwaliteit was één van de maatregelen voor de  
studenten tussen 2015 en 2017. Overigens geeft de Algemene Rekenkamer in  
haar rapport aan dat de - door instellingen opgegeven - 860 mln. in  
potentie ten goede komt aan de kwaliteit van het onderwijs. Van deze  
investeringen hebben de studenten kunnen profiteren. Een andere maatregel,  
die het voorgaande Kabinet heeft genomen, is een voucher. De eerste vier  
cohorten studenten die onder het nieuwe studievoorschot stelsel vallen,  
maken aanspraak op een voucher ter waarde van circa € 2.000. Met deze  
voucher kunnen zij, tussen de vijf en tien jaar na hun afstuderen, de  
mogelijkheid krijgen om scholing te volgen. Er wordt dus al meer gedaan dan  
alleen de voorinvesteringen voor de studenten tussen 2015 en 2017.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6   
Hoe komt het dat bijna 30 procent van de medezeggenschap niet betrokken is  
bij instemming van de begroting op hoofdlijnen? Wat gaat u doen om in de  
toekomst de medezeggenschap beter te faciliteren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit de overleggen die ik met de koepels en studentenbonden voer over dit  
onderwerp, is gebleken dat ten aanzien van de &amp;#40;hoofdlijnen van de&amp;#41;  
begroting van 2017 alle medezeggenschapsorganen op zowel universiteiten als  
hogescholen hun instemming hebben verleend. Ik herken de 30 procent die in  
de vraag wordt genoemd niet. Wellicht dat wordt gedoeld op figuur 4 uit het  
rapport van de Algemene Rekenkamer waaruit naar voren komt dat bijna twee  
derde van de medezeggenschapsraden al in een vroeg stadium bij de  
hoofdlijnen van de begroting 2017 is betrokken. Zoals eerder aangegeven in  
de schriftelijke reactie op het Algemene Rekenkamer rapport, deel ik met de  
Algemene Rekenkamer het uitgangspunt dat het belang zit in het betrekken  
van de medezeggenschap. Betrokkenheid van de medezeggenschap in het gesprek  
over de hoofdlijnen van de begroting in een vroeg stadium is noodzakelijk  
en wenselijk.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Volledigheidshalve merk ik op dat het niet noodzakelijk is dat de  
medezeggenschap in een vroeg stadium de hoofdlijnen van de begroting ter  
instemming wordt voorgelegd. De instemming kan immers ook plaatsvinden met  
de instemming op de gehele begroting. Door het gesprek te voeren of  
informatie te vergaren is het ook mogelijk om in een vroeg stadium mee te  
praten en invloed uit te oefenen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Over de rol die de medezeggenschap speelt bij de totstandkoming en de  
uitvoering van de komende kwaliteitsafspraken zullen afspraken worden  
gemaakt met de partijen die zijn betrokken bij de kwaliteitsafspraken.  
Verder verwijs ik u naar mijn antwoord op vraag tien.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
Kunt u een overzicht geven van de beschikbare faciliteiten &amp;#40;tijd,  
financiële vergoeding, opleidingsbudget e.d.&amp;#41; van medezeggenschappers op de  
verschillende hoger onderwijsinstellingen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Facilitering van de medezeggenschap is een zaak van de instellingen. De  
medezeggenschap kan op grond van de wet beschikken over de voorzieningen  
die voor de vervulling van zijn taak redelijkerwijs nodig zijn. Hieronder  
wordt in ieder geval verstaan ambtelijke, financiële en juridische  
ondersteuning en scholing. Daarnaast stelt de medezeggenschap samen met het  
bestuur een scholingsbudget vast. Ik beschik niet over een overzicht op  
instellingsniveau van de beschikbare faciliteiten voor de medezeggenschap.  
In de medezeggenschapsmonitor 2016 is op geaggregeerd niveau informatie  
over deze faciliteiten opgenomen.  
In de volgende monitor die dit jaar uitkomt, zal het onderwerp faciliteiten  
ook aan de orde komen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8   
Deelt u de conclusie van het rapport dat gebrek aan een eenduidige  
definitie van voorinvestering mede heeft geleid tot de situatie waarbij  
mogelijkerwijs honderden miljoenen niet aan de afgesproken doelen is  
besteed?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoorden op vraag twee en vraag vier.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
Deelt u de mening dat bij de studievoorschotmiddelen niet dezelfde fouten  
gemaakt moet worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik ben in gesprek met de VSNU, de VH, het ISO en de LSVb over de vormgeving  
van de kwaliteitsafspraken. Daarbij zullen we ook afspraken maken over de  
betrokkenheid van interne stakeholders &amp;#40;waaronder de medezeggenschap&amp;#41; en de  
externe stakeholders bij het opstellen en uitvoeren van de  
kwaliteitsafspraken. De aanbevelingen van het rapport van de Algemene  
Rekenkamer zijn onderwerp in de gesprekken over de kwaliteitsafspraken. Ik  
zal daarom na afronden van de gesprekken over de kwaliteitsafspraken, naar  
verwachting in april, aan uw verzoek voldoen van de Regeling van  
Werkzaamheden van 30 januari jl. &amp;#40;kenmerk 2018Z01439&amp;#41; en u een brief sturen  
over het Algemene Rekenkamer rapport.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
Hoe gaat u bewerkstelligen dat de medezeggenschap, zowel op centraal als op  
decentraal niveau, bij de besteding van de studievoorschotmiddelen wel  
serieus betrokken wordt? Op welke manier bent u van plan om te zorgen dat  
studenten zelf de gelegenheid krijgen om met plannen voor de middelen te  
komen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals door de VSNU, de VH, het ISO en de LSVb is onderschreven in de  
Gemeenschappelijke Agenda van 2016 is het goed betrekken van de  
medezeggenschap een randvoorwaarde voor de besteding van de  
studievoorschotmiddelen. Deze partijen hebben dan ook afgesproken dat de  
medezeggenschap instemmingsrecht krijgt op de besteding van deze middelen.  
De daadwerkelijke uitvoering van het instemmingsrecht vindt plaats op  
instellingsniveau, tenzij binnen de betreffende instelling de  
besluitvorming op een lager niveau is belegd. In dat geval vindt de  
medezeggenschap daar plaats.  
In de medezeggenschapsmonitor zullen we dit thema ook volgen.  
Zoals aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag negen, maak ik ook afspraken over  
de betrokkenheid van interne en externe stakeholders bij de  
kwaliteitsafspraken.

It took me a long time to finish my bachelor studies and I worked to support myself throughout it. Last year I took a holiday semester to do an internship in another country and afterwards I worked full time for a few months. Life without university felt amazing and I enjoyed the hell out of it. Not having the deadlines constantly in the back of my mind and just feeling like myself again, positive and happy person...

 Now I am back in my university town and I feel so so tired of it. I don't want to be a student anymore, I feel like there is a dark cloud over me that prevents me from seeing my future, my life clearly. Everything is on hold until I am done with my master studies and I still have 6-7 exams to write + master thesis. It is sucking the life out of me and although I have a lot of happy moments and great people in my life, obtaining this degree is always in the back of my mind preventing me from living a wholesome life. There is no other way but forward, because I need the degree to get the opportunities I want. 
Yet it is just so draining...I would be so disappointed in myself if I fail and I can't imagine that quitting now will give me relief anyway. I have also lost interest in my subject because of this situation and I just don't care about learning anything. All the lectures and the act of studying itself seem like a stupid charade to me now. I just want the degree... 

How do people cope in similar situations? 
I just need it to be over so badly.  

Tl;dr: I absolutely detest being a student, but can't quit now. How to cope?"

Anticipation builds for the release of the Marvel blockbuster 'Black Panther' as two songs from the movie's Kendrick-curated soundtrack charts in the top ten. The Weeknd's 'Pray For Me' tops this week's chart on its debut, making the song this week's highest debut. Kendrick's own song with SZA 'All The Stars' returns to the top 10 with 'All The Stars' on its fifth week.
 
CHVRCHES continues to dominate as their new single 'Get Out' reaches a new peak at #2. The Zedd x Maren Morris x Grey collaboration is definitely a hit as it stays in the top 5 at #3. So is Drake's 'God's Plan' at #4. 'Savior,' the comeback single of ~~Dr. Luke~~ Iggy Azalea debuts at #5. Dua struggles a bit as it loses two spots to #6. 'My My My!' by Troye charts at #7.
 
Despite the controversial Grammy win, it seems like Popheads is still bopping to the remix of Bruno Mars' 'Finesse' with Cardi B, charting at #9. Speaking of controversial, Justin Timberlake's 'Say Something' with country star Chris Stapleton surprisingly stays in the top 10, charting at the bottom at #10.
 
Paramore re-enters the Hot 50 with 'Rose-Colored Boy' as it reaches a new peak at #19, making it the highest re-entry of the week. BROCKHAMPTON gets this week's biggest gain as 'BOOGIE' increases 29 spots to #17. Unfortunately, James Blake earns this week's biggest decline as his new song 'If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead' loses 28 spots to #38.
 
* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #1. The Weeknd &amp; Kendrick Lamar - Pray For Me
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #19. Paramore - Rose-Colored Boy
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #17. BROCKHAMPTON - BOOGIE (+29)
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #38. James Blake - If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead (-28)
 
##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs
 
Let's bring this back, shall we?
 
Red Velvet's new single 'Bad Boy' continues to gain on its second week at #14. If they manage to reach the top 10 within a few weeks, they will become the first K-pop act to ever reach the top 10!
 
Lesbian anthem 'Curious' by Hayley Kiyoko aka Lesbian Jesus continues to do well as it charts at #15 on its fourth week.
 
While it doesn't feel like it's really a Popheads hit, 'Anywhere' continues to chart at #33 on its 14th week. Quite impressive for a song that didn't stay in the top 10 that much huh?
 
With the release of Justin Timberlake's new album 'Man in the Woods', seven songs are charting this week. Besides 'Say Something' charting at #10, 'Midnight Summer Jam', 'Higher Higher', 'Sauce', 'Montana', 'Filthy' and 'Supplies' charts at #23, #31, #33, #39, #40, #41.

7xcpre,1,2018-02-13,Router to WiFi Extender to another WiFi Extender to Desktop,Ramalho94,HomeNetworking,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/7xcpre/router_to_wifi_extender_to_another_wifi_extender/,"Hi.
So i'm moving to a new apartment for 6 months because i have an internship.

What i want to do is to take my desktop (it does't pick up WiFi) and use internet with it.
The house has a Router and a WiFi extender next to my room.
I took an extender i already had and plugged it in my room so that i could use a cable in my desktop.

I was there today and took my laptop to test it out, but was unable to connect it using the cable. (WiFi was working no problem)

It finds the network but says that it has no internet.
In the Network Map it has a router(ok), the house wifi range extender(with a red cross), my wi fi extender (ok) and internet (red cross)
Am i doing something wrong?

Thank you"
7xd38h,5,2018-02-13,A unfinished prologue to a epic tale written by a god,Felixisac,milliondollarextreme,https://www.reddit.com/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/7xd38h/a_unfinished_prologue_to_a_epic_tale_written_by_a/,"Office man doing the things that need to be done, checked that computer, told me it was broke. I fixed it, the wiring i tore and replaced, by fingers was cut and my nails blooded. My boss looks deep into my eyes and calls me a fag. I say, “I’ll have your position someday, i’ll put up a whipping rack and put you there first of em all, as a warning”. He laughs, i choke. Now i am imagining myself punching the wall of the cubicle, i think of sticking the pens in my throat, gargling them feeling the grey tips against my inner juiciness and the stapler on my eye the eye liquid slipping out and rolling on my cheek a tear and then slapping my face over and over again unto until into the plastic kitchen utensils left over from where Mick the accountant ate some Donliguenis’s pasta over here about 2 weeks ago if i remember right, or maybe 3, or maybe it was Mickal the janitor, hard to remember. It’s fall i haven’t noticed but now i look out and see the sea of leaves the orange is nostalgic i place myself as a child having a good time enjoying the horror, i am horrified by the good memories. I haven’t smelled a smell in 5 years but now the slight whiff of the taste of the air a mix of wood and biological root. I want to take a walk. I don’t. I type. The typing transforms to me shooting up a caribbean cruise, Carl Panzram is beside me, he smiles and nods. His muscles glisten in the tropical suite lights. I want to hug him but i am busy decapitating a grandmother. Boss calls me and whispers with zest that i have failed in filing the files that needed to be filed until the final flight of the yesterdays hour to midnight. I fly and i die in my to fail to say goodbye but i try to stop this plot i have bought it abort it, fore not i would have strangled this lot. Boss calls me a big sissy faggy. I compose myself. I compose drumming rhythm at my desk, banging with matchsticks and coffee cups against the surface, i ask Benny to purchase. A new filter for the coffeemaker, i want it real black, the tang to be subliminally disgusting, no goodness. He says no, he’s no slave to me. I say, Benny, we are a team. It’s more a platoon thing than a plantation thing. Benny spits at my desktop and calls me a low class slavedriver without the purchasing power. Later tonight, at home staring into the mirror for about 30 min, the daily routine, i will imagine holding Benny down by his white yellowed shirt and plunging into his ass with my rod cock over and over again, i am the cheerful court jester, throwing coffee cups in the air and catching them meanwhile as he cries as i come, come forward out of the sweeping visualization a man walks into the office his hair slicked back solid geometric contour you could slice open a membrane on that serrated edge of constrained hair. he raises his right hand and makes two quick fingersnapping gestures and all electronics infernated leaving a phantom shape of smoke and blackened frame pattern his gloves are as white as the stacked paper with frenzied intercourse of interracial international interns drawings on the right side of the dark keyboard shadow left on my desk. all is still, he retains his gripping and grasping the man moves his hand up and down and snaps each snap possessing more audible bentness than the previous, i am delirious and now furious my sight is going up and down up and down the office a blur the focus his hocus pocus. a magician yes that is what i see the cape like a snake behind frame the spell being spelled out by the shifting maneuvering of the hand i smell manure and it’s possible to change my head’s direction left of me right of him in front of us both is the boss an excess of outgushing shit soaking his trousers and leather shoes coming outpouring onto the floor in a puddle, his eye canals mimicking his anus. river of styx’d. he makes some sounds his throat tumor honking like a clown the spit getting ripped between the nicked flesh the palpitations overpowering the skin boundness 3 bone outgrowths pulsing out of the central nerve wiring entangled in it reminds me of a screw that got one turn left before getting fell as a tree by the ikea lumberjack on the new retro style chair pure fermented straight out of the clean and smiced cardboard box that you put  on a stack of books that you have meant to have read for 2 years by this time this furniture ritual takes place, it’s important to have a home that looks like the way you think, so that the thoughts can get directed, revealed, and ignited by the environment reflecting the spirit inside and giving it unclouded ways to make mind into matter. The boss spat out blood, his body turned into a human insect pile of angular bones, he made a buzzing sound, from everywhere, there was no clear distinction of a face. dozens of meat locomotives running in the integument ripping up with narrow cartilage sick yellow spirals and sinew machine churning drone the soundwave dragged out and mutilated headache inducing a parallel to the strained and aberrant being of the body. after a minute or so the boss was a perfect ball with no unevenness, dents or spasmic formation outward, made of dark spotted redness and lineament of creaminess shards. he was on the floor in the shit pile. there was words said inside the ball but it was muffled and i couldn’t tell what the boss opinion of his new existence was. i walked to the ballman and kicked him upward and falling downward into the dumpster, he was squishy and soft like a half chewed gumball so i got a bit of the boss on my shoe. the conjurer of constitution peered open my skull with a gaze that you couldn’t assume. pointed at me in a wicked fiendish way and made two waves in the time a office worker was able to do one with vertical fingers spread as far above his head. all around me was still. murmur from the dumpster. his lips creaked a slither slithered hinther from the deep winter void inside the moist and voiced tongue twisting and misting the air from his mouth affecting and directing damp cold not yet fell in the fall my nostrils hoisted into function by this conjunction. the essence of the abandoned time. Winner, he said. Remember what happened in Ingolstadt? When she went down like a slug, pretty mollusk on the wet metropolitian, how you loved the smell of the rain impaired on the pavement. And her secretion mixed in with the water creating the impression of spur of the moment artistry before the lawman came. The dark green of the cell, the teeth of the stone bastille worm and the keeping you in chains lesser but compressed callous creatures gnawing at your outer itch by itch and inch, i see a vision in the illuminated flaring of flail links your bones rotting from the inside spasming fungus more dark than the vicinity tainting you from the inward tears run as this compelled rumination won’t be disillusioned the vision of you trying to rise up above from the hexagonic masonry and force forward for a step only for your infested and swelling leg to split in two with a incline makes you cry tears of pure angst filled despair. Figments of fear is the only shape beside you down there in the hole, they sit in the corners their heavy crowns bowed down hanging, great primordial icons. You can’t decide for yourself if they are just your personal hallucination or all of mankind’s, both seemed as likely in that hazy void where all past were made unknowing as the future. Three knocks after 3 distinct paces beyond the toothed orifice, a gate opens and a man stands before. The iron teeth and flimmering shadow obscuring his profile. Time for judgement, he delivers. You were delighted. 

The seer rotates his fingers round and round. The workplace is washing out and dilapidating  around, the chairs splintering and go piercing through the roof, the ground severing itself from the walls and descending down as a tremendous elevator. 

TRIAL IN THE IMMENSE HALLWAY 

I say this man here is a treasurer of treachery and his macabre crime, or in my opinion, highly confident statement spoken with bestiality against all of woman is a rupture in the base moral code that this great city rests it’s cogs on. 50 years i have served and this is savagery i’ve seen solely once more in the since long done days, deep in the jungle we was. Immersed buried in the leaves my troop was cleaving away abyssal fever green spikes of country. Soon days have passed and we chopped and chopped, the neverending descent, Deeper and deeper we went. They were laughing, a few silent as the trees, the rustling of their steps and swing of their swords only noise produced. In the dark i saw a wonderful vision of a stone bricked pyramid. Soon as i seen the sun the leaves showed reddened, the arms of the trees had come alive and punished us for our defiance. But no, my men were roaming around their eyes fixed forward, swinging and stabbing their path, they seemed to be in complete non attention of each, round and round and round in circles and crosses and triangles cutting down each, chopping an arm or the taking of a head. The sight wasn’t what terrorized me, i had seen more blood flow in the trenches. The lack of grievance, the lack of pain. You hear, no one was saying a thing, not a gasp, just silent stabbing and blood flowing nonchalantly. It seemed so insignificant with the complaint redacted.

That’s all nice, but i see that you are a man prone to meaningless divergence, and this vergence is leading this civilized establishment into a resurgence of a tribalistic inclination. I work with a formation of truthful information. And you will hear no tales of woe and doom from me, only the gospel of justice singing out and rapturing you all into understanding of my clients sinlessness. Be enraptured, and i begin with this truth, according to my client’s beautiful wife he was at home when this sick, sick act was committed. Behold, here she stands!  (A woman with a ravishing presence moves next to the lawyer)  
I am the dealer with my deck of cards and my next move of hand is the honest truth for all you fine members of the jury to hear! Rapturize! (The woman bares her teeth)
“…………………………” Go on! “......................................” More! “...................................”
She is a bit shy, a simple fisher woman. With a simple husband. Salt of the earth people, the bricks of society’s manor. But i can speak truthfully when i say that she has articulated openly with me and truthfully with the lord in her heart when she spoke of that night and the whereabouts of her love, and that’s the truth. What’s true is this, my client was at home. A married man, a family man. Holding his fisher woman wife in the dark, not caring about the disgusting smell of fish guts all over her. Enveloping her soul, locked into an embrace against the cold and the chill of the strangers all around in the glacial streets. And this attack on this innocent hardworking, salt of the earth, man from you is a declaration of enmity and contempt against the foundation of your plateau you are so gleefully casting  your unwarranted suspicions from. I say, if you condemn this man without the lord’s justice on your side, this great association, will be sent down straight to hell. 

I say you are the one that is mocking the fine adjusted and decennial delegation of the law. It has taken a mighty long time for us to arrive at this communal system of values and enforcement. And you act like some second rate reverend with the fire in his procedure, but in procedure only. Showmanship! You are an actor playing the part of the lawyer! (the prosexecutioner slams the table) The truth is facts, no emotional reasoning, then we could be here forevermore, shooting down overwrought call to emotion with an even more sentimental response, endlessly. And the fact of this matter is that this man was found with a screwdriver in his hand. He was found roaming in the slums for god’s sake, rambling. A man from the guard, a man i deeply trust. Told me in confidence that this morose criminal was speaking in a fevered rhyme, about the devil and and his angels being hidden in a timeworn slumber in the arctic. Now, a lesser man than me would call this craziness, but i get it. Your client is a actor like you, he is playing the part of a lunatic looming his act enslaved by a devilish hand, his free will stolen from him, by either a red smoking trident or a mental deficiency, the Mephistopheles in the gray matter. But this inquisition is for the law of man and the common bound of society, not for matters of the heavens, or, if that is actually a matter at all. So mind or malevolence, it’s the same in these circumstances. And this here, is simply a man of evil incarnate. 

(the lawyer, like a great dragon, breathes out objection upon objection until his client, the man, steps forward and speaks)

“I apologize for my crime, if i did commit one, i can’t recognize any of this. It’s strange, when i look down at my asperous hands i see no fingerprints, can you polish skin?.” 

A storm of viscous words by duelling tongues continues over the man, neither side putting much value on the meaning, the meat of the sentence, by themselves or by him. In the end the agreement was reached that the man would be prosecuted, and executed, by the prosexecutioner. Some put on a face of joy, some put on a face of hate, in the end they all went home. 

MARK IN THE SHOPPING MART
And i was looking for a friend of mine. There in the maze of tin and aluminium i lost the sight of you, i caught grin from a sterilized semblance, i read the label stared at the pleased people and you were gone. The wares was to the roof, the roof was the sky, inefficient incandescent light bulbs instead of clouds. And i was seeking for a friend of mine, my walk down the path lit by the ablaze from above when i was under it was a spotlight upon me and my black dress shoes penetrated through the orb and i glowed if you would see from a distance in the heavens over the accumulation i would seem a classical hero with the power in his subsistence. My knife-edged steps echoed my suit was neat and clean and my fingers were making gun gestures in my pockets. Hours of calm walk until a blockade is upon me. A big round middle aged woman, her stomach fatness reaching the ground like a snail. I step on it and she makes wheezing sounds her gaudy gold necklace spins around her walrus neck. I ask
“I am looking for a friend of mine, have you seen him”? She rasps in response her portly bovine cheeks inflamed a bright pink. I ask
“Have you, my heavy fellow. Perhaps have had a companion run out on you? Are you here too, wandering, or in your case, waddling the halls in search for a friend of yours? I say this here building didn’t look as big as this on the outside, i wonder how it would be to be inside you too, big girl. Would all properties here in this zone of unconfirmable size be magnified on the inside? Impossible space made possible? Could i crawl into your mouth and live inside of you?” I am lost in my speech and forgot to loosen the grip on the fat woman’s throat, she releases a thunderous, roaring, last fart, an eulogy to the continuous visible downfall that was her body. The stink takes me back to the smothering clouds of death that reaped so many young men with fair bodies and clean muscles in the trenches. Still, i pay my respects and close her eyes gently with my left hand before continuing the walk, as i journey down the isles new paths open and others diverge but i keep my decided way of succession in my task of searching for a friend of mine, forward. Brands all around, their metal and plastic well sculpted shapes pointing at me from the enveloping shadows towers of convenience packaging. It took hours before the next hindrance emerged from the increasing darkness around, lights were dying, flickering away like a flame candlesticks. I went from a hero lit from above to a creep, dagger in hand crouching in the dark, if one was to observe me now i looked more a killer than rescuer. I noticed that music had begun serenading from the speakers hanging somewhere out there in the void, Italian disco. Clap, clap, clap, Do you believe in Saudade? Before me now was a surpassingly overweight old woman, a crone if put in old terms. Her wideness made her into a wall. There was leaking some enigmatic fluid from up her skirt, down onto the shopping floor, each big drop leisurely, i dared not crawl under. Her eyes signalled “BEWARE!” and her mouth moved in the process of scrutinization, a hammer upon my head as she spoke the the riddle
“A man truly weeps at two point in his life, and which ones are that?”
I say
“When he believes that love is real, and when the deceivement shows itself”
she says
“GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD”
She separates into can trimmed shapes of tissue like pasta going through a colander, i hear a echoey scream going “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” and her partitions becomes transparent and now there is nothing before me but the continuation of my trail. I walk. Weaved together girlish voices sing about dancing with hot oily men. The canisters become more vast, the flicker is the heartbeat of the building,all is obscured in a rag of shadow. My nose hits a concrete wall and it explodes. I cover the clipped bone with my hand and blood makes a glove. I see now that the canisters next to me holds giant fetuses, they are pickled. Bisected misshapen arms, bone thorn sticking out and harlequin heads with their mouths agape like a leviathan of the foggy depths of the sea. The warmth forms a running  grip around my arm seeping down to the elbow as if it was the edge of a lance. My reflection was seen in the lucid glass square in the middle of the giant vessels of conservate, superimposed on the face of the friend i was searching for, his head was in there with the rest of the misshapes. I begin to cry and i reach out and put my red gloved hand on the glass. Your visage, still so beautiful in there, i say to his lookless eyes. My center sucks into itself like a steam train crashing a roaring drop to wound the ground. My rosy fiddling digits cover my face. From beyond this long aisle the beat still blasts. Reverberating across the expanded far reaching counters. Down on the square brick road i am naked and penetrated to a blank for the whole supermarket to see. Moisture hasn’t caressed my exhausted skin and wind damaged eye gorge with its silken and motherly touch for decennia. I shake hand with my tears and i sob and i let myself depart into wailing. Wait. A step. My muscles flex and my cries are relaxed. Mixed up into a cascade enemies got the drop on me. I see none i feel them all they have me in chains one hand against my neck pressing into the pointy frail bone feels like it will burst like a sewer pipe i pathetically try to fight by wiggling like an eel i get reeled by whoever holds the grips of the chain yell out crazed “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”

They chant out with much amusement 
“DOG DOG DOG MAN DOG MAN EAT EAT EAT DOG MAN CRAWL”
I am hit in the head with a club and i drift away in bad dreams and specifically designed enshrouding terror scenarios before i awake. The back of the supermarket, the marketing executive general with his 3 dastardly goons behind him. The office design displayed an appreciation for the aesthetics of german expressionism. The general’s medals shines golden, best place to shop, best market in town, best groceries in the nation. He leans forward stirring and striking, his pointed nose acting like a weapon of intimidation, he says
“My big guys caught you sneaking around like man with thievery or something even more unsavory in his plans, could you be a pyromaniac?” I say
“I am no thieving pyro, stop revering the sound of your own fife, i was looking for a friend of mine, and i found him, in a can” The general says
“That low life bug man was a friend of yours? He was here on your spot, accused, he spoke in a very annoying and whiny way so we pickled him and put his parts in the hominal isle”
I say
“He had a razed lung condition, his throat was like an exhaust pipe, it was not his fault that he spoke like a retard, curse of the birth, he was a very smart guy actually.”
The general draws his dispatch sword from his reptile skin scabbard.
“In the eyes before my goons and my security cameras, i hereby sentence you to death”
Golem he stands there his clownish but suave arms readying a one dike strike. Solemnly, for one moment he is still, this is the second. Where the moment upwards becomes still, and like a roller coaster, peaceful balance before the explosive bullet travel downwards into DEATH! In the reflection of the blade coming down unto my head i see my past, as a child watching with my ear against the dishwasher receiving the clang and tumult within, as the noise gets louder the spoons and forks and designer dishes rippling in that white square vault i blink and see an impending collision between living tissue and forged dead earth and the force in my side throws my body tied with the chair to the ground my ear hurting my ear gushing substance with some small pebbles of texture out. In the coarse unventilated air of this office grey room i rise up as the second coming, my course. I’m cursed! The general says with a whimper in the end of the syllable, as i stand here he proceeds to tell me a story about how the last 20 thieves his goons has captured and brought here to him for judgement and punishment have all done the same thing, averted his strike in the final glimpse of possible non commitment to murder by execution. except my friend of mine i was looking for, the enemy for him that he successfully put to death by the blade. He wonders what deficiency he has committed for the gods of grocery to intercede in this way. It’s a sin by the The Pet Shop Boys plays over this scene. I stand with my middle cowered down, look of a boxer, my fists are strained and i feel my muscles pulsing like a throbbing cock 5 centimeters away from whole hole beauty waiting to be used like a garbage chute. I say, you grocer of grotesque behaviour, i don’t recognize your office, infact, i deny it’s very existence. You lack the physically to enact your laws, the rod is forever spared because of incompetence. And therefore, the child will run amok, i will subjugate you. The general kicks the ground multiple times like a madman, the steadiness that was in his joints before now loose. He points and screams, spit flying like darts. 
“CONSERVE HIM NOW, PUT THAT ARROGANT FUCKER INTO A CUP, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE HIM DOWN INTO A BLENDER” A battle ensues and much blood fills the cheap carpet and makes it look like a giant sponge floor cleaning up a crime scene.

7xd74f,2,2018-02-13,Increasing Cipralex dosage,user1510,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7xd74f/increasing_cipralex_dosage/,"Almost 3 years ago I began having horrible panic attacks that made it impossible to live ""normally"". Ive always had anxiety, and was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. I started the pills and went to a therapist the first year. My panic attacks became very rare (only 2-4 a year) and my anxiety was greatly reduced. My life was better then ever up until the beginning of this year (2018). I began getting panic attacks again and am constantly a nervous wreck. I increased my dosage to 10mg, I was on 5mg for 3 years. Now I have physical symptoms such has bad nausea, lightheadedness and hot flashes. I have had a few good days, but Im still very anxious.I had to quit an internship because of all of this.. I thought upping the dosage would help but im really scared its making it worse. But again, that could be my anxiety... 
Ive been taking the 10mg for just over 3 weeks now. Should I wait it out, or does this seem like a red flag? My doctor isnt available to talk/have an appointment for a while.
I just want to know if anyone has had similar expierence? Thanks."

Half of that year was working as a web content person for my university, and the other half was a software engineering internship. The people who interviewed me knew this and still wanted me!

So...I'm freaking out. I'll be the only tech writer in the entire department and the job has a lot of independence. Mostly it seems they need someone to devise an organizational structure for their how-tos and other internal documentation. I'm worried I won't know where to start or I won't be able to effectively get the information I need from people.

Do you have any tips for someone brand new to the field? Anything would be appreciated!"

7xdx44,1,2018-02-13,Asking For A Promotion For Almost A Year - What Do I Do?,Good_Jersey529,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7xdx44/asking_for_a_promotion_for_almost_a_year_what_do/,"I’ll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. I’ve been asking for a promotion for almost a year and every time I ask I am told that “it will be coming soon”.  I currently work as a software developer for a public university and I was initially hired as a full time programmer when I was finishing my 4th year of school (for 5k less than others in my same position). The following is a timeline of my situation:


September/October 2016 - put on a ridiculously high stress project and accumulate 10 days of flex time within one month based on the amount of extra work that the project managers kept throwing in.

January 2017 - My manager puts me in for a promotion to the director of our team. I am told that I need to wait a few more months and to ask again. Coincidentally, my work on the September/October project proves to the university that the team I work on is capable of being the primary development team, giving us even more work.

March 2017 - Two year anniversary of my current position, still paid 5k less than all other developers in my current position. I’m asked to oversee another developer (same job role as me but he makes more), I agree to it but overall I’m upset because I am overseeing someone’s work, a person who has been there for at least 5 years longer than I have but they get placed on low priority projects due to inability to work well with others.

May 2017 - I meet with the director and he says June/July is the time to ask but he acknowledges that I deserve a raise and promotion.

August 2017 - I wait a few weeks due to stressful events in the office (annual self appraisals). Again, I meet with the director and he says that I cannot be promoted or given a raise and that it won’t likely happen until January 2018. He still acknowledges that I am a fantastic worker and that the development would take an absolute hit if I were to ever leave. I instead negotiate remote work in Alaska for 3 months ( I figured they owed me that).

October 2017 - I’m working from Alaska and given a 4/5 on my self appraisal, translating to “Above and Beyond”, I am told it’s impossible for anyone to get a 5/5 on the appraisal ( I attempted for it ). Again, I’m given praise about my work and how I am doing well in the office.

January 2018 - I’m back in town from Alaska and set up a meeting with the director of the department. He tells me the promotion isn’t going to happen yet and I have to wait again. He tells me that I’m very valued. I attempt to negotiate remote work in Alaska again but am told the President of the University does not want people to work out of the state any longer. I will be limited to working out of the state once every two months for approximately one to two weeks at a time.

February 2018 - Intern on my team ( a full time student who will become a full time programmer when he graduates in May ) is negotiating a starting salary that is 3k+ higher. I like this intern, they are hard working and I don’t harbor any ill will towards them. I’m encouraging them to negotiate a higher salary because I want them to be happy. At the same time, I feel like I’ve been slapped in the face.


I’m at a loss for words. I’ve tried so hard to negotiate a raise or promotion or even a title change for the past year and nothing has happened. I need this job and I don’t know what to do.

I apologize for dumping a ridiculous amount of text on you all."
7xdxbh,1,2018-02-13,Are you having fun?,blizztracker,blizztracker,https://www.reddit.com/r/blizztracker/comments/7xdxbh/are_you_having_fun/,"#Are you having fun?

&gt;I've been playing for almost 3 months already and I still have a lot of fun on this game. The PVP is amazing, the objectives are entertaining, the pace is good, the Heroes are extremely creative, the balance is mostly fine. Of course, there is Genji, which almost ruins the game, but other than that, it is just so fucking fun! 

&gt;Yet, I don't understand you. Every single time I lose, there is someone complaining or offending team-mates on chat. Whenever I visit this sub, almost all posts are complaints about bugs, about MM, about pings, about the fact it is not as popular as LoL. So what? Hots will never be the most popular MOBA, and it is not because of bugs or MM. It is just network effect, LoL was first and people won't change all they know. That's like complaining your favorite restaurant isn't as popular as McDonalds. Makes no sense. And bugs happen! I'm a dev myself and honestly, being a dev for this game must be kinda miserable.

&gt;So, I just wanted to ask: are you having fun? If not, why are you playing!?

I'm having fun!  

I play it nightly.  I play it on my weekends.  I play it on my lunch breaks.  I've been a developer on Heroes for over 4 years.  I feel like we've done a ton of awesome things to this game and I can't wait for everyone to see what's coming in the future.

As for being miserable.  I'm not.  We have many very passionate players who want the best from this game.  We want the best from it too.  We have a group of very dedicated developers who aim to make this the best game it can be.

Thanks for playing :)

&gt;Be honest with us, do you play the game for fun while pretending you are play testing an animation or debugging?

My playing outside of work is outside me play testing in house for various reasons.  That's not to say I don't catch things outside of work too.

&gt;Do you guys ever have like, play with the Developers events? I would enjoy playing games with the developers not sure why. Probably so I can post embarrassing videos of developers making human mistakes.
&gt; 
&gt;But I'd be happy to play with you peeps anyways :)

Every once and awhile (usually on a hero release) some of us play on the heroes twitch channel for some viewer games.  Check out @BlizzHeroes twitter for updates and info on when we do the next one.  

Or, you can play a guessing game, while playing Heroes look at a high level account and guess if that's one of us or not.  Not all of us have a high level account so it can be very discrete but some of us are pretty high up there. :)

&gt;This might be a dumb question but would a developer ever be allowed to go pro on the eSports side of things? Just a random thought I had from your response.

Nope.  Conflict of interest :)  I still like to climb HL though.

A lot of practice.  Lots of hard work and a little bit of luck.  My first gig was in military simulations.  Your first job into the industry doesn't have to be flashy.  

At Blizzard we hire people who have just a degree under their belt.  We have a pretty awesome internship program as well https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/students.  Check out our careers page for openings https://careers.blizzard.com.

Keep practicing, keep trying and keep applying.  Samwise always says to remember your ABCs.  Always be creating :)

&gt;I've been playing for almost 3 months already and I still have a lot of fun on this game. The PVP is amazing, the objectives are entertaining, the pace is good, the Heroes are extremely creative, the balance is mostly fine. Of course, there is Genji, which almost ruins the game, but other than that, it is just so fucking fun! 

&gt;Yet, I don't understand you. Every single time I lose, there is someone complaining or offending team-mates on chat. Whenever I visit this sub, almost all posts are complaints about bugs, about MM, about pings, about the fact it is not as popular as LoL. So what? Hots will never be the most popular MOBA, and it is not because of bugs or MM. It is just network effect, LoL was first and people won't change all they know. That's like complaining your favorite restaurant isn't as popular as McDonalds. Makes no sense. And bugs happen! I'm a dev myself and honestly, being a dev for this game must be kinda miserable.

&gt;So, I just wanted to ask: are you having fun? If not, why are you playing!?

7xeyis,6,2018-02-13,"[F4A] What’s a little quid pro quo, Detective?",etxbkst,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7xeyis/f4a_whats_a_little_quid_pro_quo_detective/,"“What the fuck is this?” The red envelope stamped “sensitive” landed on her desk and immediately complicated her strategically planned exit from a shit day at the office. 

“You fucking know what it is. And don’t think I haven’t noticed how you’ve pushed your last report off onto that bimbo in steno so you can leave early. You’re gonna get her canned, you know.” The boss gloated widely at having fucked with her plans. This cunt thought she could fuck off whenever she wanted to simply because she was a better detective than anyone who’d ever worked the Sexual Crimes Unit. He’d had it though, and no matter how many deviants she brought in, she still answered to him. 

Most of the time the department head would give her all the space she needed to bag her quarry. He knew she occasionally let the Sapphics off with a little *quid pro quo*, and how she had that red haired slut from the steno pool wrapped around her finger. He overlooked her perversions because she brought in the real sickos. The pedos, the beastlovers, the faggots. Those fucking degenerate pieces of shit who deserved *so much more* than the chemical castration the law prescribed. And let’s be honest, despite what the law says, who doesn’t find two women fucking a turn on? Even the old bastards in congress who wrote the thing loved a little girl on girl action, and it was an open secret that the only reason they allowed female interns was so they had a fresh rotation of tail to have fun with. It’s how they proved to each other they weren’t a bunch of queers, even though every now and again DC Crimes would catch one of them giving foot signals in the stalls of the men’s restroom at some shithole train station. It was a badge of honor to get to crack the skull of some homo congressman, one that elevated the lowly beat-cop to a detective or a lieutenant. But this wasn’t DC, and no one in Lighter, Texas was important enough for SCU to single out. 

When Alex Fanshaw decided to become a cop the last place she thought the great state of Texas was going to send her was a fucked up meth-head town. Cadets who graduate in the top 3% get their pick of assignments, and she hoped for Austin or Dallas or some other place *not known* for its abundance of Mt. Dew loving drug addicts. What she didn’t know was that graduating in the top 3% of your class when you’re a woman usually meant dishing out blowjobs and buttsex along the way. She foolishly thought good old hard work and study would get her to a top notch gig in some enlightened enclave of a generally backwards state. And so despite her grades and her expert ability to handle firearms and club plastic dummies in the head she was told that she wasn’t a *team player* and as such she didn’t get to pick her poison. 

During her four years at the academy Alex never showed interest in men or women or sex. All she focused on was getting that badge and the hell out of the sort of tiny, shitty towns she spent her itinerate youth in. People asked her if she was queer, and spurned men especially would accuse her when she’d laugh at their advances. But she was smart and focused and driven, and those slanders never stuck with her. It wasn’t until the day she was handed her first duty assignment that she actually thought about sex in a less than clinical manner. As she sat in the commandant’s office waiting to find out where her four years of hard work would land her, Alex was filled with guarded hope.  

“Lighter.” Closing her file with a smirk, the commandant waited for her response. Alex sat staring at him, unsure of what he said. *Lighter,* she thought to herself? What the fuck does that mean? She’d never heard of Lighter, Texas. With a nervous chuckle she looked him in the eyes. “Lighter?” 

“Yeah, *Officer,* Lighter. Lighter fucking Texas.” He spat the words at her, annoyed that she was still sitting in front of him. 

“Uhh... that wasn’t on my duty station wish list, sir.” It took a fair amount of restraint not to skip the *sir* and go with *asshole,* but she managed it. The commandant wrinkled his eyebrows and smiled at her.

“See, *Officer*, the key word there is *wish*. As in *wish* list. You get to wish, I get to tell you where the fuck you’re going, and you’re going to Lighter.” His chair creaked loudly as he reclined back and stared at the beautiful woman. What a fucking waste, he thought. Why God would give such good looks to a woman who was either queer or asexual was beyond him. A body like that was meant for fucking, and it still pissed him off that in the four years he had to see the bitch he never once got to touch her. He had her by the balls now, and if she wanted to go to Austin she’d have to do what every other woman who sat before him did. “You’re not a team player, Fanshaw. You could be. There’s still time.” With one hand on the folder holding her signed transfer papers, he moved the other down to the zipper on his dress uniform pants. What he wanted was unmistakable. She knew it the second the words “team player” left his rotten mouth. And she considered it. Genuinely. What’s one fuck? One quick fuck and she’d get the assignment she wanted. One fuck. Her body bent over his desk as his hands grabbed her by the waist, her navy blue uniform skirt hiked up, her blouse unbuttoned and her bra pulled up. That’s what she saw when she thought those words, “one fuck.” Her entire four years had been reduced down to two words: *One fuck.*

The stale smell of his office and the warmth of a soon to be summer day held her captive. She wanted to move, but she couldn’t. She wanted to let him do what he needed to do so she could go where she was meant to be, but she couldn’t. No one ever writes about the girl who fucked her way to the top, because her record always has an asterisk by it. Alex didn’t want an asterisk by her name. Somehow after four years dodging unwanted advances she still managed to have faith that if she did right, right would be done by her. Is it possible to hear a heart break? Alex wondered if it was, because she felt and heard hers crumble. Everything she had dreamed of was gone. All because she couldn’t make herself stand so this piece of shit could screw her on his oak desk. Somehow standing up for her principles wasn’t as satisfying as she thought it would be. Maybe it would feel ok later, but at that moment all she could do was mentally curse herself for not being able to give in. Alex sat frozen, trying to find the will to move when the commandant stood. He knew even before she did that it wasn’t going to happen.

“Enjoy Lighter, Texas, Fanshaw.” 

Lighter fucking Texas. She said those three words to herself at least a dozen times a day. It didn’t matter that she’d been in Lighter for almost two years, or that she’d advanced to the rank of Detective without fucking anyone. There was still a feeling of incredulousness, that maybe she was dreaming this whole thing. Sometimes Alex thought if she just willed herself enough she could go back to that office on that singular day and let the dirty old man fuck her in exchange for an assignment to somewhere not *Lighter fucking Texas.* And now her early start to a long weekend was ruined by a red envelope. The color was significant. It usually meant that a priority case was handed down from the sixth floor. One that took precedence over every other case. One usually the result of some grudge being held by an “important” asshole who decided to rat on a rival or a friend for a very personal reason. That’s what her life had become. Taking out the trash to settle petty scores. 

“So what the fuck *is this?*” The flap to the envelope was held closed by a string wrapped around a silver brad. Alex rolled her eyes as she untied the string and reached in. 

“I don’t know what the fuck it is, *Detective,* but they asked for you to handle it, so just get it done, yeah?” 

Alex’s boss walked away as she pulled the contents free. Instead of the standard single page report a stack of wallet sized snaps fell to the floor. As she reached down to pick them up she saw a familiar face. Hers. Alex paused and surveyed the photos. They were all of her. Each featured Alex and a different women engaged in illegal sex acts. The detective looked around as she gathered the photos, panicked that someone may have seen what they contained. Still holding the red envelope she shoved the incriminating photos back inside. Alex looked in to see what else the envelope held, and she saw a note. The paper was thick, white cotton, 6” x 9”, and folded in half. Words were scrawled in a dark black ink, and as Alex examined the note she saw tell tale splatters of a fountain pen. After looking the document over as if the paper itself and not the message would reveal its truth, she clutched the red envelope to her chest and read the carefully crafted words. 

*Twelve. Twelve photos and twelve women all sullied by you…*

Yeah, I know it’s stupidly long. Sorry ‘bout that. Sometimes I can’t get to where I need to be as quickly as I might like. I’d like to do something different here. Third person, past tense. Longer (multiple paragraphs), and instead of direct replies to the actions of my character, you should set a course for your own. Let’s write a story written from two perspectives. The predator (you, the sender of the photos) and the prey (Alex.) We’ll need to talk further about how we’ll accomplish this, and I’m open to other ideas, too. If my overly long bit hasn’t turned you off, send me a message. Also, I wrote about the 12th woman in the photos, and if you’re interested I can send that along. We don’t have to use it, though."

He speaks the foreign language as a first language, and is from a country where it’s the primary language. I realized that he was attractive then, but I kept my distance because I didn’t want to create an awkward situation between TA and student.


This semester, he isn’t a TA in my foreign language class. I see him during three different club meetings, plus a class where I help the teacher. I am not a TA, I have an internship in a related subject. He is a student in the class.


During a workshop for this class, he went out of his way to make me laugh by speaking in a valley girl accent, and he touched my arm while chatting with me. 


A couple days later, I could have sworn he was checking me out during one club meeting. He made a joke about distributing the student paper to the local brothel and looked at me like he was gauging my reaction. My immediate thought was it was hard to believe he has trouble with the ladies as he’s a charming motherfucker constantly surrounded by attractive women. I think most of them are fellow foreign language TAs.


He has a physical disability that affects his mobility but that doesn’t bother me. We haven’t talked one on one much, mostly in group settings.


I don’t know if he’s been flirting with me. I’m not used to guys being interested in me because of my weight. I’m not sure if the age gap (6 years) is too much.


I want to get to know him better as I’m interested in knowing more what it’s like to teach English as a second language internationally (he’s an English teacher back in his home country). Also I think he’s funny and would be great to hang out with. It helps that he’s cute too.


Should I try getting closer to him, even if it’s just as friends? I think he’s going back to his home country at the end of the semester.


Please help, I am not good dealing with cute guys.


  **tl;dr**: I have a crush on a guy six years older than me. Should I let my guard down and get closer to him, even though I am shit at knowing when someone is flirting with me?"

**Introduction**  
Apr 2015:  
Baltimore only US top 30 city in population with black majority, staged murder, staged riots, leading to proclamation of state of emergency with thousands of neo-Gestapo armed to the teeth in the streets: ALL, including what comes next, explained by Last Prophet in this article from 2005.  
From gangsta rappers such as 50 cent brainwashing young blacks to act like gangsters to Baltimore Mayor, mom beating masked son, first protester arrested on ""live TV"" after curfew started: ALL actors part of the black cast setting the stage for the genocide of non-whites.  
In other words: same as at least 192 UN recognized ""heads of state"", executing orders from Alexander Adolf Hitler, the Fuehrer's great nephew and successor as Illuminati Grand Master.

Poster replies:  
&gt; *Why would a Nazi be flooding Europe and America with Mexicans and Muslims?*  

**ANSWER:**  
January 2009 - **WHY ANY NON-WHITE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY LEAVE USA, European Union, CANADA, AUSTRALIA**  
We are just weeks from ""Obama""'s detonation [postponed since 2009 for different reasons several times], immediately followed by edicts ordering the internment of non-whites.  
First edicts will be for ""black and Muslim extremists"".  
Reminder of Last Prophet's words from 2005 [updates in brackets]:  

**The Race Card: How the illuminati played it in the III Reich compared to how they play it now in the IV Reich:**  
The preliminaries: Genocide of Jews in III Reich 1933-1936 v the Genocide of non-whites since 1992 in the IV Reich.  
Differences are first of all a consequence of the different techniques used to brainwash the populace in the III and IV Reich.

**The Reichstag &amp; Race Card scripts**
Goals:  
- eliminate organized armed resistance, silence the political opposition, consolidate the terror state, eliminate freedom of speech;     
- get crowds.  
Time to compare this process to the first edition.

**Reichstag**  
a) III Reich:  
One of the first acts of the nazis was the Reichstag fire 1933. 
That act was solely part of the agenda ""Eliminate opposition"". The day after the nazis passed laws to intern ""communists"", the label used for any freedom loving person opposing the nazis.

b) IV Reich:  
The Reichstag fire takes place over a period of six years:   
- first OKC 1995, the only goal was to eliminate organized armed resistance;  
- the second act, 9/11 2001.  
9/11 had two main goals:  
- the first goal is similar to the Reichstag fire;  
- the second goal is related to the race card.

**Race Card**  
a) III Reich:  
Ethnic card is also played from the beginning.  
1933-1936: [Illuminati Grand Master] Hitler's nazi government spent THREE years announcing the Holocaust.   
Not to mention that the nazis played the ethnic card from the very beginning, years BEFORE they took power. 

b) IV Reich:  
1995 - OJ Simpson's ""trial"" is only a general rehearsal. Goal: test that when the time comes there will be no problems launching the supervised race war.  
The ethnic card is played only at the very last moment [fully launched early 2013], 11 years after the Reichstag type of operations was completed, long after the political opposition was eliminated.

The second goal of 9/11 was indeed to prepare the ethnic card.  
But paradoxically not by ""internment of US and EU Muslims in camps"" but by the opposite agenda: ""Islam is the religion of peace"".  
To get how the IV Reich played the race card the other way round as the III Reich you need to get the ""911 race card"" end times paradox.

**9/11 Reichstag operation and the race card: an Illuminati End Times Paradox**  
The illuminati used a few pixels as CGI ""planes"" added by their mass media ""live"", fake ""passengers"" and mini-nukes using hydrogen to create 911 and blame it on ""Osama Bin Laden"" and the ""Islamists"".  
So why was paradoxically the second goal of the 911 agenda ""Islam is the religion of peace"" and not ""internment of US and EU Muslims in camps""? 

**""9/11 race card"" explained**  
Two main reasons:   
&amp;#49;. Muslims (not to mention 20% non-whites in 2001) were already 4% of the population in the EU/USA, more than the percentage of Jewish population in Nazi Germany.  
Yet in 2001 the critical mass required to successfully launch the supervised race war was not yet achieved.  
The agenda that was to be advanced was still the ""open borders"", increasing the number of Muslims and non-whites in the USA, EU, Canada, Australia and the rest of Illuminatziland with a majority of whites.

&amp;#50;. The reason why a much higher critical mass is required in the IV Reich than in the III Reich is simultaneously the second reason why after 911 the agenda was not ""internment of Muslims in camps"" but the opposite: ""Islam is the religion of peace"".  
That reason is the almost TOTAL lack of popular support for the illuminati, a consequence of illuminati tactics to brainwash the population that were diametrically different in the III and IV Reich.  
So in the IV Reich the illuminati paradoxically fully play the race card:  
- at a much later point, more precisely 2013, before the TOTAL collapse, what would correspond to the nazis in August 1943, after Stalinigrad and Kursk;  
- much more intensely than Hitler: this time is NOT only the Jews but ALL non-whites.

- OKC bombings: the general rehearsal for 9/11 - Last Prophet's words archived BEFORE 9/11  
http://web.archive.org/web/20040825015612/http://www.terravista.pt/guincho/2104/law/mcveigh_fbi.html

- OJ Simpson's ""trial"": the general rehearsal for the supervised race war  
Google: OJ Simpson illuminati  
https://www.google.com/search?sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;q=oj+simpson+%22illuminati%20theater%22  
One of the specific results is the relevant TRUTH (although ALL results of first page are the words of End Time Prophet):  
*Illuminati Agenda, illustrated with key acts of illuminati theater ...*  
*9 May 2007 ... The circumstantial difference was that in the case of OJ Simpson the illuminati did not stage it from the beginning, i.e. the murders were ...*  
http://illuminati-agenda.blogspot.com/2007/05/paris-hilton-im-too-beautiful-for-jail.html   
Added: contrast OJ Simpson's real murder with other roles, all played by actors, added later to the black cast for the ethnic civil war:  
""Obama"" in the leading role, and a multitude of secondary roles: Al Sharpton, Dr. Conrad Murray, Tiger Woods, etc.

- The control tactics by galvanizing the population were diametrically different in the III and IV Reich:   
&amp;#45; while the III Reich had the goal of world conquest based on mobilization (fanatic crowds, dozens of millions of soldiers as cannon fodder) ...  
&amp;#45; ... the IV Reich has the goal of world conquest based on global genocide of 90% of the population, using ""smart weapons"", from vaccination to a restricted number of brainwashed mercenaries.  
It's reflected in differences of human cattle about to be slaughtered, between those marching:  
&amp;#45; at the techno sound of the ""Love Parade"" in Berlin 2000;  
&amp;#45; on ""Heil Hitler"" in the Condor Legion Victory Parade 1939.  
As explained by Last Prophet again 2004, see also link to article from 2000, archived first Feb 2002:  
http://protest-suppression.blogspot.com/2004/05/suppressing-protest-with-marches-on.html

- What Last Prophet didn't know in 2005: Hitler was more than just an illuminati agent. In other words: he was the Grand Master of the Ordo Illuminatus.  
Exposed worldwide first by Last Prophet, 2013:  
More than *** 90% *** of the world population is ruled by &amp;#42;&amp;#42; Alexander ADOLPH HITLER &amp;#42;&amp;#42;, born 1940.  
Father's uncle of current Illuminati's LEADER is most widely known man in History, together with Buddha, Jesus &amp; Muhammad.  
His real name is exactly the same:  
http://illuminatus-grand-master.blogspot.com/2013/03/illuminati-leader-reveals-himself.html

- Nothing illustrates better TOTAL lack of popular support than the fact that the only crowds that the illuminati managed to get in white Illuminatziland were to cheer ""black Obama"".
Thanks to end time computers it is possible to multiply votes of McCain and ""Romney"" by a factor 11.
Thanks to murdering all the oppositors it is possible to stage ""elections"" in the EU areas where voting machines were not yet introduced and have the illuminati always win.

http://end-times-prophet.blogspot.com/2014/03/osama-bin-laden-resurrects-next-to.html  
Reminder of what happens the day after Obama Bin Laden resurfaces in video standing by the Malaysian Airlines missing Boeing 777:  
the theater act ""Obama arrested &amp;#42;&amp;#42;LIVE&amp;#42;&amp;#42; on TV with senate and congress members as background"".

- BIG BANG includes the annihilate ""trillions"" in fiat money, from US debt to savings and pension funds of human cattle.   
http://big-bang-now.blogspot.com/2013/12/janet-yellen-vs-ben-bernanke-one-basic.html  
""Social Security defaults"", part of the ""*US government shutdown*"" theater, timed with Obama's detonation, starts the BIG BANG.

7xfo6y,11,2018-02-13,In a relationship with someone who I care deeply about but he drinks too much?,notgoodatdating,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/7xfo6y/in_a_relationship_with_someone_who_i_care_deeply/,"I 20 F (Pakistani descent) am dating 21 M (Indian descent, non-practicing Hindu) in USA.

Basically it's in his family to drink a lot. The men drink alcohol at all their family events. They don't necessarily get rowdy drunk, but they typically drink enough not to drive back. 

I am from a Pakistani family who has a lot of mixed marriages (all with white/European people). I have a handful of non-Muslims in my family. None of them drink the way my boyfriend and his family does. 

I honestly do not care about what faith someone I'm dating comes from, as long as they are non-practicing. But for some reason, drinking has always been something that bothers me so much, and I'm saying this as someone who (as of now) drinks. I know it's completely hypocritical, but I do hold myself to a different standard. I don't mind *myself* drinking because 1) I am able to control myself and I don't do anything dumb while drunk 2) I am permanently completely stopping at the latest right before I decide to try to have kids, but more than likely I will be permanently stopping after I finish my undergraduate education. 

My boyfriend, in my opinion, drinks excessively. He doesn't do anything inappropriate while drunk, but he does get drunk too often. He gets drunk every weekend. He's in his final semester of undergrad, so he doesn't have a lot of school year so he's always out downtown going to bars or parties and drinking. I really don't like it. 

I met him at an internship. I literally liked him from the moment I met him. Without me even telling him that, he told me the same thing. We go to separate schools, 30 mins apart, so it wasn't necessarily an easy thing to get into a relationship. We were friends for 4 months, then dated for 2 months without being physical (didn't even kiss during that time period) and then in the last 3 weeks or so we kissed and officially became boyfriend/girlfriend. 

He is just as inexperienced physically as me which is kind of nice idk. He is so loving and respectful towards me. I had a really hard time being physical with him (not sex; just like 1st/2nd base) and I started panicking about it once and he was so understanding about it. He always checks in with me when we are getting physical saying (""are you good"" ""are you sure you're okay""); he never tries to escalate things past what we have been doing (what he knows I'm okay with). He always kisses me and holds me. Spending the night and sleeping next to him is one of the most comforting feelings in the world. When we're not together on weekdays he texts and snaps me all the time. He's never creepy or weird. I have a close group of girl friends but he's really become one of my best friends (maybe even my best friend).

One time I went out drinking with him and I was not drunk, but the alcohol just hit the wrong way (plus I had eaten left over chicken that probably got too old) and I puked hourly for 12 hours straight all night and morning and he came into the bathroom and held my hair back while I threw up with no shirt on and while I cried simultaneously as well lol. 

He never lets me pay for anything (still, even though I try). He makes me meet his friends and hang out with them. He is driven career-wise, has done incredibly well in school, and is planning on going to medical school just like me. I never run out of things to talk about with him. I don't really like to talk about being raised Muslim, but he always asks me questions about it to understand me better. 

He never ever gets angry. He doesn't see the world in black and white at all (which is a problem I admittedly can sometimes have). It takes a lot for him to get jealous, but he never approaches it in an angry way. He says ""I understand why so many guys hit on you because you're so beautiful, but I don't let it get to me because I know how you feel about me"". 

I came from a household where my father and mother were never affectionate at all (it was an arranged marriage btw). They never slept in the same room. I didn't even realize that men could really be affectionate on their own as weird as that sounds lol. I also have a really angry father. There's always yelling in my house (my parents hate each other), it's very easy to step on my dad's toes. I was always afraid I would end up in a relationship like my mother's. I really never thought someone would be so caring towards me the way my boyfriend is. I don't even feel like I deserve it. 

I have tried so many times in my head to just end it with him because the drinking bothers me too much, but I simply can't. I really really really like him. I have never said to him that I disliked his drinking. He probably doesn't even know I have such a fundamental issue with drinking since I do it myself (not nearly as often as him). I don't know what to do because I feel like this might lead to an ultimatum and  ultimatums usually don't end up well..."
7xg3ab,28,2018-02-14,Roommate using metal utensils/metal scouring pad on my nonstick cookware,bichpoomom,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7xg3ab/roommate_using_metal_utensilsmetal_scouring_pad/,"Alright guys... bear with me. I know this may be mild in comparison to the other horror stories on here, but HOLY SHIT I just need to vent.


I moved into this small 2bd/1ba apartment last July with a roommate (21/F) who, at the time, was in another city for a summer internship. She shared this apartment with her previous roommate, who I later found out was responsible for leaving it in shambles. Anyways, the kitchen cabinets were full of trash and crumbs, but I managed to find several utensils and one sorry looking pan. At this point, I wasn't too worried because I had many kitchen utensils and a new nonstick cookware set that I didn't mind sharing. I guess I should have explained to her how to take care of nonstick cookware because I walked into the kitchen a couple months later to find her using a metal fork to cook food in one of the large nonstick pans. I asked her, ""Hey, can you please not use metal utensils on the pots and pans? It scratches the nonstick coating - I have a bunch of different wooden/plastic spatulas you can use instead."" I thought we settled this, so fast forward to a couple months later when I came across one of my small pots in the sink. It was coated with dried up coffee grounds (?) or some sort of gunky material that she was having trouble cleaning since I found a metal scouring pad soaking inside the pot. SURELY she hasn't been scouring the cookware with that, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt until... tonight.

**[startrant]**

I walk into the kitchen after she was done cooking dinner to see that she's washed the dishes. Awesome. I remove one of the large pots that she recently used from the dish rack and notice that the bottom is scratched as all hell. She's sitting in the living room, so I ask her if she used the metal scouring pad on the pot. She stared at me and asked, *""Oh. You don't?""*

I swear I almost fucking lost it but I managed to gather myself enough to explain that, ""..............No. Because it's *metal*. You're not supposed to use any *metal* like *metal* utensils and these *metal* scouring pads on nonstick pans because it ruins the coating."" This bish interrupts me three times to say, ""Yeah I know I don't use metal utensils on them but the pad's fine. I can use the pad. You're not supposed to use it? I thought it's fine."" To which I respond, ""No it's not fine. Not the pad because it's metal."" I swear to fucking god that she couldn't understand why metal scouring pad = also bad. IT'S **METAL**. THEREFORE, **METAL** DOES NOT BELONG INSIDE NONSTICK POTS AND MOTHERFUCKIN PANS. I didn't know how else to break it down for her. I literally just kept repeating, ""No, because it's metal and it ruins the nonstick??"" a million fucking times until she said nonchalantly said, ""Okay."" No apology or acknowledgement or anything. What I'm trying to understand is why that concept was so difficult for her to grasp. It doesn't take rocket science to deduce that metal utensils = no no which makes it safe to assume that metal scouring pad = also a no no. I'm 50% fucking fuming and 50% legitimately confused.

 **[/endrant]**


I'm seriously contemplating if I should just tell her to use her own pots and pans because I'm not trying to ruin a set I got less than a year ago. Fuck that noise fam. I'm putting this out there because someone must feel my pain. HALP."
7xh0ru,2,2018-02-14,Looking for C/C++/Automotive programming buddy,whitebelch,ProgrammingBuddies,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingBuddies/comments/7xh0ru/looking_for_ccautomotive_programming_buddy/,"Hello guys,
I'm currently 3 months into Automotive programming course led by programmers from one of the automotive company where I live. I did some C (simple stuff like bit operations) and finished first OOP C++ exam which was mainly about basics. I took a break from my job and I'm 100% focused in pursuing IT career in automotive branch. Currently working on my C++ via Prata book and writing some simple, mostly academic programs. I was thinking about playing around with Arduino and going more into detail with embedded C. Course I'm doing resumes in march, I'd gladly share all the things I'm doing there. I'm looking for someone motivated to learn, perhaps with some experience in the field already or someone who is looking to change his path as a programmer. Perhaps we could work on some programs to build up a decent portfolio, so it would make it easier to land some sort of internship. "

are there any templates/resources available that I can use to transfer my project to funcitonal management?

hi,

I'm currently in an internship at a senior care provider in the netherlands.
my project is to map out the wireless network at 37 locations and to produce a monitoring dashboard for the ServiceDesk to use.

i've been looking around for resources on how to handle the eventual transfer of the project from me to functional management but I've come up empty handed so far.
would you guys have any resources I can use for this?"
7xhu3s,5053,2018-02-14,Boss threatened future opportunities,OmairS23,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7xhu3s/boss_threatened_future_opportunities/,"Hi All - just gave my resignation today. 
I work the graveyard pharmacist position at hospital A. been doing it 7 months, director lobbied for the position with HR last year for a while. Point is, he put in the work to get a 7 on 7 off rotation for overnights. I was fresh out of college and needed a job so i said okay i’ll do it. he said he didn’t want someone who is gonna leave in six months and i didn’t have that intention at all. 

long story short i just got a job at hospital B that is a better position, more money, and a shorter commute. I went in today to Hospital A to give my notice, 2 weeks (3 calendar weeks due to the rotation) and he was pissed and threaten to tell other directors at other organization about my unprofessionalism and will give me a bad reference in the future. 

Anything i can do about this? Maybe it WAS a poor decision to take another job so soon but i wasn’t even actively looking for another full time job it just landed in my lap. 
Any advice will be appreciated. He already ripped me a new one so no need lol. 

EDIT: to clarify, i’ve worked at hospital A for 5 years, from intern to pharmacist. he has been director for a year and a half, I’ve been working as a pharmacist for a little over a year here.  

EDIT: he’s asking for an additional week or two (so until mid-end of march) to finish up my shifts on the schedule. is that reasonable? he says he expected me to at least “go out with class and appropriately” and doing so would be better

UPDATE: Assistant Director just called me - I relayed my concerns to her (she’s very honest and transparent). She explained that the director seemed to be confused about my end ‘date? I explained. Then I explained the directors comments and how I was shocked at his i professionalism and threats. She did her best to assure that they want an amicable and smooth transition/departure. She was incredibly kind and understanding as always, she said she appreciates the 3 weeks, but it’s common courtesy in our profession to give 4 weeks. She told me in her last job of 30 years, she gave 5 weeks and still the employer asked for(and she gave) an additional week. 
I told them I will give one more week, for HER and my colleagues (they’re great people). I negotiated a shorter shift (current is 9p-730a so i said 11-630/7 they said okay) and that I will discuss with the new employer about extending the start date. 
Right after, the DIRECTOR called back, with AD in the room - clarified original end day, he was much more pleasant (go figure) and was happy with an additional work week, would greatly appreciate till the last weekend of March and agreed to work out a shorter shift so I don’t die. 

Guilt or did AD tell him he reacted poorly? who knows. 

I knowwww 98% if y’all said no, just gtfo. But most of you also feel that if the director reacted better, it wouldn’t be as bad. I wouldn’t even be here if he didn’t flip out at me lol. "

Details, scenes and more inside.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7xj4cs/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood afternoon DPP. My name is Jeremy and as the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

People say to stay out of the dock district at night, they just want all the fun to themselves! 

""What about this one, Amy?"" Jessica says from the backseat. Natalie sits in the front, white as a sheet and wide eyed. Shes only been working with us girls in the office for a few weeks, intern. We found out she was a virgin and knew she needed her cherry popped. Would make her more fun to party with. 

""Nah, had him before. Fucking whiny bitch. Sounds like a woman when he cums."" 

This makes Jessica cackle and roll around in the back, spilling some beer on the seat. ""Shit. Pass me that cloth, Natalie.""

""Here we go..."" I've spotted some boys I haven't seen before. What sluts! Tight little boy shorts, mesh tops if they are wearing anything at all. Big strong arms, abs you could grate cheese on. Yeah, these lads will do. 

Pulling up to the side of the street, a tall one soon struts over to poke his head in the rolled down window. 

""Well ain't you a cutie, darling."" I purr. ""How much."" 

""How much you got?"" He grins, voice low. Cheeky bitch, would slap him around if there weren't any others. 

""Let's see what we're paying for first."" 

He reaches in to his denim and tugs them down for a quick flash. *Nice*. It looked big and he was circumcised. I prefer them with skin but these street walkers, you had to be careful. Some of them were disgusting. 

""What'd'ya think, Natalie? Good for a first time?"" 

Natalie was just gawking and blushing, Jessica spoke up instead. 

""He's good, hasn't been on the streets for long. No bruises or nothing."" Addressing the prostitute she continues, ""You go easy on Natalie, she doesn't enjoy every minute then we're not paying a thing."" 

""Hang on."" I run a finger down the whore's face. ""You do anal, darling?""

His face fell, guys don't like anal as a rule. I had never managed to get my frigid husband to put in my asshole. Fucking waste of a man. If they aren't screwing you or carrying things for you what use are they? Should get a divorce, find a fella that shuts up and puts it where I tell him. 

""That'll be double..."" He says quietly. 

""Fine, get in the back with my friend.""

Jessica opens the door for the slut and pulls him in, tugging off her skirt once the car is moving. 

""You can blow me until we get somewhere we can really party."" She giggles. ""You do like to party right?"" 

""Yeah, I like to party but um... my mommy said to get the money off you girls before I do anythi-""

""Don't be whiny bitch."" I growl. ""Blow my friend, you'll get your money. You think we're not honest?"" 

""No."" He sighs, bending over to start licking Jessica's cunt. 

***

Opposite world. Who're you? I want story prompts but they don't have to carry on directly from this one since I sorta controlled the prostitute. Plus I don't really want to write three different characters so unless you are willing to share control of Jessica and Natalie, could be another night on the docks when I'm alone for one idea. Or any other you can come up with that is creative with in a world in which women are the gross, dominant gender and men get to deal with the harassment, objectification and sexism. A crossdresser would actually be perceived more like a woman who was butch for example. A dominant man is the fetish sex worker, not a woman. Pegging would be a very submissive thing for a woman to do, penetrating instead of being the one penetrated. See what you can do with that.

Edit: I posted F4M but upon reflection there is a place for a woman RP partner in this world if you can think of one. "
7xk042,10,2018-02-14,This major changed my life. Trying to decide for better or worse.,DMEburnsDirty,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/7xk042/this_major_changed_my_life_trying_to_decide_for/,"Hi,I just submitted my capstone design a couple of hours ago and began to reflect on my time in this major.  I'm writing to see if there are chemE's who went through a similar experience but I'm not bias, feedback from anyone is good.

I attend a known public university with a respected engineering department globally. I'm middle of the pack in terms of gpa in my class.  I'm a super decent chemE undergrad. 


ChemE has opened my eyes in problem solving. In addition to making me more intuitive, it's had a  emotional toll. I feel  like my newly learned train of thought has led to a personality change. It wasn't prevalent until my mom told me she's sees it.  I come from a devout catholic household, my parents weren't engineers but they are a loving bunch.  This is not a negative change, but a change none the less.

Also I think the chemical engineering classroom is bad.  I know as an engineer you are constantly working in groups. But I think there is too much group work at my school and has caused the students to be cliquey.  I would not have thought that clique' ness would be at such an extent because we're chemE's and not a stereotypical crowd.  I mean it's not bad thing, you find some good partners and shackle up cause we all need to help each other with homework.  Been there done that.  But I don't like it though.  I've worked in groups and with classmates and they  gossip if other classmates name's are brought up and she/he's struggling in the major. ""Oh yea, he/she sucks, please don't ever get me partnered with them"" And it's good number of people that due this among all engineering departments. ...I feel this awful, all these students mentally sizing up each other.  For clarification, It's the percentage that negatively gossip is too high. There are still some studs that are eager to help and are nice.

So I guess my question to you guys is, is this profession always so mentally competitive? 
Because I don't know what I feel about this field if it is. And I'm not bad at it, I've had two successful internships. One big company and one small. Toot my own horn for credibility. 

Well that's it, my first post and it was a solid vent.   I didn't mean to ramble into the classroom issues but I think I did because that's probably a core cause. 


TL:DR
My questions to you.
Did you experience a sort of personality change while completing your undergrad in chemE? 
And is the work field always so mentally competitive?

### URGENT NEWS

 
* *MERCS vs Ronin*

MERCS have issued a declaration of war against Ronin. The war declaration fell short of the traditional 50 word minimum, which all factions agree should be the the minimum number of words required for a war declaration. Despite this invalid war declaration, Ronin stated that they would remind MERCS of the ""wrath of the shogun"". Shortly after the war declaration was made public, Iga stated that they would fight for Ronin, as they ""owe allegiance"" and they would ""honour this bond through military service"".

Less than 1 hour after the war declaration was signed, Ronin and Iga forces stormed the MERCS HQ, who were ""rolled over and crushed"". Ronin hope that such skirmishes will not become a common occurrence, as the population of Otsu was under great stress for 8 minutes as the war raged on.

OOC: Because I can and I enjoy doing it, that right there was 136 words. So MERCS, go and read the rules and learn how to play, or just leave and never return.


* *CrotchRot Manor closed due to ""demons""*

CrotchRot Manor, constructed in 1908 by Lord Crotchrot, has been condemned due to ""demonic activity"". Originally built to be the seat for the Crotchrot dynasty, the building was doomed from the beginning. It has been said that the Lord buried his own daughter underneath the foundations of the building, and that the building was actually a form of temple for the Demon Lord Kromdar. The council of Little Italy has condemned the building, stating that there are numerous reports of supernatural activity, including but not limited to ""objects moving themselves, strange flesh growth and demonic noises coming from the walls"". The Manor is still considered an important place to visit however, as it tells a tale of the island's history and beginnings.

We have not sent a reporter to Crotchrot Manor as of yet, due to the fact that all our reporters refused to go, and there are no available interns to do it instead at this time.

7xkzl2,1,2018-02-14,Is it possible to get a job in the industry after finishing PhD?,MariaGomezWTS,biotech,https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/comments/7xkzl2/is_it_possible_to_get_a_job_in_the_industry_after/,"I am doing PhD in Biomedicine, my project is related to microbiology and obtaining proteins. My background is in microbiology/molecular biology as well.
I have the following questions, will really appreciate if you can help with an answer.

I live in Spain and people from my lab who have PhD couldn't get any job in the industry and had to do a post doc. It's really scary for me and I even had thoughts to quit the PhD and try to get to the industry on any position (or make internship) to get experience and don't lose time doing PhD...

1.Does it have the sense to quit PhD? If I will continue doing PhD, after finishing it which positions can I pursue in the industry? Which industry can I work in?

2.It seems to me that I'm not learning any new techniques during PhD, but staying on the same point during 1,5 year, using the same basic molecular biology methods. Because of that, I think, that my skills are not enough for getting to the industry. Which techniques can I learn for becoming competitive in the industry? (work with cells, mices, genetics etc.)

3.Would it be useful to get an additional master degree in Project management? Will it increase my chances of employment in the company? Which positions can I get with this degree?

I highly appreciate any help! Thank you!"
7xlefx,1,2018-02-14,[MF] The Catherine Story,AceDanny23,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/7xlefx/mf_the_catherine_story/,"Back in early 2017 I got an internship job at my old university where I was in charge of managing the student radio station for three months. I got to work with my friend Matt, another intern who I also graduated with. Together we trained up a batch of new presenters, put new music on the system, managed the schedule and general output of the station during that time. Plus we also got to present shows (which I loved) as well as produce shows for those that weren’t as confident or just needed a little more help. It was a very hands on job that kept me busy (I’d often stay way beyond my contracted hours) and I loved it.

I met a number of new people doing this job, one of whom was Charlotte. She was initially quite shy but she was interested in hosting her own show and we brainstormed ideas of what that show could be. She has a passion for comic books and manga so that became the basis of a show that she’d host every week, joined by other comic book fans off her course. Matt and I did a show on a Friday afternoon and we positioned Charlotte’s show just before ours, but often Charlotte would stay and be a part of our show too, which meant she did five consecutive hours of radio. Charlotte’s boyfriend, Ash, also joined the station but he only ever produced. He never had any inclination to sit behind a live microphone as he didn’t trust himself not to swear or say anything he could later be held accountable for. During this internship I got on with Charlotte and Ash very well, they’d often invite me round for dinner and we’d go out drinking together.

For the Friday just before Valentine’s Day, Matt and I were going to play a version of Blind Date as part of our show. The station we worked at had recently been refurbished and we now had two studios. The plan was for me to be in studio one with a female contestant, while Matt would be in studio two with three male contestants. They’d be able to hear each other but not see each other. The female contestant would ask questions, the males would give some cheesy replies and she’d pick one to go on a date with. Then we’d swap it so we had a male contestant picking from three females. Matt and I ventured to all the local restaurants and many of them had agreed to give away a meal for two or something, so we had a selection of great prizes to give away. Now all we needed was some contestants, and that’s where things got tricky.

We had guys tripping over themselves to be a part of it but we struggled to get females. So we had Charlotte helping us all week to try and convince some single girls to take part. It's creepy and awkward if I just approach random females and say ""Excuse me, are you single?"" But females are less threatened by other females, so we ended up getting Charlotte to do it. After all that leg work, we had one girl sign up.

Anyway, the Blind Date show comes and goes, we never did get enough contestants but we made the best out of what we had. We managed to play one round with one girl and four guys. They were all off the same course, so they all knew each other and one of the guys was her ex. She ended up starting a relationship with one of the other guys who she didn’t pick, and they’re still together now. I like to think our show was responsible for that.

After the show (and the week) I decided I need a drink. The university’s Student’s Union had a Valentines event on, and I had some spare tickets (unused prizes for our show). I didn’t want to go alone, Charlotte was up for it, Ash wasn’t so it was just me and her. We were having a pretty good time, drinks were cheap, and as it was so noisy we’d frequently pop outside for a cigarette. I generally smoke a lot on nights out and have had some of the best conversations of my life in nightclub smoking areas. Eventually the the upstairs room gets opened up for the main event, which was this Valentines Disco. As everybody goes upstairs they get given a huge sticker to wear with a number on it. So the first person to arrive get's #1, the hundredth person gets #100 and so on, you get the idea. I get number 32.

So we go upstairs and everybody's wearing these numbers. There was a number of screens on the walls and hanging from the ceiling with a text message service. So if you like the look of somebody you can send a message that they will see on the screen by including your number and theirs. The majority of them were tragic. Like 'Hey 17, I wanna fuck you in the carpark from 85.' And that's probably a mild example.

So we're drinking, looking around at all the people and I see three girls, wearing 8, 9 and 10. The girl wearing #9 looked particularly stunning. Honestly, I’d say she was the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in real life. I lost myself in staring at her. All the clichés where time stands still, in my experience they’re all true. Anyway, Charlotte caught me staring and agreed that this girl was something else. She suggested that I message the screen and so I did. But mine was more respectable than most. I put '9 is looking fine from 32.'

I hit the send button and we stand there, staring at the screen, waiting for my message to come up and hoping that this girl spots it. But a few minutes later, the system crashes, the screens go black and that was the end of that. Oh well, I shrug it off, I'm still enjoying myself and carry on drinking. Later on we see #10 looking very worse for wear and getting carried out by venue staff. At this point I presume it means #’s 8 and 9 will also be leaving with her.

Charlotte and I carry on drinking, we go outside for another smoke. On the way back in, Charlotte needs the toilet, she goes into the ladies and I wait outside for her. I try and look busy, messing around on my phone but Charlotte was in there for ages. I'm talking 15-20 minutes, at least. If she’d have come out and told me there was this new system where you have to build and plumb in your own toilet before you’re allowed to go, I’d have believed her. Eventually she comes out and is like, let's go for another smoke. Might as well, it’s been a while so we go outside again. I light up, and Charlotte says 'So I got talking to #9 in there.’

My jaw drops and I'm like 'Shut up!'

She says. 'I'm being serious. #9 was in there with #8 who was on the phone to #10, because they're concerned."" So Charlotte claims she was talking to #9 about me and said something along the lines of the following. ""Yeah my friend messaged the screen saying '#9 is looking fine' you should give him a chance. But you have to be quick, he's only here until the end of March. You should fall in love with him and give him a reason to stay.”

I'm hearing this on the smoking balcony and I still don't believe her. Charlotte says she's being absolutely serious and #9 told her that her name is Catherine. But of course in conversation I'm like 'Is that Catherine or Kathryn?' And I say 'What the hell are we doing out here. Go back in and get me her number.' Looking back, I come across as a bit of an entitled prick, but that’s just what happened.

We go back inside and upstairs and there she is. #9 on the dancefloor with her friend. At that point, my stomach just goes. There’s butterflies, it's doing summersaults, you name it. I run off for a piss, while Charlotte goes back over to #9, or Catherine, as we now know her.

When I come back out I see this girl writing on Charlotte's hand and then she walks off. I stay by the bar, it seems safer there. Charlotte walks back over to me and says that she wasn't comfortable giving me her number but told her for me to add her on facebook. And on Charlotte's hand she's written 'C (Surname which I won’t publish here)'.

So I get my phone out and send her a friend request. Catherine must have get her phone out and have a look because suddenly her friend, #8 is looking at me and indicating me to Catherine. It looks like she's trying to bring Catherine over to us but Catherine keeps backing away.

Charlotte's trying to take me over to them, but I keep backing away. At this point I have zero courage, I don't remember a time that I ever felt more afraid or less confident. I have no idea how long this carries on for but we're practically following her round the dancefloor for the rest of the night, Catherine still backing away. Even if we'd ended up next to each other, I'd have no idea what I would say.

This silly game carries on all the way up to the last song and the friend (#8) still looks like she's trying to get Catherine near me. Charlotte goes to the toilet, at this point they're closing off upstairs so she has to go downstairs. The last song finishes and I'm just stood there. It all goes silent, the house lights come on and I’m just frozen. I don't know what to do or where to look. I don’t know whether to shit or wind my watch, I'm looking at the two of them and it looked like the friend screamed the words 'FUCK OFF!' at me. So I turned and ran down the stairs and out the building.

Charlotte comes outside, the building is funnelling out. I feel like shit. Charlotte sends a message to Catherine from my phone, something of the lines of 'hey I'm sorry if we creeped you out, my friend just really wanted us to meet each other'. Charlotte and I both ended up getting blocked by Catherine on Facebook. I saw her once more around a month later and I still didn’t have the balls to go and speak to her, not that I think she even noticed me anyway.

At the time, I’d been single for about nine months, now I’ve been single for about a year and a half. I had a pretty busy year following the Catherine night, working freelance on a number of projects so I was frequently meeting new people. On only one occasion since have I met a girl that I’ve felt attracted to and I’m yet to meet anyone more beautiful than Catherine. I identify a lot with the Cristina character from ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’, especially when she says “I don’t know what I want from life, I only know what I don’t want” and I think that plays a huge part in my lack of confidence when talking to girls.

On the most part I’m not bothered. If it weren’t for my high sex drive I think I could live forever without being in a proper relationship again. Lately I’ve been on pretty strong medication that has pretty killed my sex drive anyway. I don’t really get bitter, resentful or anything like that. I try to live life with no regrets. I’m always heavily critical of myself and think it helps that I can have a laugh at my own expense. I’m quite a nostalgic person. Always have been, but I try not to live in the past too much. Sometimes I can’t help myself. It’s quite nice to listen to ‘Catherine’ by Magic Man and think back to that time."

The plan was for me to be in studio one with a female contestant, while Matt would be in studio two with three male contestants. They’d be able to hear each other but not see each other. The female contestant would ask questions, the males would give some cheesy replies and she’d pick one to go on a date with. Then we’d swap it so we had a male contestant picking from three females. Matt and I ventured to all the local restaurants and many of them had agreed to give away a meal for two or something, so we had a selection of great prizes to give away. Now all we needed was some contestants, and that’s where things got tricky.

We had guys tripping over themselves to be a part of it but we struggled to get females. So we had Charlotte helping us all week to try and convince some single girls to take part. It's creepy and awkward if I just approach random females and say ""Excuse me, are you single?"" But females are less threatened by other females, so we ended up getting Charlotte to do it. After all that leg work, we had one girl sign up.

Anyway, the Blind Date show comes and goes, we never did get enough contestants but we made the best out of what we had. We managed to play one round with one girl and four guys. They were all off the same course, so they all knew each other and one of the guys was her ex. She ended up starting a relationship with one of the other guys who she didn’t pick, and they’re still together now. I like to think our show was responsible for that.

After the show (and the week) I decided I need a drink. The university’s Student’s Union had a Valentines event on, and I had some spare tickets (unused prizes for our show). I didn’t want to go alone, Charlotte was up for it, Ash wasn’t so it was just me and her. We were having a pretty good time, drinks were cheap, and as it was so noisy we’d frequently pop outside for a cigarette. I generally smoke a lot on nights out and have had some of the best conversations of my life in nightclub smoking areas. Eventually the the upstairs room gets opened up for the main event, which was this Valentines Disco. As everybody goes upstairs they get given a huge sticker to wear with a number on it. So the first person to arrive get's #1, the hundredth person gets #100 and so on, you get the idea. I get number 32.

So we go upstairs and everybody's wearing these numbers. There was a number of screens on the walls and hanging from the ceiling with a text message service. So if you like the look of somebody you can send a message that they will see on the screen by including your number and theirs. The majority of them were tragic. Like 'Hey 17, I wanna fuck you in the carpark from 85.' And that's probably a mild example.

So we're drinking, looking around at all the people and I see three girls, wearing 8, 9 and 10. The girl wearing #9 looked particularly stunning. Honestly, I’d say she was the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in real life. I lost myself in staring at her. All the clichés where time stands still, in my experience they’re all true. Anyway, Charlotte caught me staring and agreed that this girl was something else. She suggested that I message the screen and so I did. But mine was more respectable than most. I put '9 is looking fine from 32.'

I hit the send button and we stand there, staring at the screen, waiting for my message to come up and hoping that this girl spots it. But a few minutes later, the system crashes, the screens go black and that was the end of that. Oh well, I shrug it off, I'm still enjoying myself and carry on drinking. Later on we see #10 looking very worse for wear and getting carried out by venue staff. At this point I presume it means #’s 8 and 9 will also be leaving with her.

Charlotte and I carry on drinking, we go outside for another smoke. On the way back in, Charlotte needs the toilet, she goes into the ladies and I wait outside for her. I try and look busy, messing around on my phone but Charlotte was in there for ages. I'm talking 15-20 minutes, at least. If she’d have come out and told me there was this new system where you have to build and plumb in your own toilet before you’re allowed to go, I’d have believed her. Eventually she comes out and is like, let's go for another smoke. Might as well, it’s been a while so we go outside again. I light up, and Charlotte says 'So I got talking to #9 in there.’

My jaw drops and I'm like 'Shut up!'

She says. 'I'm being serious. #9 was in there with #8 who was on the phone to #10, because they're concerned."" So Charlotte claims she was talking to #9 about me and said something along the lines of the following. ""Yeah my friend messaged the screen saying '#9 is looking fine' you should give him a chance. But you have to be quick, he's only here until the end of March. You should fall in love with him and give him a reason to stay.”

I'm hearing this on the smoking balcony and I still don't believe her. Charlotte says she's being absolutely serious and #9 told her that her name is Catherine. But of course in conversation I'm like 'Is that Catherine or Kathryn?' And I say 'What the hell are we doing out here. Go back in and get me her number.' Looking back, I come across as a bit of an entitled prick, but that’s just what happened.

We go back inside and upstairs and there she is. #9 on the dancefloor with her friend. At that point, my stomach just goes. There’s butterflies, it's doing summersaults, you name it. I run off for a piss, while Charlotte goes back over to #9, or Catherine, as we now know her.

When I come back out I see this girl writing on Charlotte's hand and then she walks off. I stay by the bar, it seems safer there. Charlotte walks back over to me and says that she wasn't comfortable giving me her number but told her for me to add her on facebook. And on Charlotte's hand she's written 'C (Surname which I won’t publish here)'.

So I get my phone out and send her a friend request. Catherine must have get her phone out and have a look because suddenly her friend, #8 is looking at me and indicating me to Catherine. It looks like she's trying to bring Catherine over to us but Catherine keeps backing away.

Charlotte's trying to take me over to them, but I keep backing away. At this point I have zero courage, I don't remember a time that I ever felt more afraid or less confident. I have no idea how long this carries on for but we're practically following her round the dancefloor for the rest of the night, Catherine still backing away. Even if we'd ended up next to each other, I'd have no idea what I would say.

This silly game carries on all the way up to the last song and the friend (#8) still looks like she's trying to get Catherine near me. Charlotte goes to the toilet, at this point they're closing off upstairs so she has to go downstairs. The last song finishes and I'm just stood there. It all goes silent, the house lights come on and I’m just frozen. I don't know what to do or where to look. I don’t know whether to shit or wind my watch, I'm looking at the two of them and it looked like the friend screamed the words 'FUCK OFF!' at me. So I turned and ran down the stairs and out the building.

Charlotte comes outside, the building is funnelling out. I feel like shit. Charlotte sends a message to Catherine from my phone, something of the lines of 'hey I'm sorry if we creeped you out, my friend just really wanted us to meet each other'. Charlotte and I both ended up getting blocked by Catherine on Facebook. I saw her once more around a month later and I still didn’t have the balls to go and speak to her, not that I think she even noticed me anyway.

At the time, I’d been single for about nine months, now I’ve been single for about a year and a half. I had a pretty busy year following the Catherine night, working freelance on a number of projects so I was frequently meeting new people. On only one occasion since have I met a girl that I’ve felt attracted to and I’m yet to meet anyone more beautiful than Catherine. I identify a lot with the Cristina character from ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’, especially when she says “I don’t know what I want from life, I only know what I don’t want” and I think that plays a huge part in my lack of confidence when talking to girls.

On the most part I’m not bothered. If it weren’t for my high sex drive I think I could live forever without being in a proper relationship again. Lately I’ve been on pretty strong medication that has pretty killed my sex drive anyway. I don’t really get bitter, resentful or anything like that. I try to live life with no regrets. I’m always heavily critical of myself and think it helps that I can have a laugh at my own expense. I’m quite a nostalgic person. Always have been, but I try not to live in the past too much. Sometimes I can’t help myself. It’s quite nice to listen to ‘Catherine’ by Magic Man and think back to that time."
7xlp0d,9,2018-02-14,How far will they go with April?,JacobiSimpson,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/7xlp0d/how_far_will_they_go_with_april/,"April's falling apart. The cumulative bad events of the last few years have finally caught up with her and for the majority of this season she's been isolated, anxiety-fueled, guilt-ridden and it's heavily implied she's depressed. Currently, everyone's either taking advantage of or ignoring her, it's alluded she has a burgeoning drinking problem, and she's sleeping with the intern, which if the last few seasons of Grey's have shown us anything, is completely out of character for her. Sarah said that her favorite Dark Kepner moment is in 14x16 or 14x17, which means the spiral won't be ending anytime soon. But how far will they take it?
 
The thing that finally put April over the edge was everything in 14x10 (Matthew, police shooting, Paul, the boy who made her doubt everything). The only way I can see her spiraling further is if Jaggie gets shoved in her face (seems kind of weird that they're pursuing that so hard while April's having a mental breakdown), or they somehow drag Harriet into it...

And if they do go that way, what's it going to mean for April's character? How much darker could it get? Because I know other Shona shows can go wayyyyy dark. So it doesn't seem like Grey's wouldn't push the boundaries. 

At this point, I'm worried about how anyone even going to find out April's not okay if Arizona didn't even know when April told her to her face. Are they not going to kill her right? Because they've been doing fakeouts all season... Sarah's contract isn't over, is it?

Nothing good ever happens in my life, things never go the way I want *ever*. Ever since I was in high school honestly.

I was supposed to work at a financial firm but I didn't want to be stuck in a cubicle for the rest of my life so instead I dropped my internships and applied into the Navy to be a fighter pilot (which has been my lifelong passion). Last semester I was kinda in a rut which dropped my GPA way below what I needed for flight school so I got rejected. Now I have nothing, lost all my opportunities. 

All my friends have either graduated already or have found other friend groups. The close friends that I have now are great and all but they're not super supportive and all they do is sit around and do nothing. I want to make new friends but I'm so close to graduation that's there's just no point. Everyone already has their clique.

My love life, is hopeless. I won't lie, back in my freshman thru junior year (of college) I was hooking up with girls left and right but not making connections really. It was easy, hooking up (I feel like my personality is bland and I'm insecure that a girl would lose interest in me soon). Nowadays I struggle to even get girls' attention, all the girls I like now just seem completely unattainable. I've wanted a girlfriend so bad though for the past few years. I've never been able to bring myself to approach a girl I really liked if it wasn't at a party.

My self esteem is at an all time low. I look in the mirror and I just see a monster, I always ask myself how could someone ever find me attractive. People tell me I'm attractive but it just feels like their saying that to make me feel better. I'm always thinking about my appearance, I can never get my mind off of how ugly I am. Also idk why but I've been having this feeling in my chest everyday, I get nervous and feel so scared to speak in class and I've been stumbling over my words constantly and makes me feel self conscious about speaking. 

I feel stupid for posting this because some of you are going through a lot worse; the stuff I'm going through sounds so stupid and petty but it has kinda been building up over time and it's gotten to the point where I just don't wanna exist anymore. Honestly I've put a lot of stress on my parents (who are divorced) as well, and I feel like they just think of me as a hopeless person anyway. I've costed them tons of money through things I went through in the past. It seems like they put so much more time and effort into the kids that they have now (with my step parents)"

As I'm filling out my application to bring in, I see there is a starting and ending salary for the employment history section. 

The past two jobs I've worked have both been internship style positions where I worked primarily as a front-end web developer and feel as though I was severely underpaid at $11/hr and $13.50/hr. Especially considering the operations manager mentioned over beers one night they paid a contractor $20k/monthly to build there site, and they're expecting me to do a complete overhaul for $13.50/hr.

After doing much more research on salaries of entry level/junior web or database developers I see most people make around $75k/year. 

My wife is newly pregnant and as the only one working I need to have a living wage, so I wanted to ask here what I should put down for the starting and ending wages on the application without shooting myself in the foot. Do I put down exactly what I was being paid or put something vague in like 'entry level' and discuss further in the interview?

Thanks!

tl;dr: made minimum wage working previous web development jobs, have interview for a full time position, how do I avoid short changing myself?"

When I got to high school I got on the varsity team and by my sophomore year I was receiving letters from colleges. Then I started to feel kind of shitty physically, like this weird heavy feeling in my side when I ran and pain and weakness in my bones.  I went to all kinds of doctors and none could tell me what was wrong. 

Eventually I gave up and just accepted that I wasn't going to be able to run in college. It was an incredibly frustrating thing to accept but I got over it and moved on with life. I found new hobbies, enjoyed time with friends, and got into a good university down south.  I did really well my first year at college and I made new friends. I was majoring in accounting and started setting up internships with big accounting firms. 

But once I returned home from my first year of college I started to feel that same shitty feeling again. My stomach hurt, I hardly ate any food, all my joints hurt, I had crippling levels of fatigue, I just felt all around miserable. I still went back to school the next year and just tried to power through. 

I made it through the first semester but at the start of the second semester I dropped out.  I just couldn't keep up with all the work when I felt so shitty.  I moved back in with my parents and just worked some shitty job and played video games all day. 

After about 6 months of doing that I transferred my credits to a university nearby to try and give college another shot.  I'm 2 weeks into the semester now and my fatigue is unbearable. My attention span is nonexistent. I have 3 months left to go and I can't even imagine going another day.  

I'm on the verge of quitting but if I quit school I wouldn't even know what to do. I don't know if I could even get a job feeling like this. And my parents and family think I'm getting better because I'm back in school. I'm afraid what they would think if they see me fail again. And now that I've spent so much time feeling like this I'm starting to get depressed. I have no friends at the new college, I don't enjoy doing anything and have no motivation to even get out of bed in the morning. I feel like if I quit I'll have no future and there will be no jobs that will suit me.  I just wish I could go to sleep tonight and never wake up so that I won't have to drag myself around day after day to only feel worse and worse with each passing week.  It kills me inside to see my life implode in on itself like this.  What do I do? I feel so trapped"

I am having serious trouble finding a job in marketing/digital marketing, every single job requires some sort of experience. I am self-taught in the Adobe Creative Suite, Google Adwords and SEO practices. I have beginner knowledge in HTML 5/CSS. Unfortunately, aside from the Adobe CS it's very difficult to hone your skills in a lot of these tools/platforms without having your own public business with a website or product/service. I try go to the General Assembly once every 2 weeks, usually to a digital marketing-related day-long bootcamps.

I'm starting to feel as if this field is too competitive or the bar of requirements has simply been set too high for existing jobs and am beginning to regret taking this path in life. Has anyone else been in this position with this kind of degree? Even the internships are competitive and have taken like 5-6 weeks to get back to me. Perhaps the industry is more of a ""who you know"" rather than ""what you know"". I have friends from uni who are barely computer literate and have managed to find work.

Also, if it matters, I am also an EU citizen as well. I'm not sure and doubt that the EU has more job opportunities than Australia, and then there are the language barriers. Just thought I'd mention.

Is it worth going to a local career advisor? Are there any other fields I could consider with the aforementioned qualifications and experience?

Thank you."

Summary: a vampire plagues a small college town.



Herein is my account of the events of the summer of 2009. It is as much for me to make sense of things as it is for posterity.


Jolliet, Missouri is an old mining town on the Mississippi river, a few hours south of St. Louis. The state started a university there, first for engineers and the army, but now for pretty much everything. The mines closed about 50 years ago, so the whole town now revolves around the college. There are a few townies, people who stay year-round and really live in Jolliet, but for the most part, it is only populated in during the school semester. 


I graduated in 2009, majoring in booze and boys and minoring in my major. Unfortunately, the economic crisis made job prospects for a mediocre physics-major effectively nonexistent. My roommate was much smarter than I in retrospect. She admitted defeat before graduation and went straight to grad school in the fall. It took me a year to follow suit. After graduation, our lease wasn’t up until September, and I dreaded going home to live with my parents, so the two of us stayed in Jolliet over the summer. She threw parties and I job searched.


I was raised catholic, but like many, my family never took it seriously, only going to church on Christmas and Easter and sending us all to public school. That year however, I went every Sunday and my roommate, a devout atheist, attended too. Now, when most people think of altar boys, they think of eight graders, but this was a college church and therefore had college altar boys. One of them, Mason, was a friend of ours from class who had been flirting with me for most of the semester. He was a townie, originally from Jolliet with professors for parents, and took religion more seriously than is typical of us science majors. The other two regular servers were a pair of brothers out of St. Louis who ran a racket out the back door selling the communion wine. The local grocer donated a top shelf wine for church. Local legend said that the old lady who owned the store donated her favorite dry red, so she could drink it at communion. That was why my roommate suddenly “got religion,” good cheap wine for the parties. Little did she know, the brothers watered it down.


I first noticed something out of the ordinary at church one Sunday in June. I’d been going to church weekly for months now and had watched the crowded spring services dwindle to the sparse empty pews of summer as the students left town. There weren’t many people at mass and although I didn’t know most of them personally, I recognized nearly all the families and knew where people sat. Around mid-June a new family began attending church regularly. They consisted of two parents in their 40s, a daughter about my age, a son in high school, with two younger daughters, maybe 5 and 7 by their look. They all dressed formally, a common sight among the more rural people, but somehow out of place for them. You could tell they weren’t the usual townies. They looked like they would have been at home in Chicago, not Jolliet. They sat right up in the front and never hung around after mass, not even for the occasional fried chicken luncheon. The only thing I ever saw them do other than slink right out the door was that the mother would sometimes light a candle and say a prayer or the father would talk to the priest. By the fourth of July the oldest daughter stopped attending with them.


The priest was from up east given his accent, perhaps somewhere in New York. He was an Italian in his late 50s or early 60s, with totally white hair and a thick, manicured mustache. He smoked like a furnace and I’d wager he even took a cut of the brothers’ black-market wine profit. He always made sure to dress well and had shinier shoes than anyone outside a military parade. I mention this because the Sunday after the Fourth of July, the first mass that the girl was not in attendance, he had pronounced white stubble over his cheeks and his mustache had blended into his chin to form an uneven goatee. By the 19th His smoking became nearly constant, such that at communion his hands shook for lack of a cigarette. His shoes were visibly scuffed and dusty with limestone chat. By August 2nd, however, all was back to normal. He was clean shaven, the mustache was tidy, and shoes regained their shine, but no one of that odd family ever returned to mass.


During this time, from June through July, after mass, while Jess, my roommate, got a few bottles of wine from Luke and Dan, I chatted with Mason. We hit it off and soon the three of them were regulars at our parties. Luke worked at the south-side liquor store and even brought us a keg for the Fourth of July party. We used it every weekend for the rest of the month. By the end, it was just serving up foam, so we went back to serving sangria, which was everyone’s favorite anyway. 


In the second weekend of August, Mason missed our usual party, but Luke and Dan were there. I noted it because they usually all rode together. We didn’t see him at church either. I asked Luke and Dan and they said they hadn’t seen him since the week before when they’d served at a funeral. I hadn’t gotten any texts from him either. We soon drove by his parents’ house, but they said they hadn’t seen him since that Tuesday and had filed him missing with the police on Thursday. We all wondered what could have happened to him, but there was little we could have done, and the police did not like us getting involved.


His parents called me just as school was starting again for Jess. Mason was back but wouldn’t say where he’d been. They complained to me that he just sat in his room all day and never really spoke. I invited him to our usual party that Friday night in the hope it would help him get back to normal. It would be the last big summer party since school would be starting the following week. His parents didn’t seem optimistic.


On Friday Luke and Dan arrived as usual and, to my surprise, they brought Mason too. He looked pale and unkempt. I wondered what must have happened to him in his 10 missing days. Luke and Dan handed Jess an extra bottle of the communion wine which she added to the sangria along with the last bottle of vodka. The potent brew sat in a large cooler with oranges and apples which Jess stirred with a paddle meant for crawfish. I grabbed a cup for both myself and Mason to hopefully get him to talk. Despite his parents’ report, he was more extroverted than usual. He talked my ear off about nothing in particular, while I sipped the sangria. I hardly got a word in edgewise. I must have overindulged while he talked because soon we were talking philosophy and quantum physics, topics I rarely discussed sober. I got on a tangent and he took a long draught of the sangria, evidently his first opportunity to drink because of all his talking. 
I was in the middle of conjecture about time travel when he coughed and clutched at his throat. Thinking he was about to throw up, I jumped out of the line-of-fire, so to speak. Instead, he dropped to his knees, coughing dark crimson blood onto the carpet. I immediately called 911 and the operator told us all to stay clear but to make sure he didn’t choke. By the time the ambulance arrived, he was unconscious on his side with a thin trickle of blood from his nose and mouth. The police and some EMTs stayed to get names and numbers of everyone at the party in case he had something contagious, so we could not follow to the hospital. They also got a brief summary of what had happened and took his cup of sangria to test along with some photographs of the scene. When they left, we sent everyone home and cleaned up the blood.


Mason was declared dead upon arrival to the hospital. His parents never spoke to me again, not even at his wake. I think they must have blamed me for his death. There was no evidence of poison or infection and the coroner deemed the death accidental from a bad allergic reaction to shellfish, stating that we used a crawfish paddle to stir the sangria. They never addressed that he had drunk that same sangria every Friday night for months without issue and Jess always made it exactly the same way.
Naturally we threw out the rest of that batch. Although nobody else got sick, we were all fairly traumatized. I tried to rationalize what I’d seen that night. What was different? The only thing I could think of is that Luke and Dan had brought that free bottle of wine which they usually avoided due to the risk of getting caught. 


The following Sunday after church I inquired about it. Dan claimed that it was just the same as the rest. Luke shuffled uneasily and later interjected that they had refilled that bottle with some of the extra wine that was served at communion. Jess exclaimed how disgusting that was, that people could have contaminated it. Dan quickly got defensive and stated that they never used the cups that people drank from, just the extra in the decanter. He claimed that since they used it in sangria with vodka that it was perfectly sanitary anyway, even if they had refilled from the cup. He also said they had always done that, so really it wasn’t unusual. I questioned him, saying that I thought they watered the communion wine down, adding holy water at the altar. He admitted that they did, but that it wasn’t enough to alter the taste. The two of them had even added extra holy water recently when filling the decanter, so the bottles would still look full when a good portion of the wine was consumed during the mass. Jess stormed off in a huff, knowing that she’d been getting ripped off for months. I followed, still confused as to the source of Mason’s poisoning. 


Jess went back to school that week and I researched on my computer. No allergic reaction I could find made people cough up blood like that. Nobody else had gotten sick at the party and I had brought him his cup, so it couldn’t have been tampered with. Furthermore, the police found no poison and he had drunk that sangria dozens of times before without consequence. None of it made sense.


On Wednesday at Mason’s wake the priest approached me. He offered condolences and stated that Luke had filled him in on the details of what happened at the party. He began asking about Mason’s behavior just before he died. I accompanied him out to the funeral home porch where he could smoke and described how Mason was unusually talkative and charming but appeared sick. He asked if Mason had kissed anyone at the party which I took as much too nosey, but answered that he had not, assuming the priest suspected some contagion. I asked why he was so interested to which he postulated that Mason was an undead, a vampire, and it was the holy water laced in the wine that killed him. I scoffed and asked what he’d been drinking, stating that it was ridiculous. 


He produced a small flask, to which I grinned smugly, but he defended that it was full of holy water, not liquor. He described to me his plan to test his theory, that he would drop a tiny amount of the holy water on Mason’s skin in the casket and see if it burnt him. I was intrigued. Part of me thought he was insane, the other wanted to see him attempt it. He stomped out his cigarette and patted his coat in search of another, but the box was empty. We headed back inside where I agreed to cause a distraction so he could test it. 


We returned to the wake separately. He meandered near the casket and I near the food. I loudly bumped the table, knocking the lemonade off its stand and scrambling to set it back on balance. For a moment all eyes were on me before everyone returned to normal. The priest returned to me and stated that it had worked. The holy water had burnt Mason’s skin thus confirming his theory. I was doubtful and went to see it myself. The priest instructed me to look at his right hand to find the burn. Just as he had said, there was a small punched out divot in his hand as if a hot coal had landed there. I returned to the priest and asked him to drop some of the “holy water” on his own hand, perhaps it was lye. He did so without consequence.


I was still skeptical. I thought for a moment and challenged him that, if Mason was a vampire, how did he become one? Don’t you need to be bitten by a vampire to become one? He answered me stating that it was a long story but recounted it to me there. It began with the new family in June. “[They] came to town from Memphis when [their eldest daughter] began behaving weirdly. She stopped associating with her friends, which the parents initially supported since they disapproved of them, but also realized how unusual it was for their rebellious child. She dropped out of school in the middle of spring semester and came home. They noticed her talking in the middle of the night, alone in her room. Through the door they heard different voices and even different languages. At first, they thought it was skype or some video chat, but they barged in on her once to see her sitting in bed, eyes fixed on the empty wall, just talking to herself. They sought psychiatric help without success and finally asked for an exorcism in St. Louis after hearing about the one in ‘49. They told her that only one exorcist stilled lived in Jesuit Hall but he was too senile and decrepit to help. They referred the family to me. In seminary school I did an internship at the Vatican and assisted with an exorcism there. Although I had never lead one myself, unfortunately I was the closest thing to an exorcist in the region. After all, exorcisms aren’t really done anymore. I conducted the usual tests and determined that she was possessed. I began the exorcism, but when we did not see improvement after two weeks, [her father] prohibited me from continuing and checked her into the psychiatric ward at St. Sebastian’s Hospital in town here. I tried to explain that some exorcisms take a long time, but he wouldn’t listen. She was found dead in her hospital room a week later. Apparently, she had slit her wrists in the night with a jagged bar that she snapped off the bed frame. We held her funeral at the church on the following Tuesday, the night Mason was last seen before going missing. When he was reported missing, I first suspected that she was undead. I went to her grave site the following night to see that the new sod was overturned and the dirt disturbed. I then contacted the bishop in St. Louis but was dismissed. I did the same in Springfield and received a similar response, that I did not have enough evidence to make such claims. Since nothing more happened, I let the issue slip until I heard that Mason was back. You pretty much know the story from there.”


I didn’t know what to say. Was he insane or could this have really happened? I entertained the idea for a moment. “Assuming this is true, what do we do now? Also, how did she go from being possessed to being a vampire?” I asked


“As for her becoming a vampire, she died while possessed, therefore the demon was still in there. It now occupies her body alone since her soul is gone, thus she’s a vampire.” I didn’t quite follow, but just nodded while he continued. “If she is out attacking people, there will be reports of it on the news. Furthermore, from what little I know of the undead, she must sleep during the day and cannot go into the sun. I’ll need to research missing persons and unusual news to try and locate her resting place before I can deal with her. I could use some help triangulating her position if you’re not busy.” I really didn’t believe him but stayed silent out of courtesy. I also figured that even a fruitless witch-hunt would beat applying for jobs. “Your roommate could help too.” He offered, likely sensing my reservation. I agreed to help, only to research, and decided to involve Jess, mainly because playing along to these possible delusions made me nervous. 


That night I scoured the local news website and surprised myself with what seemed like evidence. A local man who lived in a remote mobile home had died in what was officially regarded as a gas explosion. A video accompanied the report and his wife insisted to the reporters that he simply burst into flames as he walked outside that morning. People in the comments remarked that they must have been cooking meth for her to try a story that absurd. Additionally, there was an article questioning whether mountain lions had returned to the state. They cited sightings going back to 1994 and posted a map of local livestock killings. The report stated that coyotes and other Missouri predators were too small to bring down cows, and suggested mountain lions as a possible explanation. The map showed the killings centering around a hollow on the south side of town and the author suspected that the lion may have a den in the old lead mine that still opened into the hollow.


I sent these reports to the priest and discussed the whole situation with Jess. She thought I was crazy, that we both were crazy. She said I had been spending too much time alone in my job search and had finally lost it. I showed her the news reports and cited the burn on Mason’s hand. She explained that the priest had been smoking and could have found another cigarette to burn that mark. I admitted that her explanation seemed much more valid and kicked myself for being duped. I then decided to test it officially. I convinced Jess that at the funeral in the morning we would each bring a water bottle from the tap. We would have the priest bless one and not the other then test it ourselves. 


The next morning, we did just that. Before the funeral we had the priest bless only one water bottle and let a drop from each of the two land on Mason’s hand. The unblessed water ran off normally, but the holy water burned into his skin like acid. Jess cursed in amazement under her breath. She immediately took the holy water and touched it to her arm only to watch it run off harmlessly. She sat down in shock and pretty much remained that way throughout the funeral. 


After Mason was interred, we hung around the grave site until everyone had left but the priest. Jess asked if we needed to stake Mason like in the movies, but the priest answered that the holy water had done the trick already. He then explained that his research found reports that also centered around the old mine entrance and that the girl likely rested there during the day, hunting at night. He described a plan to investigate during the day when she would be asleep. We volunteered to go along, which he was glad of, but wouldn’t have ever asked of us. Since it was already mid-afternoon, we decided to reconvene at our house the next morning.


It was Friday. Had circumstanced been different we would have been preparing for our weekly party, but instead we whittled branches from the back yard down into stakes. A little before noon the priest arrived with bags of garlic, three bottles of holy water, and a few stakes of his own. He handed us each a bottle of the holy water and advised us to put on long pants and long sleeves, covering as much skin as possible. He then instructed us to cut cloves of garlic and rub the cut surface on any exposed skin, especially the neck. I asked if wearing a crucifix would help and he said he thought crosses were just used in Hollywood, that from what he read, garlic was the best defense. I put mine in my pocket anyway. He then warned us about how vampires attack, stating that they generally don’t like to kill people, but to create new vampires. “She will try and tempt you,” he said, “to convince you to let her bite you. You have to be bitten willingly to become a vampire, otherwise she will just kill you.”


“Well that’s certainly better than death! Immortality, eternal youth, and all.” Jess said.


“You don’t get it,” he replied. “You will be dead either way. The question is whether or not a demon may walk around in your body after.”


“Oh.” She answered, disappointed.


With that clarified, and after preparing, we all drove down to the hollow with the mine entrance. It was cold all year round there in the hollow and a sulfurous smell issued from the mine, giving it the colloquial name “the Devil’s Anus” (the Devil’s Ice Box was already taken). Frat boys would hold summer bon fires down there in years past, but the police put a stop to it in the ‘90s. Since then, the trails had become overgrown. Sapling oaks and wild blackberry brambles made it a rough hike, but we eventually reached the entrance. We proceeded in a few yards only to realize we’d forgotten flashlights. I had the new iPhone and had downloaded a flashlight app as a black light for the party but forgot to delete it despite it not working. We used the phone to guide us deeper into the mine, but soon encountered a fork. Taking the right tunnel, we continued. It couldn’t have been much further, that the 20% battery warning appeared on my phone, forcing us to retreat. Soon the battery ran out leaving us in total darkness. Jess had her brand-new Galaxy and simply used the screen as light. Every few minutes it would turn off, but we slowly and carefully picked our way through the tunnel until reached a place where faint natural light glowed in the tunnel and we could exit.


I despaired that it was all a wasted journey as it was already getting late, too late to return with lights, but the priest suggested waiting for her there in the hollow. He used a branch to dig a narrow trench across the entrance, pouring the holy water from his bottle into the trench, making a barrier. It soaked into the soil, so we added the contents of another bottle and split the remaining one between the three of us. The barrier remained so we waited behind a low berm for darkness. Its hard to describe the combination of excitement, fear, and total boredom that attended me during that wait, but the hours passed like years.


Just as the last sunlight faded from the hollow, she appeared. She wore the beautiful light blue dress she was buried in, now marred with dirt. The mud caked her matted hair. Blood stained her hands and face, the drips making a bib around her collar. She walked to the entrance but leapt back, hissing, when she encountered the water. She stalked forward to the edge of the trench, paused a moment, and kicked a mound of soil over the water, allowing her to cross. The priest tightened his grip around a stake, closed his eyes, mumbling a quick prayer, and then rushed at her. Only half way across the clearing, he stopped in his tracks. She stood still, looking him in the eye, menacing and unmoving. He lowered the stake, transfixed. I shouted for him to attack and was promptly hushed by Jess. This must have startled the vampire girl because she dashed ahead to bite him. She grabbed him by each shoulder and bared her fangs for a fatal bite to the carotid, but instead pushed him to the ground, retching at the garlic.  He sat there for a moment, motionless, then began to roll up his sleeve, offering his uncoated arm instead. 


I gave my bottle of holy water to Jess and pulled the crucifix from my pocket. I told her to use it all if I too became enthralled. I grabbed a stake and advanced presenting the crucifix in my other hand. It didn’t faze the vampire. On my approach she turned and looked me in the eye. 


Time didn’t really line up anymore. I heard her voice in my head, promising the knowledge of the future and to all the questions of science and the universe. I told myself it was all a lie, but she rebutted stating that if I knew who she was then I would know she could give me what she offered. I longed for the knowledge, but before I could make up my mind, Jess flung holy water at her, burning away half of her face. 


The skin and muscle sizzled and melted away like wax from a candle, leaving only bloody bone. She glared at Jess with an empty socket and a single icy blue eye, but unfazed, Jess ran back to the brush to grab a stake. While the vampire stared after Jess, the priest seized his opportunity and stabbed the vampire in the back with his stake, barely missing her heart. She turned back to him, grabbing his exposed arm for a bite. I quickly stabbed her through the heart with my stake. Jess returned with the third stake just a little too late, as the vampire girl was already cracking into ash with bits of her body drifting away like seeds from a dandelion puff.


The priest’s white collar was stained with blood while splatters had soaked into his black shirt. I looked down and I too was splattered from staking her. We each proved to the others that we hadn’t been bitten by touching the holy water to our skin and remaining unburnt. Jess was the only one of us without suspicious-looking blood stains, so she went for the car while the priest and I waited just out of sight in the woods. I asked him what the vampiress had tempted him with and he answered that it was proof of God. He said he’d always doubted it at the back of his mind and just wanted surety one way or the other. I replied that mine was similar, that she promised me the answers to all of my questions about the universe. Jess arrived in the car and we dropped the priest off at his house behind the church. We then went straight home, careful to not be pulled over since we could think of no good explanation for my being covered in blood. 


Later I asked Jess how she avoided vampiress' temptation, and she couldn't say. She guessed that perhaps it was because the girl only had 1 eye left, or perhaps she just didn't want anything bad enough. After all, the only thing the vampire could offer was wealth and comfort, neither of which she considered worth her soul. She said she was already pretty comfy and that if she wanted wealth she wouldn’t have gone to grad school. She admitted that perhaps immortality would have tempted her before, but the priest said it was an illusion. I laughed saying she never believed a word he said before and she told me off saying I was lucky she believed that bit.


At Sunday service life was back to normal. The church was again crowded with students, and we claimed our usual pew in the back. After the usual dull sermon, we sang “I Saw the Light” and departed, deliberately not visiting the back door for Luke and Dan’s watered-down wine.


The beginning of September loomed, bringing with it the end of our lease. I helped Jess move to her new apartment while she helped me box my stuff for moving back in with my parents. I spent the waning days of the year hunting for a job but ultimately gave up and applied to grad school in the spring. She continued with school and we again shared an apartment in the fall. As far as I know, no more vampires plagued Jolliet, or at least if they did, the priest never involved us again.

7xognl,1,2018-02-15,Long vent of me complaining about my life,StoPeean,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7xognl/long_vent_of_me_complaining_about_my_life/,"Alright this is going to sound super whinny so sorry if I cause some eye rolls but I just wanna let it all out.

Both my parents are depressed. My mom manages it pretty well even with her Bipolar Disorder. My dad is pretty bad with it and he’s done said done and said some pretty mean things to me when I was younger, but I try to forgive him. I was a lil shit and he had a rough childhood too so I can kinda understand, but it doesn’t justify everything. And to add onto that he’s a hoarder so our house is disgusting 24/7.

I’m pretty sure I’ve had depression/general/social anxiety my whole life, the whole buy-one-get-one-free deal. I don’t remember what it’s like to not be depressed or if there even was a time I wasn’t depressed.

One of my first memories was in pre school and even that was depressing. I was super anxious to go to school, as always. My mom gave me a kiss goodbye and got some lipstick on my face. The kids asked if I was a girl because of it. It’s funny now but they didn’t stop there. They would hit me with those big plastic dinosaur toys till I cried, put dirt in my clothes, and shove me. Typical bullying stuff.

I was the punching bag for all of my “friends”. I call them that because we hung out and knew each other pretty well, but they were a really toxic influence on me. Every new “friend” circle I joined I was still always the punching bag. I usually tried to laugh it off because I thought that was what friends do. Plus it was either that or be the weird loner kid. I’m inherently shy so I was both the weird loner and the doormat kid-the worst of both worlds.

Some of the weirder toxic friends did pretty perverted things. This part is pretty gross so feel free to skip it. Anyways they would watch me pee in the urinals, take shits by looking under the stall, and squeeze my privates. I’m a dude. Both genders did that stuff. I still feel so violated years later and i think it caused me to feel extremely uncomfortable anytime someone  touches me and to have some real asocial behaviors.

They would also steal money, punch me, kick me, and sometimes choke me. I didn’t fight back because some of them were girls and I’m really against violence so I just kinda took it. I like to think it made me tough but I’m still just a lil bitch who won’t fight back. Those friends were so awful to me. I feel so emasculated and pathetic. The only time I fought back was when they insulted me, but they were pretty weak comebacks.

The fun didn’t stop at school. Remember what I said about my dad? Yup it was filthy because we never cleaned and I live with a hoarder. Like actually. It wasn’t just clutter, although we had a lot of that too, it was really dirty and gross. We only did the bare minimum of cleaning to not get sick but we should’ve done way more. I’ve never had a friend over and I’ve never lived in a clean house. It looked ghetto, but my family makes a decent amount, we just never bothered with maintenance so a lot of things were broken, old, and gross. You know those shows where there’s a house someone buys to renovate but at first it looks terrible and like someone could never live in there? Now imagine it filled with useless junk more dirt and people living in it. That’s my home.

Aside from never sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, or just taking decent care of our house, my family added pets to the mess, dogs and cats. We rarely walked the dogs and didn’t train them well so our pets are loud and cause the house to smell like animal and animal pee. On top of everything else. I feel bad for our pets. They deserve a better home and better owners. We do make sure they’re always fed however, but they should have a less crowded environment and we probably should’ve only had one pet. I hope they don’t mind the mess. They seem to like us so at least we have that.

My dad used to be an alcoholic, but he never completed AA. He gets enraged sometimes cause his body still wants alcohol so he lets it out on me. He would yell at me, curse at me, call me stupid, ground me for no reason, get up in my face, and just say mean things to make me cry. I don’t want to actually state them so just imagine insulting someone who you do not care about at all and maybe even resent a little. That’s basically what he did.

Like I said, my mom is bipolar so she had some manic episodes before she was diagnosed. She would not come home for days and sometimes just ignore me or push me aside when I needed help. I still think she’s an amazing mom and those things are all forgivable. My dad would blame me for when she went missing for a while or when they were arguing. He would say things like, “Mom isn’t here because she doesn’t want to deal with you and your shit”. 

I did not react to these things very well. I pretty much avoid socializing whenever possible and rarely leave the house or my room. I can’t even bring myself to get out of bed anymore and I miss a ton of school. Sometimes I don’t even leave my room to eat. I just zone out all day on video games or whatever. I think I pretty much ruined all my chances of being a functioning member of society. I feel like such a leech.

I’m no saint or an innocent victim. I’ve done bad things too. When I was younger I would say things like, “I hope you die” a lot to my sister or, “I wish I wasn’t part of this family. My aunts and uncles are way better parents. Fuck you.” My sister would respond with slapping me and I would pull her hair but That was just dumb sibling stuff. We have a great relationship now. I also threw a ton of temper tantrums and lashed out a lot at family. I feel guilty about this because I was just doing the same thing everyone else was doing to me: I was hurting them so I could feel better about myself. I’m no better, I just added more gasoline to a fire when I should’ve called the firefighters.

These past few months have been especially rough for me. I tried to kill myself by starvation. It kinda became surprisingly easy to skip meals. I only lasted about a week and lost 10 lbs while I’m already super skinny. My mom took me to a psych ward and I had to be in inpatient for a week. I honestly believe inpatient made me worst. The place was pretty sketchy, it felt like a prison and the staff was rude even though a lot of people there tried to kill themselves and the therapy we got was from untrained interns. 

As soon as I discharged I relapsed and had to go back to inpatient again, but this time I came back in handcuffs. Same stuff, I didn’t improve at all. Mental healthcare in America is just the worst. 

I’ve been out for a bit now, hopefully I won’t relapse again. I’m eating now at least, but I’m still isolating. I haven’t gone outside in a couple of days. And I haven’t gone to school in a couple of months. Starting home study soon, not sure if it’ll work. I have no motivation left. There’s just this constant, crushing feeling of fear, regret, guilt, loneliness, negativity, dread, and heartbreak. I don’t know if heartbreak is applicable but it seems like the best way to describe it, maybe a little over dramatic. 

I don’t see myself getting better after this. I don’t know if I want to put in the effort to get better. It’ll probably just lead to more disappointment and I don’t even know if getting better is possible. I’m scared I might just leech off of others the rest of my life because I’m too anxious to get a job and I can barely take care of myself. I want to have my own family and my own clean home and real friends but I see myself just making the same mistakes my dad made. Will those things even make me happy? Is it just what I think I want when I need something else? I think I need happiness and love but those are too vague and I can’t even put in the effort of finding them.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far."

7xq3y0,0,2018-02-15,"How do I (M,30) make a move on her (F,29) while she is still in a relationship?",SingleMess,datingoverthirty,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/7xq3y0/how_do_i_m30_make_a_move_on_her_f29_while_she_is/,"Hello everyone! I'm currently in a situation where I need some guidance (due to my lack of experience...). Also, when browsing through this subreddit I felt like this topic is not as much discussed as I would have expected for ‘over-30-dating’.

Let me begin by outlining the situation: 
At the end of last year, I was doing a three month internship at a company. I really enjoyed this internship, as the people in general were very nice and helpful... I learned a lot and actually had the best three months of my life (so far), despite the long working hours.
One of the reasons why I had such a good time is probably this one colleague, who I was sharing an office with (the ""HER"" this is all about ;) ). While at the beginning I wasn't interested in her at all (romantically), over time i realized what an amazing person she is and at some point realized that I had a crush on her. My mood would lighten up whenever she was present and I was missing something when she wasn't there. However, I felt like I had to get over her, since she seems way out of my league and I also learned about her boyfriend at some point. So after my internship ended, I just tried to get over my crush and actually made some progress, despite staying in contact with her.

However, last week there was Karneval here in Germany, and where I currently live it's celebrated quite heavily. She already asked me before if I wanted to join her and the rest of the office in their celebration one day, and of course I did! And the moment I met her there it all came back.. I really never experienced anything like it before. However, we spent most part of the evening together dancing, talking and drinking. At some point I got approached by a stranger (guy) asking me whether she was my girlfriend, and when I answered ""no"", he advised me to make a move, since she was clearly into me! But since all her colleagues were all around us it didn't seem like a good idea to make a move. Although I kind of regret it now ;) 

For the last week I've been thinking about nothing else but her and feel that I somehow need to grow a pair and reach out to her, just to get some closure!  However, I do not want to ruin it with her, because besides my current romantic interest, she is also a great human being I want to keep around. I feel like I actually might have a shot (which I usually never feel…) . 
I know that she still has her boyfriend, although there might be a very slight chance of her being single in a few months... but nothing I can rely on happening. 
So, the question is: How do you approach someone who's in a relationship? I feel that I need to somehow make her aware of my interest in her without appearing disrespectful of her current relationship status or being creepy.  

TL;DR: Fell for a coworker from an internship I did last year. She has a boyfriend. Decided that I need to make her aware of my interest in her in order to at least get some closure; How do I approach her without being disrespectful (i.e. ignoring her relationship status) and losing her as a friend?

Yes I am wanting to become a PI but I have on experience and no connections. I worked as a security guard for about a month back in 2001 but since then I have been in IT. I currently work as a sys admin in Georgia and I need to keep my full time 8am-5pm job. Is there anyway to intern or get credit towards the 2 year requirement in the evening working from home? From reading it seems like most of the job seems to be surveillance which I know I can not do from home but I was hoping there was some way to do something, paperwork, internet searches, anything from home to get that credit. Might be a stupid question but I just have no way to quit and dive into PI work. I support my family, all 5 of us, so I need my steady income until I can go into PI work full time. Is it possible?

7xs7zi,10,2018-02-15,Is this a pyramid scheme? Was contacted by a woman on LinkedIn.,BandWarrior,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/7xs7zi/is_this_a_pyramid_scheme_was_contacted_by_a_woman/,"I'm a college student and very happy in my current job, but I am also willing to take on an internship or anything like that in my last semester here, mostly because I don't want senioritis to get to me and my job does have limited hours. I am also just plain open to gaining experience in fields other than the one I'm about to enter. My attitude is very ""try everything.""

So this woman contacted me on LinkedIn saying she and her husband were looking for potential interns for their company and she saw that I had experience in IT and marketing, which would make me a good candidate. This led to a phone call where things got a bit suspicious for me. 

She started off with her personal story of how when she was an undergrad, she met her business mentor who was super qualified and taught her how to run her own business. Said mentor (Lauren) only asked for 6% of whatever company she would eventually start, and her willingness to pass on her teachings to other young college kids. The idea is that she and Lauren's other protégés would go out and essentially recruit college kids into this business coaching thing, where they would be taught how to start their own business by first starting one online on a platform similar to Amazon. The third and final requirement was that these college kids would only listen to Lauren, not their parents, regarding business advice. 

I asked her about the online business thing next. She basically told me that I would ""invest"" $200 or so into a product that was ""disposable"" and that people buy often, like makeup or toothpaste. I would market this product on an Amazon-like online platform and from there, learn how to business. I would not manufacture or choose what product I sell... they would do all that for me. 

So, is this a pyramid scheme? My gut says it is. The only thing that makes me unsure is that she mentioned nothing about recruiting others. Either way, I told her very firmly that my studies come first and ghosted her after she tried to push me into listening to these audio logs she sent to my spam email. "

I'm also working a bit with physics modeling/simulation, as well as FPGA development for digital pulse processing. Once I'm finished with my degree, I am primarily interested in pursuing academic or national lab work. I've already been exposed (during internships, research, lit reviews, and otherwise) to many situations where either C++ or Python has been used. 

So I'm curious, for those of you in the field: given a choice of one or the other, which of these codes would it be more beneficial to put time and effort into learning (or learning first), C++ or Python? For background, I primarily code in Matlab and I am well versed in VHDL, and I also have a minimal knowledge of C++ (as in I can code very simple things, can read simple code written by others)."

7xtj3l,108,2018-02-15,Me (19 F) with my (22M) boyfriend. He just dropped a bomb on me and I'm struggling to cope.,ali3712,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7xtj3l/me_19_f_with_my_22m_boyfriend_he_just_dropped_a/,"So long story but I (19F) have been with my (now ex I guess) boyfriend (21M) for about a year and a half now. He’s been drinking a lot lately, like every night really. And going out to the bars 3x a week. Which is fine, I mean he gets his college work done and we don’t live together but this past Sunday he was coming over and said he was grabbing us some beer on the way and it hit me that I hadn’t hung out with him sober since..well I couldn’t even remember. So I told him no thanks and when he came over I told him I was just concerned about how much he was drinking and that it was a bad habit to make. He agreed, although sullen. I wasn’t angry, I mean he had made me quit smoking cigarettes BC it was bad for my health so it was my turn to make sure he stayed healthy as well. 

But since that day he had been extremely distant with me. He would still ask to hang out but when we were together it was just like we were in the same space but not really hanging out. He would be on his phone, be short with me, etc. I noticed right away, asked what was wrong and he said he’s just been feeling blue lately. Ok, no problem. People feel blue from time to time so I gave him some space. I’ve been extremely busy this week anyways working 40+ hours, juggling nursing school, and getting all my work done by this Friday because I had bought us a cabin in Gatlinburg to celebrate Valentines and our Anniversary (which is on Valentine’s Day). I mean I have paid upwards of 300-400+ for this trip. So Valentines comes around and he asks if we can get dinner and if he can take me to Sephora and he let me pick out like $150 worth of things. So obviously he’s been distant but we must be ok if he’s putting this much effort, right? Wrong. I mean it’s only been four fucking days of him being down. We get back to my place and he’s back to short replies and playing a video game in my living room and every time I try to get near him he’s just pulling away. I mean he doesn’t like cuddling in general, but it’s Valentines/our anniversary so I tell him, “Hey I know your feeling down but I’ve had to initiate every kiss and hug today and it’s kind of an important day so I would appreciate some effort here.”

So later that night his friends call and stop by real quick and it was just a 180 in his attitude. He was back to himself, happy, and joking. And then when they left we went outside and he just went right back to being very cold towards me. And I think in that moment I realized that something was seriously wrong. 

So I ask him, must’ve been the millionth time, what’s wrong and that I loved dinner and I appreciate the presents but what I really want is him. And he just sits down and says that we don’t click anymore. He tells me he thinks that I just don’t, “Get his humor” and how he, “Can’t marry someone who doesn’t get him.” I’m stunned. I mean floored. We have had such an AMAZING relationship up till this point. Like hands down everyone looked up to us. And I’m asking him what he wants to do, that I can cut down on Work and we can set up days to actually get out of the house and go on adventures and he just says he doesn’t know anymore. Cue some silence of me quietly crying. He asks me to please say something and I don’t, and then says that he thinks he should go. I tell him I think that’s a good idea and that was that. 

So hello Reddit, I got dumped by my initially flawless boyfriend on Valentines/our anniversary/1 day before a huge expensive trip I had paid for for us/ 4 days before my fucking birthday. I spent last night bawling. My best friend is driving 5 hours to come stay with me in the fucking non refundable cabin I have booked and I am just in pieces. 

I don’t even know where it went wrong. I mean I was a wonderful girlfriend. We never fought, Ive been paying for everything for the past 6 months since he doesn’t have much money at the time, I have constantly doted upon him with  gifts, I’ve helped him all semester with school and his planner, I mean I can go on and on. And to end a year and a half relationship over such a BULLSHT excuse? 

The only thing that’s changed is last year I was partying with him and drinking and generally just going out every other night. I didn’t have a job, I was a bit reckless. And this year I really buckled down and got 3 jobs to afford a vacation (ironically BC he has an internship in Bangkok for 2 months this summer and I had planned on spending 2 weeks with him). I started nursing school and I only drink every few weeks now. Maybe he only really felt bonded to me when we were fucked up together? I don’t know. I’m grasping at straws. 

Since then he texted me “Hi” once to which I opened and didn’t read. He then texted me saying, “do you want to talk,” which I didn’t respond to. And he’s called me twice. To which I ignored both calls. I need space. I mean even if he comes back around, how do I forgive him for leaving me in just the absolute most cruel way I can think of. He’s changed his profile picture of us to just him and his friends and he stopped sharing his location with me. He's sent me a couple texts and called twice.
 I only replied once to his requests to talk saying, ""I need a few days and some space. But I do have to know, are you willing to work this out or are you just done?""

Him: ""I'm not sure yet. I hope you do know I care about you. I'm sorry Ali3712. I think a few days will be good for me to try and figure all of this out.""

Me: ""You left me on Valentines Day. On our Anniversary. Days before a huge non refundable trip that I have bent over backwards to make happen. And four days before my birthday. I love you. I really do. But I'll come to you when I'm ready to talk.""

Him: ""I thought you wanted me to go last night. I didn't want to have that conversation with you last night. I'm so sorry Ali3712. I love you too.""

I’m just stunned still. And angry. I need some kind words and advice.

 TL;DR Seemingly perfect relationship of a year and a half gets ruined when boyfriend tells me we, ""don't click"" and I ""don't get his humor"" on Valentines Day/our Anniversary leaving me to deal with my first heart break."

 Fast forward to this semester after getting to know her better, I decide maybe I should ask her out. 

Turns out she said she was waiting for me to ask her out last semester but I didn’t and some other guy decided to aak her out first. No apparently she is in on and off complicated relationship with this dude.

7xudsd,3,2018-02-15,Being relocated at same company with no pay increase. Should I be concerned?,accountawaythrowasdf,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7xudsd/being_relocated_at_same_company_with_no_pay/,"I started as an engineering intern at a small business contracting company in Northern Virginia and was hired as a full time engineer once I graduated with my BS in Mechanical Engineering. I will have been a full time employee with the company for 2 years this coming May. 

When I was given a full time offer the salary was $52000 with free healthcare with no overtime possible. I thought that this was rather low compared to what my classmates were getting offered. However, this was a work from home position so I thought that benefit and the healthcare was worth the lower salary. Six months ago, my boss decided that everyone had to start working in a office building. This came with no pay increase despite the change in work life, however I didn't think it to be much of an issue as it was only a 30 minute commute. At the beginning of this year, we started having to pay for our own healthcare. Again, I figured I had no reason to be upset about it because most people have to pay for it.

This week I was told that I will be getting moved to an on-site location in DC and would not be receiving a pay raise for it. This will literally triple my commute and I will have to pay for a parking pass for the facility. This position has considerably more responsibly than my current one. While the commute and extra responsibility will be highly stressful, the experience could greatly boost my career in the long term.

At this point I am not sure what to do. I can either suck it up and work at this new location without a pay increase, or begin looking at other positions closer to my home. The main issue I encounter if I try to leave and find a new job is the tuition reimbursement program I am in. I currently am in online school to get my masters in nuclear engineering and receive $5280 per year from my work to pay tuition. Classes are $3300 per course and after this semester, I will only have 4 left to take. The condition for this tuition reimbursement program is that I have to stay at the company for 3 years after the date of payment or I will have to repay the money that was given to me in the 3 years prior. At this point I would owe the company exactly $5280 if I were to leave, which would be difficult for me to pay. However I also believe that I could make a salary in the upper 60s if I were to find a new position.

Thoughts on what I should do?

Thank you.

I thought what I was feeling was normal and that I was too inadequate and stupid to handle college. 
I'm in my third year in a competitive engineering major and all my classmates are high achieving. I overhear them talking about the research they do in labs and the internships they have lined up. My only friend tells me about all the internship offers he's gotten. 
Due to my depression, I have a relatively low GPA (3.0), making it pretty much impossible to get any meaningful experience. Companies hiring for interns want to see lab experience, but professors won't take you into a lab with a low GPA. 

Basically my depression has ruined any chance of me being successful. I graduate next year and I feel like there's no chance for me. My motivation for trying in classes is falling exponentially. I go to a world class research university and I'm wasting it doing the bare minimum. All the ambitions and dreams I had when I started had withered in simply wanting a job once I graduate.
Counselling helps a little, but the ramifications of my mental illness are going to continually curse me

In high school, I worked my ass off while maintaining a fantastic GPA, maintaining strong friendships (few that are still equally as strong 6 years post graduation), did all those vital extracurriculars (even a rather prestigious one that I earned explicitly through merit).

That hard work earned me acceptance to 10/11 schools I applied to and a nearly full ride (90%) to a private university that was my dream choice. 

In college, I held at least 1 job and 1 internship from sophomore year until graduation. Every single semester, I worked at least 2 jobs that means. Beyond that, I also babysat for professors and worked as a personal assistant to keep myself financially afloat. Yes, I had a small chunk of student loans out but I wasn't living off of them, I **had** to work. 

And I still graduated university with a pretty good (not great) GPA despite hardly ever sleeping in between this wild thing I call life.

Needless to say, I'm nearly 2 years post grad from university and my future is constantly at the forefront of my mind.

**I should have never started dating you**

I regret it.

Not because of anything you did. Not at all. But because for a minute, those fresh love hormones and whirlwind feelings almost swept me away from my dreams. 

I've always tried to be honest with myself.

Men/love can wait. 

But my dreams... What I have literally been working my whole life towards... I can't lose sight of that just because I find you funny, hilarious, and attractive.


I don't have the luxury of having family that has any wealth or that can help me out.

You have that luxury and that's wonderful... Your parents are supporting you all the way through your Master's degree... You still get an allowance from them and that's fine... But that is not my reality. 

All the connections I make, all the opportunities I get/achieve are through my own hard work. And that's that. That's just how it is. 

I don't really mind it... Obviously, it's not always easy but I am extremely proud of my achievements.

I have had some **amazing** internship opportunities in NYC and although I screwed up things at my 1st career job post-grad, I've pulled myself back up (after a brief but powerful bout of depression), and have been working hard to get back to where I need to be.

I just bought my first ever car thanks to my phenomenal credit rating that I've been working to grow since I was 19/20. 

I'm starting to take some online courses just to keep my mind spry.

I just earned a part-time job in an amazing role at a great company that is a **big deal** in my field of work. If I work my ass off, in a year or less I could be made full-time and see promotions that will see me achieve my biggest dream.

In the meantime, I want to go to grad school. I crave a master's degree. Hell, I would LOVE to get my doctorate.

But to do that, I need money. And the only way to make money is to have a job. Yes, I **could** get funded for my degree but I'm not banking on that. 

I need alternative solutions in order to flourish. 

Yes, I have a shitty part-time job in retail but I didn't work my ass off my whole life to end up here. It's been helpful in saving for a down payment, insurance, and odds + ends, but beyond that... Hell no. HELL no. 

It grates on me that you're putting a timeline on my career growth/personal growth. You won't wait for me to get my career in a good place in 1-2 years. You won't wait for me to get my Master's degree. You absolutely refuse to consider me getting my doctorate. I respect that... You're 26 and you're from a culture that sees marriage/children as a key piece to one's life. 

I don't want to hurt you with this decision.

But this won't work out.

And that's why we're breaking up.

And I'm sorry I hurt you.

And I'm sorry I let myself get swept up and away by our romance, but I have to do what's best for me. 

I cannot let my dream die.

I am terrified that it's all going to blow up, and I'll die in poverty, mediocrity, and isolation. It's likely my perfectionistic inner critic going off on me again, its just hard to think through the anxiety. It feels like there is so much more to do, but I don't know where to start.

tl;dr: anxious about future prospects, trying to get my life in order while making decisions about my higher education. Feel out of control and anxious.

7xvioi,14,2018-02-15,This is a living hell,unhappypatient,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/7xvioi/this_is_a_living_hell/,"All of it. 

If you are unemployed  for a long enough time, you are denied training; skill within your market; income, including that which might be paid to acquire new skills; and thus, the tools to...seek employment. To write cover letters; to relate to interviewers; to become *employable*. If you are not midlevel in any field by a certain age, you're a piece of shit to every employer who indulges you with an interviewer. Shit, if you're entry level b/c you're changing a career and your background is not transferable - same thing. 



Every day is filled with black terror. I don't really think of myself as a human being anymore. I think of every breath I take, every doctor's appointment, every mistake (every decision is a mistake), every experience of physical discomfort and potential need for medical care, every exchange with human beings - imagining their lives, their jobs, their pasts, their wages, their desperation as I buy cheap food or waste money on a temporary distraction - every day I'm still alive is tallied in a series of shitty, low quality purchases, as bargain bin and shitty as the jobs I'm forced to take. I think of my life in dollar amounts - minimum wage, with someone else pocketing the difference. 

My mother used to tell me I was a piece of shit who would never get the most basic of office jobs and mocked me when I agonized over resumes and applications. She'd go back and forth between that and shrieking YOU HATE EVERYTHING! or that I fail everything when I applied in person to shit retail jobs with no mobility (but I did  - eventually, of course, they tell you to apply online). 

She forced me into childcare right after college - I lost five years while still applying and the market for older candidates shrank, having never really acquired experience outside early childhood ed. I went to a horrible program for my degree, too. I left in good standing - but in all that time, two waves of job candidates have graduated and interned and been recruited, while I got older and have yet to have ever lasted longer than a month or two in the lowest possible office jobs, earning 15/hour to the 25 and change the little brats I rely on for gigs earn.

Every failure, every rejection, my complete unemployability now, and and the *horrible* experience of having my life in the hands of 22 year old recruiters who hold my same stupid fucking stupid liberal arts degree and are earning 50,000/year as a starting salary while they send me for two week long jobs here and there is a joke to my mother or a ""choice"". It was not. I cannot choose to give myself a job, or have the experience expected of me in the most entry level jobs I can find, that which I'll be competing with 1,000 more experienced, younger candidates.

I do not know what path to follow to go back to school and was not a good student as an undergrad; I'm terrified I will make another stupid, expensive choice attached to continuing ed (quickbooks, medical billing and coding, electronic health records - all horseshit) attached to no job placement and have lost even more time and income. 


In a city where the entry level positions I'm qualified for are going to go to attractive, bubbly, well connected new grads directly recruited from campuses or by friends, I have less than nothing going for me and my resume and cover letters are total pieces of shit because the only jobs I've ever done, really, are data entry or seasonal, low level jobs in dumpy places. 

In the last eight years since I've graduated I've easily applied to thousands of jobs and 80% of my interviews were with horrible recruiting agencies that take my resume and never call again, primarily calling me in the hopes of finding out who employed me as a temp to cultivate leads. 

I am a burden on my friends.I have to lie about my entire life, just so as to be allowed to passively join them for *their* weddings, their house warming parties, their lives - to not lose them completely, not just yet. 

The jobs they had with less experience and lower degrees than me in their early 20s, I probably couldn't get if I went back to school. 

I am trapped and humiliated and more than anything else, I wish I could just kill myself. I've stayed alive for the last horrible decade for my family; but I hate them. They bring me no comfort; the hatred I feel for them, the bitter resentment at the prospect of pain and sorrow I no longer feel they deserve to claim, and the overwhelming powerless hatred I feel for myself is a poison I swallow every day. And now, I am the wretchedly self-fulfilled prophecy of their ignorance, my cowardice and stupidity, and their deep, *deep* contempt for their stupid, ugly, cowering daughter, someone who would have been fated for a steep climb professionally even if I hadn't made such dumb fucking choices in school. I was sick during and after my time as an undergrad, pushed into a horrible career path by my parents immediately, and had to figure out how to even write a fucking resume and get some relevant volunteer experience by myself. 

That was a very painful time of doubt and strife, a punishment unto self - that punishment never stopped. I have never stopped paying for being who I am; I was young, stupid, a poor stupid, and too ignorant to know how to get job experience. 

I am the same, only much older, and the job market in my city is a stone maze with no exist for someone like me. You need experience to get experience; I have none of value in a sea of technically-engaged, attractive, fresh young candidates, so that's that. My last was probably 2012. 

I can't believe I've spent nearly a decade like this.

My father had to bust his ass to help network my younger brother and his excellent GPA and internships into a decent finance job, but he did it. Meanwhile he let my mother railroad into a field where you get a master's to earn 35,000 a year for 12 hour days if you're lucky enough to get anything other than a fucking teaching assistant job. 

It was all too late, and it's all worthless to interviewers. It's *disgusting*, desperate, and pathetic. 

So am I. 

 If I ever get a job it's going to be someplace horrible - more badly run offices, where I'm treated like detritus; a call center where I'm basically the consolation prize for the machine my employers would prefer to hire, if only they could (strong metrics and no need to pay those!); a horrible customer service or admin job that pays 12/hour in a dump without central air or a closing front door, with no mobility and management from the bowels of hell. And worse, if I need to be trained to do something, if I make a mistake b/c a senior employee gives me bad information or I'm missing something, or if I make a mistake I correct immediately - it doesn't matter. Some employees can do that as part of their work, and be kept; I walk in the door garbage, so instead of being given the benefit of the doubt, I'm fired. The only jobs I can get are with people I do not want to work for, who give no feedback in companies I would never choose to work for - and though I smile, am polite, make small talk, take notes, and am eager to work - I fuck it up being myself. I fuck it up, because I have spent all of these years without acquiring experience. I fuck it up, because the companies are horrible, so small there's no training, and horribly run, or else, I am an older candidate in a role designed for fast hiring and firing who has never advanced or been taught the skills to be more. (Inevitably, people will infer who I am on reddit is who I am in the office - quite the opposite. Doesn't matter on this board, does it.) 

I have no real friends, no self-respect, have never taken a vacation as an adult, no partner, no assets, and have never succeeded at anything that mattered to me; the only dream I though might be vaguely realistic in life was obtaining and being worthy of a reasonably respectful, decent paying job someplace where my coworkers and employer treated me well and gave me opportunities for advancement, like every single person in my high school and likely graduating college class. 

I wish I were dead. It vibrates in every cell and permeates all my organs. I know it better than I know anything. I knew it since my last horrible junior and senior years of college. Every fucking day I wake up and wonder what awful thing might happen to me, because no efforts I've made to make this *stop* have done anything but lead to more humiliation. "

It’s at about 230,000 miles, the A/C being on causes the engine to overheat, and the check engine light comes on every so often (cylinder 6 misfire).

Like the title says, I’ll graduate this December and I’ll also have an internship over the summer to start saving money. My parents advice would be to buy a used car for $5,000 - $8,000, drive it until it dies, and then repeat. 

For that price range what would be the reasonable life span of a car? Would it be more worth my money to get a newer car and take out a little credit if I’m confident I can pay it back in 3-5 years? Regardless of that, what would be a good target goal to save to?

Extra info: I’m graduating with a dual major in Computer Science and Cyber security, and I’m not too concerned about getting a job, so that’s the starting salary I’d be working with. My parents won’t give me any financial advice beyond what comes from the mouth of Dave Ramses so I want to reach out and get more input so I can be as ready as I can be when the time comes. I’ve used a credit card all through cllleve and paid the balance in full every month so I should have decent credit as well. "

First of all, I want to say that I love being single. I'm not actively looking for a relationship at all but the truth is that if the right person under the right circumstances came along I'd change my mind. However, all of my gay/bi acquaintances have had relationships trough apps, going to gay bars or just being in the ""gay scene""; things I do not have the interest of doing. Also I never flirt at all and when someone does flirt with me I'm super oblivious and don't realise it till months later. I don't have any experience and therefore I'm also not interested in hook-ups or fwb. My schedule is quite occupied with college and an internship so I rarely go out at night, because I prefer to rest. I'm also very introverted and never make the first move to go and make friends, but once they do I am friendly as well.

With all of this in consideration, has anyone simliar in my situation found love? Please tell me your love story"

I guess I wanted to just send this into the void on the off chance that I’d cross paths with some other lost soul. It’s basically a dissertation on my fuck-ups so feel free to skip to the end. 

Let’s set the scene: I’m 21, living in a city, going to a top-rated school. All my friends are rich kids who’ve never made a real mistake. These facts on paper might make me seem lucky, but after that acceptance letter came in my luck ran dry. The past 3 years have been like Lemony Snicket books- A Series of Unfortunate Events. 

I ended up not really fitting in freshman year, so I got depressed, wrote a note, and left campus. It was reported all over the news. I couldn’t upset my family so I decided to come back and stick things out. The first year was hell on earth. I lost all the fake friends I’d had. Nobody invited me to parties, and my little breakdown was the talk of the town. During this time my grades dropped, because I hated going to class and facing them. 

The next year was pretty shitty as well, until I met a boy. Details are irrelevant, experiences speak for themselves. I was running on automatic before I came to know him....going through the motions and trying to pretend I was still alive. Nobody understood me, or even wanted to understand me. I was misrepresented by almost everyone, so I gave up even bothering to fight a losing battle. The one night I decided to get out and meet people, I met him. We didn’t have a romantic connection, but immediately something was different. The barrier couldn’t hold...we were on the same wavelength. The walls fell down because they had no foundations. For the first time in years, I was at ease. We didn’t have to calculate the right formula- we could just exist. It was so natural, his presence, so right. He wanted to know me- that was refreshing. But I wanted to know him too. Something about his aura reeled me in, during a period of time when I’d long ago stopped allowing myself to want. For some reason I felt like it was okay to shatter the forbidden glass, to step forward, to want. 

I invited him on a walk to explore his mind and he ended up asking me out on a dressy date- me, suicide note girl! We talked for 4 hours, so long that the waiter had to kick us out. I caught myself smiling again- this was the first flower bud emerging through a long-barren landscape. We ended up dating, sharing our worlds. He told me he loved me, I returned the sentiment, we cried. This experience was, for someone as lonely and alienated and fucked up as me, truly a miracle. He changed me. It was like a blind man seeing a sunset, for the first time since his childhood. But one day I went blind again... or maybe someone blindfolded me. He broke up with me- no official reason. It was a profound loss that I still feel today. I loved him. I was ready to spend the rest of my life with him- live out all our plans. The sort of love I felt for him, I don’t know if I’ll ever feel again. I wrote a poem about what the relationship did for me, which got published. But I don’t think it did as much for him, because as of recent, he’s dating someone else. 

I tried to cope, however I could. I made a handful of friends. I started trying to change my major. I did an internship, mostly thanks to Adderall. Summer was a mirage...amphetamine-tranced afternoons in cubicles, weekends on the run. I spent all of them going on road trips with some people I’m still close with, and some I’m not. Fall was a blur. Busting my ass to transfer out of my program, and not much else. Falling out with some of my friends. Inheriting some money, letting it slip through my hands as I attempted to escape myself through possessions. 

And now a year has passed. Where did it go? While I was trying to snap out of my daze the world completed its rotation. I was treading water while everyone else was doing Olympic laps. I don’t have a summer internship lined up. I’m graduating next year and I have no idea what I’m doing with my life. Everyone’s in a relationship suddenly (my ex, for one) but I don’t know if I ever will be. I’ve aged rapidly. Maybe it’s the Adderall, maybe it’s the depression, maybe it’s both. I look like I’m about 32, but my bank account doesn’t. I spent 80% of the money, and the part I invested may never yield me anything substantial. I don’t know what I wanted, I think I believed that if I bought the right outfit someone would make me their muse again. 

But it never happened. I don’t have a specific problem. I think it’s just an existential lack. I don’t know if there’s anything left for me out there. Maybe I was never pretty, but if I was, it’s over now. I want to discover love like what I knew before. I don’t know if I still believe in magic, but I still hope I’ll stumble upon it when no one’s watching. I’ve been blind for a year, and the sunset is fading from my memory, but not the warmth it cast upon me. 

It’s not all about romance- I have class anxiety too. Everyone is securing their place in the world and lining up their salaries. And me, I’m just fucking around and questioning myself. Half of the time I live in the past, so I guess I forgot to protect my future. 

A year and a half ago I saw horizons. The world that encompassed me and the future before me seemed full of possibilities. I knew I couldn’t do everything, but I was sure that I could do something. And now everyone’s moving on and rising to greatness. They have stable relationships. They have Wall Street gigs. They have a clean record, not a murky past. Most of all, there’s no articles about their depression on google. 

There are so many celebrity train wrecks that are manufactured and torn down in our sexist atmosphere. The “crazy bitch” is a trope that’s ingrained in the cultural consciousness. It seems a woman can’t have mental health issues without being transformed into a caricature. Sometimes I worry that nobody else will ever dare to love me. That I have too much baggage, and not enough beauty to make carrying it worth the strain. Sometimes I worry that I’ll never have a real job. That I’ll end up with no money, struggling to live on my own, while everyone else counts each pretty dime of their 70k starting salary. I feel lost. I feel like a failure, and like it’s too late, and like nobody cares in the first place. Oh and I’m black, as if that helps! Depression already makes you less respectable for some, but the intersection of depression and blackness must trigger the fear of the unknown, for quite a lot of people. I just don’t seem to make sense in American society. I’m a freak, and to some, even dangerous. I don’t see my white picket fence, my smiling husband, my house in the suburbs. All I see, now and until the end of time, is alienation, fear, loneliness, and regret. It consumes me sometimes, until I can’t even distinguish it from myself. 

I wanna climb out of it all, but I’m afraid that my time is up. Success is a door that’s about to slam. I don’t know what to do...I don’t know how to be desirable, to men or to society or to anyone, really. I crave security- existential fulfillment, the reliable paycheck, someone to fall asleep and wake up next to. But it all seems like it’s not meant for people like me. 

I’m profoundly out of sync, so I guess I’m just throwing my thoughts out into the universe, for the sake of exposing this surreal continuum of emptiness, and perhaps making myself a little bit realer

7xwolq,37,2018-02-16,The Fate of Wargame,SwordOfInsanity,wargame,https://www.reddit.com/r/wargame/comments/7xwolq/the_fate_of_wargame/,"Given the current employee strike against Eugen, and ongoing suspicions of the company's financial state, many of us fear the consiquences for WG:RD - Server Shutdown, this could likewise be true for SD44. Many of us ravished the poor performance of SD44's release last year; presuming Eugen would return to providing continued support/DLC upon the proven success of WG:RD to maintain a revenue stream. However Eugen has persisted; Likey based upon contractual obligation to Paradox, to support a failing SD44. 

When the fiscal state of Eugen was assed last year;
https://www.reddit.com/r/wargame/comments/6zj17a/eugen_systems_fiscal_review/

We assumed bankruptcy would be imminent, however continued holiday sales and perhaps financial support from Paradox has kept the company afloat until today. The ongoing scandal of undercuttung salaries and cycling through minimal pay intern's reveals the company's desperate need to cut costs to maintain its operations. With Eugen liabel for lawsuit in French courts, (A battle easily in favor of the Strikers) the company's fate would be sealed; Liquidation. The most important matter in this process for the WG community would be the server stability and inheriting party upon court settlement. Further concerns would the likely choices made by Eugen's Devs, Paradox, Focus, and any initiative we as a community could take.

We should address the following questions:

1) What will Paradox do now that Eugen is involved in this wage scandal+unable to honor it's development contract. Will Paradox distance itself from Eugen due to unethical behavior, perhaps voiding it's contract and filing suit against Eugen?  Would Paradox attempt to support Eugen, Financially/Legally, by providing them either with sufficient funds to cover the eventual finacial judgement against employees, and further granting them a line of credit to rehire staff/maintain contractual obligation? Eugen claims another product is current under development for Paradox, would Paradox support this product to completion, or does the Publisher have a history of abandoning failing studios? 

2) If Eugen files bankruptcy and must be liquidated; who will inherit thier Intelectual Property Rights? Currently the WG series IP is a 50/50 partnership between Eugen and Focus. Presumably, the SD44 IP is a 50/50 Partnership between Eugen and Paradox. If strikers are successful in their court greviances they can either request compensation be seized from Eugen''s Assets (basically the only thing worth a damned are both the SD44 and WG IPs), or more likely, Eugen's assets would be liquidated by the courts (a very long process), where the IP shares would be auctioned off and the proceeds paid to compensate legal costs+missing wages.

3) Presumably Paradox could simultaneously file suit against Eugen for breech of contract (failure to deliver X-number of products) and reclaim total rights to SD44. The would mitigate any server downtime for SD44 MP as hopefully Paradox would want to maintain responaibilty for the products image/servers.

4) What choices does Focus Home Interactive have upon Eugen's liquidation? Presumably their 50% rights to the WG IP would be completely worthless if a Dev studio wasn't attached to support MP servers. Likewise with only 50% of the rights, whatever further steam sales of WG would have to be held in an escrow fund at Focus' expense, as Focus not wholly entitled to the proceeds. Could liquidation of Eugen mean a breech of partnership, that Focus could also file suit to totally aquire the IP to WG? If Focus becomes the complete owner of the WG IP; would they provide continued server support/sequels, or does their company history also show them in favor of abandoning older games regardless of popularity?

 5) What are the chances of the free market aquiring either/both the WG and SD44 IPs? Perhaps upon Liquidation, neither Paradox or Focus wish to obtain total IP ownership of these products (unwilling/able to find a Dev studio to continue the support), and instead offer to sell their remaining shares to the new partial owners-assuming they'd accept. What histories do either Focus or Paradox have of relinquishing IPs, or would this be a financially viable option. What are the chances of liquidated IPs being aquired by active Dev studios? Many publishers can simply aquire rights for cheap at an auction, cash in on limited sales and provideven zero further support, while other may have interest in continuing a successful product- are there examples we can find of this?

6) Assuming the above,  what are the chances that the WG community could aquire the WG rights for cheap?

7) What steps can we take; letters to either Focus, Paradox, Eugen Devs, or even Eugen themselves, to ensure preservation of MP servers for WG, and perhaps a possible renewal of the series?

I entered a general degree in science, hoping I would stumble upon something I was passionate about, aka 'find my calling'. In second year I chose to specialise in Neuroscience (to be honest a larger-than-I'd-like-to-admit factor in my choosing was how fancy it sounded to say I study Neuroscience). However, as I progress deeper and deeper into the mind-numbingly technical and niche aspects of the degree (cell signalling - KILL ME), I've completely lost interest and nothing about the content I'm studying excites me. I'm still performing moderately well, and maintaining a respectable GPA, but I'm at a complete loss with what I want to pursue after graduation.
Options: 
- I thought there would be more of a psychological aspect to the subject content I would be studying, and I think thats why I chose it in the first place - however, there's hardly (if none) at all. I'm wondering if I would enjoy a grad course in a more psychology-based setting (such as cognitive neuroscience)? (BUT THEN WHAT???)
- I'm becoming increasingly more attracted to the idea of science journalism and communication. I've always loved writing, and find myself on a daily basis (when I should be studying!!) reading article after article, ranging from the obscure to the most topical. I think being paid to write about my interests and passions would be like a wet dream for me lol. And I would definitely enjoy writing about science - believe it or not from this post, I used to be enthralled by science! It was always my favourite subject at school, and I would definitely be content writing about it. The MAJOR con of this is, well, the salary. In Ireland where I am, the average annual salary is 20 grand (24972.80 dollars). Don't get me wrong - I am not and never have been motivated by a big pay check; I would much rather love my job than have a big house or fancy car. But I also don't want to throw away four years of extremely hard work in such a difficult field for extremely mediocre pay and bad prospects in terms of job vacancies. 
So here I am - at a complete loss. Everyone around is applying for summer internships to work in labs and I can't think of anything worse than spending my summer months pipetting and blotting. Some, ANY, help would be extremely appreciated. "

I've read up on the world of advertising and it really interests me.
___
I've had a string of engineering internships, decided I didn't like it, started reading Campaign/IPA/WARC, and have had a little experience (around a week) in agencies and am still interested.

I like coding (MATLAB) and analysis and I like being creative (I've got experience in Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere - but not the level of an art schooler). 
___
My query is in 3 parts: role, agencies, digital:

**ROLE:** 
It seems my interests/skills best suit strategy or insights/analytics. I've learned a bit of Google Analytics but do people appreciate Python/Javascript knowledge?

**AGENCIES:** agencies seem to be getting squeezed a bit right now and 90% of entry-level jobs are account execs (which sounds pretty rough from this subreddit). Throwing that in with the work-life balance thing, makes client-side seem more attractive...

**DIGITAL:** it seems digital (especially mobile), is quickly becoming the future. It might be on par with traditional media right now, but I'm guessing it will eventually take over a huge chunk of client budgets.
___
Basically, given a cross-section of me, I think digital, client-side, insight role seems best suited for me. Would love a second opinion though from people who know more - would love a job coding and being creative. 

Thank you all, r/advertising has been a massive help to me in a confusing time.

7xz6f5,6,2018-02-16,Will be graduating college in December and will be wanting/needing a new car around then. Looking for advice.,SegFaultHell,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7xz6f5/will_be_graduating_college_in_december_and_will/,"I currently have a 1999 Crown Vic but I fear it may be nearing its end. It’s at about 230,000 miles, the A/C being on causes the engine to overheat, and the check engine light comes on every so often.

Like the title says, I’ll graduate this December, and I’ll also have an internship over the summer to start saving money. My parents advice would be to buy a used car for $5,000 - $8,000, drive it until it dies, and then repeat. Most cars in that price range have 90,000+ miles already and would not be described as my first choice in a car. It feels like you're trading in better mpg and newer features for the sake of not making monthly payments.

I feel like it might be worth it to get a newer used car (2015 - 2017) with under 20,000 miles. The only financial advice I'd get from my parents is whatever comes from the lips of Dave Ramses, which isn't a bad thing, but it's definitely a bit one sided.

I'm looking for general advice and what I should start doing now/over the summer to plan and be ready when it's time to get a new car. Also, any advice on buying outright for $8,000 vs buying newer on credit, max of 5 years but ideally pay it off in 3. Obviously credit is bad, but for something I'd use a minimum of 5 days a week, I don't want to cheap out and get a car I don't like as much that's already well into its life if there's better value over time in a newer car.

Extra info: I’m graduating with a dual major in Computer Science and Cyber security, and I’m not too concerned about getting a job in that field. I’ve used a credit card all through college and paid the balance in full every month so I should have decent/good credit. I'll be getting married the June following my graduation, and ideally we'd be looking at houses sometime between March and August depending on a few factors."

I don't know where else to go. the relationship reddit is so toxic to people with BPD so I can't post there. I don't even know if anyone will read this. It will be too long. But I'm tired of talking to my friends about my life because all I freaking do is complain and ask for help because I'm so miserable and depressed all the time (bipolar cycles with bpd are terrible).

I just feel so devastated. I had a talk with my bf and FP (who also has bpd) and just... I feel like it's over. We are parting ways geographically come March 31st cause I'm graduating and moving in with my parents until I can move into residence at the campus for my post-grad program and for financial reasons. He still needs to live by his school. We've been living together for 3 years so that also doesn't help. We've also been together for 7, since high school. Both our first loves. Although he says he's fallen out of love and trying to find it again.

But yeah, we had a talk. These past two weeks have been the first time he's wanted to kill himself not out of hatred for himself but out of the immense pain he's felt. Learning about his biological family and identity crisis. I've been very sick with a cold the past two weeks and havent been able to do much and that's part of what showed him one of the reasons our relationship is rocky. Basically some of the things are as follows:

the fact that he needs someone as strong or stronger than him and he sees that I'm trying and I say that I'm trying but I'm not doing. One example really upset me. He said when he needs help he really wants help dealing with the problems and not just questions and me validating him. Yet... Months ago he said it was so frustrating when I'd try to help him solve his problems because people need people there, not trying to solve the situation. And I told him that, I told him I've done both and he just resorted to ""I guess we're just incompatible with communication"".

He wants help but he won't tell me how to help him. He knows how to help me and I've known him for 7 years but literally, out of all the people I've helped in my past, he's the one person that is still hard to decipher especially cause he's changed (for the better/confidence/motivation/etc) the past few years. And has always been reclusive and has sometimes where he's hard to read. or some things work sometimes, then they don't work. 

I ask him, ""What do you need"" because communication and clearly I'm doing something wrong. And he just says, ""I don't know, thats for you to figure out"". And I'm trying. I'm trying so hard but it's not enough. He says I do all these nice things like make him food and drawings and cards and be there, physical affection, etc. But he says he doesn't feel like he can rely on me, like I won't sacrifice anything for him. I have in the past but I guess I can't remember any recent times where I have or been able to. Like a few nights ago I said I'd make dinner which he really needed cause he was having a terrible day at work during a shitty week and i was so sick that i couldnt see straight so i didnt, and it upset him.

He also said that when I'm sick it feels at times that I just ride it out and don't do anything. He said he's trying not to judge but when he's been sick (albeit for like, a day, still bad tho), he still went to work and class and did responsibilities, but he feels like I just didn't even really try to do anything.

Just everything. I've had this deep pit every time I do something wrong that it makes our relationship go deeper and deeper. I know both of us are severely depressed and the pushing away got really bad when he fell under to depression but I still know a lot is my fault and I guess we aren't incompatible anymore? I don't know. A HUGE reason why I've been pushing through with my depression is so I can help him but that doesn't matter. We still have times of affection and hugging and kissing but he still can't say he loves me again.

He even said for a bit he was contemplating asking about an open relationship so he could meet people. Which makes no sense in his logic cause he's like, ""I don't want to sleep around with people, just meet people"". And I know he doesn't lie to me, he's the most honest person I know, but I don't think he knows what that means. He says he's over that idea now though. Just everything last night is really what mattered. To top it off he decided to talk to me about it when I was half asleep and these serious conversations always happen at night when we are both home and calm from work and my medication kicks in to make me tired, so I could barely reply. Which adds to the fact that I'm probably not good enough.

I just don't know what to do. I'm trying so hard and I keep falling under. I even had to take a week and a half off of my internship due to an impending mental breakdown then my cold. Everything is falling apart more and more and nothing gets better. I love him so much. He means everything to me. We wouldn't be who we are today without each other. But now I feel it's inevitably going to be over once our lease is up. He says he doesn't want to make any big decisions now but that's how he feels. I know for a fact that if this ends, I never want to love again. I never will. It's too much. Like I know it's cliche but he is literally the only person I can ever picture being with. EVERYTHING about him that makes who he is, I love. I probably sound ridiculous. I don't know. 

I'm sorry to post all of this. I don't care if nobody reads it. I'm just so lost and my relationship's demise is no doubt pending. I'm not strong enough despite trying, and I don't know anything anymore. Just when I thought my depression was lessening too, everything is back full force.

7xzdrc,1,2018-02-16,Parasitic worms found in a woman's eye - first case of it's kind (natgeo),make_mind_free2go,HighStrangeness,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/7xzdrc/parasitic_worms_found_in_a_womans_eye_first_case/,"""An Oregon woman’s infection marks the first time on record that an eye worm species normally found in cattle has been seen in humans.

Abby Beckley was salmon fishing in Alaska when she felt something in her left eye.

“It felt like when an eyelash is poking you,” she says. But try as she might, the 26-year-old couldn’t find a hair—or anything else—in her eye. The feeling wouldn’t go away, and after about five days, Beckley was frustrated.

“So one morning, I woke up and I was like, If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to get whatever the heck is in my eye out of there,” Beckley says. She screwed up her courage, pulled back her eyelid, pinched the inflamed skin underneath, and gave it a yank.

When she looked down, she says, “there was a worm on my finger.”

Beckley is now the first person in the world known to have been infected with a particular species of eye worm. Called Thelazia gulosa, the parasitic worm had been seen in cattle eyes—a normal pit stop in its life cycle—but never before in a human’s.

What’s more, hers is only the 11th human case of Thelazia eye worms of any species in recorded U.S. history. The last known case, researchers report today in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, happened more than 20 years ago.

SHOW YOURSELVES

Beckley didn’t know any of that as she stared at the worm on her finger in the summer of 2016. The small, nearly transparent creature wriggled for a few seconds, then died. She had seen similar-looking worms in salmon, so Beckley wondered if she’d somehow accidentally transferred one to her eye. But then more worms started to appear, and it became clear this was a bigger problem.

“I was just pulling them out, so I knew there were a lot,” she says.

Beckley had pulled five more worms from her eye by the time she made it to a doctor in Ketchikan, Alaska. The doctors there were “legitimately freaked out,” Beckley says, but they didn’t know what the worms were or if they were dangerous.

Worried about the proximity of the creepy-crawlies to her brain, Beckley decided to return to Portland, where her boyfriend’s father, a doctor, prepared the medical staff at Oregon Health &amp; Science University for her arrival.

At the hospital, “they basically rolled out the red carpet,” Beckley says. Doctors and interns gathered, hoping to see the rare eye worms. They seemed a bit skeptical at first, she says, and suggested that maybe what had looked like a worm to her was really just mucus.

But Beckley kept insisting that there were worms in her eye: “I kept thinking, Show yourselves! You have to show yourselves!” she says. For the next half hour, she sat with hospital staff staring into her eye, waiting for a worm to appear.

“I’ll never forget when the doctor and the intern saw it wiggle across my eye,” Beckley says. “He freaked out and jumped back, and was like, Oh my god, I saw it! I just saw it!”

As for Beckley, “she handled it all with remarkable grace and stride, and is incredibly strong,” says Erin Bonura, the infectious disease specialist at OHSU who treated her.

MYSTERY WORM

Ophthalmologists managed to snag one of the worms from Beckley’s eye, although it broke in half, and they sent the pieces to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

That worm and several more pulled from her eye made their way to Richard Bradbury, who leads the CDC’s Parasitology Reference Diagnostic Laboratory, the nation’s primary resource for identifying rare parasites. They analyzed nearly 6,700 mystery samples last year alone.

“When you don’t know what it is, it ends up on our table,” Bradbury says.

“All these parasites are rare, and this one is extremely rare,” says of Beckley’s eye worm. He had to dig out a German research paper from 1928 to finally identify the species as Thelazia gulosa, making it the third species of Thelazia to turn up in a human eye, along with a species in Asia and one in California.

The worms are carried by face flies, which feed on the tears of cattle, horses, and dogs; you may have seen them persistently buzzing around an animal’s eyes. If you can get over the horror of eye worms and face flies, they’re a fascinating example of parasite survival.

First of all, Bonura says, eye worms can’t survive without face flies. The worm larvae can mature only inside a face fly’s digestive tract and organs, and then they find their way to the fly’s mouthparts. When the fly lands on an eyeball and begins to drink tears, the late-stage worm larvae climb out of the fly’s proboscis and onto the eye. There, they finish their transformation into adults and produce more larvae, which must get picked up by another face fly—or the worms face death.

In Beckley’s eyes, “there was no way for them to continue their life cycle, so they all just died,” Bonura says. It’s still a mystery exactly how the worms got into Beckley’s eye, but Bonura suspects it may have happened when she passed through cattle pastures.

COULD IT HAPPEN TO YOU?

In one bit of good news, the worms don’t burrow into the eyeball itself and instead take up residence on the soft tissue under the eyelids and around the eye socket. Once in an eyeball, though, there aren’t many treatment options. Sometimes, anti-parasitic drugs are used to kill them, but these can worsen inflammation.

In Beckley’s case, the best treatment was for her to gently pull them out, one by one. Over the course of 20 days, Beckley pulled 14 worms out of her eye. Still, the doctors involved in the case agree that these eye worms aren’t a looming public health crisis.

“Do not panic that you’re all going to get eye worms,” Bonura says. Not only is it extremely rare for a person to get a face fly in their eye, it’s even more rare for the fly to stick around long enough to deposit worm larvae. The best prevention, Bonura adds, is just to shoo flies away. And if one gets in the eye, remove it right away.

“As long as you’re doing what we would normally do, it should be fine,” she says.

Beckley’s worms didn’t leave any lasting damage, and she says her vision is fine. A year and a half later, she had trouble even remembering which eye the worms had been in.

And in case you’re wondering (I did), she didn’t keep any: “I did not want to spend any more time with those things than I needed to.”

Thank you so much for the help since I’ve been posting here. Got another question for ya:

I have an internship with an industry firm this upcoming summer (in my second year) and I’m pretty sure it’s just very basic AR/AP role and helping any seniors there.

Although, I want to get an IT audit position in public after school so I have applied to a few public accounting “leadership” programs, in hopes of then getting an internship next summer. I haven’t been accepted into any yet but interviews are coming up soon.

How should I tell my current employer that I need days off to attend (maybe multiple) of these programs? Should I tell them right when I know or wait until they’re closer?

I feel bad because they are already working around my summer classes which is doing me a huge favor. Also, these programs are in the 2nd and 3rd week of my internship and I’d feel bad asking them for time off so soon.

Thanks for the help!"

I am looking to borrow £300 for a short period of time and this will be repayed in a timely manner with interest (which can be discussed).
I am a university student and although I keep myself to a relatively strict budget I am struggling this semester. In my first semester our student house got burgled and various items of mine were taken along with other housemates possessions. Unfortunately, I did not have contents insurance so I had to replace everything that was stolen. At the time I did not think the financial setback would be significant but it has been. My rent for this semester was also larger than last semesters as I am paying for an extra month due to the finance plan given by the estate agents. 
I will also have interviews coming up for companies I have applied to for internships and the travel costs will add up and along with bills and other general expenses I will struggle financially. Hence, I am asking to borrow £300 which will be repayed at the latest on the 25th of April 2018. My next student finance loan is set to come in on the 23/04/2018 and my rent for that semester is much lower than previous so I will be able to pay off the loan straight away.  

I appreciate any help and support received, have a good day."

&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Sinds wanneer bent u bekend met de op 15 juni 2017 gepubliceerde nota  
“Impact Brexit voor douaneverplichtingen in Nederland” van het Landelijke  
Bureau Douane? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik ben op de hoogte van het feit dat de Douane vanaf de zgn. artikel 50-  
notificatie door het VK bezig is met het analyseren van de gevolgen van een  
Brexit voor het goederenverkeer met het VK vanuit de invalshoek van  
douaneformaliteiten en douanewerkzaamheden. De genoemde nota is in het  
reguliere overleg van de Douane met het bedrijfsleven ook gedeeld, om toe  
te werken naar een gedeeld beeld van de huidige handelsstromen tussen NL en  
het VK.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
Hoe beoordeelt u deze nota en welke actie heeft u ondernomen op deze nota,  
die meer dan een half jaar oud is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De nota geeft inzicht in het goederenverkeer met het Verenigd Koninkrijk om  
zodoende inzicht te krijgen in de mogelijke groei van de  
douaneverplichtingen door de Brexit. Het is een van de stappen die de  
organisatie heeft gezet in de voorbereidingen op Brexit. Hierna zijn nadere  
analyses uitgevoerd, waarbij de mogelijke consequenties van Brexit ook  
doorvertaald zijn naar personele en materiële consequenties voor de Douane.  
Op basis daarvan is reeds besloten om binnen de bestaande kaders 50 fte te  
werven met het oog op Brexit. Het kabinet heeft inmiddels besloten dat  
Douane en NVWA nu per direct kunnen doorgaan met het werven en opleiden van  
meer nieuwe medewerkers, het starten van aanbestedingstrajecten en het  
organiseren van huisvesting. De budgettaire gevolgen van deze beslissing  
worden dit voorjaar verwerkt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Is deze nota geraadpleegd door KPMG in hun onderzoek aangaande de gevolgen  
van de Brexit voor Nederland welke ze hebben uitgevoerd in opdracht van het  
ministerie van Economsiche Zaken en Klimaat en het ministerie van Landbouw,  
Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Deelt u de kwalificatie “de douane beschouwt alle uitkomsten waarbij het VK  
uittreedt uit de interne markt, en dus de EU Douane Unie verlaat, als  
'harde' Brexit” uit de nota?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Als het VK de EU verlaat en daarmee een zgn. derde land wordt, betekent dat  
invoering van douaneformaliteiten op het handelsverkeer tussen de EU en het  
VK. Dit vergt dus in alle gevallen een forse investering. Dat maakt de  
kwalificatie “harde Brexit” vanuit douaneperspectief begrijpelijk.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Op basis van dit impactassessment maakt de douane een schatting dat er  
tussen de 500 en 800 extra douanepersoneel nodig is bij de Brexit hoe  
interpreteert u deze aanbeveling van de douane?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat betreft de methodiek zijn in het voorjaar van 2017 de Douane en de NVWA  
gestart met het in kaart brengen van de impact van Brexit op basis van  
gegevens over de huidige handelsstromen. Vervolgens is de vertaalslag  
gemaakt naar hoeveel extra benodigde capaciteit en middelen nodig zijn bij  
een terugval op een WTO-scenario. De NVWA komt met de huidige inzichten uit  
op een benodigd aantal van 143 fte. Op basis van de huidige inzichten heeft  
de Douane twee scenario’s uitgewerkt. Het scenario “no deal” en het  
scenario “CETA” met als basis het handelsakkoord van de EU met Canada. De  
uitkomsten hiervan zijn dat, uitgaand van gelijkblijvende handelsvolumes en  
ongewijzigde handhavingsaanpak, respectievelijk ca. 930 fte en ca. 750 fte  
aan extra capaciteit is geraamd. Het kabinet volgt vanzelfsprekend de  
onderhandelingen nauwgezet teneinde hier adequaat op te kunnen blijven  
inspelen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
Hoeveel formatieplaatsen &amp;#40;fte-equivalenten&amp;#41; telde de douane ultimo 2013,  
2014, 2015, 2016 en 2017?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
Hoeveel medewerkers &amp;#40;fte-equivalenten&amp;#41; had de douane ultimo 2013, 2014,  
2015, 2016 en 2017?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De formatie en bezetting is als volgt:  
[pic]201320142015201620172017 excl DCPFormatie472346554576456146564541Bezetting461745804458429045914478  
Per 2017 voert Douane een taak &amp;#40;“DCP, Belastingdienst Douane Processen Douane”&amp;#41; uit die voorheen elders binnen de Belastingdienst werd uitgevoerd. Dit verklaart de stijging in de formatie en bezetting van 2016 en naar 2017. Om een correcte vergelijking te kunnen maken tussen 2017 en de jaren daarvoor is een kolom 2017 exclusief BCP toegevoegd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
Zijn de 50 nieuwe mensen bij de douane en de 20 bij de Nederlandse Voedsel- en Warenautoriteit &amp;#40;NVWA&amp;#41; geworven binnen de bestaande kaders of zijn ze echt extra?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De genoemde mensen bij de Douane worden met het oog op Brexit geworven binnen de bestaande kaders. Vooruitlopend op Brexit werft de NVWA extra mensen ten behoeve van de benodigde capaciteit additioneel op de bestaande formatie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
Heeft de douane alle douaniers die – onbedoeld – vertrokken zijn met de vertrekregeling al kunnen vervangen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ten behoeve van de continuïteit heeft Douane vanaf 2016 drie grote wervingsrondes uitgevoerd. Inmiddels is de beschikbare Douaneformatie voor bijna 99% bezet.

&amp;nbsp;    
Ik ben altijd bereid specifieke inlichtingen te verschaffen, spontaan, maar ook wanneer uw Kamer daarom verzoekt. Bij het antwoord op vraag 5 ga ik in op de aanpak van de berekeningen voor Douane en NVWA. De door uw Kamer gevraagde analyses zijn echter opgesteld voor intern beraad en het is onwenselijk dat zij onderwerp zijn van politiek debat. De uitkomsten van het interne beraad krijgen hun weerslag in de uiteindelijke besluitvorming, waarover verantwoording afgelegd wordt aan de Kamer.  
&amp;nbsp;

Wat is er volgens u veranderd in de verhoudingen in de Brexit-onderhandelingen sinds juni 2017 &amp;#40;publicatie van deze nota van douane&amp;#41; en januari 2018 &amp;#40;de regering informeert de Kamer over 50 fte extra douanepersoneel&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In juni 2017 waren de onderhandelingen tussen het VK en de EU net begonnen, op basis van de richtsnoeren van de Europese Raad d.d. 29 april 2017 en de onderhandelingsrichtsnoeren die de Raad van de Europese Unie d.d. 22 mei 2017 heeft aangenomen. De eerste fase van de onderhandelingen is moeizaam verlopen. In december 2017 heeft de Europese Raad kunnen vaststellen dat er voldoende voortgang was om de onderhandelingen over de tweede fase te kunnen starten. De afspraken over de eerste fase onderwerpen &amp;#40;rechten van burgers, financiële afwikkeling en de Iers/Noord Ierse grenskwestie&amp;#41; in het gezamenlijk verslag van de Commissie en het VK van 8 december 2017 hebben nu vooral politieke waarde en moeten nog in een juridische vorm worden gegoten. Pas als het terugtrekkingsakkoord gesloten is, zijn de afspraken juridisch bindend. De verdeeldheid binnen de Britse Conservatieve Partij en het uitblijven van duidelijkheid over de Britse inzet blijven een soepel verloop van de onderhandelingen in de weg staan. Het is dan ook duidelijk dat het scenario dat het VK op 29 maart 2019 zonder terugtrekkingsakkoord en zonder overgangsperiode de EU verlaat nog altijd denkbaar is. De rode lijnen van het VK voor de toekomstige relatie met de EU &amp;#40;verlaten interne markt en douane-unie&amp;#41; leiden er toe dat de handelsrelatie niet veel verder zal kunnen gaan dan een handelsverdrag zoals de EU met Canada gesloten heeft.  
&amp;nbsp;    
12  
Zou u kunnen nagaan of de douane nog steeds van mening dat er tussen de 500 en 800 extra douanepersoneel nodig is, of is de douane eveneens van mening dat er sinds juni 2017 en ander speelveld is ontstaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 10.  
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
Hoe verklaart u het verschil tussen deze analyse van de douane en uw analyse aangaande de benodigde fte’s als gevolg van de Brexit?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het memo van juni 2017 betrof een eerste analyse van de impact van Brexit op douaneverplichtingen. De afgelopen maanden heeft de Douane in samenwerking met andere onderdelen van het Ministerie van Financiën de analyse van de gevolgen verder uitgewerkt en doorvertaald. Daarbij is zowel gekeken naar een “no deal scenario” als het scenario van een transitieperiode en daarna een handelsakkoord a la CETA. Zoals is aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag 5 zijn daarvoor uitgaand van gelijkblijvende handelsvolumes en ongewijzigde handhavingsaanpak, respectievelijk ca. 930 fte en ca. 750 fte aan extra capaciteit geraamd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
14  
Aangezien uit de nota valt op te maken dat het totale aantal douaneaangiften voor onze douane met 33% &amp;#40;uitvoeraangiftes&amp;#41; en 18% &amp;#40;invoeraangiftes&amp;#41; toeneemt, zou u kunnen aangeven hoeveel douanepersoneel in een gewone situatie &amp;#40;dus wanneer er geen Brexit zou plaatsvinden&amp;#41; nodig is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien er geen sprake is van Brexit is er geen extra douanepersoneel nodig.  
&amp;nbsp;    
15  
Herinnert u zich antwoorden op eerder gestelde Kamervragen waaruit blijkt dat de opleiding van een douanier 9 tot 22 maanden duurt, waarmee de tijd dringt om voldoende douanepersoneel in dienst te hebben op 29 maart 2019? Hoe lang gaat u nog wachten met het organiseren van voldoende douanepersoneel?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja dat herinner ik me en dat is ook aanleiding geweest voor Douane om na te gaan of door een andere manier van opleiden, verkort en taakgericht, een deel van de benodigde extra capaciteit eerder kan worden ingezet. Dat proces loopt. Daarnaast, zoals vermeld bij het antwoord op vraag 2, heeft het kabinet inmiddels besloten dat Douane en NVWA nu per direct kunnen doorgaan met het werven en opleiden van meer nieuwe medewerkers, het starten van aanbestedingstrajecten en het organiseren van huisvesting.  
&amp;nbsp;    
16  
Aangezien in de nota per &amp;#40;douane&amp;#41;sector wordt geëvalueerd welke gevolgen de Brexit heeft, kunt u aangeven hoe u de reeds geplande 50 fte over deze sectoren wilt verdelen en waar u mogelijk meer personeel nodig acht?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De 50 fte met het oog op Brexit zullen primair ingezet worden om een correcte en tijdige verwerking van de aangiftestroom te bewerkstelligen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
17  
Kunt u alle memo’s, notities &amp;#40;inclusief concepten die nog niet definitief gemaakt zijn&amp;#41; over de Brexit en de douane aan de Kamer doen toekomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 10.  
&amp;nbsp;    
18  
Zijn de huidige informatietechnologie&amp;#40;IT&amp;#41;-systemen van de douane voldoende om de activiteiten en werkzaamheden naar aanleiding van de Brexit te ondersteunen? Zo ja, wat is uw motivatie en/of waar blijkt dit uit? Zo nee, welke aanpassingen dienen er nog te gebeuren, tegen welke kosten en binnen welke doorlooptijd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane gaat er op dit moment vanuit dat de IT-systemen toereikend zijn. De geprognostiseerde volumestijgingen als gevolg van de Brexit kunnen volgens de huidige inzichten opgevangen worden binnen de systemen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
19  
Is er voldoende tijd om ervoor te zorgen dat de douane goed is voorbereid op een Brexit indien het Verenigd Koninkrijk in maart 2019 uit de douane-unie stapt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De tijd tot maart 2019 wordt door het kabinet benut om zo goed mogelijk voorbereid te zijn op een uittreden van het Verenigd Koninkrijk uit de douane-unie in maart 2019. Uiteraard worden het onderhandelingsproces over de Brexit en de voorbereidingen van de uitvoeringsdiensten nauw gevolgd om zo nodig bij te sturen en/of om aanvullende maatregelen te kunnen treffen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
20  
Herinnert u zich dat u in het algemeen overleg over de Brexit van de commissie Europese Zaken op 24 januari 2018 zei: “Wij hebben de effecten op luchtvaart, visserij, transport, inklaring bij de douane en keuring van veterinaire producten – dat moet ook geregeld worden namelijk – inzichtelijk.”? 3&amp;#41; Kunt u deze inzichten met de Kamer delen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het kabinet komt hier voor het einde van het krokusreces in een aparte brief op terug. De huidige inzichten over de effecten van de Brexit op Douane en NVWA zijn in de antwoorden op de voorgaande vragen gegeven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
21  
Kunt u deze vragen een voor een en binnen twee weken beantwoorden?  
Ja

7y0ckn,0,2018-02-16,"My [23F] new coworker [23F] drives me insane, but since most of it affects me indirectly, I'm not sure what i can do.",secretarystateofmind,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7y0ckn/my_23f_new_coworker_23f_drives_me_insane_but/,"Hi Reddit!

I've posted on here before about my job. A few months ago, I got promoted to a new department, and absolutely love it. My boss is amazing, the work is rewarding, and I feel very fulfilled.

About a month ago, a new girl, Maddy, began working here too. She's also 23, so I thought it would be cool to have someone my age to whom I could relate (it sometimes gets weird or a little old discussing marriage/kids with my coworkers when i can't relate.)

But Maddy is an absolute nightmare. She's the kind of 23 year old girl who epitomizes why professional companies don't want to hire 23 year old girls. 

In the month she's worked here, she has already taken 3 sick days, all for ""migraines"" that she later confided were just bad hangovers. ""It *was* a migraine, just an alcohol-induced one, haha!"" She regularly interrupts my work to come into my office space and talk about her ex boyfriend. She comes in late (about 9:30) and leaves early (4:28ish) every day when our office is normally 8:30-5:30, despite living four blocks from our office. She didn't even come in to work today because ""something came up."" That was honestly the extent of the excuse. Convenient how something only comes up for her on Mondays or the Fridays before long weekends.

She is fresh out of grad school and has never had a real job, so a lot of this I thought was just her being ""green"" - but she has proved wildly incompetent in almost every faculty. She cannot write. Her clothing is wildly lacking in professionalism. She cannot behave professionally and appropriately at meetings. She regularly talks about her dance and gymnastics career to clients and colleagues at length for no apparent reason other than to let us know she did gymnastics and dance for a long time. She interrupts meetings, standup chats, and regular office hangout time to talk about herself, and is oblivious to the most basic social cues.

However, all of this can fall under ""annoying coworker I'll just have to deal with,"" as her lack of professionalism and grating personality are not really under my control as her equal within the office. I would hardly make myself look good by tattling to my boss about her fake sick days and irritating time-wasting monologues about her ex. 

But Maddy will do this bizarre thing that does impede my working relationships directly by ""outing"" my age. Everyone else in our role is about 28-32 years old, with a few outliers in early 40s. Admittedly, it does feel kind of cool to have gotten this position so ""young,"" but I have also worked in this industry long enough to know that being young and female are not seen as professional assets. I could pass for 26ish with the right makeup and never bring up my age in hopes that people assume I'm the same age as everyone else, because, I dunno, it's more important to me to be seen as competent than ""young"".

Maddy found out that I am also 23 and will now mention it to literally anyone: our boss, our grandboss, clients, interviewees, in team meetings. I'm not exaggerating. If we're going around the room and doing introductions, hers will be ""Hey, I'm Maddy, and I'm 23. So is OP! Woohoo! Except her birthday is in (early month) and mine's in (later month) so I'm the youngest.""  Our new intern is 23, and when he was doing his introduction (""Hi, I'm Sam, I'm 23 and a grad student at John Smith College"") she interrupted to say ""me and OPare too! But we're not interns, haha.""

It's inexplicable. It drives me insane. As far as I can tell, she just does this because she wants people to think she's super cool for having gotten this job ""young"" but it just backfires and makes us BOTH look naive and incompetent. 

Is this just something I'm going to have to deal with? She also ""confided"" in me (I'm not sure why) that she will be leaving in May because she got a better offer that dosen't start til then, though she told our boss when she was hired she'd be working here for a couple of years, so I should only have to put up with her for a few more months. But am I within my rights to report the weird stuff she does, and if not, what the hell do I do to manage this person in the meantime?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: New coworker thinks we're soul sisters because we're the only people in our early 20s in the department. She actually drives me insane, is hugely incompetent and unprofessional, and ""outs"" my age to people which I believe undermines my professional image. What can I do about it?

Edited because I accidentally used Maddy's real name"
7y0l1h,11,2018-02-16,"FR - Cancer, control, and lessons applied",thegreatestape,marriedredpill,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/7y0l1h/fr_cancer_control_and_lessons_applied/,"This is a follow-up to a previous post, linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askMRP/comments/78r512/applying_mrp_concepts_to_ldr/).

For anyone interested, my mental health continues to be great.  If you know anyone who is dealing with PTSD, encourage them to try to get a Stellate Ganglion Block.  It’s not a permanent solution, but it’ll turn off the “fight or flight” response for a few months, which will allow a person to get the right permanent mindset.  Huge game changer!  Seriously, it was like the hypnosis scene from Office Space, with the resulting happy DNGAF attitude.

I visited my wife in FL shortly after my previous post, and made sure to make plenty of time for myself.  She was interning at Disney and we got free passes into the parks, which made it easier to keep a relaxed pace and not *have* to squeeze every ounce of fun out of the theme parks.  I worked out every day while there, got numbers from 4x HB7-9s for catch &amp; release, hit up a local BJJ gym, and spent time with my cousin who just got out of the Marines.  Had a great time with other people.  I still spent plenty of time with the wife and kids, but the wife was not my biggest priority.  Each day there, I created the plan and drove the timelines, and led the family while having fun.  Caveman sex, and I made it clear I was simply using her for her body.

After I left that week (early October), I told her I was going to stick with my original plan to do Christmas in Arkansas with my side of the family, and I was bringing our daughters with me.  I had planned on this prior to her getting selected for her internship.  Because of deployments, alert requirements, training, and previously living in Japan for 3 years, I haven’t done Christmas with my folks in 7 years, and it was important to me.

**The Turning Point**

In a phone conversation, she tells me that her doing an internship at Disney is basically the same thing as me going on a deployment, and because of all the deployments I’ve been on, she should be doing more trips away from home.  I basically reply with, “Yeah, that ain’t happening.”  Shitty attitude and rant from her promptly ensue, and it felt really good to hold frame the entire time.  Again, after dealing with PTSD for so long, and finally getting the right treatment, I felt totally content in the midst of the storm, just like I used to before the PTSD.  When asked why I think my career is more important than hers, I tell her that it *is* more important, that I’ve saved people’s lives, killed a lot of bad people, that the things I do go on to define nation-states, and my kids will read about this shit in history books, not to mention I make more money and have more opportunities than she ever will as a chef.  And that the most impact she’ll make interning as a cook in Disney is to make some tourist’s facebook storyline.  No anger in my voice, and I shrugged it off as a pretty obvious point.  She tells me that she hopes our daughters never know how arrogant their father is.  I respond with a lighthearted “ok” and leave it at that.  “That’s all you have to say for yourself is ‘ok’?”  “Yep.”  She then insists that we need marriage counseling and she doesn’t know who I’ve become.  “We’ll see.  Listen, I’m gonna let you go, I’m going out with some friends tonight.  Hope you have a good night.”  The next day I started getting sexy pictures texted to me, which hadn’t happened in a looong time.  Felt nice to see a positive change, but exit plan is the same as the stay plan, and I know it’s still a long, worthwhile road ahead.

**Cancer**

A few weeks later, right before Thanksgiving, she gets news that the lump in her breast she got biopsied back in May was, in fact, cancerous, not a cyst like we were originally told.  Since the aforementioned phone call with me, she had been finding reasons to no longer enjoy being in FL, but this diagnosis sealed the deal.  She moved back home to do treatment since oncologists here are stellar and tried to pull the “but I have cancer” card to get special treatment from me (it seems to work on most other people, understandably).  I shut it down immediately and told her that I’m going to help her when she needs it, I’ll be there for the treatments, but that her cancer doesn’t change anything else so she needs to be a big girl and do shit for herself.  She later told me that this was a turning point in her respect towards me, and her actions backed that up.

When she got back, almost nothing changed for me.  I took the girls to school and gymnastics, and have a good reputation with the teachers/other kids’ parents because my girls are respectful, intelligent, and I’m sociable.  The girls echo my sentiment of “Daddy’s house, Daddy’s room, Daddy’s whatever...Daddy paid for it, so it’s his.”  In addition to lifting and doing BJJ at work, I started doing additional MMA training a couple of nights a week and helping out buddies with various projects.  Wife starts hearing good stuff from my buddies’ wives about me, and I can see the hamster spin.   She felt out of place, and I took advantage of a couple of comfort tests.  She still insisted on doing marriage counseling, so I had the unit chaplain come to our house.  During the flowing conversation, at one point I had mentioned that 3 requirements I have for the woman I’m with is that she’ll meet my sexual desires, cook food for me, and take care of my kids and my house when I’m not around.  The next day while I’m putting down wood flooring in my house, wife comes sneering into the room and asks, “So you’re saying that if everything else were good but sex life wasn’t great, you’d leave?”  I told her, “No, I’m not leaving my own house that I paid for.  I implied that I’d divorce you and you’d be living somewhere else.”  Gave her a wink and went back to the flooring.  I honestly expected an explosive reaction from her, but she just went to the bedroom and came out an hour later, being a complete sweetheart.

The next big turning point is the unit Christmas party. She got her chemo port placed the day prior, and she knew she’d be losing her hair soon, so shit was getting real for her.  I’m always the sharpest dressed at work, and the Christmas party was no different.  I got a lot of compliments on my 3 piece suit and my solid look, and the women at the party were all over me.  No way I’d touch any of them with a 10’ pole, even if I was divorced (plenty of good-looking women, but all were either workmates or married to my buddies), but it was it was a super fun night.  The changes in SMV that occurred since the time my wife left for FL couldn’t have been more stark.  I fucked her brains out that night, and 3 times the next day.  Since then, as much as she’s able, she’s constantly cooking, cleaning, and making sure things in our life are how I want them to be.  She defers to me, values my opinion, takes pleasure in my happiness, and likes that I have control over all of our lives.  Her hair is gone, she’s put on a little weight because of the drugs, but I know that shit is temporary and I still find her attractive.  A couple of weeks ago while we were walking together, I asked her how she thought the marriage was going.  She got a little bit of a tone in her voice when she said, “Well, I bet *you’re* happy since you’re getting sex and food all the time!”  I gave her a smirk and raised my eyebrows to signal that she didn’t answer my question and I was still waiting for her response, when her face relaxed and she said, “Actually, I really am happy with things.  I like making you happy.”

**Conclusion**

For anyone wondering why I haven’t done any OYS, I’ll say that I generally don’t have much of an issue with self-discipline (unless I have a coconut cream pie in front of my face).  Plus I generally delete my comments, anyway; I don’t care about having a background for people to look at, take my comments at face value or don’t, I don’t care.  I also wanted to wait a little while before posting to ensure that my marital gains weren’t just a temporary change that I’d lose after a few months.  I did a lot of MRP stuff prior to PTSD, but I didn’t know why they were working, which meant that I didn’t have a solid plan on how to make my marriage keep getting better over the years.  I’m grateful for the folks that put together the sidebar and consistently answer questions on r/askMRP, it helped me solidify a lot of thought processes that otherwise would have taken me a long time to define.  I hope my experience here can help someone else out so I can pay it forward and show gratitude to others who have helped me.

Things were tense, I felt like I was walking on eggshells and couldn't talk about labor and delivery, my mom only held the baby because I put the baby in her arms. They leave. I get a text from my mom roughly saying my dad was wrong, it was so much worse than she expected, she cried the whole way home. I ignored it because I was tired, and fed up. Whenever I got up at a morning hour (feeding every 2-3 hours is grand) I had a text from my mom saying that text was meant for her sister, but she guesses it's best that I know. I called her and it very quickly it somehow got on the topic of my husband talking to her on the phone early on in labor with her yelling/sobbing ""do you now what he said to me?!"" and after repeating that several times my dad took the phone and she was sobbing in the background. I told him I didn't know what was said (I didn't at that time) and he said it was very rude for someone to say to their mother in law, but I still didn't know what was said. We arranged for my mom and dad to come over and talk because I was sick of this tension and just wanted to have it out (terrible idea in hindsight, I was so hormonal, and sleep deprived, and still upset from labor and delivery, but we did it, oh well). My dad wanted to be there to mediate, which I thought would help some. It did help in some ways because when I would say something and my mom would interpret it completely wrong he would point out that is not what I meant, but in other ways it hurt because they ganged up on me about a few things. Before they got there I asked my husband what he said to her and he said ""she asked what was going on, he told her basic info, she asked if I was in pain, he said jokingly trying to lighten the mood ""well yea she's in labor""'. They arrive and my dad, mom, and myself go in the basement to talk. The order of everything is fuzzy, but I'll give the gist of things that were said. Both my parents were upset they didn't get more updates because I was induced for a medical condition and they were concerned for their only daughter, though they never communicated this desire. They were both upset they weren't told of the EMERGENCY c-section before it happened. I ended up apologizing for not sending more updates because of the gaslighting, even though we gave more updates than originally we had told them previously. While still in the hospital after delivering, my husband told me the day before I delivered, but was in labor, he saw my mom in the hospital while he was getting food, but she hadn't told us she was coming, so he snuck away from her. I brought this up and my mom was furious we didn't send more updates and come update her when she was at the hospital for nine hours that day. We had no idea she was there for nine hours that day, my husband reasonably didn't want to see her given her shady behavior. She apparently was in the chapel most of the time praying cause she"" felt"" like I was going to die (like her psychic intuition told her), she could feel a connection to me and the pain I was in. I was in pain, like all who give birth, but I was never anywhere near death's door. I told her this is why I didn't want her in the room, who wants that negative energy around. Then we discussed her barging in, which my dad had an excuse for saying it was his fault for misunderstanding, but considering we didn't even give them the room number yet and she needled it out of security (after we told them no visitors at all, I'm still mad about this), it's pretty clear we weren't ready for them to come back. I brought up her snapping at my husband when he's in a critical emotional moment of his life and she said he'd been so nasty to her on the phone and then didn't get any updates, so he basically deserved it. I told her he said he was joking on the phone and she scoffed. She said she didn't like being managed about coming to visit post-delivery. Me telling her when she could stop by and fitting her in around our friends was upsetting. Then the baby shower came up again. She said after their email exchanges she's just so upset with my husband and he clearly doesn't like her. I, at the time, had not read these emails, but I doubted they were that bad. I have since read them, and there is one email asking her to run party purchases by my MIL and him first so we don't overbuy as the guest count is changing, and asking what decorations she's making. It's perfectly cordial, and there is only one email, so I have no idea what multiple emails she is referring to. She also said she was so disappointed in my behavior at the baby shower, I didn't spend much time with them, and didn't walk around and introduce her to everyone as a host or future grandmother. And I didn't take pictures of her hard worked on decorations or thank her specifically publically on social media. I ended apologizing for all this. Then she kept repeating that she wasn't allowed in the hospital and I said she couldn't be there, which was not true at all, I told her multiple times she could be in the waiting room for days if she wanted. She then talked about how embarrassing this all is when people ask her about the delivery because everyone knows how excited she is to be a grandmother, and she wears her grandmother pin every day, and she wasn't even in the room. She then said she ""needs to be committed"" because when she's mad she ""sees red"" and ""can't hear"" what anyone else is saying. She has not since been committed or sought any form of treatment. She said I don't have to walk on eggshells and can just talk about what I want with her, and that she walks on eggshells around me because I'm not interested in her hobbies. We went round and round the same topics, I cried, she cried, I apologized for stuff and hugged her. Since then she rarely (I won't say never, but very rarely) asks about the baby. I can say with certainty she has never once asked to see the baby. She has never posted about the baby on social media despite the important role it plays in her self worth, and posts about my brother's ""accomplishments"" (she applied to an internship for him, wrote the essays and all, he's an adult, which he got, and she's proud of).

After all this and as time has passed I just feel so differently about that whole conversation. I HAD NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. SHE NEVER APOLOGIZED ONCE FOR HER BEHAVIOR (which I didn't even realize the day of cause I was so overwhelmed). Her behavior was OUTRAGEOUS and is not acceptable! In my mind I can pinpoint her calling me selfish for talking about my pregnancy and baby (more so in hindsight because after her saying she's all about being a grandma this outrages me), her trying to make labor and delivery all about her, her ignoring myself and new baby immediately after birth, and her never apologizing her anything to be the moments that redefined my thinking of her. While I will remember giving birth as a defining moment and filled mostly with happiness, it feels like it is forever tainted, we can never get that moment back. Realizing she will never change or see my side or put me first, should have come earlier, but this is what finally did it. Though I wish she would take an interest in the baby cause her disinterest hurts me, ultimately I don't know the relationship she will have with my child yet, so it might be for the best. All of this has also made me realize how much my dad rationalizes her behavior into being not as bad as it is. He had excuses for a lot of her behavior.

If you have read any parts of this story thank you so much. If you have read it all you are amazing. There are more stories, more than I can even mentally process right now, but maybe getting these particular ones down will stop them from jumbling around in my mind so much. "

He snorted an oxy and it was laced. His poor mother found him dead in the bathroom. I had no idea he was using. 

I ironically work in probation/parole as an intern. The only difference is my case load is much smaller and I’m supervised more closely. 

I’m 22. I had a client who is 21 and completed 30 days of inpatient rehab for his Heroin addiction. The facility had recommended that he goes to a halfway house for an additional 90 days. The client refused any aftercare. His parents didn’t know what to do with him so they drove him to the office and I got a call when I was opening my lunch saying you have someone here to see you. They dropped him off to talk to me. He was adamant he wasn’t going and he didn’t need anymore help. 

Little did his parents know, I was a grieving girlfriend of a similar situation. I can say I’ve moved on but I still have a heavy heart when it comes to this subject. 

I asked my client to tell me what’s going on. I let him talk about why he didn’t want to go to aftercare. I wanted to hear what his plans were for himself. I eventually got him to admit he’s afraid of relapsing. I made him elaborate what he thinks could happen if he relapses. I just listened. I let him talk for a good 20-30 minutes. He didn’t have any plan other than live with his parents and hope they run a tight ship. He told me death is a possibility. 

I hit him hard and heavy with I just experienced your future if you keep going down the road you’re on. I told him what that phone call was like with my boyfriends mom telling me he’s gone. I told him what his families faces looked like when I saw them. I told him what it was like to hear them screaming when they found out his cause of death. I tried to make him picture my boyfriends mom finding him dead on the bathroom floor. I explained that this was soon going to be his family if he didn’t get his shit together he doesn’t know what he’s buying - he just hopes at this point it’s what he asked for. 

He just gave me a blank stare while I told him his. He didn’t answer me in anyway he just stared. I ended it with, I can’t make you do anything. You have to want it. Here’s your appointment card for next week, I hope to see you here. I walked him out. 

I wasn’t optimistic. By his answers I knew he was going to go right back to using. I was surprised today to get a phone call from my client. He called to tell me I thought about what you said and you’re right. He had made arraignments to go to a halfway house tonight. He thanked me for everything that I said and it made him realize a lot. 

I wished him good luck and I broke down just a little bit. In some ways, maybe this was all part of the bigger plan. My goal was to save at least one person from going down this road and I can say, I did it. "

I'm currently a 3rd year undergrad majoring in math. My plan is to pursue a master's in education a few years after college, and then teach high school.

However, before I settle down to teach I want some financial stability. I'll also need to save up some money for grad school, and hopefully make enough money for a house's down payment, etc.

My school already required to take some CS classes as a part of the math curriculum, would the extra 3 CS courses be worth it to obtain a minor?

7y3ugh,1,2018-02-16,"[M4A] ""She said she liked my haircut.""",WeDontNeedRobes,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7y3ugh/m4a_she_said_she_liked_my_haircut/,"""I really like your hair.""

It was supposed to be an off-hand comment, but it was the only thing I could think about for days. I'd had a haircut and gotten rid of my whole skater boy look which, if you'd seen it, was the kind of thing that Avril Lavigne would've sung about fifteen years ago. And, yeah, I used to skate at the park, used to play every song in ""American Idiot"" day-in and day-out on a guitar with half-broken strings, used to enjoy hanging out at the seedier parts of New York City pretending to be a delinquent. But that was the old me, the ""edgy"" me, the person that I wanted to get rid of when I got to college. I mean, college is a time for reinvention, right? So, I got rid of my old stable of cheap hair dye, crappy body spray, and band tees. In came proper cologne, button-downs and vests, and - of course - a brand new haircut.

When I saw my best friend, he almost didn't recognize me. To be fair, *I* almost didn't recognize me. I looked in the mirror and had to do a double take. Gone was the skater boy, and in came someone who looked like he was ready to be an intern at the New York Times. Smartly dressed, freshly-shaven, wearing clothes from Banana Republic. *He* looked pretty handsome. But he also didn't look much like me. I had a bout of existential panic, and I wasn't totally sure I was ready to be someone brand new.

Until you.

Yeah, it was stupid. I was hanging out at the campus' black box theater 'cause I used to do set tech back in high school for the drama club. I'd help out when I could, especially for the theater majors who were always a little too frazzled and dazzled and never had any time to say anything beyond ""Hello!"" and ""I'm sorry, I'm super busy."" But that was fine with me. That never bothered me. Again, until you.

You came in wearing a pair of ripped jeans and an army jacket and a black crop top and brown leather boots and, holy hell, that was some bright, bright neon hair dye that you were using, looking every bit as out of my league as Hayley Williams or Taylor Momsen. I almost dropped a 2x4 on one of the other stage hands when I saw you. You walked by, wide grin on your face, and started toward the stage. Immediately, my hands got sweaty and I got all clammy and I was processing everything in super slow motion. Fight or flight. Fight? Or flight?

But you got to me. And you said it. ""I really like your hair!"" you said, with a gigantic smile on your face. Your teeth were really white, I noticed. White like angel wings. A lump formed in my throat and I couldn't say anything for a couple of seconds. But by then you'd walked past and you were gone, disappeared into the dressing room. You were an actress, a theater major. One of the stage hands told me that, looking at me with an annoyed expression on her face, right before telling me to get back to work. An actress. A theater major. And you liked my haircut.

I felt lightheaded. You know that feeling when it feels like you just meet the right person at the right time in the right place? I didn't until I saw you. And, by God, I'm pretty sure I fell in love. I'd been luckless before, had girlfriends before. I didn't want that this time. I didn't want a random hookup or a stupid, drunk make out session in the back of a club. This was true love, baby.

And I was gonna make it happen.

---

So, this is kinda weird, right? It doesn't really ""feel"" like a traditional DPP prompt, I bet, but I am in desperate need of an 18+ sweet, cute, romantic RP at the moment. I'm in love with love, you could say. Anyway, I won't say more. Let's talk, alright?"
7y3wao,115,2018-02-16,Thoughts on switching specialties,msfuturedoc,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/7y3wao/thoughts_on_switching_specialties/,"I have a rather unique situation that I have found myself in and I am not sure if this post is better here or over in r/medicine. Towards the end of my intern year, I had a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted about 4 min. I was hospitalized, had an abnormal EEG that didn't fit any particular disorder, luckily no brain tumors. BTW, I have NEVER had seizures before or anything even close to a seizure. This seizure happened after being awake for almost 30 hours straight when I was post-call. Obviously, wasn't able to drive for 3 months so had to rely on family to get me to and from work, which was a huge annoyance and I felt like a total burden. At that time, I was started on keppra, figured that was it, and just told myself to be more careful with exhaustion and have better sleep hygiene. Fast forward to Jan 4th of this year, I am home after a night call in the ICU (sleeping about 4-5 hours a night that week), and I have another tonic-clonic seizure in my room. I was on my phone planning my schedule for my next week and next thing I know I'm being wheeled into an ambulance and I am post-ictal AF. And while I did feel sleepy prior to the seizure, I didn't feel particularly crazy exhausted as I had felt prior to my first seizure. Now I don't know what to do. I am in my second year, so I find myself wondering if surgery is even a possibility for me. Even if I get into a boutique gen surg lifestyle after residency, getting through residency itself is going to be difficult with the different night shifts and 28+ hr calls I'll be expected to do over the next three years. I've started to develop anxiety around being tired, which keeps me up and then makes me more tired. My neurologist was like, ""Well maybe you can ask your residency to change your schedule to not do nights?"" Honestly, even if they could I wouldn't want them to because it puts unnecessary strains on my co-residents. I am not doing nights for the three months after my last seizure as I 1) can't drive myself and 2) had my meds changed and they aren't therapeutic until 3 months of titrating up.

Given all of these changes, I have started to seriously consider changing residencies. This has been difficult as I really like surgery, I am at my top choice institution, and from the feedback I get from my faculty, I do pretty well and am well-liked. It doesn't make the option of changing feel any easier. I thought about rads since they do procedures, but it is another 5 year residency and I just so happened to have a seizure at the end of the whole interview season, putting me even more behind. I am starting to look into PM&amp;R as I have interest in pain medicine and they still get to do minor procedures so I would still have that hands on component. Since this has all started, I have become seriously concerned about having a seizure on the job (luckily the other two were outside of work). If I do go forward with surgery, and I have another seizure as an attending, I would likely be placed on probation vs have to double-scrub all of my cases with another attending. Also, I would not be able to take any home calls if I was on driving restrictions after a seizure. 

My program director is very supportive and says he will help me out with whatever decision I make. But I think the unknown is what's killing me. My neurologist doesn't get the whole surgery lifestyle and his thoughts to me were, you could have another seizure or you couldn't. A lot to work with. My PD has offered to get my a research position at my institution for this upcoming year to help me get situated for switching residencies if needed. The other option is to stay on as a categorical and see if the whole seizure thing becomes another issue again.

The scary thing about both of these seizures is I had previously experienced multiple times and still do experience those levels of exhaustion. Its like russian roulette like which time am I going to seize now?

I guess I just want to get feedback from other people to help me make a decision. Obviously, at the end of the day it is a personal decision as to what I think will be best for me. I just haven't been able to find anyone with a similar experience. I just feel like I am in this quarter-life crisis/free fall and it has been very difficult to reconcile all of these thoughts and worries on my own. 

I appreciate any assistance you all could give me and thanks for reading through the long post.

I thought the guy was a little odd at first, making really weird, immature jokes all the time and laughing at them. But I thought it was harmless. I was already a supervisor when he came in, and generally he trusts me.

Fast forward to now, and I have no doubt in my mind that he's crazy and self-involved/socially unaware. He constantly invades peoples personal space (male and female--making the females pretty uncomfortable), and makes inappropriate comments to everyone (for example, singing Christmas songs with lyrics changed to be dirty). I generally do my best and try to suck up to people over me, so I usually avoid his wrath. Others have a tendency to make him mad. 

He'll get angry at part time workers for requesting off--he constantly asks ""Why are they working here if they need every Monday off?"" (for college), or ""Does she think she can just ask off every Sunday?"" (for church). Meanwhile he takes off most Fridays and most weekends. He makes it seem like he's doing everyone a huge favor  if he approves their time off, and makes sure to let them know (meanwhile I'm the one actually making the schedule work).

I've told him that I am possibly seeking an internship in my career field of choice this summer, and he belittled my decision, telling me I wouldn't be able to find a job in my field with no experience (kind of the point of an internship though). I told him I actually have pretty good qualifications (some certifications that are difficult to get), and he responds saying ""Anyone can get those."" I just let it slide and ignore it since he's my boss.

The tip of the iceberg for me though was last week. While I was on duty at a big event, I received news about a close friend being moved to hospice. I was naturally upset, and had to spend about 30 minutes gaining my composure. When I finally found him, he asked me what was wrong. I told him, and he told me to ""Not think about it"". Later, before he left, he came up to me and told me ""Stop crying, dude"". I wasn't even crying at that point, just red in the face. He left, and I found out that the next day he asked another staff member on duty ""So did steightst8 just spend the whole night moping around crying last night?""

For anyone not familiar with me, I'm 17 and the past couple years have been a wild ride. I'd probably say the lowest point for me was in July when I was fainting multiple times a day, dislocating my knees at every opportunity and using a wheelchair the majority of the time. I was also at a point where I was pretty sure I would be dropping out of high school because I couldn't handle it anymore. 

Flash forward to now! I haven't fainted in two months, I have a 4.0 in college, I don't even need to use a cane anymore! I have legit hobbies again, like pottery and reading. I've finally gotten sorted with all EDS-literate physicians, most importantly a physical therapist who specializes in EDS. I also have a bit of a fling going with a guy I really like, which is super exciting because I was sure no one would ever love someone as sick as me (plot twist, he actually doesn't care I have a genetic disorder, he's sad that I'm in pain but it doesn't affect his ""liking"" of me). 

I'm planning a backpacking trip in Europe next spring and applying to lab internships and just generally super hopeful for my future. 

I know my life is going to be different because of EDS, it's going to be painful and frustrating and sometimes things won't go how I want them to, but I think I (and a lot of other people just starting out in this ""EDS adventure"") forget that hEDS is not a death sentence. There are treatment options, and yes, sometimes they take a long time to work and not everyone responds to the same things but your worst isn't doomed to be your forever.

I don't want this to turn into a whole preachy ""I cured my EDS with one simple step!"" type thing, I'm still sick, I've just found really productive ways of managing my condition. Will things change as I get older? Obviously, but I've gotten to the point that I have a well-established care network and I'm confident that we will be able to handle any issues that arise. 

I'm grateful to have a family that drives me three hours round trip every week for physical therapy, I'm grateful to be taken care of by some of the top doctors at Johns Hopkins, I'm grateful that I responded well to physical therapy, and I'm extremely grateful for this community always being here to support me when things get rough. 

So, here's the message to all the people who are at their low points (and maybe for me to keep in mind next time things get rough again): You are capable of getting better, your now is not your forever. Life is a bumpy ride full of highs and lows, especially when you throw a genetic disorder in the mix,  but just try to keep in mind that there is still hope.  

Peace out zebras, dazzle on

I’ve never had a girlfriend before; the closest I’ve ever gotten is a loosely defined romantic relationship with a girl (I’ll call her A) who interned with the same organization as me. This started mid-Fall of 2017.

Unfortunately, it didn’t last.

After a couple weeks of us being together, A decided that we should just be friends. Her justification was that she was afraid that she was getting too attached and didn’t want to get hurt when her internship ended and she had to leave.

As part of her justification, she told me a story about a male friend of hers from when she studied at a school Tennessee as part of an exchange program during the Spring 2017 semester. She was very close with this guy (I’ll call him B; unfortunately, he appears later in this story), and they were interested in one another, but nothing ended up happening between them. A told me that she thought this was for the best because in the end it made it much easier to say goodbye when the semester was over.

Just as a note, the whole “let’s just be friends” thing came about a week after she’d visited her friends in Tennessee for a couple days. At the time I didn’t think much of it, but, as you’ll see later on, it seems like it might be significant.

A and I continued to be friends and still hung out regularly for the next couple weeks until the end of the semester. It was almost exactly like when we were together, just without anything physical. When she left, it was even more devastating than when she decided that she just wanted to be friends. There was still hope though; I’m on a weird extended internship (my situation is a bit complicated), and she was reapplying for another internship in the Spring semester, though she didn’t like her chances.

For at least the first week or two after she left, we were in semi-regular contact, and she was consistently pessimistic that she’d be back. At one point though, I ran into one of her housemates, who mentioned that she was still in talks with their landlord to continue renting for the Spring semester. I tried not to think about this too much- just a day or two before, she’d told me that she probably wasn’t coming back, and I was certain that she’d tell me right away if anything was set in stone as far as her being able to return.

So, the holidays went by without my hearing anything from A, and I started to get over her. That is, until a day in early January when I randomly saw her in our workplace’s cafeteria. Apparently, this was her first day working again, but she’d been back in the area for almost a week at this point.

I felt a bit betrayed that she hadn’t told me she was back, but I let it go for two reasons:

For the preceding couple of weeks, I’d had a crappy broken phone and hadn’t been able to access Snapchat. She uses Snapchat all the time, and it would make a lot of sense for her to have snapchatted the whole way back and expected me to see her updates.

I was just happy to see her again.

I asked her about going to the gym together (we worked out together a lot in the Fall), but she said that she probably wouldn’t be able to for the next week, because a friend of hers was visiting.

A few days later I met this friend. He was from Tennessee. I put things together pretty quickly that this was B, the guy from the story that she told me when she was explaining why we should just be friends.

I still trusted her enough to assume that she would explicitly tell me if they were together now, but something didn’t seem right to me. Somehow I managed to ignore that feeling and fell back into crushing on her.

A week later, after B had left, and A and I had started falling back into our regular schedule of working out together and hanging out, I asked her if she wanted to try again with our relationship. She said no, for the same reasons that she gave me for ending things back in the Fall. She made no mention of B, and repeatedly told me that just being friends was probably just as frustrating for her as it was for me, but she was convinced that it would be worth it to avoid being heartbroken when she left. This was disappointing for me, but it seemed to confirm that A and B were not in a relationship.

Since being rejected, I’ve started grad school and switched to only working once a week, and because I’ve been so busy and neither of us has a car (and because it doesn’t seem worth it to put so much effort into seeing her when we’re not actually in a relationship), I’ve been seeing A much less. Despite mostly only seeing her on weekends, I’ve been happy to have her back in my life. It has been a bit frustrating though, because I still like her a lot. I’ve also gotten the impression that she reciprocates these feelings towards me; she's been going out of her way to make sure that we spend time together every weekend, and has frequently talked about how she misses seeing me every day.

All of this changed a couple days ago on Valentine’s day. I was randomly scrolling through Facebook, when I saw a picture she had posted of herself. B had commented, saying something along the lines of “Beautiful, babe. Happy Valentine’s”. She responded with a heart emoji. I also noticed that his profile picture was of the two of them together.

Out of respect for her, I hadn’t previously asked A’s housemates the exact nature of the relationship between A and B, but at this point I decided I had to right away. I messaged one of her housemates right away, and he told me that though it seemed kind of vague, he was under the impression that A and B were a couple.

The past couple days have been painful and stressful, as I’ve realized that it looks a lot like A has been intentionally emotionally manipulating me. I get the feeling that she only had good intentions; she tends to avoid conflict and probably thought that she was protecting me, but I really don’t think the ends justify the means in this case. I also recognize that this is at least a little bit my fault; I’ve been avoiding direct communication and deluding myself into trusting her much more than she deserves to be trusted.

I plan to confront her about her dishonesty at some point this weekend, but I’m afraid. I don’t know how to start, or what to say. I keep concocting imaginary scenarios where somehow she isn’t guilty of violating my trust, but I know that the chances of that are slim.

Do you all see any chance that she isn’t being dishonest with me? I get the feeling that it might be best for both of us if we stop being friends, but I’m afraid I’m making a mistake. Is this the right course of action?

Anyways, sorry this post is so long. Any advice that you all might have for me would be appreciated.

tl;dr: I suspect that a girl that I'm interested in/my sorta-kinda ex has a boyfriend, and has been dishonest to me to avoid talking about it. I'm going to try to confront her about it."

She lied, even the Postmaster said she lied, and was planting evidence.

Psychiatrist etc
#801 “Officials at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus said Wednesday that a suspicious package was discovered at the Facilities Services building on Monday. It had been delivered to the campus by the U.S. Postal Service that same day, was immediately investigated and turned over to authorities within hours of delivery.”

Ok, now I know the USPS is slooooooooow as mole asses, but the latest Holmes could have mailed that package would have been Thursday at 5pm. He has been tied up since then. So, assuming it was mailed in Aurora, it should have been delivered the following day, Saturday at the latest. Jeeze, even in my little town, if I mail something 100 miles away, they get it the following day.
#809 “The package was seized by authorities on Monday after it was discovered in the mailroom at the University of Colorado, Denver. It's unclear if it was sent before the attack at the July 20 midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" that left 12 dead and dozens of others injured. “
If it was sent after the attack, there were others involved. The attack was in the AM hours of Friday morning, as I stated before, the package would have had to have been mailed by him, on Thursday afternoon, at the latest. It took all of Friday, Saturday and Sunday to arrive on Monday. A stretch even for the Post Office.

One of three things here right off the top of my head:

1. Either he didn't mail it but an accomplice did (why?).
2. He mailed it and it got lost in transit.
3. It's planted evidence.

I think TPTB within this case are extremely perturbed that public knowledge of this book got out.
#816 
Remember, in the original Fox “News” story it wasn’t James Holmes that alerted the feds to the whereabouts of the notebook, it was a professor at the school who had a package that he mistakenly thought was from Holmes. Turns out, there was another package that was. 

#834 

Don't forget he (Holmes’ father) worked for RAND as well, the mind control factor in all this is monumental, father and son involved neuro programming. 

I've been suspicious of that psychiatrist, wondering if he even had one, but they can make things up to appear somewhat legit, the way that package was handled ""here it is! I have a package from the killer!!"" ""no. wait. false alarm."" ""wait, wait, wait!!! i have the right package from the killer!!!"" Latest it could have been mailed was the 19th if Holmes did it, but it arrives the 23rd according to the USPO postmaster (remember they tried saying it had been sitting at the school since the 12th? Postmaster called bs as I understand it). Turns out she got busted for writing prescriptions for xanax and other high powered drugs to herself and her husband. Her punishment? Don't do that anymore. Yep, that was it. So, my guess is, she'll do whatever they tell her, just as she was told to alert the authorities when ""the"" package came in, and screwed it up royally. I have a hunch she'll say anything about him they want her to, oh yeah, he was crazy, oh yeah, he talked about killing everyone, oh yeah, he had an anger issue. Oh yeah.

&gt; James Holmes Family Tied To DARPA And Mind Manipulation Work
&gt; July 26, 2012
&gt; By Wayne Madsen
&gt;
&gt; Aurora massacre: several links between James Holmes and U.S. government research (Salk Institute involved in neurologically enhancing soldiers' abilities on battlefield...connections to DARPA)
&gt;
&gt; James Holmes, the 24-year old suspect in the mass shooting of Batman ""The Dark Knight Rises"" movie goers in Aurora, Colorado that left 12 people dead and 58 injured, has had a number of links to U.S. government-funded research centers. Holmes's past association with government research projects has prompted police and federal law enforcement officials to order laboratories and schools with which Holmes has had a past association not to talk to the press about Holmes.
&gt;
&gt; Holmes was one of six recipients of a National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Training Grant at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver. Holmes is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside with a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience. Although Holmes dropped out of the PhD neuroscience program at Anschutz in June, police evacuated two buildings at the Anschutz center after the massacre at the Aurora movie theater. Holmes reportedly gave a presentation at the Anschutz campus in May on Micro DNA Biomarkers in a class titled ""Biological Basis of Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders.""
&gt;
&gt; Initial reports of Holmes having an accomplice in the theater shooting have been discounted by the Aurora police. However, no explanation has been given by police why the Anschutz campus buildings were evacuated after Holmes was already in custody in the Arapahoe County jail.
&gt;
&gt; The Anschutz Medical Campus is on the recently de-commisioned site of the U.S. Army's Fitzsimons Army Medical Center and is named after Philip Anschutz, the billionaire Christian fundamentalist oil and railroad tycoon who also owns The Examiner newspaper chain and website and the neo-conservative Weekly Standard. The Anschutz Medical Campus was built by a $91 million grant from the Anschutz Foundation. Where are the other 5 students studying?
&gt;
&gt; In 2006, at the age of 18, Holmes served as a research intern at the Salk Institute at the University of California at San Diego in La Jolla. It is noteworthy that for the previous two years before Holmes worked at the Salk Institute, the research center was partnered with the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Columbia University, University of California at San Francisco, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wake Forest University, and the Mars Company (the manufacturers of Milky Way and Snickers bars) to prevent fatigue in combat troops through the enhanced use of epicatechina, a blood flow-increasing and blood vessel-dilating anti-oxidant flavanol found in cocoa and, particularly, in dark chocolate.
&gt;
&gt; The research was part of a larger DARPA program known as the ""Peak Soldier Performance Program,"" which involved creating brain-machine interfaces for battlefield use, including human-robotic bionics for legs, arms, and eyes. DARPA works closely with the Defense Science Office on projects that include the medical research community. Fitzsimons was at the forefront of DARPA research on the use of brain-connected ""neuroprosthetic"" limbs for soldiers amputated or paralyzed in combat.
&gt;
&gt; According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes's father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a ""neural network"" company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing ""cortronic neural networks,"" which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans. The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software's chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.
&gt;
&gt; It has also emerged that Holmes, when he was 20, worked as a camp counselor at Camp Max Straus of the Jewish Big Brothers and Sister of Los Angeles. According to the Jewish Journal, among other tasks, Holmes helped to teach boys between the ages of 7 to 10 archery. In another unusual detail, the car Holmes used to drive to the Aurora movie theater had Tennessee plates. Holmes is originally from San Diego.
&gt;
&gt; James Holmes is the grandson of Lt. Col. Robert Holmes, one of the first Turkish language graduates of the Army Language School, later the Defense Language Institute, in Monterey, California. Graduating from the Turkish language class in 1948, Holmes spent a career in the Army, which likely included more than a few intelligence-related assignments. Typically, U.S. military officers conversant in Turkish served with either the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency at either the U.S. embassy in Ankara or the Consulate General in Istanbul, or both.
&gt;
&gt; Terrence Sejnowski, the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the director of the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, in an interview with Cognitive Science Online in 2008, had the following comment about recent studies of the human brain: ""Alan Newell [cognitive psychology researcher at the intelligence community-linked RAND Corporation] once said that when AI [artificial intelligence] was founded not enough was known about the brain to be of any help and in the early 1980s, symbol processing was the only game in town. That has changed and we now know a lot about the brain, perhaps more than we need to know [emphasis added].""
&gt;
&gt; More than we need to know!
&gt;
&gt; The links between the younger and elder Holmes and U.S. government research on creating super-soldiers, human brain-machine interfaces, and human-like robots beg the question: ""Was James Holmes engaged in a real-life Jason Bourne TREADSTONE project that broke down and resulted in deadly consequences in Aurora, Colorado?"" In any event, if the Batman movies are now serving as a newer version of J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" subliminal messaging triggering mechanism, -- Salinger's novel was of interest to a number of American political assassins -- keep in mind that August 10 is the opening date of The Bourne Legacy. It may be wise to skip that film in the theater for a while.

Did anyone listen to Toldce's interview which I posted here yesterday? It is not far from the realm of speculation that mind control techniques could and were used on Holmes, V2S (voice to skull) technology-the victim hears voices broadcast to his skull that no one else can hear, possibly sending him to see a psychiatrist. Mind control techniques have been studied and used for nearly 100 years, speculation that Holmes was a victim of this by evil factions to attain a specific goal(s) is not impossible, in fact, looking at his direct connections to such people, it is more than likely the truth of the matter.
#856 Holmes' defense attorneys claim he was a ""psychiatric patient"" of the medical director of Anschutz's Student Mental Health Services prior to the Aurora shooting; however, the prosecution disagrees with that claim.[36][37]

James Holmes' Psychiatrist Contacted University Police Weeks Before Movie-Theater Shooting: ABC Exclusive

Report: James Holmes' Psychiatrist Was Concerned

17 Comments


By MARK GREENBLATT (@greenblattmark) , CAROL McKINLEY and MIKE GUDGELL
Aug. 6, 2012

The psychiatrist who treated suspected movie-theater shooter James Holmes made contact with a University of Colorado police officer to express concerns about her patient's behavior several weeks before Holmes' alleged rampage, sources told ABC News.

The sources did not know what the officer approached by Dr. Lynne Fenton did with the information she passed along. They said, however, that the officer was recently interviewed, with an attorney present, by the Aurora Police Department as a part of the ongoing investigation of the shooting.

Fenton would have had to have serious concerns to break confidentiality with her patient to reach out to the police officer or others, the sources said. Under Colorado law, a psychiatrist can legally breach a pledge of confidentiality with a patient if he or she becomes aware of a serious and imminent threat that their patient might cause harm to others. Psychiatrists can also breach confidentiality if a court has ordered them to do so.

""For any physician to break doctor-patient confidentiality there would have to be an extremely good reason,"" said Dr. Carol Bernstein, a psychiatrist at NYU Langone Medical Center and past president of the American Psychiatric Association.

Bernstein has no specific knowledge of the Holmes case and spoke in general terms.

""Confidentiality is a key part of the doctor-patient relationship,"" she said. ""It is central to everything we do.""

ABC news and affiliate KMGH-TV in Denver first reported Wednesday that Fenton had contacted other members of the university's threat-assessment team about her concerns. The university-wide, threat-assessment team reportedly never met to discuss Holmes after he announced his intent to withdraw from the University nearly six weeks before the July 20 shooting that left 12 dead and 58 injured.

University of Colorado spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery declined to comment on what, if anything, the university police officer might have done with information provided by Fenton, citing a court-issued gag order preventing her from confirming or denying any information related to Fenton or the investigation.

In a written statement to ABC News, however, the university said campus police officers are ""frequently involved"" in meetings of the university's Behavioral Evaluation and Threat Assessment (BETA) team.

The statement went on to say that police involvement with threat assessment ""could include security matters, badge access, background checks, wellness checks, criminal investigations and referrals and outreach to other law enforcement agencies.""

An attorney for Fenton declined to comment.

#878 (reply) I still think Fenton is a junkie and was approached ""months before"" regarding submitting false information regarding Holmes, in exchange for her job. Records are easy to fudge if you know ahead of time you need to.

I think someone was messing with his mind to the point they got him to uncharacteristically begin failing classes for the first time in his life, creating the impression of a desperate individual, whom the pressure drove mad. Perhaps it was Fenton who was given the task of initially inducing him via hypnosis, then others took over-usually, to be hypnotized one must trust the hypnotist. After that, post hypnotics can be used to turn over control to others. It seems far fetched but I've heard several women who've come out of governmental satanic abuse who said this is exactly what they do. They can make the victim think they are someone else and not recognize their true identity, it's fascinating stuff, and not that difficult to do.

I've heard rumors that the notebook has been thrown out of evidence.

Interesting point in the huff (huffington post) article above. First it mischaracterizes the Temporal Illusion presentation. He (James Holmes) was not saying that one could change reality, what he was talking about was memory modification involved in memory encoding and retrieval-post occurance memory modification and unconscious transference. He was not saying reality and time actually changes. 

Basically, dancing around post hypnotic commands of amnesia, or similar. This is very nearly investigating mind control and it's effects on the brain.
He was one of the top neuroscience researchers in any college from what I could learn.

Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door.

7y634y,3,2018-02-17,Need help/advice about moving on and healing,queerbabe,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/7y634y/need_helpadvice_about_moving_on_and_healing/,"I broke up with my girlfriend of two years in December. She cheated on me and lied by omission and expected me to stay and get over things in less than a month. We were going through another round of cross continent ldr. 

Her only parent passed away that fall while we were a part which was super hard on her, and in turn hard on us and myself. Before all of that my only complaints were that I need more space because she wanted to talk on the phone everyday for hours and hours, and that I missed her so much t was affecting my mental health.

But once she finally told me how she soberly kissed the person she had feelings for and vice versa the house came down. She admitted she only told me because I had been so good about her telling me she was attracted to this new friend of hers (I don’t have any issues around jealousy and was fine with her thinking someone else is hot, as long as she didn’t act on it.) after the kiss they expressed to each other that, had it been another time or world or some shit like that they’d be together (other person also in a long term ldr) she drunkenly told me 5 days after the fact ands also that this person tried to kiss her every time they hung out for the past two weeks. She was going to wait till she arrived at my doorstep over the holidays to tell me this but drunk her decided that I might not even care and be understanding. She didn’t think it would hurt me. All this 2 weeks before her flight to stay with me for a month. Had her mother not passed away so recently I would have never considered trying to work through all this.

She hadn’t even gotten on the plane and she tells me I should be over it by now and it’s not fair to her for me to be upset about it this long. When I told her I wasn’t sure if it was a good idea for her to stay at my apartment, she flipped. She said how could I tell her not to come visit me and why wouldn’t I let her come take care of me?? That she had already checked into the flight(a totally lie this was 5 whole days before the flight) there was no way she could get a refund and cancel. Girl, I suggested you stay somewhere else, I didn’t say don’t come, and I paid for over half her ticket. I told her we needed a break before she actually checked in.

Cut to her being here, I am 100% taking care of her emotionally and doing most of the cleaning. She pays for most of our meals out, which are quite frequent and often lavish in an attempt to win me back. She’s lashing out at me at random without warning but expecting me to still want to be near here and want to comfort her. The whole time I had to dance around her feelings as not to upset her even more in fear of how badly she was already lashing out. Not to mention one night after Christmas I was so sad about us being over I was near tears, but she’s “finally feeling good” and “doesn’t want to bring her mood down” so we cuddle and listen to music without talking because she’s texting people back where she’s from. I start to cry because I can’t believe she’s treating me like this and she ignores me for like 15 minutes saying she’s comforting a friend..... a friend over seas who she only met in September rather than the person she was in a relationship with for almost 2 years who’s heart she just broke and says she’s still in love with.

Eventually I couldn’t take it and I booked a flight to visit family, leaving her have my apartment to herself, for nothing in return, but any empty fridge and my apartment so messy it took me a half a day to clean up after her. When i confronted her she tried to blame me saying I left the apparent messy “so it was only fair.” I left a few dishes in the sink, and had done all the vacuuming till then when I finally said enough it’s your turn. That’s the mess I left.....

Once I’m with my family I start to see the abuse I hadn’t been able to see when I was under her spell. Her toxic jealousy. She once nearly broke up with me because I was up late editing interviews. One of the guys I interviewed was flirting with me over text while I was trying to get his info to put in the credits even though I ignored all of his advances. At the time I didn’t see how bad this was, all I could think of was how I didn’t want to lose her over some boy that flirts with everyone and didn’t even like. Her taking my emotional labour for granted, her controlling me by insisting on paying for most of our dates and using it for leverage when she wanted. She was working full time and I was a full time student with a low paying internship FFS. Don’t even get me started on how she never wanted to hangout with 90% of my friends because she had social anxiety even when it was just one of them, but was always the most outgoing person ever in a room of strangers and could make anyone a friend at the drop of a hat.

I used to playfully slap her bum when I got annoyed at her and vice versa. One day I playfully do this and she smacks me hard on my arm and tells me never to do that again. I still remember how badly it stung and the shock, but she said she did it in retaliation. For some reason I believed that a hit meant to hurt someone was the same as a playful  bum slap, that until that moment she had been ok with and she had done the same to me. I haven’t told anyone about this because I feel ashamed that we used both playfully slap each others bums. It seems so childish and stupid now. Part of me still blames myself that one hit because I chose to engage in playful bum slaps.

She belittled me a lot through our relationship, instead of expressing her issues maturely. When I told her this  was bully behaviour she cried and said I was being hurtful to her. She expected me to always be the bigger person to the point where when I would bring up her emotional immaturity and she would say “but you’re the good one.”

I was always there to comfort her and talk things out. When I was upset I was overreacting or too emotional. When I upset her she would ice me out for a minimum of a few hours going up to four days.

She had a hard childhood/life she alluded to but never once told me full details on. Having gone through tough stuff myself I respected that she didn’t want to talk about it. Now I see the difference was I had either worked through my stuff or I was working through it. She was/is still repressing it all.

I used to have a problem with yelling when I was upset. My parents fought and yelled a lot even to this day and never hid it from me. One parent in particular still has a short temper and yells at me or anyone easily before calming down and realizing yelling is not appropriate. Before dating my ex I didn’t even know yelling was wrong. I thought it was a natural part of arguing with a partner. Half the time i didn’t even realize I was yelling. She helped me realize it was wrong and through her help and me seeing a counsellor I have successfully stopped yelling when I am upset or angry. I say this to show I was not perfect all the way through and that she did have her moments in the beginning where she helped me grow emotionally which I will always be thankful for.

This was the first serious relationship for both of us so I had nothing to compare things to and told myself most couples must be like this.

We never got to hash out what happened and have a mature convo about all the reasons we were over, partly because she was so emotionally volatile and also because it was kind of too soon. We said we be friends but this was before I realized how hurt I was/am.

I also now know she was gaslighting me through our relationship thanks to a recent conversation where she told me that I said x  happened but I was wrong, actually y happened. All this was in a very  convincing manner, but I luckily had a clear memory and insisted that x really did happen and not y like she said. She then admits she made it up because that’s what she hoped had happened but couldn’t remember. There were times in the past where she did this but my memories were fuzzier so agreed with her because she seemed so sure of herself and I trusted her.

I could go on but I’ll stop here with telling the past and explain the present. She wants to be friends, used to text everyday till she got a hint when I only responded a couple times a week. In a way I still love her as a person and care about her wellbeing. But I am so conflicted about is being friends because I don’t know if it’s healthy for me. I hate the idea of never speaking with her again, and won’t happen anytime soon as I am still storing some important stuff for her. But as of now I’ve noticed all the toxic behaviours. I rotate through short quickly phases of missing her, hating her, feeling like I never even knew her, being happy we aren’t together anymore and then repeat.

How do I help myself get out of this cycle? Unfortunately I can’t afford therapy atm.

Is this a person I should work towards zero contact with? (I already feel guilty for blocking her in anger on the social media we share links etc on if it’s not text) Or is she maybe someone that overtime it could be healthy to be only friends with her? She is so smart and funny and talented, she just needs to work on her toxic emotional behaviour...I’m sorry I’m so all over the place. I feel like I’m in a void trying to find the right direction out of this headspace so I can heal and build trust with good people."

I started doing this for myself but thought I’d share this very real and scary timeline with this community in hopes that it could help someone in someway, shape or form. 

I wanted to add my location as I feel like I am in an area that’s stricken with drug abuse, perhaps some of you are close and I’d love to find someone on a similar journey. 

Stage 1: Intro to MaryJane
It all started at 15, I hit my first pipe. It was a tin foil pipe and a nickel bag of some mid grade herb. I could still remember the smell, the taste, the exact moment of my first hit. I would smoke randomly after that (once or twice a month) until about senior year of high school. Back then I thought, “This smells good, tastes good, makes me feel good so why not?” My dad was an alcoholic so when my friends first began to start drinking I thought I could use weed to replace it and still have fun at some parties.

Stage 2: High school
My friends and I would smoke daily in my senior year of high school - mountain rides after school - another mountain ride before bed rinse and repeat for a solid year.  I also started smoking cigs here too (Marlboro Reds). We use to split a gram between 4 people or so, so throwing $5 for a ride didn’t seem that bad. Within a year I was attending ounce parties and got my own glass pipe and learned how to roll blunts. My use was really picking up now to daily use. I can remember sneaking buds off friends as they always asked me to roll the blunt because I was gifted with twisting up beautiful blunts that burned forever. 

Stage 3: College
College, I had a lot of free time and money.
I had some relationship with both bright minded people and some beautiful women but pushed them away as I didn’t care or even realize the social foundation that I could have been building on in college. I was getting fucked up every day. Drinking on weekends, adderoll for tests, mushrooms/DMT, Xanax, couple two tree lines of coke at parties, whippets, opium - just a lot of drugs all around... I had some amazing, unforgettable times with great people but at the end of it I didn’t know what I wanted in school. I didn’t know what I wanted with life. I didn’t perform exceceedingly well in school but I still managed to pass all my classes. I had internships but passed up on a lot of opportunities. I ended up taking the easier internships that left me in my comfort bubble. This is also when I went through a big depression stage as graduation approached, almost like a quarter life crisis. 

Stage 4: Graduating college
Towards the end of college I cleaned up for 30 days to pass a drug test for an internship. I ended up smoking 2 days before my drug test and used my sisters pee strapped to my leg to pass... and somehow I did pass. I got an amazing internship at one of the best companies in my area. I was around very smart &amp; successful people each day. I was so mentally cloudy and constantly wondering how no one knew, this is when I really began feeling like I had a substance abuse problem. I couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t remember a damn thing, I had hundreds of post it notes on my desk of things I had to do or remember. I had to write down conversations that I just had. I swear I could hear my brain cells popping in my head. 

Stage 5: Full time job
My internship led to a full time job (somehow) so I landed my first entry level IT job. At this point I’m 24 and still living at home making more money than my mother was. My daily routine would be go to work and come home to blaze. At this point, I stopped drinking and doing pills. I also stopped smoking cigs around this point. I had a gf that would put up with all my shit. She loved to smoke too. I was in my moms house, in my room smoking all day, alone for a large majority of it. I was buyin over quarter a week. Smoking from 5pm-2am every day. I would go into work with the biggest bags under my eyes- deep blue/purple in color. Everyone would always say how tired I looked. I was not doing shit in my free time. No travels, no movement, just playing video games... how sad. Just a bunch of fucking wasted time. I stopped hanging out with friends, everything I did outside of work I had to do while I was stoned. My headaches would be so bad at this point. I had severe migraines that would last for hours and they would occur every day.  I didn’t lift, my diet was shit. Sex life was terrible as marijuana abuse and porn addiction does come hand in hand. I was barely functioning at work. Passing up more opportunities because of anxiety. I couldn’t even talk. My mind and my body were disconnected. The words I would think would not come out of my mouth. I felt like such a fucking dumbass. My relationships were all shit, my friends are fucked up and only wanted to blaze, drink, do coke, anything that revolves around abusing a substance. I’m stuck in the same town, doing the same shit, day after day. I became angry with myself. 

Stage 6: Rock bottom 
I tried to quit for months. I would buy weed and smoke, get overwhelmed with anxiety and throw away all the weed I just purchased. I’d be sober for maybe 24hrs and hit up my dude and go buy more again. I even began to dig through the trash when I returned home from work in hopes I would find the weed I threw out in the morning before I left. I would feel so terrible but I would just keep doing this rinse and repeat for roughly 2 months. I would smoke blunts back to back. Not even 30 minutes in between each one.  One night my heart was racing as I lit up a blunt in my room, alone. I knew this was the last time. I made a video of myself and I honestly just starting crying, smoking, asking myself “Why? Why am I so addicted - look at yourself right now - look how fucking terrible you look - look at your room - the same room you’ve been in for years doing nothing, look at how terrible you feel, look at this wasted potential, get your shit together!”

Enough is enough, it’s time to get my shit together. I want more out of my life. I really need to push myself to be the best version I could be. I knew I had a problem. I knew I was an addict. Decided to get sober once and for all. Told everyone I had a problem. Told my mom how fucked up I was. I told my friends where I’ve been hiding for the past few years and that I will no longer be blazing with them. It felt SO FUCKING GOOD to finally tell people about my problem. I deleted all my dealers from my phone, deleted every picture of weed I had, deleted herb entirely from my life, threw hundreds of dollars worth of glass off a bridge... *splash... sink* Took a week off of work to sober up, get sick, cry and die. I broke things off with my girlfriend of 4 years as our relationship was fucked beyond repair, a lot of that was due to my addiction but I couldn’t sulk in it any longer. I need to heal myself, and I need to do it alone. I moved out of my moms house and got my own apartment. (The money I was spending on weed alone pays my rent and then some). 

Stage 7: Recovery 
I’m now 26. I try not to sulk in my thoughts about the previous stages of my life but man is it hard. I believe this is part of sobriety and recovery. I need to feel these emotions and learn how to deal with them rather than suppressing them. My brain hurts, my heart hurts but things are slowly beginning to get better. I count the weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds of my sobriety.  I’m trying to use every negative thought in my life for fuel to my fire as I move forward. My dedication now is to my family, my career, my health, my spirituality and not to Mary Jane. I am giving everyone the best version of myself. I am trying to repair damage with loved ones and friends. I have a long road ahead of me. A road that is just beginning.  I cant wait to see what this next stage has in store for me. 

Please don’t ever think you are alone. So many people deal with substance abuse, specifically abuse with marijuana. I wish I had a Marijuana anonymous group around my area but I’ve yet to find one. I’m very skeptical about going to AA as I know some people kind of think about marijuana addiction as a joke. I really am looking to surround myself with sober people or people in recovery. A steady DM session with a few of you leavers would also help. I thank you all so much for sharing your stories here on leaves. This is a wonderful community and has helped me out so much. Feel free to ask any questions you have about my journey or about yours. Good Luck. R"

I just wanted to see if any of you had any ideas for improving my application for my odds the next time around. I was fortunate to have 2 interviews during this last cycle, but no acceptances. 

In terms of my stats I have a 3.9 GPA, 312 GRE, well over 6000 hrs of paid clinical/direct patient contact work, which will be closer to 8,000 by the time the next cycle rolls around. These hours are derived from a wide array of clinical experiences ranging from lab work to dosimetry to patient check-in/transportation/assisting in surgery/minor suturing, etc...

My hours have come from being enrolled in a paid internship program from which several of my fellow co-workers have been accepted into various Med/PA programs. I also have a LOR from a department head of the local medical school (and my alma mater) who runs the program itself and who has sent countless med students/PA students to various programs around the country. 

I'm going to remain in the program for one more cycle/year as I can't find another position that pays as well, or offers nearly the amount of exposure to such a wide variety of experiences, but I'm wondering what else I might be able to do to better my odds. 

I contacted my alma mater at which I had an interview and asked them for any advice, but was simply told that they take a ""holistic"" approach when evaluation applicants and that they can't/don't/won't offer and specific advice. 

I'm open to any and all suggestions, so please feel free to offer any ideas that you think may help.

Thanks. "
7y7hpw,1,2018-02-17,[Investing] Discussion about Long Term Total Market Index Investing Strategy,jhonnyonthespot15,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7y7hpw/investing_discussion_about_long_term_total_market/,"Format edits


**PREFACE:**

I’m fairly young and near the start of my career. During internships etc, I always contributed to my Roth IRA but did very little with those funds until recently. Over the past year I have become incredibly interested in FI/ER and general investment strategies for a variety life goals. I understand how important it is to get a jumpstart on financial health as soon as possible. I’m interested in setting myself up on the proper railroad tracks to direct my financial future to align with my best guess of where I want it to go, while maintaining flexibility because – well – life happens.

Something I read almost everywhere is along the lines of ""nobody can time the market, it's impossible. It's all about time IN the market. A cornerstone of your investments should be low cost total stock market index tracking funds. Prices go up? Great, you've made money. Prices go down? Great, shares are on sale. Just keep buying, no matter what. Automate as much of the process as you can to remove yourself as much as possible. Losses are only realized if you panic and sell when the market is down. Generally, market entry via initial lump sum investments perform better overall than legging in with dollar cost averaging, but always keep contributing once you establish a position.""

While I agree that trying to time the market is a fool's errand, I believe a compromise must exist. I think a “pseudo-timing” method based on a long-term indicator would yield better return as well as freedom to use your money as you want. I also think that countless people 100x smarter than me must have thought of similar ideas, so why do I never read anything about them? Are underlying assumptions in my/similar approaches flawed? Have I simply made math errors? Is it pointless to only look at the growth of a lump sum without the effects of future contributions over time (still working on that)? Constructive criticism, suggestions to improve my “first cut” estimates, etc are very welcomed!


**THE COMPROMISE:**

Apply a simple long-term indicator to pseudo-time the general trend of the market. People seem to generally accept the 200 day simple moving average as a reasonable long-term indicator. Instead of blindly buying regardless of market condition, why not follow a few basic trading guidelines:
*Lump sum establish position buy signal: price rises above 200 day simple moving average (or a certain % above)
*Sell all signal: price falls below 200 day simple moving average (or a certain % below)
*Continue regular contributions when receiving buy signal

As an example I went through the history of Vanguard’s total stock market fund, VTSMX, and identified most of the buy/sell points according to this strategy. While this is a more active approach that is less “set and forget it” than buy-and-hold, it historically seems to require only a handful of actions per decade. I admit that it also requires more touch time because many people like to automatically deduct amounts from their paychecks and send it straight into these types of long-term funds. With my proposed method, it may make more sense to send those deductions to the money market/cash section of portfolio so it doesn’t buy funds when you are gettubg sell signals. Additionally, this 200 day strategy requires more trades and assumes you do not pay any fees/commissions for trading (eg, trading VTSMX in a Vanguard account).

**COMMENTS:**

Realize that this strategy never attempts to buy in at the very bottom or sell out at the very top; it simply tries to limit risk by avoiding the bulk of massive drawdowns, and it seems to outperform a simple buy-and-hold [Returns](https://i.imgur.com/omW8azC.png). This comparison assumes that any growth over time is included whenever you buy back in (eg, started with $10k, sold at $12k, buy back in with $12k). This comparison does not include any further contributions over time. It simply shows what % growth happens to a certain $ over time given the two strategies. I am working on what it looks like when you employ the 200 day strategy PLUS dollar cost average contributions whenever there is a buy signal. So far it also shows 200 day &gt;&gt; buy-and-hold, but I am not satisfied enough with the fidelity that model to post yet.

Another advantage of this strategy is it seems to allow more flexibility with your money. Market in a multi-year bear run? With buy-and-hold, your investment to that point seems frozen – if you want/need cash, you are stuck taking losses (conversely, seems like if you are committed to this strategy and have the cash flow and emergency funds to do so, this would be a great time to suck up extra shares for cheap). Following the 200 day, you were **out at a reasonable price** (but not the highest), and can put that money to work elsewhere and/or reinvest it once a strong buy signal reappears.

**TLDR:**

Most people tend to agree that long term investing in total market funds similar to VTSMX is a good idea. Timing the market is not possible, but it seems like following a long-term indicator can increase returns dramatically and allow more flexibility with your portfolio. I showed the historic difference in growth if you simply buy-and-hold a lump sum amount versus long-term indicator buy and sells. I am working to improve my model that explores the historic growth difference between the strategies while including dollar cost averaging after initial lump sum investment. So far, I think that will also show buy-and-hold as inferior.

I understand that past events do not guarantee future results. Please remember that I’m just some guy on the internet with an idea seeking comments, but little investing experience so far. It’s possible I’ve made stupid mistakes/assumptions. I’m trying to soak up as much information as I can. Constructive criticism, suggestions to improve my “first cut” estimates, general insight from more experienced investors, etc are very welcomed!

Whether or not gun control will help lower the number of Mass Shootings in America does not really matter.  That is a debate that is scheduled to go on for at least another 10 years. Lets do something before that.  
It’s time to stop knocking on the closed door. There is not enough time. There is not enough time to sit and wait for change.  Change needs to happen and it can be put together and implemented before next September.  
SO – Here is an idea. Lets just start addressing the need for Mental Health Services in schools. I’m not in elementary school or high school anymore. I don’t pay attention to them honestly and I have no children.  I don’t know if services similar to the ones I am bringing up are available. 
I know that when I was in high school, there were guidance counselors assigned to alphabetic sections of students, and they told us about college. I never saw my guidance counselor as a therapist or someone I could discuss my depression with. I never felt the presence of mental health services being available in school. If it is now, I just don't know that.  Perhaps the following will be redundant. I am curious what people will see as Pro’s and Con’s to the following idea…. 

So, If I was in control, or a DeVos, I would instigate the following:

The Installation of a “Student Therapeutic Services” Location in every school District.

Summary: 
Every School District in the U.S. will have a Psychiatrist and a Licensed Therapist or Psychologist appointed to a newly created “Student Therapeutic Services office” in their district. School Districts will be required to have one Therapist available for every 500 students. Psychiatrists will be available but only for Psych Evals, not to rx medications – Student who would benefit from medication would need to have their parents contacted and consulted and then be referred out.  Therapists may be interns but will have hours signed off by Head District Therapist.

The “Student Therapeutic Services Office” location for available Mental Health Groups and Individual Therapy sessions. Also in that location will be tutoring, College information, and “xyz” program headquarters. As needed. The Center will have other things like College info session and xyz so that students will be able to say they are going for that reason and save face. 

When a teacher or administrator has a feeling a student will benefit from counseling or a session of some sort, an incentive for the student to visit that location after school will be made. Extra Credit etc. Students might be able to earn a form of CEU from group therapy session in specific areas – anger mgmt., Substance abuse, Physical or sexual abuse, Depression, anxiety, etc. 

When a student is “red flagged” by instructors or administration, one of the therapists will come to the school and meet with the student within 24hrs. The student will be interviewed, assessed, and offered services. If the services are refused, client will be given referrals and parents will be contacted to inform of referrals.

In addition to teachers and administrators being able to notify the Therapeutic Services department, other Students (Peers) will also be given an anonymous opportunity to report students who may need to be helped. Upon peer reference, Mental Health dept staff will contact 2-3 of students’ current instructors and check if they too agree if student is in need of services.

WHO PAYS?  - Pretty sure the Gun Lobby/Manufacturers / NRA would be very supportive financially when the issue is pointed more at mental health than their guns!

Whatcha think?"

Without going too much into my sob story, I'm a non-traditional full-time student slowly realizing I am in no way setting myself up to be competitive for the internship application process at my school when I graduate next year (hopefully anyways). I'm running myself ragged enough just trying to stay on top of my grades, a part-time job, and maintain a decent home life. I'm beginning to think it would be better to simply finish my Nutrition Sciences degree, get some job experience, and then re-attack the internship when I have some hours under my belt. Unfortunately, I constantly get the feeling within my department and the AND circle I try to run with that if you don't have an RD, you're nothing. Consistently seeing required RD credentials in local job listings don't help either. I don't want to come this far and then fall flat simply because I didn't have hundreds of hours to dedicate to working at a food bank like my peers. I'm super excited for these individuals because they seem to really have their stuff together and I want nothing but the best for them, but comparing my incomplete ""tick-boxes"" to their completed ones is really wearing me down.

So, what sort of job's should I be looking for? Is there anything even out there for non-RD's? I don't even know if I'm cut out for applying feed tubes and working in a clinical setting anyways. I'm really passionate about food insecurity and simply helping people that are suffering. What entry-level positions that bring in at least some decent pay would you suggest? If you have any other advice, I'm completely open to that as well."

Hello! 

I applied for an internship program and I was short listed. My application was sent to companies and now those companies will decide whether to invite me for an interview or not. I really want to get this internship. Please I need some suggestions...

The thing is that there are more than 100 people were shortlisted from my local university and the companies will decide which candidate to invite and not for an interview.  The competition is high. I asked my university and they said that from now on everything will depend on them since I already passed the preliminary application stage and they sent my application along with other 100s of applications to hosting companies. So, I am so dependent on their mood or need... 

Do you think it is a bad idea to try to connect with those companies and send them an email? There are not so many companies, but there are more than 100 candidates for a few spots. If I do send them an email what is the best of way of expressing my interest without being pushy? I understand they are busy and will decide whether to invite me or not, but I want to use all possible ways to connect with them and tell them about me, my skills, and the abilities. 

Thank you and have a great weekend!

----------------------------------------------
I have realized that when I respond to questions about my profession with “I predict the future!” I get much more enthusiastic responses than the comparatively bland “I am an actuary.” By and large, that is what actuaries do: we project losses, premiums, and expenses in order to accurately price insurance products. But the profession represents so much more to me: Insurance is a crucial boon to society, allowing people to take risks and recover from disaster. I love going to work every day and doing my part to keep that system solvent, so that insurance coverage is both affordable and widely available. The best next step I can take to further that aim is enrolling in Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA) program. This program will help me develop the tools and mindset needed to more effectively pursue the various passions I have developed through my career: solving emergent business problems, thinking critically, and most importantly, helping people.

Growing up just outside the Washington D.C. beltway exposed me to economic policy concerns and the ways in which governments and the private sector respond to economic trends. When I entered university, this interest led me to dual-major in Economics and Statistics, which culminated in a summer internship at a major public policy think tank, XXX. That experience was invaluable, bolstering my interest in data by allowing me access to government longitudinal surveys on which I ran regression studies. It also made me realize that due to the way such research is inevitably politicized (or so I believed, perhaps naively), I would prefer to pursue a career where the connection between the work and the results was more tangible. However, I still wanted to work in a field that I believed would better society, which led me to insurance. I’ve maintained a keen interest in economics and policy and one thing that increasing my analytics capabilities would allow me to do would be to explore the relationships that can be unearthed between macroeconomic data and insurance data.

My current role as an actuary at XXX Insurance further solidified my excitement for the stories that can be told through solid data analysis. I have developed a tool using Python that collects and runs calculations on insurance data which allows for the exploration of how premiums may need to change under various scenarios in the challenging California market. This tool greatly expedited a previously manual process and allows for a quicker response to business realities. I have also developed regional metrics that combine market penetration data with measures of how adequate our insurance rates are, and mapped these metrics using R. This work was a principle input into a growth plan developed to ensure XXX was writing new business as widely as possible while also reacting to the growing wildfire risk in certain regions of the country.
 
While these and other contributions have significantly impacted business outcomes at XXX, I am concerned that traditional actuarial skill sets (including my own) are not evolving quickly enough. I love my job, but my job is necessarily going to change in exciting ways and I want to be an agent for this change. Insurance companies already have access to an enormously complex and manifold wealth of data and new sources are becoming available rapidly. With the knowledge gained in the OMSA program, I hope to expand on my ability to tap into this data, build insights with cutting-edge statistical modeling techniques, and execute on business objectives. This program is especially attractive to me because its interdisciplinary nature aligns so well with the actuarial profession, which itself represents a synthesis of various disciplines.

I plan to continue my career while pursuing the M.S., already having demonstrated the organizational skills and drive to succeed in such an arrangement: I completed the extensive actuarial credentialing process while working full-time, passing all ten exams on the first attempt. The material on these exams, my college coursework, and online classes have given me a solid foundation in the mathematical and computational prerequisites for the program, and I think I am set up to succeed in it. I additionally plan to take one of the foundational edX MicroMasters courses this coming summer. Enrolling in the OMSA program is the best career move I can make right now and will set me on the path where I can most ably achieve my long-term career goals, which include becoming the Chief Actuary of a major insurance company. Thank you for your consideration.

Bear with me.

I met my girlfriend Noel at university. We were both freshmen. I started at 25 because, quite frankly, I had been living rough for a few years and when I was 18, I had no interest in college. You can tell I was living rough. I'm scarred up from fights and hospital trips, and a lot of my older jackets still smell like smoke and whatever else, despite many cleanings. A lot of people describe how I look as ""intimidating.""

Noel and I were first ""just"" friends. We met in a chemistry lab, and this is going to sound cliche, but I knew when I met her that she was someone I was going to have in my life for a long time. She's over a foot shorter than me and soft-spoken, but I've never met someone so driven and fierce. She isn't afraid to work and refuses to be stepped on, and she certainly has a fiery temper, but she never loses it. So we became pretty good friends, and I felt myself open to her. Though we both tried dating other people, we ultimately gravitated toward one another. We started dating around October of 2016, and I've never once questioned being with her.

We've been so happy together. I love doing things for her. I love surprising her with little jokes. I love her stories about her day. I love her jokes. She's such a gorgeous woman. I feel her love every day we're together. I find love notes in the lunches I take to campus. She's always up before me in the morning and puts the coffee on. She's always playing with my hair and overall makes me feel loved. She makes me feel like I'm a good, worthwhile person, and I can't imagine not knowing her. By meeting her and being with her, I've also gained a good group of friends. Life is good.

That said, we're happy, but there are people who are not happy that we're together, and it's focused largely on me. The people who are most disapproving are my father, Noel's best friend, and Noel's older half sister.

My father is not happy that I'm with Noel. He doesn't trust that I'm ""fully reformed"" and feels like I'm playing Noel by being with her. He's been extremely hard on me for most of my life, and even now, as I'm getting good grades and doing a prestigious internship, he says he's just worried that I'll ""fall to pieces once again."" He loves to throw all of my past mistakes in my face. I wanted to bring Noel home to meet my family over Christmas (my mother is extremely excited to meet her), but I lost my nerve because of how my father talks about me. I don't know if I'm ready to have my father talk poorly of me to Noel, even if she already knows about the things he'll talk about.

Noel's best friend hasn't been able to let go of the age difference between us. I didn't want to date her at first because of this reason myself, especially since seven years is a LOT when the younger person is under 20. Her friend will not spend time with Noel if I'm going to be around, and she leaves after a few minutes if I come over to say hi to them during the day on campus. She's been thawing a little and will talk to me for a few minutes, but never more than that. Noel has spoken to her about it many times before, but it doesn't look like it'll improve much any time soon.

Lastly, Noel's older half-sister. Noel has an awesome family, and while they were wary of our relationship at first, her parents have come around and do like me, as does her younger brother. However, her older half-sister hates me. She surprised Noel and came into town once while I was sick with the flu and didn't look well; she proceeded to tell Noel's parents I must have been ""back on drugs."" Her parents thankfully took it with a grain of salt, but she's since been extremely hard on me. Noel asked her to stop coming around if she can't be nice. I still get pretty nervous if I know she's going to show up at a dinner with Noel's family or something, though.

I know this is the price I have to pay for the kind of past I have, but I really love Noel. She's been so supportive of me and has been firm with people who try to criticize me for things a long-time in my past. 

I guess my question is, how do we work around this? Noel already works really hard to make me feel more welcome with her family, but what can I do? What should I do? 


  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend and I are an unconventional pair that works well together. Due to my past, some of our relatives and friends aren't fond of me. Noel is doing what she can to get people to lay off of me, but is there anything I can do to make them like me more?"
7y9xqd,0,2018-02-17,Rainbow 12 Suggestion for Yandere Dev (repost),Fortunate-Teller,yandere_simulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/yandere_simulator/comments/7y9xqd/rainbow_12_suggestion_for_yandere_dev_repost/,"*I decided to repost this since Yandere Dev apparently wasn't checking Reddit when I originally posted it.*

Yandere Dev once posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YandereDev/status/691333371360751616) that he'd love to keep the Rainbow 12 in the game but that production might limit his options. I won't complain if the Rainbow 12 get removed from the game, but I'd rather not see that happen. I really like them. So I thought up a proposal for spreading them out into school clubs. I like the idea of putting all Rainbow 12 members in the same clubs as their male/female counterparts. Not all clubs need to have the same hair color for all their members. The Martial Arts Club, the Gardening Club, the Student Council, and the Anime and Gaming Club members all have varying hair colors. So here's my game plan.

**Kokona and Riku: Drama Club**, no question.

**Saki and Sora: Cooking Club.** I don't think this should be an all-female club. Guys cook too.

**Mei and Ryusei: Art Club.** Both of Mei's signature hairstyles (tritails and bun) have kind of an artsy vibe to them and Ryusei actually used to be in the Art Club, so some people may already associate him with it. Plus, they both wear glasses like Geiju Tsuka. I'm not saying every member of the club has to wear glasses but that could possibly be their trademark look.

**Koharu and Hayato: Gardening Club.** I also don't think this should be an all-female club either. Most professional gardeners are guys. Also, I think it's appropriate to have green-haired students in this club.

**Yuna and Sota: Sports Club**, because they're technically blonde. I know Yandere Dev said he wanted this to be an all-male club but, I mean, Asu is the president, so it's already mixed gender. But the rest of the members can still be male. Yuna would be the least athletic member of the club and Sota the second to least because they don't spend as much time training as the other members. They would both still be slightly more athletic than the average students though, just last in their club. They also might not be as tan as the other members either.

**Yui and Haruto:** When I was thinking of where to place these two evil redheads, the first thing that came to mind was the Science Club. But Yandere Dev already posted [silhouettes](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yandere-simulator/images/5/5c/MadScientists.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20160316072359) of those club members so I threw that idea out the window. Then I thought maybe there is one other club they might fit into. **The Info Club.** Now I know this sounds totally nuts but hear me out. Info-chan is a girl running who knows how many shifty operations. However, she is not the type of person to ever get her hands dirty when she doesn't have to. She spends all day, every day sitting at her computer in a locked room, never actually interacting with people face-to-face. We know she has criminal connections, so it would only stand to reason that she would have at least a few minions in the school for spying in the places her hidden cameras can't reach. Since the Info Club is exempt from school rules, Info-chan would only need to keep two informants handy. Yui, for gathering intel on the girls. And Haruto for gathering intel on the boys. One option could be that they're not actually official members of the club but are working to gain enough credit with Info-chan so that she will let them join the club by the end of the game. Like a pair of evil interns. Whether or not they do actually get in could depend on how the player interacts with them throughout the ten weeks, if at all.

They're the ones who would've gathered the additional information that already comes with the students' profiles, like the rumors surrounding the Basu sisters, the lies Ryuto tells his parents, and the bullies' true nature. This is why they spend so much time socializing with other students despite their evil personalities. However, they're not good at getting panty shots, which is where the player comes in. Maybe they also deliver the drop items to the Info Club too, outside of game hours so you wouldn't see it? I don't know . . . Here are some hypothetical ways of how they could work in daily gameplay.

- Yui and Haruto wouldn't wear any club accessories (at least nothing regular students would recognize as a club accessory) and as far as the other students know, neither of them are in any club. This is so the Info Club can remain a secret.

- Doing tasks for them may involve committing acts that go against school rules.

- If you send Info-chan a shot of Yui's panties, she'll say thanks and promise not to tell Yui about it.

- After school, Yui and Haruto would either spy on the other clubs or just go home. They would never enter the Info Club room and like Yandere-chan, they only communicate with Info-chan through their phones.

- A use for them could be getting access to restricted club items. Since none of the other students know they're in a club, you could pay them in panty shots (which they would use to get credit with Info-chan) to temporarily infiltrate a club and get you a member item for the day like a mask or the cello case. This would only work twice per club though, since there are only two of them, and would not apply to intangible club assets such as increased running speed or martial arts skill.

- They still won't report you for murder but they also still won't help you commit a murder or dispose of the body to avoid being an accomplice. They would also still participate in a group takedown to avoid suspicion. 

- They wouldn't refuse to talk to you after witnessing murder. It may also be possible that if they see you doing other crazy stuff, they won't drive your reputation down since they know your their boss's valued customer (or maybe not). Or perhaps, if you gossip with them, you won't lose reputation points because they feed all the gossip they get back to Info-chan.

- If you choose to kill either of them, Info-chan will still offer you her services, but she'll increase the price of her favors since you cost her a valuable source, which will set her back slightly.

If this idea totally clashes with Yandere Dev's vision for the Info Club and doesn't work at all, then it's okay. Perhaps Yui and Haruto could go into the Science Club or just be the one pair of the Rainbow 12 not in a club, since their evil personalities kind set them apart from the rest of the group. At any rate, at least consider the clubs I put the other students into. If there is absolutely no way to make the Rainbow 12 fit into the school population, then I guess they could also be NPCs in the small town if that gets implemented or inserted into 1980s Mode. I just wanted to put this idea out there. I love this game so much and also want it to keep as many of the original characters as possible.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!"
7yb8rk,23,2018-02-17,I'm new and just got tested positive for Huntingtons.,stephanieaj90,Huntingtons,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/7yb8rk/im_new_and_just_got_tested_positive_for/,"Hey everyone. My husband is a long time redditor and recommended me this sub-reddit to find people to talk to. 

The disease is on my dad's side, and has essentially wiped everyone out in their family. My great grandma, grandma, 2 uncles, and my dad all had it (and who knows how much further back it goes). My dad was diagnosed when I was 6, and most of my memories of him are of my ""sick dad"". Never really got to know my REAL dad, the man he was before he got sick. I thought Huntington's was a somewhat normal disease when I was younger because so many people in my life suffered from it.

I had always been afraid of being diagnosed with it the moment I found out it was genetic. I feared it my entire life, and I was so sure that I had it, but never had the balls to get tested. I just wanted my life to be mine, and not knowing was better than knowing for a long time.

I met my husband in undergrad school, and we had a daughter, (who is almost 3! D;) and got married and finally settled down in a house. My husband has always known about this disease being in my family. He did his internship in hospice care, and worked with 1-2 Huntington's patients, and he really grew to know the disease.  That's actually one of the reasons I married him because I knew if I did test positive, he'd take good care of me and would have an idea of what to do (though he's never actually lived with it).

About 2 years ago, I started experiencing some severe brain fog, short term memory problems, and trouble concentrating. I figured it was probably due to an anti-depressant I had been on for awhile so I decided to see a therapist &amp; psychiatrist. Nothing seemed to change, so my husband and I thought for sure I had ADD. But there was just that prominent sign poking out in front of my face every day that said HUNTINGTONS. I was in a much more secure place than I was when I used to want to get tested at 19 (good fucking thing I didn't). So I talked to my husband about how I wanted to get tested just to rule things out so I didn't have to keep suffering with not knowing. All of this crap going on right now was more worrisome than getting tested, so I got my blood drawn about a month ago.

My results appointment was for the 15th, and on the 8th, I found out I was pregnant, which was completely unexpected! I really wanted to believe it was something else that was wrong with me. Like, what horrible God/entity/etc. would make a sick woman pregnant, right? The minute I heard the counselor say, ""unfortunately"" I lost it. I had the exact same results as my dad too.

I have been a mess ever since. Not only am I pregnant, but now I have to hope that things won't progress any further than they already are now. This mental crap has been the worst thing to ever happen to me, and now it'll only get worse from here? Made some calls/texts to friends who were anxiously waiting for my results. A lot of people who didn't know what to say (obviously, and I don't blame them).  My husband has been extremely supportive and has been my rock these last few days. I have a lot of crying spells, as I'm sure a lot of you out there probably experienced. Right now, I am just so mad. I am mad at God and the world. I really wanted to put an end to this after all the beautiful souls that were taken away far too early. And I'm mad because I wasn't even 26 when I first had symptoms. How fucked up is that?!  Usually you don't start showing symptoms until your 30s or 40s (and I realize 26 is CLOSE to 30, but I am still in my 20s- I'm young). 

I was sort of spiraling last night and sobbing as I texted my husband when he was at work. My mom was completely against me getting tested because she knew it had ruined people when the results came back positive. And I tried to stay optimistic, like ""oh I've got a lot of support and at least getting a positive result at my age can get me into a lot of trials"". And I was so mad at myself last night. I wished so badly I could undo what I did. My world was mine and I was happy and it was just me living with symptoms with no known cause. A pregnant happy mom and wife. This completely broke me, and my poor husband has been picking up the pieces. I just feel like I'm going to be a terrible mom this time around because my cognitive skills suck. What if I have to do something really important for the baby and I'm stuck on auto-pilot? What if I miss something and the baby gets hurt/sick? And my 2 year old adores babies, so I think she'll be really into helping and whatnot, but there's only so much she can do.

Today was a good day though. Like I said, back and forth emotions. Yesterday I cried A LOT and today I was fine. Have my daughter here to hang out with, my mom is staying the night. I'm not crying myself to sleep and hyperventilating. Currently, I'm excited about this baby. I'm just so scared to see when and how soon more symptoms will arise. I think I was given my daughter when I was 24 so I can see her grow up and spend more time with her than my father did. I was so hopeful for that, but she's not even 3 and I'm already having issues /:

I'm so sorry for the long post. I even tried to make it short, but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it.

Going to look into support groups around here too, but I thought joining an online community so to speak would be helpful too. Any tips, information, or whatever you want to throw my way is appreciated. 

Hope to get to know some of you!"

Math is fairly easy for me and I loved Legos as a kid building my own creations. Around 15 I decided to pursue electrical engineering. 

Fast Forward to now, I'm 23 years old living in Washington State. Currently have an Associates in Science for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. And going to UW Tacoma to pursue my Bachelor's in Science starting Autumn of 2018 (hopefully). 

However, I'm trying to get my foot into the door in the engineering field now. Been out job hunting I'm finding it extremely difficult. Entry level jobs want a minimum of a Bachelor's and X amount of years of experience. Applied for a few internships this last month but even then I haven't seen any luck.

Am I missing something that is making things not work out, or do I really just have to wait until I get a Bachelor's? Is there any way to speed up the process or any tricks to get into internships/entry-level jobs? Looked into the E.I.T, but they're wanting minimum of a Bachelor's before taking the test.

Currently looking for Engineering internships/jobs through the Indeed app, applied for an Internship through Puget Sound Energy website, and even through the County. Any other ideas of where to check out would be amazing. 

I've applied for probably over 30 engineering related jobs/internships within late January/February with no luck. Do I just need to be a bit more patient with applications being processed?

Any help or advice will greatly be appreciated. Just trying to make a name for myself and build my resume and try and get some experience. Just want to know if I can get into some sort of engineering job with only an Associates and no work experience in engineering, or I'm just fucked till I get a Bachelor's and then hopefully make things easier."

7ye5uo,342,2018-02-18,Elaine acts as J. Peterman’s boss when he decides to go undercover as an intern. George thinks eating pistachios cures his social anxiety; he starts eating them all the time. Jerry’s girlfriend does improv and thinks it’s superior to stand up. Kramer can’t get rid of his hiccups. [Plot inside],jkremer3,RedditWritesSeinfeld,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld/comments/7ye5uo/elaine_acts_as_j_petermans_boss_when_he_decides/,"Jerry does stand up to begin the episode. 
 
Jerry: I have never understood the job of a fashion model. Why do they always look so serious when they walk down the runway? Is that part of the requirements, no smiling? They can be wearing a toaster oven for a hat and an upside down clock for underpants and still have a dead serious look on their face. Maybe that’s what it is — it’s resentment. They hurry down the runway with a grimace on their face thinking, “I can’t believe they put me in THIS crazy outfit.”
 
Elaine is at work editing the catalog for a new J. Peterman clothing line titled “Back to Basics.” We can see from the pictures that the designs are very plain, with solid colors and simple shapes. Peterman calls Elaine into his office and says he has something important to discuss. 
 
Peterman: Elaine, as a teenager I spent my summers at a Mexican villa by the sea. Every morning, my caretaker, a middle-aged Mexican woman, would wake me by gently dabbing my forehead with a warm towel while she wafted soothing spices in the air. And she would always bring me a breakfast of fresh mangos. Ah, the most juicy mangos! Until one morning she walked in on me as I was changing out of my sleep trunks, and, with the scent of mangos on our breath, we gave in to temptation. What I mean to say, Elaine, is that it’s high time that I break from my privileged perspective and get “back to the basics” myself. So, I have decided to go undercover as an intern and I’m putting you in charge ‪starting tomorrow‬. 
 
Peterman explains that only Elaine will be in on his plan. ‪Starting tomorrow‬ he plans to go “incognito” and Elaine will be his boss. He puts Elaine in charge of planning the big fashion show to launch the Back to Basics clothing line. 
 
George buys a bag of pistachios at a news stand and then waits to catch the subway. While he waits, he effortlessly cracks the nuts with one hand and pops them in his mouth. A beautiful woman approaches George and asks if she can get a picture with him. 
 
George: “Who, me?”
Woman: “Aren’t you that famous director?”
George: “Me? No, you must be joking.”
Woman: “Oh. I’m sorry. I could have sworn you were someone famous. You just looked so familiar...and so confident.”
George: “Confident?”
Woman: “Yeah, it must have been the way you were eating those pistachios.”
 
The woman walks away. George looks down at his bag of pistachios in amazement. 
 
Jerry goes on a date with a woman named Marissa who is an improv comic. They go to a modern art museum and Jerry cracks jokes — “and this piece commemorates the time when the artist fell down the stairs with his painting supplies.” Marissa improvises the scene from
Jerry’s joke. She acts out someone painting at the top of the stairs, then slipping and tumbling down while still holding on to the canvas and brush. They both laugh and Marissa says they make a good comedy team. She also says that Jerry should try improv, since it’s “really the ultimate form of comedy.” Jerry says “eh” and shrugs it off. They make plans for a second date. 

Elaine is having a meeting at the J. Peterman office to plan for the big fashion show. She starts the meeting, but someone interrupts to ask if she can please introduce the new guy. Peterman is sitting in the back in disguise. He is wearing a wig with long, brown hair and a full brown beard — this makes him looks like he is disguised as Jesus Christ. Elaine introduces him as the new intern “Jared” and then continues her meeting. “Jared” repeatedly interjects (Peterman does not alter his voice or speaking mannerisms at all when talking as Jared) and offers “suggestions” that at Elaine is forced to accept. All of Elaine’s colleagues eagerly agree with Jared. 
 
Later, Jerry is on the phone in his apartment. 
 
Jerry: Yes, mom, I will call Aunt Lisa to wish her a happy birthday. 
Helen Seinfeld: She gets so lonely because Markus never calls or visits her. 
Morty Seinfeld (In the background talking to Helen): Why did you buy me this jacket with Velcro pockets? You know I hate Velcro.
Helen Seinfeld: Quiet, dear. I’m on the phone with Jerry. 
Morty Seinfeld: Oh, good. Ask Jerry if he has ever seen a grown man’s jacket with Velcro pockets. 
Helen Seinfeld: I’m not asking him about pockets, we’re talking about how Markus doesn’t care enough to visit Lisa. 
 
Kramer slides in to the apartment. He looks terrible with bags under his eyes, wrinkled clothes, and messy hair.
 
Jerry: Look, mom, I’ve got to go. A zombie just walked in my apartment. 
*Jerry hangs up the phone*
Jerry: Kramer, what happened to you?
Kramer: It’s the hiccups, Jerry. I’ve had the hiccups for six days. 
*Kramer hiccups, causing his whole body to spasm*
Jerry: Six days? Shouldn’t you be at the hospital? 
Kramer: Oh, this is nothing. I can beat them. My worst run was three weeks. *Hiccup*
Jerry: You mean to tell me that you’ve had hiccups last for weeks? And this is a normal occurrence? 
Kramer: Oh yeah. Big time.  I get one or two bad spells every winter. *Hiccup* 
Jerry: Well, have you tried slowly sipping some water? 
 
George enters. Kramer pours himself a glass of water and starts slowly sipping. He struggles not to spit out the water every time he hiccups. George asks what’s wrong with Kramer and Jerry says it’s apparently a case of the “seasonal hiccups.” 

George and Jerry ignore Kramer’s attempts to cure his hiccups in the background. George tells Jerry about his encounter with the beautiful mystery woman at the subway station. Jerry asks, “what do the pistachios have to do with anything?” George says that he never realized it, but pistachios have a big effect on him. He says he is confident and “has nerves of steel” whenever he eats them — it’s like he is hypnotized. George pulls out a bag of pistachios to demonstrate his smooth cracking and eating. Kramer tries to sneak one, but he hiccups mid-bite causing him to spit it out. Jerry remains unconvinced of George’s magic pistachios. 

Then next day, Elaine and Peterman (still in his “Jared” disguise) step out to grab lunch. They are walking down the street when Peterman sees Kramer approaching in the distance. Kramer still has the hiccups so he walks like a mad man with random chaotic spasms. 

Peterman: Elaine, look at that majestic man’s walk. He would be perfect on the runway at our show! 
Elaine: Who? Kramer? No, no, Mr. Peterman—
Peterman: Jared! Elaine, you mustn’t reveal my identity. We never know who is listening.
Elaine: Yes, well, Jared, I don’t think it would a good idea to hire him. 
Peterman: Nonsense! I want all of our models walking exactly like him. Elaine, now that you’re in charge, I want you to always ask yourself this question: what would Jared do? 
Elaine: ...hire him for the show?

Elaine talks to Kramer and sees that he has the hiccups, but she asks him to help work on the fashion show anyway. Kramer leaves to go buy Chinese spices that he thinks might cure his hiccups. 

George walks into his boss’s office (George Steinbrenner’s office). George is eating another bag of pistachios. 

Steinbrenner: George! What do you want? You can’t eat those things in here. You’re getting shells all over the floor. 
George: Mr. Steinbrenner, I came to ask for a raise.
Steinbrenner: What! Hah, George my boy you know I just can’t do that. We’re under a lot of pressure right now. Please stop with the shells. 
George (interrupting): Oh, I think you’ll give me the raise. 

Then Mr. Steinbrenner keeps talking and talking while George just stands there slyly eating pistachios. Eventually Steinbrenner talks himself into giving him the raise if George will stop getting pistachio shells all over the floor. George is thrilled and leaves the office to go buy jumbo bags of pistachios.

Jerry, Marissa, and George are eating at Monk’s diner. Of course, George is still cracking and eating his pistachios. 

Jerry: Again with the pistachios?
George: You don’t understand, Jerry. When I’m eating these I’m unstoppable!
Marissa: I will say, you do look rather confident cracking those one-handed. 
George: See Jerry! She gets it. What’s the opposite of kryptonite? Pistachios are my anti-kryptonite. 
*George flicks a shell on the ground. Jerry looks disgusted*
Jerry: I refuse to believe it until I see it in action. 
Marissa: Speaking of action, Jerry, are we still on for the improv class tonight? 
Jerry: Eh, I don’t know. I’m don’t improvise. If there’s a script, I like to stay on it. 
Marissa: You’re just afraid because improv is the superior form of comedy! C’mon, it’ll be fun. George, you should come too!
George: Sure, why not. 
Jerry: You’re going to do improv? Now this I’ve got to see. 

Later, the three of them are in a small theater for the improv class. The instructor asks Jerry and Marissa to go on stage to improvise a scene together. The instructor gives them the prompt “you are in line at the bank.”

Marissa: Honey, I think we need to withdraw $100. 
Jerry (awkwardly acting): Okay, I’ll do that. 
*Marissa bends down and pretends to interact with a small child*
Marissa: Stop it, Chaz! Behave! Your dad and I are here to get money for your birthday party. 
Jerry: “Chaz”? Really? I don’t think we have a son named Chaz.
Marissa: Jerry! You’re ruining it. You’re supposed to stay in character and react. Improvise!
Jerry: I am improvising. That’s the first thing that popped into my head — that I would never have a child named Chaz.

The instructor cuts them off. He swaps out Jerry for George. George brings his pistachios on stage. The instructor gives the prompt “You are two former lovers reunited after years apart.”

Marissa: Oh, Oliver! You came back for me. And after all these years. Why? I must know why. 
*George pauses and slowly eats a few pistachios and looks intense*
George: What can I say? I like what I like.
Instructor: CUT! Goosebumps, George, that gave me goosebumps. You’re a natural! 

Elaine is at the fashion show stage rehearsing for the big show. Kramer walks up and down the runway doing his hiccup walk. The models try to copy him. “Jared” (still disguised in his Jesus hair and beard) watches over and yells “Hallelujah!” whenever the models correctly fidget and spasm like Kramer. 

George, Jerry, and Marissa stop by the rehearsal to show support for Elaine. George immediately notices that his mystery woman from the subway station is one of the fashion runway models. He tells Jerry that he plans to ask her out. Jerry asks if he might be setting his target a bit too high by asking out a model, but George insists that as long as he is eating pistachios it’ll go his way.

Elaine and two of her colleagues come over to say hello to Jerry, George and Marissa. Elaine says she is still working on the final touches and she feels that the fashion show is “missing something.” Marissa jokingly suggests that Elaine should hire her and Jerry to do comedy acts as a show opener. Elaine says no thanks, but one of her colleagues jumps in to say they think it’s a good idea. 

Elaine: Comedy at a fashion show? I don’t think anyone in fashion has a sense of humor. 
Colleague: But Elaine, what would Jared do?
Other colleague: Yeah, what would Jared do?

Elaine decides to hire Jerry and Marissa as opening acts because she thinks “Jared” probably would have done that. 

The day arrives for the big fashion show. Jerry and George show up together. At the entrance, they line up together for a security checkpoint when George sees a sign that says “Absolutely No Food or Beverage Allowed Inside.” Security guards are checking everyone’s coats and bags to make sure no food is coming in. George starts sweating and tells Jerry that he’s ruined.

They go through security and George has to empty his pockets, revealing five different jumbo bags of pistachios. Jerry pretends not to know George. Security confiscates the pistachios and makes him throw them away. 

After they get past security, George whispers to Jerry.

George: Jerry, it’s a miracle — they forgot to confiscate my sock nuts.
Jerry: Do I want to know what that means?
George: My pistachios, my precious pistachios. I have one small bag hidden in my sock. Just enough to get through a conversation to ask her out. 
Jerry: So what’s your plan?
George: I’m going to sneak back stage to find her dressing room before the show starts. 
Jerry: Don’t you think that’s a little creepy?
George: Not as long as I’ve got these babies!
*George shakes his foot*
Jerry: I guess there’s nothing creepy about a man with a bag of nuts in his sock. 

The show is about to start and “Jared” gets on stage. He is wearing a white robe, making him look even more like Jesus. Peterman reveals that it was him all along. The crowd ooo’s and ahh’s with delight, but Elaine just rolls her eyes. 

Jerry goes on stage first, before Marissa. 

Jerry: What’s the deal with these Back to Basics outfits anyway? Brown sweatpants and white t-shirts? Do we really need famous endorsements and a fashion show to get people on board with those outfit choices? I think there are thousands of people at home right now, eating potato chips on the couch, dressed just like that. 

The crowd boos at Jerry because he is making fun of the clothing. He bombs the rest of his act.

Marissa goes on stage and asks the audience to yell out something for her to improvise. Someone says “Jerry Seinfeld doing stand up!” She improvises a scene of Jerry coming on stage to do stand up. She re-tells all his previous jokes in a dorky voice and she makes fun of him for wearing “dorky sneakers” with jeans. The crowd loves it. 

Marissa goes up to Jerry after her performance.

Marissa: See, improv is just the superior form of comedy.
Jerry: That wasn’t improvised! That was just my stand up set with a silly voice. 

George sneaks back stage. He pulls out his sock nuts and looks for the mystery model. He clenches onto the last bag of pistachios in his hand. It’s dark back stage, so George starts to get lost in the hallways. He rounds a dark corner and suddenly Kramer pops out with a loud hiccup. George is startled and drops all of the pistachios on the ground and they scatter everywhere. Kramer says “yowza!” Just then, a model opens a door. It’s George’s mystery woman. George panics and tries to pickup the nuts off the floor. The mystery woman calls him a creep and storms off. George calls out to her from on the floor, “Wait! It’s me! The pistachio guy!” 

Kramer no longer has the hiccups due to George startling him. The stage managers tell him it’s time for his entrance - he is first in a long line of all the models. Kramer walks down the runway normally. All of the models behind him are very confused. About half of them still try to do the crazy hiccup walk and the rest walk normally. The audience thinks this was all planned, so they applaud at the bizarre performance. 

The episode ends on a freeze frame of Kramer striking a pose at the end of the runway. "

7yfepl,2,2018-02-18,Excellent Credit but a Student,nyxlite15,CreditCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/7yfepl/excellent_credit_but_a_student/,"Hi, I’m 21 years olds and have had a credit card since I was 18. Over the past 3 years, my scores are an average of 750 and I currently have excellent credit. I have a discover IT card and a BOA americard cashback card. 

During the summer or fall Im thinking of applying for another one to help build my credit but the issue is my income. I’m a full time student and make between 10-15k a year.

The issue is I have tried to apply for the citi double cashback card and was denied and the letter just said my yearly income wasn’t enough.

I’m not sure whether i should:
 -just wait until I graduate (for double cashback card and i’ll at least be in grad school with a paid internship) 
- apply for a chase unlimited or a blue cash everyday card

7yfnyj,4,2018-02-18,[M4F] - That'll Show Her! Oh Yes It Will!,alexanderfarkov,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7yfnyj/m4f_thatll_show_her_oh_yes_it_will/,"I never liked you from the very first time you stepped foot into my house, behaving like a self-entitled princessy bitch. Yeah Mum liked you because you helped out with her cookies once but you never had a nice thing to say about me. From parading about in my house and shit-talking to her about how untidy my room was, I'd lost count of the number of times I got a earful from your nosey behaviour. That fucking high-pitched voice as you ranted and bitched about every twitch you saw in me, I still get the shivers today. Maybe that's why your parents were rarely at home. Who could ever love a child like that?

Mum really loved comparing my grades to yours and asking me why I couldn't do as well as you did, often in front of your smirk-filled face as you haughtily strode off, with your nose high in the air. I vividly remember I got a big ass whooping from Dad because you sneaked into my room, rummaging through my stuff  while I was out and proudly showing your newfound treasure to my parents which just so happened to be my carefully hidden bong. 

I will never forget the look of disgust as you learned that I would be attending the same Ivy League college as you did. Oh, I can definitely feel your agony of being in the same school as that worthless piece of shit neighbour. But yet, here I am! I thought that you might have matured a little as college started and you began making a name for yourself as one of our top athletes. Or perhaps, you might have decided to lay off me a little. But oh no! I saw your eyes glowing red with envy as I clinched the national junior title for wrestling, that very sport that you once described to Mum as swines rolling about in mud and filth. And what tales did you tell Mum when you headed home for the summer? Me fucking that stunning cheerleading blonde that everyone lusted over? Really? You either found great joy in making life miserable for someone who had done absolutely nothing to you, or perhaps you were secretly craving for a piece of me you fucking psycho!

Still life went on and there you were, cussing to your friends and practically everyone you met about how it was impossible for me to being on the dean's list with you without having cheated in my exams. I didn't know I mattered to you that much. It did make sense in a way, considering your pathetic nerdy boyfriend who was as proud of his moral compass as a well endowed porn star is of his monstrous dong. One who spent way too much time in the library while I had my fair share of fun and the outdoors while still trouncing him academically. Look at that tiny failure of a human specimen, thin enough to be blown off by the wind. And yes, I did accidentally knock into him once as I went about a corner but from your account, it sounded like I was on the verge of beating the crap out of him and snuffing out his last breath. 

I couldn't really be bothered with you but it was proving to be a struggle to sneak in a snide remark as I landed that dream internship role that I knew you were eyeing. I wouldn't say that revenge was served stone cold as you never really let up on your disparaging remarks but oh how sweet victory tasted, made extra special with that dejected look of yours as you for once, hung your head low. 

Those plump lips of yours, guilty of uttering the most vicious of lies and gossip were now shut. Maybe you should have kept it that way from the very beginning but I must admit that they do look good stretched taut over a throbbing cock. That superb stereo sound system of yours as you broadcast every demeanour of mine, perhaps they might be put to better use in the bedroom. I must say that I'm really curious, are you more of a moaner or a screamer if I stretch your prudish cunt with my manhood and fuck you senseless? Maybe I should plunge every inch of my pulsing warm fat cock into you and laugh at your loser boyfriend. Dumping my whole load of sticky gooey cum down your throat? Oh no you fucking bitch! How about smearing it all over your face and throwing you out of my room. I'm sure a walk of shame would be letting you off too lightly? Maybe my parents might change their opinions of you once word or even a picture gets round showing what a fucking slut you are!

7ygtgr,13,2018-02-18,Doing damage control on coming out,rreed_,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/7ygtgr/doing_damage_control_on_coming_out/,"Hi first time posting here, sorry if I break any sub rules.

Last night, I had to come out to my dad. I'm 20 years old, currently in university but moved back home as it's closer to my internship. On Friday, my dad asked to use my phone to make a skype call and wound up going through my messages and discovered the texts I've been sending to a guy I like. I swore up and down it was actually a girl and I'm straight and he believed me so that was the end of that.

But I saw the face he had when he asked me, he looked beyond enraged and that hurt me. I never planned on coming out until I was in my own place with a stable job, but his face made me realize I could never come out and have things be the same.

I've been really depressed/panicking since then, and next late night he woke up and saw me trying to open the cupboard and get my anxiety medication I used to use. My dad's always been worried about my mental health and is willing to do anything to make sure I'm alright and sleeping well. He wouldn't go unless I told him what was bothering me. He said he'd love me no matter what I did so I told him I was gay.

He cried and kept denying it, saying it's too early for me to know and that I've haven't been with the right girl yet. I've been with both and I only enjoyed being with men. I said no when he asked if i've been with a man because I knew it'd escalate the situation. I keep telling him i haven't changed suddenly, that I love him no matter what

This morning we talked again, he said he wanted to die, that if I cared about my family i'd try to change and he's been looking up articles on conversion and changing sexuality. He thinks it's a choice and keeps asking me to try to change.

My mom doesn't know yet but she noticed me crying and said the same things my dad did. That she'd love me no matter what, that it would bother her if i didn't tell her and I feel trapped.

What I want to know is: How do i proceed? Do I give my dad space or try to talk more? How do i stop my dad from reading these articles on changing me? What do i say to him? Do i tell my mom?

I wasn't ready to come out this early, I don't have these resources ready, I don't have answers as to why i'm gay, what will i do for a family. I don't think I'm in danger of being kicked out, he says he's my dad but I don't he loves me anymore.Hi first time posting here, sorry if I break any sub rules.

7yhh8f,0,2018-02-18,Honours Computing Science vs First Year Engineering (ultimately Software Eng.)?,1100H19,uAlberta,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/7yhh8f/honours_computing_science_vs_first_year/,"I am a high school student who got an offer to both who's trying to decide between the two. I have a solid amount of CS experience, and I'm fairly certain that this is the field I want to head into. I'm leaning towards working in industry, but with no research experience, it might turn out that I enjoy academia. I would love it if anyone in either program (or even anyone who has friends in either program) can offer insights to help me decide between the two programs.

With some research on this SubReddit, here are some pros and cons I put together. 

ENGINEERING

Pros

* 3 co-op terms. I can try out different positions in industry.

* Guaranteed sections in CMPUT classes, really useful for popular classes like CMPUT 301

* Professional Engineer, Iron Ring (not that much benefit since I plan on heading to the US and they don't care about these professional designations)

* $5k scholarship (solid amount for a high school student but small amount in terms of the ""bigger picture"")

* Engineering math is generally more applicable to industry (?)

Cons

* General first-year. I already know what I want to do so this wastes a year and adds a year of stress (gotta keep 3.0 to get into Software Eng). This is probably the biggest disadvantage of engineering.

* Gotta learn chem and physics which aren't as useful

* Not as flexible. If I wanted to apply CS to another subject like biology, there won't be enough electives.

COMPUTING SCIENCE

Pros

* Straight into CS. With any luck, I can snatch a summer internship first year.

* Less rigorous course load means more time for side projects and research with profs. Also better for my mental health.

* Lots of spaces for electives so I can branch out to my other interests

Cons

* Very difficult to get into popular courses. This is the biggest disadvantage of CS.

* Science students don't get jobs (?)

* I prefer multiple smaller internships over one long internship


So yeah, I'm pretty torn between the two. I would totally go for engineering if I didn't waste a year and risk not getting into software. I would go for CS if the higher level classes weren't impossible to get a seat into. Anything else I should take into consideration?"

I recently started looking for a new TKL board with mx clear switches to use at work (programming intern). I ordered a Leopold FC750R and it arrived about a week later. But I realized pretty quickly that something didn't feel right and it turns out they sent me a model with mx browns instead. Probably an honest mistake. I talked to a customer service rep and he told me to reorder the board that I want and they'd send me a prepaid shipping label to return the wrong one they sent me, which I did. But when I tried to order the new board, my order went through but was canceled a few days later with a notification saying that the board was out of stock, even though it was very clearly in stock according to their website at the time I ordered it. So here I am almost two weeks after I ordered the board for the first time, still boardless and having to order something else. Sorry for the long post, but I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues when ordering from this website? "
7yhzo3,3,2018-02-18,Friday there was another 7.1 earthquake and it broke me down..,RomeroVF,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7yhzo3/friday_there_was_another_71_earthquake_and_it/,"So last September, the 19th to be precise, there was a 7.1 earthquake that hit central Mexico. It ended up severely affecting various states, mainly Mexico State, Oaxaca and Puebla (where I live).  There were multiple deaths and horrible damage done to these states and some others surrounding them.
 
Now...
I work(ed) in a hospital called San Alejandro, it was Latin America's largest hospital of it's type at the time, It held 2,700 workers, not including hundreds of residents, interns and nursing students. Had thousands of medical appointments each day, hundreds of surgeries every single day and well it was an absolute monster. I'm 25, with an administrative role and had worked there for nearly 5 years, I loved that hospital and it taught me how to work under massive pressure, less than ideal working conditions, and with thousands of co-workers. 

September 19th, 2017.    11:30 A.M.
We had a meeting talking about how we needed to update our emergency protocols because they were outdated and a week or two before there had been an 8.1 earthquake. That earthquake surprisingly didn't cause much damage but it shook us (pun not intended), because we realized we were unprepared. Now back to the meeting, we agreed we needed to sort everything and had set it for a future date, where we'd all come together and plan everything out. Now the even funnier thing about this is that we had a drill planned but ended up cancelling it so as to not cause panic due to the last quake.

The meeting ended and I went about doing my normal tasks until the clock hit 13:00, that's when I headed to the cafeteria to have lunch with my friends. So I was with my friend Luis when we felt a slight but firm shaking, we quickly realized it was another earthquake and proceeded to calmly walk out and down the hall. About 8 seconds later and while we were in the hallway jam packed with people, the second stronger earthquake hit and absolutely all hell broke loose. We started running towards the exit, just under the ER ramp and as I was getting out I could see pieces coming down on top of us so I made a massive Sprint to the parking lot. I made it out fine but when I looked back, I could see the entire building swaying side to side, I looked like paper just ready to collapse. It was just wow. Absolutely terrifying, awe inspiring and insane all at once.

Once we were all outside we started to smell gas, lots of it. The cafeteria workers yelled to look at the side building, the gas tank had tipped over and was shooting gas out into the air, so much and so hard that it looked like water at first. We were all worried as hell and I was just in shock, until I heard a head nurse run out and yell, ""The babies, we need help to get the babies out!"". I didn't know what to do until I saw my friend run in, so fuck it if he's dying he's not going alone. We run in and coordinated with some co-workers, they'd go after the babies down the hall in the ICU and we'd go to the ER to get the patients out. We ran up the ramp and he went in while others passed me gurneys with patients in them to get down the ramp and to safety. I got around four or five down before I went in to the main ER hall. They told me it was taken care of that they'd gotten them out or were almost out. Now, remember the gas leak? It still hadn't been controlled so we were all coughing and light headed, I was relieved thinking we were done....until we remembered. 


We covered the ER and infant ICU, who has the other fucking 8 floors in the main building? We panicked and ran to the construction area entrance and up emergency stairs to get into the building. Ended up looking floor to floor and helping co-workers carry patients down the stairs, and since there were no beds or gurneys available in the main part of the hospital, we had to carry them down the stairs using their bed sheets and desk chairs. 


Now to cut this rambling story short, that day I learned a lot, about myself, about my friends and about Mexican society. While we were rushing to get patients to safety, there were hundreds of co-workers just standing around taking pictures. Every person I saw helping was either, construction, cafeteria, maintenance or a a few nursing students. Where the absolute fuck were the medics and nurses? Taking pictures and relaxing. I still get worked up thinking back to that. It wasn't all bad though, the neighbors pitched in and brought out water, food, coffee and opened their homes so we could safely store the ICU babies in them. And about myself, ha. I dislike kids and babies but seeing them in garages and restaurants in incubators really hit a soft spot and just tore me down. So that was September 19th, in the end? Our hospital, my second home, had to be closed. Our 2,700 plus personnel had to be reallocated, as with our patients. I'm now in another smaller hospital with 1,200 of my San Alejandro co-workers.


This is horribly structured I apologise, and I keep rambling but now onto what happened this Friday.


There was an earthquake (7.2) that hit around 17:40 just as I was at a restaurant eating with my mom and a friend. It felt fairly strong but thankfully it was short, maybe four seconds at most. As we were evacuating I immediately thought about how strong the second quake would be and how much time I'd make getting to my hospital. Luckily as I said, it wasn't severe, and it was super short, so I was very relieved. I played it off like no biggie and it really wasn't, but I kept having flashbacks and just broke down crying. It was so damn out of nowhere and I thought I had gotten over the nightmares and anxiety but guess not. Kept thinking about the babies, the patients and that damn gas leak and couldn't get it out of my head. Just had to get this off my chest and write it down."
7yi1gh,5,2018-02-18,I have a smoking problem and I need help or guidance,throwawayyy333333333,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/7yi1gh/i_have_a_smoking_problem_and_i_need_help_or/,"I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm 100% sure that if I get this job I will be drug tested, and potentially be on random drug testing from then on out. It is a good job with good pay and benefits which is in line with what I went to college for and is close to where I live. Even if I don't get this specific job, drug testing seems to be the norm for every job I apply for.


I'm 23 now, and I started smoking when I was 15, and have been smoking daily since sometime in high school.


My parents caught me a few times and that went...badly... I've never successfully passed a drug test on my own. In high school we were put on random drug testing if we were involved in anything extra-curricular at the school, and the one time I was called for testing I had a friends clean piss in a bottle in my pocket so I passed (yeah, carrying a bottle of piss around was common practice for the stoners in high school. It was either that or fail the drug test and then shit hits the fan. Or not smoke all of high school).


In college I stopped smoking for 4 months while looking for an internship. This was the worst 4 months of my life and I was extremely depressed. Smoking was always my coping method, and I had just transferred schools and was living by myself so losing my normal coping method at that time was not good. I ended up smoking multiple times anyway during this time because I had no will power. When I finally got an internship I tested myself with a home kit before the first day and failed so I nervously took a bottle of clean piss to work for the first week, until I found out the company doesn't test interns so in reality I could have been smoking the entire time....


Now I'm graduated. My most recent job required a drug test and I tried to pass it, I really did. I painfully but successfully stopped smoking for almost a full month. This was another horrible month and I found myself getting very angry at every little thing, but I was living at home with my parents and was around my home town friends instead of off at college so they kept me a bit more grounded. When I went to test myself though, I failed. I think it was because I was doing a lot of dabs before stopping and I guess that stays in your system longer. So I had to take a bottle of clean piss to the drug test which got sent to a medical lab. Scariest moment of my life, but I passed.


I've been job hunting since my last job ended (it was only a temp job). I was supposed to stop smoking for my new years resolution for the job hunt, but that failed quickly. My mom caught me again last month and I told her I would stop because I understood I needed to pass a drug test to get a job. I smoked last night, and just about every night before that. When I didn't have weed because I wasn't re upping like I usually do when I'm low (because I knew I shouldnt be smoking), I would awkwardly hit up friends late at night to try to get them to smoke me up, or I would scrape the gross black res out of the inside of my bowls and smoke that. It's disgusting but it gets you kinda stoned. I just kind of pretended I would be ok since there was no upcoming scheduled drug tests or anything


Now I don't know what to do. The job hunt is getting more serious and things are becoming real. On Friday during an interview they asked (as is normal) if I could pass a drug test and background check. I lied and said yes.


I cleaned all my bongs and pipes yesterday so I wouldn't try to smoke res again, and smoked one last bowl before handing over the rest of my weed to my friends last night. I planned on enjoying my last night smoking by staying up all night and playing video games, my favorite thing to do stoned. I usually stay up till 2 or 3 am when I do that. I smoked my final bowl at around 9:30 pm, passed off the last of my weed to my friends at around 10:45, and by 11 I had beaten myself up for not keeping one extra bowl to smoke later so much that I went to bed because I didn't want to fall asleep sober. I've always had trouble falling asleep when I'm not stoned.


I feel depressed. I know I'm gonna have trouble sleeping tonight and don't know the next time I'll be able to smoke. I'll probably fuck up at some point and smoke anyway. I don't want to quit. Even when I convince myself that I can quit, it doesn't last. What usually gets me through the day is knowing that whatever happens, I can always smoke at night. ""Sure, today sucked but I'll feel better once I smoke."", and it works. Once I smoke I usually do feel better. I know that probably isn't a healthy way to live my life. 


My dream is simple. I just to get a full time job where I make enough money to pay for my car payments, student loans, and rent so I can move out of my parents house, maybe find a girlfriend, and be able to smoke after work and on weekends. I just know when I am able to smoke I am generally happy, and when I can't I am generally not happy.


I've always told myself I'm gonna smoke till I die, but my career field is making that seem less possible. I went to school for 4 years for this degree and am in a significant amount of debt for it so I'm kinda stuck in this route (engineering). I'm an idiot for not realizing this would happen when I chose this path. I have an addictive personality and less willpower than I would like to admit, and am afraid that if I can't smoke weed, at some point I'll might find another way to get high. Right now its easy for me to say no to harder drugs because I have weed but I'm scared of what I might do when the opportunity arises and I don't have weed to keep me happy. Or what I might start seeking out when I get bored and am sober. I know you can order drugs online on the dark web, I used to browse the marketplaces for kicks.


I don't know what to do, I'm depressed thinking about having to quit, and I can't smoke to make myself feel better. I just don't know what to do. Any guidance would be fantastic.

7yi20s,1,2018-02-18,Soon to be College Grad looking for advice,ClubsisMe,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7yi20s/soon_to_be_college_grad_looking_for_advice/,"Long time lurker first time poster.

I will be graduating in December 2018 with a Business Degree and a concentration in accounting and I want to set myself up to move out immediately after graduation.

Some facts about me:

- I am 22 years old
- My credit score is currently 689
- I wish to work as an auditor
- By the end of February I will over 600 dollars in my bank account
- I will owe just under $30k in student loans upon graduation
- I am currently in 2,502 dollars of credit card debt.
- Of that 762.30 is from a 0% interest for the first year purchases that comes due March 30th
- The other 1,770.65 is from a Discover it student card. The no interest period on it ends March 1st
- I am fortunate enough to own a very reliable car but it does need new brakes soon that I will have to pay for and a leaking shook that needs fixed
- I am even more fortunate that monthly I am only responsible for my gas
- I currently work a retail position but due to rough financial times my hours have very irregular. I make $9 dollars an hour and averaging 7 hours a week currently
- I am applying for several positions and even a full time summer internship this coming week. The one position I am really hoping to get pays $12 an hour with 15-18 hours per week available

My goals for the reminder of 2018 in order of importance are:

- To move to a new city upon graduation
- Have at minimum $2.5k saved up by graduation
- Get my car fixed
- Graduate and owe less than $1,000 (not including student loans)
- Have a good credit score

My questions:

- Is it worth getting a credit card that offers a no interest for so many months on balance transfers to avoid paying interest?
- Are my goals reasonable?
- What is the best plan of action for me moving forward?

Thank you in advance to anyone who offers advice."

By Michael Aveni

So you've just been told that you have to give a big, important business speech about business stuff that you only kind of understand. But let's face it, you were just an intern 2 months ago, and being hired full time upon graduation was, while exhilarating in it's own right, a huge step forward that you may not have been prepared for. This speech (really just a glorified update on sales progress, and a proposal for strategies to optimize production while slashing production price) will be given in a medium sized conference room, in front of both your peers and superiors. You've gotten word the CEO might even drop in, just to see how things are running at your branch. Your inner dialogue, as the time draws near, may go something like this:

Fucking shit....I'm screwed, all is lost! PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER! Ok, ok, just think....I've got the data....things are looking, uh, well, the same. Which isn't good. They don't want bad news, they want good news, they want progress. Dammit, why can't a senior employee do this! I have no original ideas, they're gonna fire me after this. And my hair looks awful. They might just fire me for that...I need a drink.

The alcohol temporarily numbs the existential dread, but you know that when you wake up, you're gonna have to give that speech. No way around it at this point. With your last shot of whiskey, you resign to defeat and call it a night. Final plan? Wing it.

There is certainly something to be said about going into scenarios like this with a fully prepared template, a structured A to B to C format that organizes your ideas. Indeed, most employer prefer you handle all of your assignments and projects in such a manner. Unfortunately, this method requires you to know exactly what it is you are going to say. That isn't always the case. Real life ain't so simple. Even when you do know what to say, and have a perfect plan, things inevitably go wrong. One deviation from the intended projection, one unaccounted-for variable, and your platform crumbles underneath you. Now you have to think on the fly. How do you do that? I mean really, when your on stage, all lights on you, and the script gets thrown out the window, what do you say? At times like this, it might be wise to examine actors. Professional, broadway actors. Why? They are trained to be masters of improvisation. In other words, they fake it. They make something up so quickly, so smoothly, that you or I in the audience would have no idea it was unintended. I know what your thinking: How could a dramatic actors improv skill help me with a sales report? The answer is simple, if you know how to make it look like you know what your talking about, then you actually kind of know what your talking about. I get it, it sounds like cheating. Because it is cheating. As hard as it may seem to be a reality, the better you are at pretending like you belong, even if you truly don't (or at least think you don't), the more you will eventually start operating at the level you've ""faked"".

The mathematicians among you may be able to find a similar phenomenon in the 80/20 rule. simply put, it states that for many systems, theoretically and in reality, you can get 80% of the outcome with only 20% of the effort. You see this in self taught musicians, language learners, and especially improvisers. Let's look at the example of a beginning guitarist. The guitar is an amazing instrument, because it's easy to pick up, but very difficult to master. By this I mean that, as anyone who plays guitar will tell you, there are four chords, very basic and easy chords, that result in being able to play just about every single pop song in the top 20 for the past two decades. As well as hundreds more, spanning multiple genres and decades. These are almost always the first chords guitarists learn. That's why you see so many shirtless douche bags on college campuses or at parties playing guitar to impress the ladies. It took them maybe a week to pick up that guitar, learn those chords, master them, and boom they're the next Jack Johnson. But I digress, the point is that so many systems operate according to this rule, and if you can find the crucial 20% of information you need, are good at improvising and pretending like you know way more than you actually know, people WILL believe you. Well, then you may ask: How can I keep that up? Won't someone figure out I'm a fraud? The short answer is yes, it's a very real possibility. Especially if you play it up for too long, push it too far, indulge in the spotlight and take on challenges you really aren't prepared for. The longer answer is that this outcome is easy to avoid. First off, NEVER claim your expertise. Make it clear from the start that something you say might be incorrect, and that you still have much to learn. This lowers standards and impresses more when you show what you actually do know. Second, ALWAYS be willing to learn. This is so crucially important, I cannot stress it enough. There is an old saying in the Jewish tradition, that is, the wisest man is the man who learns from every man around him. Consider that for a moment. Rather than viewing those contemporaries whose skill truly surpasses your own as opponents who you must compete with, what if you saw them as teachers? Clearly they know something you don't, and there is no shame in admitting to their superiority. The smartest people in every field will tell you there is someone better than them, someone who they learned from. If they are decent people, and usually they are, they won't think less of you for asking for advice or tips. Often times they feel honored, and might share some very valuable information that they otherwise wouldn't. If you combine a willingness to learn from those around you with the ability to fake expertise at the right moments, guess what? You've become the expert. That speech you seem so worried about will become routine, because you understand how to sway the crowd with good rhetoric. Substance isn't always necessary for a good argument, in fact it's often the least important aspect. Get good at delivering your message, and the rest will follow suite. Apply these rules to your daily life, and you will immediately notice immense progress in fields that have plagued you for years. Worlds of possibility open up to you. Good luck.

And was the first man I ever had a crush on. He's ten years younger than Dad. But when they had a business merger, which made them a lot of money, he invited his new friend and business partner over for dinner. Mom was happy to meet him as well. Anyone who made Dad richer made Mom happy. Meant she could get away with going shopping on her credit card more. And then just make it up to my Dad later. In private. Since I knew she really liked to use Dad's foot fetish against him. It's kind of hard to forget when you see your Dad on his knees in front of your Mom doing that. The flashy heels. The  licking. The heavy petting. And then scaring them because they were caught. All because their only female child had a nightmare and wanted to be comforted. The thought of that night and others like them still make me shiver. 



Dad's best friend though. He was like a man's man. You could tell that he kept himself in shape. And he dressed well. In tailored suits. So they would hug every part of his body just right. And give off that clean and well trimmed appeal to clients and being the Boss of his firm.  And it probably also got women to notice him in a crowd. If he went to the right bar. Seeing him like that time after time for dinner just made me melt inside and, well, between my legs. Sometimes it felt like he didn't know the affect he had on women.



When I graduated from High School he sat with my parents. Cheering me on alongside my parents as I walked across the stage. Making butterflies flit about my stomach even more. And he stayed for the graduation party that my Father threw with Mom's party planners help. There was elegant food and plenty of picnic tables in the yard for everyone to enjoy the nice weather. Dad was proud of me. I had graduated as the number one student in my class and had written a speech as valedictorian. And I had been accepted to the college my Father went to for the Fall. Yale. When he found out he was over joyed. I mean I was happy too. I was going to a really good school. So, unlike my older brother, I could follow in his footsteps and work in field of law. I wasn't sure if I was going to be a lawyer. But I knew I could figure it out at Yale. 



Dad's friend and I had a moment alone at the party. I had gone to my room to be alone for a moment and he was there. Looking around in my room. He had a black bag in his hand. Holding it by the strings. He looked up at me with a smile. Which made my face flush and my knees weak. I walked over to my desk so I could lean on it. So I wouldn't fall over in front of him. Then he moved closer to me. Looking me over with those dangerous eyes that any girl could fall into. 


""Your speech was really great. Full of wisdom I didn't expect from a 18 year old woman. I think it was the perfect send off for your class."" He said. 



He held up the bag to me.


""Would you open my gift here?"" He asked. 



I nodded and gingerly took the bag from his hand. I turned my body a little and set the bag on my desk. I opened it and there was a card on the top.  I smiled. I opened it. There was a gift card to my favorite store. For $1,000. Which made my jaw drop a little. I recovered and then noticed something else under it. I put the card down and took out the thing in bag. It was hoodie sweater. I let it fall open. I smiled when I saw that it said Yale. And it was one size bigger than the usual size I bought. How did he know that I did that?



I looked up at him and there was a sparkle in his eyes. Like seeing my reaction had made him happy.



""Um..Thank you. For all of this. It means a lot. I honestly didn't even expect you to be here."" I replied. ""So thank you for coming and thank you for the graduation gift.""



""Its not a problem. I'm happy to be here. I was happy for you when your Dad said you decided on Yale.  I went there as well."" He replied. ""So I feel like its a right of passage to get you the sweater. And the gift card is so you can get some clothes that are respectable for a college wardrobe.""



I smiled. I was trying to resist the temptation to push myself up off the desk and kiss him. To show how thankful I really was. But I didn't. I stayed put. Trying to make sure I was breathing right. He licked his lips briefly. Then he leaned in to kiss my cheek. But I moved my head and his lips landed on mine. I kissed back. Which led to more kisses. My arms wrapping around his neck. Chest to chest as we kissed. Then we heard foot steps and broke apart. I looked at the card. My Dad walked into my room. Rambling about this is where we had been hiding. That Dad and him needed to go to Dad's study to talk a little business before going back to the party. 



When they left the room I went to the bed and hugged myself. I had gotten to kiss a man I had lusted after for so long.  The party ended at midnight that night. Sometimes I would catch him looking at me. But I tried to focus on having fun with my friends. Enjoying the food. The cake. And etc. Summer was over before I knew it and I was packing up for college. Mostly with clothes I had never worn before. Because of the gift card. I moved into my dorm. And had an awful roommate my first year. Second year wasn't so great either. Third year I got lucky and had my best friend as a roommate. But it was summer again. And I had to do a internship at a law firm. 


Which my Father, of course, got me a prime one at the firm he co-owned. And the person I was to report to and help all summer was Dad's friend.



This was going to be a long summer. As a 21 year old female intern. And being around a man whose touch I longed for again. That no college lover or Boyfriend had been able to make me feel. Compared to how it felt that night at my graduation party.  



I looked around my college dorm. I was all packed. Dad and him were using their cars and mine to get my stuff home. Where I would be staying for the summer like always.  Seeing him lift boxes and plastic tubs of my stuff was somehow sexy. And I was aching between my legs. Oh. How I wanted that man. 



Between our 3 cars everything got home and unloaded in the same day. I spent the next few days unpacking what I needed. My mom had surprised me one day with a shopping spree for office appropriate outfits for the summer. Since she knew I had none and Dad approved it. Mom didn't stop until I had enough to rotate through in month. To keep myself looking fresh. And, of course, shoes to go with them. 


And now here I was. In front of his office. Setting up a desk that had a plaque with my name on it. I was nervous and excited all at once. Because I had been working very hard in college on my courses to become a lawyer. 

All I had to do was survive being this close to him. Every week day this summer.

___________________________________________________

So at this point in time she is 21 years old. Her Dad is 45 years old. So the male lead is 35 years old. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. This character needs to be played as the Alpha type. That knows what needs to be done in his public and private life. And very much so knows what he wants in his love affairs as well. 

So..How will you play this character and get her to fall into his idea of fun? While keeping appearances of being professional at the office? While dealing with the struggle that they are falling for each other? And what her Father will think?


Turn OFF's: Anal, scat/piss, blood, rape, heavy S&amp;M, Deep Throat blow job,and being degraded.



Turn ON's: Light biting and biting back, kissing, Having my earlobe bitten/suckled on lightly, having my boobs played with, Oral Sex(Giving and getting), breeding kink, cream pies, moderately rough sex, Cuffs for the wrists, under the bed wrist/ankle cuff system(With consent/safe word), Lingerie, and fingered on my g-spot.

Very very long",bpt1047,relationships_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/7yjcgr/need_support_just_got_broken_up_with_after_3/,"I'm on mobile so I apologize for any formatting errors. I'm not using a throwaway because there's no point, I've used them before to ask for advice and I just want this to be as real as it is. This will be a long one, I just need to vent and I thank you if you have the time to read it all.

My girlfriend of almost 3 years just broke up with me this morning. She feels that although she loves and cares for me, we have  grown too far apart. She feels we have become less compatible since we first started dating and that we have lost sight of what we really love about one another.

Some background would be helpful I suppose: This was my first serious relationship. Couple of ""girlfriends"" in high school, couple of girls I liked in college but no one I considered to be a partner. A true match physically, mentally, and emotionally. 

We met in college, hit it off pretty well I thought. We were physical with each other for a few weeks before we were ""official"" but never had sex until after we we're officially dating. We spent a lot of time texting and getting to know each other. I was coming from a low point in life and she was a real nice change of pace from my moping around and feeling depressed. I was drinking a lot and eating edibles just to get to sleep. I thought I'd finally found someone who cared for me and help me through a difficult situation. Someone who made me feel like I didn't need substances anymore.

After about 2 months I finally confessed that I loved her. We took a mini stay-cation at a nearby hotel and I surprised her with a card and roses. When she was done reading it, I told her how I felt, how special she was and that I wanted her to be my girlfriend. I told her the situation I was in before and why it felt like I took so long to tell her, but it was all worth it when she said those 3 magical words right back at me.

From that point on, it was puppy love. Hanging out all the time, exploring everything about each other, really connecting on many different levels. I truly thought I had found my partner in life. At one point we had both told each other that it was such a relief we had found one another, as it took a lot of stress off finding someone you want to spend your life with.

Couple months later, summer was coming around and we both had internships but were scrambling to find housing for the summer. I knew it was early, and looking back I shouldn't have brought it up, but I was broke, desperate, and in love so I asked her if I could stay at her place. To my upmost surprise she accepted. I thought we were really a match made in heaven to feel so comfortable doing this. We laid down ground rules, what responsibilities we would have, and looked forward to our summer together. 

This went fairly well for the first few weeks. We were getting into a routine, discovering each other's habits, and having a lot of fun in a new city and new experiences. After one night out I noticed she was quiet and asked what was wrong. She told me through tears that she noticed me looking at other women too much. How she knew one of her parents main issues was her dad doing the same. I was really caught off guard. I had never thought I was intentionally looking at other women, but when I saw how much it meant to her, I apologized immediately and promised I would try to work on that and overcome it. 

This was the first of many times that instead of sticking up for myself and explaining my point of view, I would do anything to keep her from feeling that way again out of fear that she would leave me and love me less. I didn't have the highest of self-esteems at the time and still don't to be honest and I was absolutely so infatuated with this girl, that I would do anything to keep us together.

The rest of the summer when by pretty smoothly. I met her wonderful family, spent many weekends with them and truly learning got to know her. Out of the blue one day we had a conversation and brought up kids. Now I've always seem myself as a family man. I've always wanted kids and think it takes a very special couple to want to bring new life into this world. One way or another we talked and started flirting with the idea of having kids, how many, names, how cute they'd be , etc. Probably another no-no so early on in the relationship.

So we get back to school, senior year so lots of stress for the both of us. She brings up the next major issue which was that she thought I still had feelings for girls I used to be friends with. She would see how I looked at them and treated them and thought I was capable of doing the unthinkable. I defended myself this time and tried to assure her I could never and would never. I may be imperfect but I'm not a cheater and I don't believe there's ever a reason why it would be ok. She was too important and too special to risk losing. She was understanding and looking back she thinks she was being a bit jealous but had still brought these issues up again from time to time. 

Another issue she felt was important was our communication. I am a big introvert and although she isn't an extrovert at all, she is more outgoing than I am and felt like she was always initiating conversations or thought that our conversations weren't always as meaningful. I admitted that I struggle with speaking up and speaking out and vowed to work on it. This became another ongoing issue and source of stress.

Around our 1 year anniversary and job hunting season coming around, I had an interview to work for a company I thought I'd love out in the Midwest (we're on the east coast). She heard me do the initial phone screening and broke down in tears afterwards saying how she always felt she needed to go back to her home state. That's where she wanted to live, that's where she wanted to be close to her family, that's where she wanted to raise her own family. I personally wasn't tied down to a particular location and would've packed my bags to move to the country my dream job is in if it came down to it. But I felt right then and there, that this girl is so special and so important to me, that I would put my career goals aside and stick by her.

So I switched and looked for jobs only in the tri-state area, trying to be within a few hours drive of her home. She had recently been offered a job in her hometown so I was keen on being close enough to her that we could continue our relationship post grad. I ended up getting an offer that was only a 4-5 hour drive and thought we were set. Then she ended up getting a second offer, nearly double the salary, different industry than her previous experience, and down south. That 4 hour drive turned into a 6 hour flight. She accepted that offer.

I was extremely upset and frustrated, but had to be supportive of her choice. She was moving very far from her friends and family and I had to show support for her. I was sad to see her be so far away but knew to advance her career and professional goals, it really was a good move.

Fast forward a few months after graduation. I had flown down to visit her a couple times, spending the little extra money I had on plane tickets. We were Skyping pretty frequently, always keeping in touch. One night we're Skyping and she tells me how much she hates it down there. She hates her job, hates her coworkers, hates being so far from me and her family. I tried to console her best I could but she was locked in for a year down there. I really was sad for her, that she was dealing with all of that but knew it would be over in a year. It was tough for me being alone on the east coast, hours away from my own friends and family, but knowing she was so much farther away really put things in perspective and made me sorry for her. I tried to continue supporting her and visiting her, ended up visiting too much I think as I watched my credit card bill rise.

She ends up quitting that job, moves back home, and starts the job search again. This time adamant on being close to family. I was about a year into my company and was actually loving it a lot. Not my dream job per se but definitely interesting, engaging, and money was good. I overhear my boss say that we were actually opening a new office close to her home town and I told him how interested I was. I shared this info with my girlfriend and we were ecstatic. We began apartment hunting and were looking forward to moving in together. About a month before my lease was up, I was having apartment troubles (mold) and was kindly invited to stay with her and her family until we had our new place figured out. My first night down there after not seeing her for so long was amazing. We went out to happy hour, fooled around in my back seat ;-), was truly a memorable reconciliation. After about a week of staying with her, she still hadn't gotten any offers and was getting less and less confident. She then broke it to me that she didn't feel like we were ready to move in together yet. She felt like something was off but couldn't explain it. Like the spark hadn't reignited like she hoped after being apart for so long.

Me being me and not wanting to upset her further, I reluctantly found an air bnb close by so that I could still commute to work and be near her. Not even a week later and 2 weeks before I was supposed to move into the air bnb, she had a few interviews and preliminary offers. She then backtracked and we started the apartment hunt again, this time way more serious. I immediately cancelled my air bnb, eating almost $1000. She ended up getting 2 great offers soon after that. One from a huge organization that was another different industry, pay wasn't as good, but still a great name. The other was a huge company that paid very well but also required a lot of travel.

Trying to be supportive, I told her that although the travel would be hard, I knew we could manage it. She believed it would be very travel intensive at first, but slow down after a few months. So we found a perfect apartment, truly perfect. Great location, tons of space, close to our jobs, her family. Now I'm new to this area, 4 hours away from my own family. No friends at all nearby. Any extra money I have goes towards date nights with bae. I go weeks without seeing my family, months without seeing my friends. All I have down here is my girlfriend and I grew dependant on that. I hate to admit it but I know now that I truly needed her more than she needed me.

Just a couple months ago from today, we revisited her feelings of ""offness"" about us. She felt we were becoming less compatible. The more we got the know each other, the more differences became apparent, and the less feelings she said she had for me. We talked again about how my communication was lacking, how we thought it could get better but she was growing tired of things always getting better. It felt like she wanted them to improve immediately and this was really bothering her.

It's been about 5 months so far since moving in, travel hasn't slowed at all. She's gone for days at a time, only coming home on weekends sometimes. Now, money is still pretty tight on my end. I don't have a lot of play money and being the introvert I am, playing video games and watching Netflix is enough to keep me at ease. I did it for the entire year she was down south and it became my stress reliever, my escape. Now don't get me wrong, I don't choose to play games over being with her, it was more so the fact that we didn't do much except go to the gym, occasional dinner out, and watch Netflix. 

Her and I are both big travelers (at least I want to be) but I just knew it wasn't in the budget for a while. I did get one excuse to see my family in Florida and she gladly joined me. We had a lot of fun I thought and it was really nice getting away with her. She brought up going on an international trip and believe me, I'm all for it. But I just had to wait until my finances were in order to feel comfortable. Throughout our time dating, I have always been the ""penny pincher."" So much so that I had to really try hard to let loose and not care for a weekend or 2 when I was visiting her or while we lived together. Those few outings really add up though in the long run hence my financial situation.

This past Friday, she came home after being gone all week, and right away I notice things were darker. We've been a little more frustrated with each other lately, a little less tolerant, but I was under the (wrong) impression that things could still get better. That we would get through this rough patch. We haven't really been intimate or sexual since the back seat of my car. We did it a couple times but definitely not as regular and not as much desire as there used to be. We finished our dinner and out came the tears. She was at a breaking point. She said she didn't feel like we were good for each other anymore. How we were both a lot sadder than we used to be and she didn't see it getting better. I'm really emotional and I just bawled my eyes out. I've never cried so much before, until today that is. I tried to be civil and respectful and going back to my old ways, tried to let her know I was there for her, would love her, and how much I wanted to right all these wrongs. I was really upset and could tell how saddened she was by admitting this. We still ended up sleeping side by side.

Yesterday was a big day. Her Christmas present to me was comedy show tickets and it was our late Valentine's day date night. I was ready to turn on the charm and prayed for the opportunity to get back and show her how much I loved her. I thought the day went pretty well, had a lot of fun at the show. It was apparent on the ride home this were not going to go as planned. When we got home we had the same talk again, this time even more so past the breaking point. Lots of tears followed, I slept in the guest bedroom. It felt like we were done.

This morning, I try to keep positive. We had our yoga class then were planning on having dinner with her parents. I wanted to turn around and be the man she knew she loved, and knew she could continue to love. I didn't get that chance. After our yoga class, she broke down again and said she was done. Couldn't handle the stress of our relationship anymore, didn't see a future with me.

So we just spent the better part of today crying. Trying to figure out next steps, and dealing with these emotions. She told her parents, all parties are pretty sad. I'm waiting until this weekend to tell my mom.

She has made it a point that she wants to continue being friends, and stay in contact. She assures me she still loves and cares for me very much. I find it so difficult to have such strong feelings for someone and not act on them. It will be very hard but I don't want to completely remove her from my life yet. We spent a lot of time today in each other's arms, holding hands, crying and hugging. Knowing it was the end, but how bad it really felt. We would maybe go 15 minutes before breaking out in tears again. 

We told each other how special we are, how we'll never forget the love we had and how we'll always love each other. She seemed to be consoling me because I am not taking it well. I did not want this to end. I am so torn. My heart is broken but I would still do anything to be with her. It does feel selfish though since I truly want her to be happy, and I'm just not being that person for her right now. It just really sucks how it's not mutual. I've heard her say I love you more times today than I've heard all year. I can't help but feel like if these feelings are truly that strong, and that she wants to continue our relationship, if only at a friend level, why can't we work together to improve the relationship.


But here comes the tricky part. We still have 8 months left on our lease. I've moved my stuff to our 2nd bedroom for now. Need to figure out what to do about this apartment. I need to find a new place to live and stick to my budget more than ever before. Problem is I don't have enough savings to cover a deposit. At least not yet. Would need to use my credit card which i would hate to do. We need to figure out our bills, cancelling our joint gym membership, moving out. We can't break our lease without paying thousands of dollars and so much shit has to get done with all these leftover feelings. It's incredibly sad, uncomfortable, and it will get awkward after a few days. I'm at a total loss. I lost my best friend, I lost my partner, I lost my love. I don't know what to do or how to move forward. I don't know how to approach telling my friends, my parents. I was so set on her being the one. My eyes hurt from crying so much, head is pounding, hearts not there anymore. Stomach is crying but I have no appetite. I'm doing my best to prevent panic attacks, did I mention I have anxiety? I'm hyperventilating like crazy and feeling very overwhelmed. Just as I thought things were getting back on track in my own life and in the relationship, it all fell apart.


I'm going to call my best friend soon and break the news. Thanks for reading."

**The House of Cards Set**

President Francis Underwood and his wife, First Lady Claire Underwood, were in the Oval Office, alone. Judging by their body language and demeanor, something was clearly wrong with Mr. and Mrs. Clinton. Frank, who had probably just got back from pushing a journalist in front of a train or something of that nature, was seated at the desk while Claire paced around this room where so many historic decisions, for better or worse, had been made. Finally, after about a half a minute of this, Claire took a seat directly across from her husband and began to speak.

**CLAIRE:** Let’s run together.


This statement, which seemed more befitting of two rebellious teenage lovers than the leader of the free world and his wife, caught Frank off guard. 

**FRANK:** You don’t mean.. as a-

**CLAIRE:** Yes, Francis. An Underwood/Underwood ticket. 

**FRANK:** I’m worried about you, Claire. 

This was apparently the kind of news one had to be on his two feet to truly process, so the President stood up from his desk.

**FRANK:** You’re not making any sense. You’ve let your ego get in the way.

It was at this point in their conversation that his tone went from dumbfounded to verging on angry as he gripped the edges of the so-called Resolute desk. 

**CLAIRE:** I’ve always been your running mate, you just didn’t know it then. But I was always the only person you could ever truly trust, and you know it. Doug’s loyal, but he’s gotten sloppy lately. 

**FRANK:** As my Vice President?! Jesus Christ, Claire, do you have any idea what people would say? Nepotism would be declared the word of the year by Merriam-Webster, and I can’t even imagine what the headlines would read. 

**CLAIRE:** I’ve put a lot of thought into this.

**FRANK:** You can’t have thought this through, because if you did- 

Before Frank could finish his sentence, Claire began to spout out a series of phrases ranging from “she has no experience” to “it’s like some third world dictatorship.” The President seemed to be tiring of his her antics and threw up his hands in mock surrender as he moved across the office. 

**CLAIRE:** You can’t win without me. 

This, it seemed, was the last straw for Frank, who rapidly advanced towards her until there was barely six inches between. 

**FRANK:** I’d rather have Doug or a spineless Donald Blythe as my Vice President than someone who’s never held elected office in their life! 


**CLAIRE:** You’re losing to a woman who’s never held elected office.

The truth in these words stung. Frank was, in fact, currently trailing behind the progressive candidate Heather “Bernadine Sanders” Dunbar in the polls.

**FRANK:** You don’t deserve it. You have no idea what it means to have nothing. You don’t value what we have worked so hard to achieve together. I have had to fight for everything my entire life. 

After delivering the first part of what was sure to be a classic Frank tirade, he rushed back over to the desk and retrieved an old photograph from the surface of it. The photo, which had caused quite a stir earlier on in Underwood’s political career when it was leaked, was of his late father standing next to a member of the Ku Klux Klan, presumably at some kind of rally or cross-burning, with both of his thumbs up and a smile on his face. 

**FRANK:** Do you know why I kept this? Do you have any idea? Because it’s the one time I was proud of my father! Because this man, in this moment, as repugnant and vile as it was, is fighting to survive! He is doing whatever it takes! And so will I, with or without you. So no, I will not dignify your fantasies of playing Vice President with anything resembling a conversation! I will not indulge you any further, you have to let this go! 

Frank was halfway through the door by the time he finished this, but Claire was not finished. 

**CLAIRE:** I can either be a part of your campaign… or I can end it. 

**FINCHER:** Cut!

David Fincher, the acclaimed director of Zodiac, Fight Club, and numerous other films that, while good, are overhyped by the general public, which is rarely exposed to good cinema (The Nolan Syndrome), called for an end to shooting on this particular scene in House of Cards. Numerous members of the film crew (known as ""film goons"" in the common parlance) raced around pulling away cameras and booms and other minor objects that we have no real knowledge of because we've never actually been on a film set. Kevin Spacey and his co-star Robin Wright took a few seconds to collect themselves, and then started walking off set side-by-side.

**WRIGHT:** You know Kevin, I thought that was a great performance.

**SPACEY:** You weren't too bad yourself. I think you're really starting to grasp the intricacies of Claire, you know.   

**WRIGHT:** ""The intricacies""? That might make sense if they gave me any decent material once in a while. 

**SPACEY:** I think the material Claire gets is pretty decent, actually. She comes across as one of those strong women you always see people babbling about in newspapers. 

Wright stopped, and Spacey quickly doubled back in order to continue their conversation. 

**WRIGHT:** I think Claire comes off more as someone who's being artificially propped up as being clever. They keep giving me these big moments where she's showing skill, but that doesn't matter if leading up to and away from them I'm portraying a raging idiot. If the pay here wasn't so good...

**SPACEY:** You'd what? Leave? Come off it, we both know that's not true. If this industry hates anything, it's quitters. If you dropped out of the show because you didn't agree with the writing of this or that season, you'd be blacklisted faster than you can say ""Red Scare"".

**WRIGHT:** And you expect me to think you'd stick here if people were *laughing* at Underwood? 

**SPACEY:** I signed a contract, I made a commitment to stick with this show until it ends. I'd still be here even if they made me a talking donkey. 

**WRIGHT:** Yeah, whatever. I somehow doubt that, Spacey. 

**SPACEY:** You can doubt whatever the hell you want, Robin. I know my own mind. I'm not just in this for the Golden Globes and the Emmy's. God knows *I* could get a golden globe for acting a pumpkin in the new X-Files. I'll see you on the set. 

With this, Spacey turned his back on his co-star and headed to his trailer, where he went straight to his record player and popped in Bill Withers’ [Use Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZldnP0lhHA) as he began to wind down after a day’s filming. Before he could get properly settled in, however, a knock came to his door and Spacey opened it begrudgingly to find one of the aforementioned ""film goons"" standing there, holding one of those clipboards that everyone knows doesn't actually have anything substantial on it. Spacey looked at him impatiently, quite eager to get back to his records and drink some surprisingly cheap whiskey. 

**SPACEY:** Well, can I help you?

**INTERN:** Yeah, gee, uh, I'm real sorry, Mr. Spacey, but uhh, uhh, Steven Spielberg is uh, here for you. In fact, he's..

Steven Spielberg, who was, bar none, the undisputed king of Hollywood, walked up towards Spacey and the intern, and extended his hand towards Kev, who immediately shook it.

**SPIELBERG:** Right here. How are ya doing, Kevin? 

**SPACEY:** Why, I'm fine. What about you, Mr. Spielberg?

**SPIELBERG:** Thanks for inviting me in, Kevin! There's a lot of people who wouldn't be gracious enough to do that.

Ignoring the fact that Kevin Spacey hadn't actually invited him into his trailer, Spielberg pushed past the intern and, with Spacey standing back to let him past, waltzed right on into the trailer. He looked around, as if questioning the living standards of one of the top-paid actors in the world and his luxury trailer, before sitting himself down a red armchair near Spacey's television.

**SPIELBERG:** What are we watching, Kevin?

**SPACEY:** I was just listening to some Bill W-

**SPIELBERG:** Oh, great, I love Seinfeld.

Spacey, despite being among the biggest actors in television and film today, still knew that there were people in this business that he had to answer to and therefore paid no mind to Spielberg snatching the remote and flipping through channels on his TV. 

**SPACEY:** So, Mr. Spielberg, what brings to this neck of the woods, then? Wait, don’t tell me, you’re guest directing the next episode?? 

Spielberg, clearly above Spacey and House of Cards in every sense, chuckled at this suggestion. Spacey let out a small laugh too, because that had in fact been a joke.

**SPACEY:** Seriously though, Mr. Spielberg, to what do I owe the honour?

**SPIELBERG:** I don't see why you have to owe it to anything, Kevin. 

**SPACEY:** Well, what I'm trying to ascertain is, is this business, or a social call?

**SPIELBERG:** Oy vey, Kevin. Why does everything have to be business or pleasure? I've always been a fan of the middle ground.

**SPACEY:** Washington consensus politics?

**SPIELBERG:** Although that's the greatest force of good this world has ever seen, I mean, Kevin, that I like to make things business *and* pleasure. Just because something's work related doesn't mean it can't be fun. I mean, try telling that to anyone operating a casting couch.

**SPACEY:** Try telling that to the people on the casting couch. 

Spielberg let out an unwarranted and hearty belly-laugh as soon as he heard this, slapping his leg in the way that no one ever actually does earnestly. 

**SPIELBERG:** Oh Kevin, you're really too much! Listen up, I'm going to be blunt. I've always wanted to direct you, Kevin. You're such a fine young talent. I want to offer you the role of the lead in my upcoming biopic of Franklin Roosevelt, Kevin. I think it's about time you get that third Oscar.

Spacey was somewhat taken aback by this offer, considering that Spielberg had never before expressed any great interest in casting him in one of his surefire blockbusters (Kev had actually auditioned for the role of Lincoln in the eponymous film, but been flatly rejected), and took a few seconds to think about it.

**SPIELBERG:** Well? 

**SPACEY:** Well...thank you for your offer, Mr. Spielberg, but -

**SPIELBERG:** Why does there always have to be a ""but"", Kevin? Everywhere I go, it's thanks ""but"", can't people just say ""no thanks""? 

**SPACEY:** If you'd let me finish, I was going to say that I have to think about it. I don't make any business decisions unless I'm sufficiently drunk, as I'm sure you understand, and, you know, the show takes a lot of time. 

**SPIELBERG:** Oh, I'm sure it does. I'm sure that House of Cards takes up all of your valuable time, Kevin. I bet you wake up after a half-hour nap at 3AM, and think to yourself ""oy gevalt, I've gotta reshoot"". Kevin, I'm making you an offer that you really shouldn't refuse. 

Spielberg stood up and made his way over to the door of the trailer, but he seemed to have second thoughts about leaving, and stopped halfway across the room. 

**SPIELBERG:** Kevin, every single person that I end up directing comes out on the other side with a brand-new better life. 

**SPACEY:** What if I like the life I've got? 

**SPIELBERG:** Then I'd have to say that you're very foolish, Kevin. Kevin, think of it like this. You've made it to the highest rung of the ladder in Hollywood, you crawl up onto the floor, and then someone comes along and tells you that there's a whole other ladder above this one. Don't you want to see where that goes? 

**SPACEY:** I think I'd just ask the guy telling me about the ladder what it leads to, actually. So where's your ladder taking me to, Mr. Spielberg? Some steal beams and a hard hat? 

**SPIELBERG:** Oy vey, Kevin, you can't just ask where the ladder takes you, y'know? The ladder takes you where the ladder takes you, I'm just telling you it's not a place you want to miss out on.

**SPACEY:** Yeah, problem is, I think I know where this ladder's going. Right to the heart of the New World Order. 

Spielberg laughed, clearly trying to give off a feeling of incredulity and feigned disbelief and Kevin Spacey's (presumably accurate, let's be honest) assumption about the purely hypothetical ladder.

**SPIELBERG:** The New World Order?

**SPACEY:** Yeah, the N.W.O. Bohemian Grove, Tribe, whatever you wanna call it.

**SPIELBERG:** You are delusional, Kevin. You know that? Completely and utterly insane, and not to mention, massively anti-Semitic. You know something, Kev? People like you lost in the War, and I don't think you're going to win the peace, either. You're lucky I don't feel like making you into the next Mel Gibson, you nazi. 

Spielberg threw open the trailer door, and stepped out into the sunlight. He made sure to slam it behind him, shaking a picture of Spacey's parents off of his coffee table. Now, ain't that a real meanster move?

**Whole Foods** 

Jeffrey Tambor was a family man through-and-through, and as such, he did a lot of the grocery shopping for his wife and four kids. On this particular evening, he found himself perusing the aisles of the local Whole Foods for some delicious and nutritious (albeit a bit overpriced) eats. As he made his way down the nuts aisle (Tambor was rather fond of pistachios and walnuts, if you must know), however, he heard a set of faint footsteps behind him and, assuming it to be another shopper, stepped out of the way to allow them to pass. When this didn’t happen, Jeffy turned around, only to find no one in sight. The 73-year-old actor shrugged and, chalking this bizarre occurrence up to his admittedly poor hearing, continued on down the protein-rich aisle. Nuts are, in fact, full of protein. Most people know this, but it’s something to get out of the way just in case the readers don’t. Without the risk of encountering random photographers and poor people in this supermarket, (There was no hard ban on them, but surely the property prices in the area amounted to nothing less than a soft ban) Tambor was able to contently go about his shopping, and soon grabbed the next item on his, a jar of generic brand peanut butter (although, if Whole Foods carried it, he would have surely bought Jiffy, even if it meant paying a few cents more). Having acquired not-jiffy, Tambor crossed it off his list and moved onto the next aisle over. As he went about doing this, however, his attention was drawn momentarily to a dark figure (physically, but not racially, mind you) standing in the middle of the intersection of the aisles. The man had long, unkempt hair and a beard equally as messy, and wore a dirty overcoat. Every inch of him appeared to be covered in dirt and grime, including his face. This all led Jeffy to believe that this must have been a bum who had wandered into the store, potentially from nearby Venice Beach, which boasted a large homeless population. Tambor, who had long been uncomfortable around the homeless after an unfortunate incident in the mid-90s where he was mugged by a dozen-odd bums in the middle of Times Square (They had pushed awful mixtapes on him, to make it look like an actual transaction), put his head down and quietly pushed his shopping cart past the man. A second or two later, he glanced out of the corner of his eye and saw that he was being tailed. 

**TAMBOR:** Aw geez.  

Jeffy, by this point thoroughly unnerved by this hobo’s behavior, opted to just go pay for what he had at the till and avoid another potential Times Square scenario. As he approached the one register that actually had an employee behind it, Tambor had on a rather disturbed demeanor. The cashier, a young man of no more than twenty years, took immediate notice of this and leaned in closer to speak to him.

**CASHIER:** Uh, sir, did you find everything alright?

Tambor responded with a nod. 

**CASHIER:** Well, that’s good, but you look a little bit shaken up. Is something the matter, sir? 

Jeffy again nodded, before finally answering in a hushed tone. 

**TAMBOR:** Is he still following me..?

The cashier glanced around the area but found no one. After all, this wasn’t typically an hour when the store had many shoppers. 

**CASHIER:** I don’t believe so, sir. 

Jeffrey looked around himself, but he, too, saw no one. The cashier quickly rang up his grand total of two items and Tambor handed him a few one dollar bills and some change. 

**TAMBOR:** Uh, you can keep the change. 

**CASHIER:** Um, alright, sir, have a good rest of your night, then.

Jeffy had already departed through the set of doors and into the parking before he could even finish this sentence. As he began a beeline for his car, which he had made the mistake of parking towards the back of the lot, Jeffy managed to accidentally drop his keys, which is something that you only really accomplish if you’re a massive dipshit.

**TAMBOR:** Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me…

Still several hundred feet from the safety of his car, he bent down to pick them up. Returning to his feet, the actor glanced back at the Whole Foods, where he saw the bum from earlier standing in the exit. The sight of this sent him (and his heart rate) running for his parked mercedes. Immediately upon entering the driver’s seat, Jeffy locked his doors. 

**TAMBOR:** Calm down, Jeffy… 

As he backed out of the parking space, Tambor looked in the rear-view mirror, which was facing the front of the grocery store. The homeless man (Who really needs a quicker name - perhaps Trashman) was no longer standing in the doorway, and was in fact, nowhere to be seen. After assuring himself that the trashman wouldn’t just pop up in the back seat of his wagon, Tambor set off for home, far away from the clutches of the nastier elements of the underclasses. A few short hours later (You can blame the traffic in the City of Angels, folks) and Tambor had arrived at his rather spacious home in Westchester county, merrily pulling up in the driveway and jumping out with his shopping bag. As he walked up the steps to his front door, though, he realised that the way he was holding his bag reminded him vaguely of a hobo’s bindle, and images of that completely drug-addled looking prospective kidnapper from Whole Foods filled his head. Thoughts of this meanster occupied Jeffrey’s head so utterly that he failed to even open his door, and simply stood there until his wife, Kasia Tambor, came to it.

**MRS. TAMBOR:** Hello? Earth to Jeffy?

No response. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** For Christ’s sake…

Kasia, assuming this to be a joke on her husband’s party, grabbed Jeffy by the hand and dragged him into the house. As he entered, he was practically blitzed by two of his younger children, Gabriel and Eve. Finally, it seemed he had snapped out of this trance-like state and addressed the two little tykes. 

**TAMBOR:** Woah, easy there, kids, your dad’s like a big ole tree, he might look tall but it doesn’t take much to know him over. 

Mrs. Tambor was left baffled at this sudden change in demeanor from Jeffrey, who had by now picked both kids up and hoisted them up onto his shoulders. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** Alright, kids, it’s actually way past your bedtime so why don’t you go head upstairs and get ready for bed?

**GABRIEL:** Aw, but mom, we’re having so much fun!

**TAMBOR:** Your mother’s right. Besides, we need to have a grown-up talk anyway. 

**GABRIEL:** Alright…

After the two little ones, who, compared to many American children this day and age, were fairly well-behaved, headed upstairs, Tambor walked into the dining room and virtually collapsed onto one of the chairs. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** So, are you going to tell me why you came back with only two things off that list and looking like you’d just seen a ghost? 

**TAMBOR:** Kasia, I promise I’ll tell you all about it, but I want you to go and draw all of the blinds. Just trust me on this one, alright? Don’t ask why. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** You want me to go and draw all of the blinds? Jeff, you know I get that sometimes you can be a lil eccentric, that’s part of the reason I married you, but…

**TAMBOR:** I told you not to ask me why, just, please do it.

Kasia Tambor nodded understandably and went off to go abide by her husband’s request. A few minutes later she came back into the sitting room, clearly still confused about exactly why she’d just had to pull every blind in her house.

**MRS. TAMBOR:** Is this about the sunlight giving you headaches, again?

**TAMBOR:** No, it’s not about the sunlight. Jesus, Kasia, not everything has to be about the sunlight. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** Well, what is it about, then?

**TAMBOR:** Look, there was this guy...a homeless guy, in Whole Foods, and I’m pretty sure he was following me. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** Why would there be a homeless guy following you in Whole Foods, Jeffrey?  What do you think this is, Times Square? It’s not going to happen again, honey.

**TAMBOR:** I’m not worried about him mugging me, I think...maybe he wants to kill me?

Mrs. Tambor blinked a few times, processing this information. Perhaps she thought that her husband had finally lost all of his marbles.

**MRS. TAMBOR:** He wants to kill you. 

**TAMBOR:** Yeah, I think he might. I think he wants to kill me like he killed Prince, dear. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** He killed Prince, and the next step is killing Jeffrey Tambor….?

**TAMBOR:** Geez, I mean, when you put it like that, I guess it might be. Maybe I angered the uh, the Tribe, and they want to take me out. Kasia, I think they killed Kennedy. 

Before his wife had time to respond to Tambor’s ramblings about the so-called Tribe and Kennedy (Q: John or Robert? A: Both.), both of them heard a distinct clang and thud from outside, like someone had knocked over a garbage can. Mr. and Mrs. Tambor (Mr. Tambor more so, but it was hard to say that his paranoia hadn’t infected his wife) paled at such a loud noise coming from right outside their front door. Jeffrey held up a hand to stop his wife from heading out the door to investigate, and slowly made his way over to the blinds covering his large front-room window like a Vietcong member preparing for the Tet Offensive. Tambor peeled back the blinds like you might open a book you were afraid of ripping, and gazed outside. He could see the family trash can rolling towards the sidewalk, contents spilling out around his yard. 

**MRS. TAMBOR:** Well?

**TAMBOR:** It’s just the trash can. I….I guess maybe one of Mrs. Roth’s cats knocked it over. You know how they always poke around the property.

**MRS. TAMBOR:** Yeah, I guess it’s one of the cats. 

Jeffy prepared to close the blinds again, but at the last second he noticed a figure sitting on the other side of the block - a homeless man wearing a tattered soldier’s outfit. The man, who was categorically not the same person as Tambor had encountered in the supermarket, seemed to be eating some beans out of what might be considered his hat, were it actually on his head. He briefly made eye-contact with Jeffrey, sending the Arrested Development star into a great fright, and causing him to snap the blinds shut again and turn away from the window, heart racing.

**TAMBOR:** Kennedy, Kubrick, Bowie, Prince….Kennedy, Kubrick, Bowie, Prince….Kennedy, Kubrick, Bowie, Prince......

**Pool Party at Chris Evans’ House**

Hollywood, as anyone who spends more than a few hours in the City of Angels is bound to find out, primarily revolves around either partying or sitting in your mansion remembering the days when you did party, like some kind of real-life Norma Desmond figure. The films and awards were, in reality, secondary to having carte-blanche to get completely fucked up almost whenever you felt like it. Most of this happened at various elite nightclubs which you couldn’t get into without an annual salary of at least 200,000 dollars, or at private parties hosted by big-name actors, directors, and producers. One of these parties was currently happening at the mansion of Chris Evans, star of the Avengers and Captain America film series. A lot of the time, Hollywood parties ended up devolving into people who were already in sets or cliques standing around and talking to each other, while only briefly talking to other people. For those of you who have ever been to a real party (read: no one) this is basically how they operate, too. At the minute, Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Melanie Daniels (A minor figure and celebrity hopeful who had got into Evans’ do by virtue of being the person Franco was dating in this two week window) were sitting around in a circle in one of the bedrooms, smoking the ole’ “peace pipe”.

**ROGEN:** Bro, quit hoggin’ the kush! You’re like a big sponge but instead of water you suck up fuckin’ weed, man. A weed-sponge. 

**FRANCO:** Fuck off, man, if anyone here’s the sponge, it’s you! You sure as hell have the figure of one. 

Melanie, who we speculate was some kind of model, giggled at her boyfriend’s “witty” remark. 

**ROGEN:** Bro, I was thinking, what if we do a movie about Drumpf, except, here’s the thing, bro. 

**FRANCO:** What’s the thing, man? 

**ROGEN:** What if Drumpf has like...flatulence, man...or like, incontinence. 

**FRANCO:** How would we show Robert Mueller’s rape of Melania, man?

**ROGEN:** Hmm.. I got it, I think. How about we have a funny sound effect play each time he like.. shoots in her? I don’t know, man, I’m just kinda spit-ballin’ here, but I personally think that’d be a real conversation-starter.

**FRANCO:** Bazoonga! 

**ROGEN:** Bazoonga?

**FRANCO:** Yeah, bro, every time he shoots his load in her, we play this Chinese guy shouting “bazoonga!”.

**ROGEN:** That’s fucking genius, man! And people wonder why we always work together! Clearly you’re the brains and I’m the… god, how the fuck does that one go? Pinky, I’m pinky and you’re the brain, man, that’s it. 

**FRANCO:** Bro, what if the end of the film has Barron Trump coming back and raping Mueller’s bombshell daughter, man? And, like, when he’s doing it, he, like, he snarls at her man, bazoonga, bazoonga. And then we roll the credits.

**ROGEN:** Man, I’m worried we’re gonna forget all these dank ideas when we wake up tomorrow morning. Does anyone have a pen and paper or something? I’d hate to lose all this stuff, cause I think we stumbled on some real gold here, man! 

**FRANCO:** I want to act Mueller, bro. 

**ROGEN:** Aw, shit, man, yeah, and Melanie here can play Melania! I mean, they basically have the same name anyway and you two wouldn’t even have to like.. sign any papers beforehand or anything like that Jodorowsky guy had those girls do before he act-raped them. If anything, I think it’d bring you two together, even. I don’t know, I might just be spouting off bullshit due to all this dank fuckin’ weed we just smoked, but it sounds like a killer idea to me. 

As Rogen and Franco, who were clearly the Laurel and Hardy of their era, discussed this amazing movie concept that would surely go on to dominate the oscars (Who couldn’t award Rogen a best actor oscar for his heart-breaking portrayal of Steve Bannon?), Brett Ratner walked past, heading towards the pool with a cheeseburger in his hands. Although the man who was surely the greatest director in the history of motion pictures clearly didn’t care about the cholesterol implications of eating a pure American (Insofar as Taiwan is American China) hamburger, Seth Rogen, who actually had an amazing diet in spite of his great weight, clearly did. 

**ROGEN:** Look at that fat fuck, bro. Does he just wanna clog all his arteries up or something??

**FRANCO:** Yeah, man, preach that shit. It’s like some people don’t give a shit what they put in their bodies.

As Franco said this, he took another hit of the joint before passing it on down to Rogen.

**ROGEN:** I guess you finally decided to redistribute the wealth, bro.

**FRANCO:** Anything for a brother, man. That Ratner fuck’s got some real nerve showing up around here, though, after trying to put his grubby hands on my girl. 

**ROGEN:** No shit, dude. What happened, Melanie, bro?

**FRANCO:** She was auditioning for a part in Rush Hour Six and he totally abused the imbalanced power relationship to try and make a move on her, bro! 

**ROGEN:** You just don’t do that shit, man.

**FRANCO:** That’s what I’m saying, dude!

**MELANIE:** Y- 

Before Melanie Daniels could say whatever insightful and presumably profound statement she had come up with in her big ole word-factory (that’s brain for you plebs), she seemed to be struck down by some kind of pain in her head. A few seconds later, and blood started to pour out of her nose like if God had forgot to make vaginas and our nose was our female sexual organs and a woman was having one of her kooky periods. Seth Rogen, ever a caring and considerate friend, attempted to ask her if she was alright, but she couldn’t hear him because [Jessie’s Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYkbTyHXwbs) was blasting through the nearby speakers. Either that, or because she was having a massive brain hemorrhage. One of the two. Melanie fell out of her chair and onto the floor, writhing about in agony potentially comparable to the greatest pain a woman can feel - not childbirth, but rejection. 

**ROGEN:** Aw shit, bro, she doesn’t look too good! 

**FRANCO:** Yo, are you like, alright, babe? 

Melanie give this a big and hearty “no” by starting to bleed from her mouth, and then her ears, and then her eyes, in response. She then began to violently spasm, launching her out of the corner that the three of them had been in, and towards Mr. Evans’ pool. 

**ROGEN:** Shit, man, what the shit!

**FRANCO:** I dunno bro, maybe we should call an ambulance.

**ROGEN:** You’re not thinking straight, man! You have any idea how long it’d take for an ambulance to get up Evans’ driveway?

Rogen had a point. Chris Evans, the man hosting this lil shindig, held the record for Hollywood’s longest driveway, not that this is of any importance to the narrative. 

**FRANCO:** Fuck, what the fuck are we gonna do, man??! 

**ROGEN:** Well, we gotta do the only thing we can do - try and plug her up. 

**FRANCO:** With what, though?!

**ROGEN:** I don’t know, dude, why do you expect me to have all the ideas?? 

**FRANCO:** What about the MJ, bro?!?! We could plug her up with the leaves!

**ROGEN:** That’s an idea, bro. It’s not a good one, but it’s better than what I have.

Seth and Jimmy appeared poised to launch into this pot-plugging exercise, but Melanie Daniels apparently had other ideas, propelling herself into the pool, which soon filled with blood and emptied of people. 

**ROGEN:** Scratch that, bro. The weed would get all damp! There’s a line between dank and damp, bro, and that would definitely be crossing it!

**FRANCO:** Shit man, she’s gonna drown! 

**ROGEN:** Fuck, we’ve gotta fish her out of there! Fucking Evans has to have one of those nets they use to fish frogs out of the pool laying somewhere around here.

It appeared that Rogen was right, because after a few seconds of searching, the two weed-brothers located one of “those nets they use to fish frogs out of the pool”. They now had a captive audience consisting of every single person attending the party gathered around the pool and watching them. They weren’t helping due to the bystander effect, which is probably the same reason any of you would be contend to watch a little Syrian refugee get raped in the middle of the Sunset Strip, if there were enough people doing the same. Rogen rushed over with the big toad-pole and started trying to pull Melanie out of the water, but he found that his arms were too short for the task.

**ROGEN:** I can’t reach her! 

**FRANCO:** You need to get closer, man! 

Rogen attempted to get closer to the water, but, in doing so, lost his balance and ended up suffering the same fate as Melanie (minus the whole “bleeding out of every orifice” bit, albeit). By now, most of the crowd had taken out their smart phones and begun recording the ordeal, because they’re really scummy people, to be quite honest. From there, it would soon find itself on the front page of TMZ and other gossip columns as these things tend to do.

**The Weinstein Company Studio**

The main Los Angeles studio of the prestigious Weinstein Company was running at full capacity today as Harvey and the gang started full production on the upcoming Quentin Tarantino film *Chalkboard Love*, starring Jon Hamm as a white orphan who was raised as a black man in the deep south, and must seek revenge against the Grand Wizard of the Klan, played by Matthew Broderick, who kills his adoptive family. Any similarities between Hamm’s character, a passionate cinephile and foot fetishist, and the director himself, are purely coincidental. Tarantino and Harvey Weinstein were currently taking a break from the shooting, and enjoying a refreshing cup of joe and some of the diner food that never looks quite as good in reality as it did in Pulp Fiction. 

**TARANTINO:** Harv, all I’m saying is that maybe you should’ve let Salma down a little bit easier the other night. I’m not saying you had to take her up on her offer - I mean I certainly would - but from what I’ve heard it sounds like she was really hurt by it, y’know, my ghetto nigger? 

**WEINSTEIN:** Look, Quentin -

**TARANTINO:** Imma just sayin’, play it coo’ nigga!

**WEINSTEIN:** She just kinda threw herself onto me, man. I don’t know, I just don’t think that’s very attractive.

**TARANTINO:** Aw shiet, I, uh, I dig, Harv-dog, I dig. Fuckin’ hell, man, when’d the radio go off? I had it on fucking, 70s classic rock radio, Boston, The Knack. God, I really gotta hire a nigger to keep my radio on, fuck! I’ll be right back, man, this shit’s really messing with my, uh, my groove, man. 

Tarantino, clearly upset by the fact that K-Billy’s Super Sounds of 70s was no longer playing, went off to go remedy this. Harv, meanwhile, picked up a copy of today’s edition of the Los Angeles Times and began flipping through it. At first, he noticed no stories that piqued his interest until he reached the second page, which contained the headline “Hollywood party ends on somber note after aspiring starlet found dead in pool.” As Weinstein glanced over the article, he noticed Kevin Spacey making his way towards him. Spacey, who, we can confirm, was not a cast member of *Chalkboard Love*, soon reached Harv, and sat down beside him.

**WEINSTEIN:** Kev, fancy seeing you around town. Anything I can do for ya? 

**SPACEY:** Yeah, Harvey. I think you can. I think I’ve made up my mind. On “The Tribe”. 

**WEINSTEIN:** Alright Kev, good to know. Can you tell me how that relates to anything I’m fuckin’ doing, unless you’re here to give me some good news?

**SPACEY:** I think they want me to join their ranks, Harvey. 

**WEINSTEIN:** What makes you think that, did you get the invitation in the mail?

**SPACEY:** No, I was approached by Steven Spielberg of all people on set the other day and I’m certain now that he was talking about the tribe. He kept talking about how I should “go up the ladder” or something. It all fit the description of the Tribe you gave at the party. 

**WEINSTEIN:** Well, what did you tell him?

**SPACEY:** I said “no,” of course. 

**WEINSTEIN:** Jesus Christ, Kev, you shouldn’t have done that. Do you have any idea what they’ll do to you now that you’ve rejected their offer?! These people don’t take “no” for an answer! 

**SPACEY:** Nicholson said he rejected them too and he looks fine to me! 

**WEINSTEIN:** You should never base your decisions off anything Jack says, for fuck’s sake. I’m pretty sure the only reason he hasn’t been tribed at this point is because he acts so god-damn unhinged! You’re no Nicholson, Kev. I’m worried about you. 

**SPACEY:** Well, you shouldn’t -

The man who had managed to remain as the sole shining light of the entire House of Cards project for almost a decade trailed off mid-sentence, as he noticed the newspaper that Harvey was holding in his hands, and the headline of the article he was reading. Spacey reached over and snatched it out of Harv’s clutches, his interest clearly piqued to fuck.

**SPACEY:** Lemme get a look at that…”An aspiring young actress was reported dead on the scene at a pool party hosted by *Avengers* star Chris Evans. Melanie Daniels, 23, apparently suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage following an overdose”.

**WEINSTEIN:** Yeah, and? 

**SPACEY:** Did you not look at the picture? She’s right there with James Franco and Seth Rogen, Weinstein. 

Weinstein’s brow furrowed upon hearing this news, and he did what any normal person would do in this situation, taking the newspaper back from Spacey and looking at a picture of young, dumb, and blonde Ms. Daniels standing right beside Franco and Rogen at the pool. 

**WEINSTEIN:** Y’think....?

**SPACEY:** I got contacted, Franco gets this, which I assume has to be related. If you check in with Jeffrey Tambor, I wouldn’t be surprised if something was going on with him. Someone has to have overheard our conversation last night, Harv. 

**WEINSTEIN:** Oh shit….we gotta go, Kev. C’mon back to my place, man. If you’re right, things are going to get *very* difficult, very fuckin’ soon.

My boyfriend and I have been together for close to 7 months and it s been really great, but recently he s been offered an internship that could most likely lead to a sort of a dream job for him. 

Thing is, he would be moving 4 hours away for some time during the internship and possibly forever if he d get the job... I was planning to move there too after i finish college ( i have a year and a half left ) even before he told me he ll go, but i had really bad past experiences with long distance relationships and i m just terrified of getting hurt again... 

I m really happy for him and proud of him, but Ive been crying a lot lately and i just can t / don t know how to control myself... he says I m crazy and that everything s gonna be fine, that we could see each other during the weekends or every other weekend and on the one hand, i love him and i see a future with him, on the other hand i feel like i m going to be stuck for a couple months in some sort of long distance emotional purgatory and that he ll realize he doesn t want me anymore and that would just be devastating to me... 

i don t know how to approach this..

Thanks for reading this

TLDR:  long distance relationshop, boyfriend wants one, i m chicken, what do

7ykcpu,8,2018-02-19,Rise on Apache summer sublease(1BR)!,SunDeviI,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/7ykcpu/rise_on_apache_summer_sublease1br/,"Hey guys, I'm putting my one bedroom, one bathroom apartment up (available immediately after the end of Spring semester, May 7th) for sublease as I'm pursuing an internship out-of-state. I'm going to be straight up with y'all though. Yes, this place has a bad reputation for poor management, cleanliness, and water outages but actually, management is starting to pick up the slack and the water situation has been consistent. I believe the reason for the last water outage (which lasted for two days iirc) was because some person drove their car into one of the main water supplies in the parking garage but I could be wrong. There's nothing that can be done about the trash because college students will be college students.

The amenities can be seen on the website but the things I actually use are the fitness center, the 10th-floor study lounge/running deck (which includes free printing if you provide paper), and of course, my personal favorite, the 15th-floor rooftop pool area with a lot of open area, a pool and a jucuzzi, and a number of grills for BBQ. 

For utilities, everything from water, wifi, and cable are provided, however, electricity is not. That, and a parking permit in the 4-floors parking garage if needed, are the only other expenses.

Rent and conditions are negotiable as the subleaser would be helping me out big time. In all honestly, Rise is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be considering the circumstances since they're rookies but it'll only get better from here. Spread the word and if you're interested, please PM me so we can discuss things more in detail! Thanks!

.  
Day 16, and part two of the techwear pant challenge put to me by a user named Danii who is the creator of the awesome accessories brand AOKU. Yesterday I dove in over my head and ended up only just getting the patterns done in time. Today I set forth to make my first pair of pants with any kind of form or shaping... my previous efforts were all shapeless tubes for legs. I have say it... I'm pretty sure I killed it! I'm incredibly proud of these things, everything ended up landing almost exactly where I expected on the body and I learned a hell of a lot about crafting technical garments... eyes opened for more technical garment experiments in the future.  
.  
I know I set out to make two pairs today, but the order of operations on these was a real brain teaser so pair two - made from a ACR Stotz style textile - will come tomorrow with a few extra features added. Pair number one was made from the heaviest duty and strongest winter softshell in my small collection, (it's been really cold in Vancouver lately), a Schoeller fabric again, this one most comparable to WB400. Super durable wind proof water-resistant outer face with an ultra comfy fleece backing against body.  
.  
The pattern around the knee was inspired by Guerilla Group's new Denim Dyneema hybrid pant the ""18S-ES-PD01"". I wanted something with a lot of fairly radical geometric gussets which add lots of volume and provide a completely unhindered range of movement. I don't like pants that are very wide around the thigh when looked at straight on so I was careful to build out the volume forwards and backwards... giving two entirely different silhouettes when seen on front/back or from the sides.  
.  
It's going to be very hard to wait on taking this idea further while I complete the next couple weeks... I really enjoyed this one so maybe I'll do some more pants later in the challenge also.

INTRODUCTION OF THE 30-DAY TECHWEAR CHALLENGE FOR NEWCOMERS:  
My school and industry mentors have challenged me with the task of trying to create a new product - from scratch - everyday - for 30 days... I'm a second year Student of Fashion Design - studying in the city of Vancouver. Since September I've been interning at a local research and design firm to gain exposure to technical fashion design, construction techniques, and the real-world process behind bringing wild ideas to life...   
.   
The studio where I intern is very tight-lipped about their outputs and involvements, however I am allowed to say that they have been quietly responsible for many of the innovations and products seen across the market. My roll is still at the utmost bottom of the ladder (see:gopher), however my mentors are incredibly supportive in including me in and teaching me the in-and-outs of the nuances fashion design.  
.  
At the end of this project, I'd like to be able to assemble the 30-day log and the products created into a portfolio which I can use to find a job. I'm still very new to this but it's clear to me that technical apparel and accessories design is where I want to focus my ambitions and career. With any luck this project will be an appealing application for a design position with one of the larger industry players.

7ykkej,4,2018-02-19,[M4F] - Psychotic Exes Make For The Best Sex [Intercourse],alexanderfarkov,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ykkej/m4f_psychotic_exes_make_for_the_best_sex/,"Nobody ever expected us to get together but somehow the stars aligned and two ends of the opposite spectrum did meet in a dazzling flash, worthy to illuminate the night sky. Or perhaps, my nonchalant attitude towards your seemingly irresistible charm worked in my favour. You had a reputation for being the It girl of college, though that took a darker turn as you soon realized the power and control you had over men who were swooning over and drowning in their lust for you. And boy, did you tease them mercilessly, flaunting your perfect, stunning figure ever so often on social media as you relished your time in the sun. Whispers of your slutty antics and depraved kinks spread around the campus. Unlike the lasses of lesser calibre, you weren't simply written off as a village bicycle and instead, your popularity soared higher than ever before, taking the throbbing hard cocks of the privileged few you chosen and turning their owners into whimpering boys by the time you were done with them. 

I always remembered the very first time we met a club, as you poured out every bit of your seductive appeal, teasing me as you gently placed your delectable fingers on me with that sultry, ""Heyyy"". I knew your act like the back of my hand. The moment a guy thought that you were into him, your cold shoulder came up in a flash, leaving all high and dry before moving on to your next target. I gave you a faint smile and went about my way. It did seem like I was the first guy who rebuffed your advances in ages and that was something that you didn't take lying down. Cranking the sex-o-meter to the highest setting, you aggressively got your hands all over me while trying to intoxicate me with your mesmerizing eyes, daring me to lock lips with you as you started a slow heavy grind against my crotch. I was a few drinks in but I vividly remember your shell-shocked face and disappointment as I whispered tenderly into your ear. ""Lady, if you're looking for a prey to toy around with, you got to try much harder.""

And you lost it right at that very moment, forcing your luscious lips right on mine as if I'd just accidentally flicked the sex switch on your tight frame. As cool as I may try to play things off, the bulging stretch in my pants gave me away as dirty thoughts flooded my mind while my hands gingerly traced the outline of your smooth curves. I could sense your insatiable thirst for a throbbing hard cock and we wasted no time in heading back to my room. Oh I could tell how you lusted over my manhood as you slobbered over and gagged yourself on my cock throughout the Uber ride back. With the door locked shut and coyness long thrown out of the window, we hastily yanked and ripped the clothes of each other. Your tantalizing breasts that now lay free before me and I latched my slimy tongue onto them while I fingered your tight cunt till it was all soaking wet and yearning for more. 

Your tight pussy was a delightful surprise as you moaned in pleasure while I stretched it with every inch of my pulsing warm cock. I just loved how you tightened the grip of your fuckhole as I pounded you hard and furiously, egged on by your dirty talk rolling off your filthy whorish lips. Those uncontrollable shivers as you squirmed and moaned while I fucked you like a savage beast brought me close to the edge as every inch of you seemed to be primed for fucking. I had my fair share of fucking wild horny sluts but they all paled in comparison to you as you rode me like a sex-deprived maniac till you squirted large loads of sweet warm juices all over me. I pulled you close to me, drowning myself in the sensual warmth of your body that was now drenched in sweat, locking my lips with yours and our bodies intertwined in a constant grind and thrust till we both came and collapsed in bed.

How could that ever be enough? In no time, we were both up and at it again, fucking like rabbits as you bent over at my window, shamelessly offering yourself up for display as the loud slapping sounds of your ass bouncing off my thighs echoed through the night, with your depraved cries for more being audibly heard loud and clear down the corridor. Not that we minded one bit. I had the hottest slut on campus, now on her knees before me and desperately milking my tool. Your lips were stretched taut over it as you polished the length of it in its entirety ever so fervently with your tongue till I dumped a cockload of gooey sticky cum down your throat. As you licked and sucked me dry as our eyes were both locked in a seductive gaze, we both knew that we had found the right partner. 

Alas, I should have taken heed at the warning signs. The sex was phenomenal but there seemed to be something off about you right from the start. It didn't take long for you to demonstrate your possessiveness, as you went on a tirade against any girl who was unfortunate enough to be seen talking to me. Yes, my phone was frequently searched and you would be set off by just about anything. Our hot sex served as a fantastic patch-up glue, there was no denying about that, but soon there came about too many problems to be fixed. Just because I consulted Rachel on that finance project that I so desperately needed an A+ for, you posted a video of yourself making out with another hunk on snapchat, accusing me of cheating and whatnot. Not too long after, I soon got my head out of the gutter, deciding that the drama and psychotic moments weren't simply worth the frequent wild, sweaty hot sex. I guess it's probably true, what they say about psychotic girls being the hottest fucks. I had my fun on the ride and there were now other more pressing things on my plate.

I didn't hear much from you during our final year as I slogged away on a part time internship. I really did wish I had a chance to say goodbye to you as we both graduated but I wasn't sure if you were ready then. Mutual friends of ours quipped that you had sobered up but I couldn't be sure. After all, you were one who could tenderly embrace my face and whisper sweet nothings while planting warm wet kisses all over me in one moment before exploding like a dynamite the second a female groupmate texted about a project. Yes, my room had been trashed more often than not and I was glad that such a nightmare was over. 

I moved away to New York, excited to embark on a new life and the start of a glittering career at one of the most prestigious financial institutions in the world. Things went well. I settled in nicely at work and had my fair share of leisure time. Casual dates didn't really work out but that was alright. I was enjoying myself. There was a bar around the block which served an impeccable selection of the finest whiskies and craft beer. But one must not forget, fate always had its own mocking sense of humour. And who would that be, that stunning lady sitting right at neighbouring table while I was enjoying a chill night out with my other friends?

7yl8hb,4,2018-02-19,I took the “entrepreneurial leap” 3 years ago - I feel like I’m worse off than I started and now there’s no going back. Maybe I just wasn’t made to be an entrepreneur,deepbutnotreally,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/7yl8hb/i_took_the_entrepreneurial_leap_3_years_ago_i/,"3 years ago, I was in the middle of completing a computer science degree and was about to enter a paid internship for CS.

The path was set for me to basically land a cushy 6-figure CS job.

The problem was, I wasn’t excited about programming. I was good at it (maybe 80th percentile), but looking into the future I didn’t see myself as a programmer.

I didn’t get excited about software projects, I didn’t connect with the people there. But it was something I didn’t mind doing, I liked solving problems.

The thing was l, I got bit by the travel bug a year ago after backpacking to Thailand and have wanted to travel ever since. I didn’t see how that’d be possible with a CS job.

That’s when I found a program that promised to teach you how to build an online business automated by outsourced overseas employees so you can travel while running a business.

I trusted the dude who was selling it and really focused all my energy on this. I was so determined to make it happen and thought it was so possible.

Back then, weighing the future of a CS career vs an online business... I chose the latter and basically dropped out of the program.

I went full force with trying to build this online business (oh it’s not an MLM btw lol), and spent months pursuing prospects, building up my website, learning new skills...

But no one told you how much rejection hurts and how heavy self-doubt can be.

Long story short... it failed. I failed.

Then I joined up with a friend to try and start up an Amazon FBA consulting business... we didn’t know what we were doing and that bombed too.

The savings I had prepared for a 8-month stretch of “business building” was dwindling. And I was nowhere near this business freedom I wanted so badly.

But maybe I didn’t want it bad enough, and that’s why I failed. Or maybe I’m just not cut out for the entrepreneurial life...

Anyways...

Savings ran out. And I had to get a job - but for someone who has a half finished degree... the job I ended up getting was a customer service position that any high school graduate could get.

Here I was, A-student set for a 6-figure position - gave it all up and now at a position that paid $15/hour.

Why did I give all that up? Man I failed fucking hard

I was there for 6-7months and hated it.

The people were nice, but every second I just knew... I just knew I was better than this. I knew I could achieve more but I wasn’t.

I was stuck in a chair answering emails about yoga pants and how a stitch came loose and now they want a fucking refund.

8 hours a day.

What. The. Fuck.

I’m pretty frugal so I managed to save up enough money to give the business thing another go.

This time I went out and tried being a freelance copywriter (it’s not someone who does trademarks and copyrights things, it’s someone who writes copy... copy is just marketing text - anyways besides the point)

I made peanuts for months... and this went on for a few months.

All this time I’ve been trying to do this... I kept thinking to myself...

“Why am I not successful yet? I’m hustling every day, I’m not stupid, I’m not lazy... and yet the results I’m getting are absolute shit... like this is so stupid I was an A-student, a critical thinker... I should be succeeding... why is everyone else seeing results and I’m just left here looking like a fucking dumbass who’s got nothing going on?”

And the worst part about this is during the entire thing, friends would ask

“So how’s that thing going” how’s the business going?”

I’d be so fucking ashamed man... I made a fucking grand gesture of dropping out and trying to be an entrepreneur and I fucking flopped...

Everyone’s pity when I tell them “it’s going” or “I’m still figuring it out” just wreaks if tone of “I told you so”.

I reached for the stars, I missed and got burned. The return to the atmosphere burnt me to a crisp and there wasn’t much left of me.

Eventually, I got a intern position doing digital marketing which is something I really learned to enjoy because of the impact you can create... this position started paying me $500 a month and I accepted it because i wanted to learn so badly and there was promise of “growth”.

Growth eventually got to $2000/month, barely meeting my expenses after I moved out of home lol. Fuck man it’s expensive to just live...

And I didn’t see much potential to grow more here so now we’re parting ways. I’m leaving a $2000/month job and need to find another position.

I feel completely and utterly lost right now. I don’t even know what I want anymore.

Part of me wants to be independent and do my own thing. But part of me wants to just find some sort of stability and security because I feel like I haven’t had that in years since I started this.

I’m constantly stressed thinking about how I’m gonna need to make it or else. But man, I’m so fucking tired of trying to be an entrepreneur. I’m burnt out.

I just want a nice easy, good paying job right now - I don’t know if I was meant to be an entrepreneur but man I don’t feel like I’m worth jack shit right now.

I gave up so many parties and nights out over the years to “work on my business”. Were all those nights just wasted? I could have had fun...

But I was on a pointless “grind” to nowhere. Worse than nowhere. I’m here.

Did I miss moments with my friends that I could have cherished and created stories of? Instead they’re replaced by anxious nights at a lonely coffee shop - trying to “make it”.

And even times when I did go out... like New Years or something. I’d feel SO guilty for enjoying myself because I haven’t “made it” yet, I haven’t earned the right to enjoy myself... “I should be working right now”

All those motivational videos telling you to work while other people sleep... man that’s bullshit.

If you’re only working to run away from your fear of failure - is that really the best way to spend your life?

If you’re only hustling so you can say “fuck you” to the people who doubted you - aren’t you basically living your life to the whims of the people who give literally no shit about you?

Fuck man - all this entrepreneurial bullshit... fuck I mean

I understand the spirit of individualism and wanting to fend for yourself... but dude maybe not everyone is meant to be on their own...  maybe... iunno man

I’m just so fucking completely lost right now and I can’t even find anyone to talk to about this.

I don’t have friends who are doing the same thing as me... and I mean I do but we’re not close and it’s hard to talk about feelings of doubt or fear with someone when you’re not close - it’s hard trying to not be a downer, but man I’ve been down a lot recently.

I hold this all to myself. Because I beilieve in self responsibility but carrying all this weight and expectations... it’s fucking hard.

Sometimes I just want to not exist.

I lay in my bed wishing a meteor would fall on me an annihilate me painlessly and erase my existence. Erase all my responsibilities. So I don’t have to worry about anything anymore.

And it’s imperative this is a meteor because I don’t want it to be suicide. If it was suicide people would be mad at me, and I’m not brave enough to face the criticism even if I am dead lol

If a meteor killed me... people would cry for me, they’d weep for me, they’d speak eulogies of how great I am and how much I meant to them... and it wouldn’t be my fault... my death wouldn’t be my fault so no one would be able to blame me...

But no, not suicide. I’m not brave enough for that

I wish I had someone to talk to... maybe it’s me for not reaching out. Maybe it’s my fault...

I just don’t feel like I have anyone who has my back 100%...

If I tell some friends that I’m doubting myself, they’ll pull me back and tell me it’s okay to settle and just wait until you get “more experience”

Some won’t really empathize and just give out solutions because they’re uncomfortable with things not being okay

Some... some I’m just not their priority and that’s okay. I’m secondary

I’m secondary and have been most of my life. I’m the backdrop - the “nice-to-have”, the cool-if-he’s-there but no one really cares if he doesn’t show up.

I’m the acquaintance. I’m the nice guy. I’m the dude that gets told “I love you” but actions show a far different story.

I’m the dude that isn’t lovable. Who would right?

I’ve been doing “self development” for five years now. Maybe I did a shitty job

The whole point was to fix the insecurities, but I didn’t. I just stuffed them down and covered it up with a macho confident facade like I’ve got everything handled.

No, man it just got bottled up and built up. Built up inside until I’m too unstable to even go outside. Too unstable to even leave the bed because I know if I go out to any place in public and even if someone like a barista asks “how are you?” I could just fucking collapse in an instant.

I really don’t know. I want to say I see a silver lining to this I’m sure there is but right now

I am so lost in my vagueness, lost in my decisions, intoxicated with regret, and unsure of my existence.

I’m not ready to “take control” of my life.... I just want someone to talk to and who will listen... fuck man

Been trying so hard not to be beta or w.e but man... I just want someone to love and to love me back. I’m lonely as fuck and I’m really wondering if I made the right decisions...

Fuck

If anyone has been in any of these courses and could provide details on employment opportunities, placements, internships etc. that would be great. I've seen a few posts where people have said its not a good idea to specialise directly into cyber security as an undergrad, so is it better to have cyber security simply as a major? Curtin is closer to me, but ECU is apparently really good for computer/cyber related degrees. I don't think Curtin has work integrated learning, whereas ECU does, not sure how big a factor this is."

I am a soon to be BS Chemical Engineering graduate in search of a job preferably in the Cleveland Ohio area, but I open to move if need be. 

Unfortunately, my resume is geared more towards admittance to graduate school than it is industry.  A rough outline of my resume is:
Near flawless grads, two TA positions (calculus and an assortment of chemistry labs), I have worked in two different academic labs (one for my honors thesis and one for an NSF REU, and two internships in industry labs (one was soils and the other was paint). 

I have had a change of heart and do not want to pursue a PhD (immediately). 

Unfortunately, I have no true engineering experience as most of my work has been in chemist roles. 

I would like advice on how to bolster my past experiences when applying for true engineering positions. I would not be opposed to taking an industry chemist position provided the pay was comparable to that of an engineer , so tips on negotiating salary would be cool too.

I have just started applying for jobs so I am not discouraged... yet. I am simply seeking advice on how to make my application stand out.

7ynzpj,33,2018-02-19,Why can’t I make female friends? Am I the problem?,aly3ska,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7ynzpj/why_cant_i_make_female_friends_am_i_the_problem/,"Basically I (25F) have noticed a pattern in my life that I would like outside perspective on. 

Namely my inability to make and keep friendships.  I have 2 ongoing relationships in my life:  my long term boyfriend (5 years we live together) and a childhood friend who I introduced to her husband.

My boyfriend is great and I think our relationship is really healthy. We talk about everything and he is my best friend. However, I know he can’t be my only support so I’ve tried to make friends outside the relationship. Despite the fact that when meeting us he would be the shy withdrawn introvert and I would be the extrovert, he has many close friends and has made more friends since we moved in August across the country that he hangs with outside of work regularly. He games and paints models and they all do this together.

The childhood friend to be honest would probably not be friends with me if I did not make the effort to keep her in my life. I realize it is one sided but I would like to maintain  this relationship. In fact, I invited her to a party (which she almost didn’t come to) where she met one of my boyfriend’s friend’s and they later married and now my boyfriend has gotten to know her and commented about how she makes effort for “her friends” but not for her “husbands friends” I.e. us. For example they will drive 4 + hours to visit her college friends but can barely make time to visit us when we lived in their home town and it often ends up being just the husband who comes over. 

I guess the point is that she doesn’t dislike me she just would have let the relationship fade if not for the husband connection.

More examples of the same pattern:

Elementary school 2 best friends found shared interests in orchestra (I played brass) and despite that I tried to join in (I joined symphonic band to play with them) they still grew closer to each other until I realized that they were going to concerts without me, hanging without me etc. I don’t think it was malicious. I think they just thought my interests where different. We all went to different high schools and they kept hanging out but never let me know and never could get together when I texted them. 

Middle school friends did maliciously ghost me for being “weird” and wrote me a note listing the reasons why they couldn’t be friends anymore. I didn’t get the note and was very confused why they were pretending they couldn’t hear me for a week.

College roommate for three years. I thought I had finally found a female friend I could be myself with. She liked the same dark humor the drinking and smoking but we also loved shopping and cooking and shared other interests as well. I felt like I could tell her everything. Stuff about depression etc. that other people shied away from. She ghosted me after I told her she should dump her emotionally abusive boyfriend after SHE ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT SHE SHOULD DO. I had never said anything in 3 years. Just supported her, and then she finally asked my opinion and I was honest and she blocked me and unfriended me and I never heard from her again. (I did reach out to her multiple times) That was 3 years ago. 

I haven’t had a close friend since despite trying bumble bff, doing an internship and inviting different interns to get drinks/coffee with me,  and now being in a masters program etc. I am friendly, I offer to go get coffee/drinks... I say I am interested in going to bars or to a party but I just don’t get invited to anything. I tried just going along and accidentally almost crashed someone’s tinder date. Everyone drinks after exams but they are always on to another bar by the time I’m done and I ask them to text me where they go but they forget or are too drunk to text back. 

TLDR: I am not one of those girls who “hates being friends with girls” I desperately want to be friends but every relationship I have ends in flames. What do?"

7yo7mu,1,2018-02-19,[21/m] her [23/f] We're at a weird juncture... Having a break but not really.,khawarizmy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7yo7mu/21m_her_23f_were_at_a_weird_juncture_having_a/,"To begin:

I'm 21; male; half Lebanese/half German; bi-curious
She's 23; Tunisian; bi

We've been together for almost 2 years, but known each other for like 3+ years. We met in University since we both graduated in the same major (Computer Science). We graduated last December in Lebanon and now moved to Germany for January and February, because she's doing an internship and I'm just taking a break figuring out my life. We're don't have a normal couple relationship, we're more best friends at times than partners or lovers. We hang out a lot, and do a lot of stuff that besties would do to pass time. What I'm trying to say is that our relationship feels more like a really strong and comfortable friendship than it does feel like a couple. 

But it hasn't been going so well lately. We've been fighting a lot and we've been getting angry really quickly for stupid reasons. From my point perspective I feel like I don't get enough attention sometimes, in as, I want more cuddling and touching and lovey-dovey stuff than she wants me to give. She has all right to give as much as she can, and I understand how she feels, because we're at our core both introverts. But it is still aggravating, when I try to hug her or cuddle when we wake up or fall asleep and she pushes away. Just to clarify, I never push her to do anything she doesn't want and she knows that. So that's just me. I know sometimes that I need more than she can give.

And lately we'v been feeling very numb, we haven't been able to talk much nor inspire each other. We talked about this and we are both aware about it. We had a talk two days ago about how we should have a break. In as a break from being romantic partners and just be best friends for a while. I would have never been able to come up with such a compromise, because my emotional intelligence is a bit lacking. I find it very hard at times to to read her feelings, like I ask a lot of times ""Are you okay?"" to the point of her getting annoyed at just that. I really mean it well sometimes, when she's in bed and looks sad and watches some series I just feel like I should cheer her up and go to her and hug her. But that's not what she needs, at that point, I should leave her alone and give her some time to herself, which bothers me and makes me feel unable to help her when she's not okay. Also a lot of times i feel like I don't understand what she means with certain things about us and I have to keep asking what is wrong. I think she's just more experienced. She's been in a relationship before whereas for me it's just my first real relationship. 

I don't really comprehend what we are now, but I suddenly feel like she is more distant but at the same time gotten more interesting and attractive. WE decided to not cuddle or kiss or do anything a couple would do, but rather only things friends would do. Which makes me feel weird because I don't know if i should be colder towards her or not. I don't know how to act now.

What should I do? Where do we go from here? We are going to be apart from each other for a month and then meet again in a different country for educational reasons, though we are not going to be sharing an apartment, nor in fact will we be close or be able to see each other on a daily basis. Whereas we've spent most of our days together for the past year.

After writing this I feel a bit more aware of my feelings, and actually feel a bit heartbroken. I feel like crying now. I really love her, but I don't know if we are good for each other. We have different career goals and ambitions. What should I do now? 

Thanks for reading all of this.
TL;DR: I don't think i can summarise this. So just read last paragraph."

Sunt anul 3 la Matematica si Informatica la Universitate in Bucuresti si am nevoie de practica pentru facultate. Nu am mai muncit pana acum si asta imi afecteaza mult CV-ul. Se vede in faptul ca nu ma contacteaza nimeni cand vad ca nu am experienta practica.

Am inceput sa invat Python recent si mi se pare destul de usor si interesant oarecum, cu toate ca nu sunt foarte pasionat de programare si sincer nu ma vad facand asta peste 5 ani. Oarecum ma simt intr-un segment unde nu mi-e locul si nu mai pot sa dau inapoi pentru moment.. pentru ca am nevoie de practica ca sa trec in anul 4.

Am nevoie sa imi spuneti daca am sanse sa gasesc un job sau macar internship folosind Pyhton.  Si cam ce ma sfatuiti sa invat si pe ce sa ma concentrez. 

Multumesc.

**Edit:** Multumesc pentru sfaturi. M-am hotarat in final sa merg pe web development pe partea de front end, deoarece am vazut ca reusesc sa invat destul de repede si mi se pare interesant."
7yp674,2,2018-02-19,I'm at the end of my rope 'cause this place is killing me,KanYeFatChoi,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7yp674/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_cause_this_place_is/,"By ""this place"" I mean my current job.

My previous job was exhausting but doable. I had to spend a lot of physical and emotional energy and I came home aching every day, but I had awesome regular customers and some pretty great employees that made the work worth it. I was also pretty darn skilled at my job to the point where people would ask for me by name, and was given the opportunity to flex my skills in other ways like design work for the store that made the job feel somewhat more fulfilling. If it wasn’t for having health issues that made standing on my feet all day excruciating, I probably wouldn’t have left.

Unfortunately, I do have health problems to contend with, so I had been looking for another job off and on. I had a contact who had been trying to get me a job at their company that sounded pretty sweet: a desk job doing social media work with higher pay and good benefits. So when given the opportunity I jumped at it.

The first red flag should have been the application and hiring process. I gave them my resume in spring of last year, had to give it to them *again* a month later when they interviewed me as they lost it before, and then heard nothing from them until December when my contact (not either of the two owners) offered me a job. I received no formal job offer, was given the wrong start date, and didn’t even know what my *position and title* were until the second day of the job. None of which came from higher management. Oh, and I also wasn’t going to be making the salary that I was offered, and was now making barely more than the other job. But at least I wouldn’t have to be on my feet. 

It quickly became apparent that I’ve been the victim of a really bad bait and switch. When I applied, I made it known that my strengths were in social media and design. I was told that this is what I would be interviewing for. Instead they shoved me in the sole marketing and advertising position for the company, because their previous marketing director quit and left them in the lurch (they’d been without a marketing director for a month by the time they finally hired me.) I know jack shit about marketing and advertising, no one is here to teach me, and the previous manager left me next to nothing as far as currently running promotions or even if we have any contracts active with our clients. Oh, but also, they do need me to run their social media accounts because they're currently being run by our graphic designer/webmaster who is doing a shoddy job of it. So I got saddled with being the sole person in charge of social media *and* marketing/advertising, yet they still insist on paying me the low end of what a social media manager makes. (I make about $29k/year, whereas average for social media manager is about $45k/yr. A marketing manager makes nearly double that at about $80-90k/yr.)

Just about everyone is terrible about communication at this place. I’ll send out time sensitive messages and not get responses until a couple days, if not a full week later, and usually that’s only after a fair deal or harassment. I’m still not getting most of the emails that were (and are still being) sent to my predecessor. I can’t count how many times I’ve had an “urgent” message pop up telling me that paperwork is due the next day, only to see that the recipient (usually our big boss) got the email a week earlier and is only sending it to me the day before it’s due. So I’ll bust ass to get things done and sent off, confirm with everyone that it’s done, and then get a follow-up email a week later asking if I ever finished said task, despite me having sent out confirmation that the task was taken care of *and* me popping by big boss’ office to tell them I did it as well. 

That’s one of the major things, and probably the root of all of our problems: incredibly inconsistent management. There’s rampant nepotism and favoritism, so some people are basically untouchable, and you can bet they fucking take advantage of it. People take off days all the time with no repercussions, and since we literally work on the honor system it’s distressingly easy to fudge your hours. Seriously - we write in all of our hours on our own time sheets and turn them in every couple of weeks. There is *no* time stamping system of any sort. Not mention that people are allowed to get away with massive incompetence, leaving the rest of us to pick up their slack. 

Additionally, big boss is an intense micromanager and workaholic who refuses to let people handle things on their own. Which, I mean, is understandable when you have a lot of dead weight. Someone has to get this stuff done. Unfortunately, big boss is also a serial waffler and one of those big-idea-but-no-follow-through kind of people. So they’ll meddle in everything, but then take forever to get back to you on something because they’re constantly looking at every single option available, along with some that are neither available nor relevant. But you bet your ass he wants you to follow up on that pie in the sky idea he had even though it’s nowhere near relevant to what you need to get done. It is impossible to get any sort of concrete decision out of big boss, and when you do finally drag them into committing to something, you’re just as likely to come in to work the next morning to find they had doubts in the night and “need to tweak things a little.” (Spoiler: it’s never just “a little.”) If you try to work without letting them micromanage every little thing about your project, they get upset because they weren’t included in the decision process even though they slow everything down by an order of magnitude. And they feel like since they’ve got their hand in everything, everyone else should be fine with it as well, and assigns extra work to people despite the work not being anywhere near their department. Boss’ attitude to everything is that if you don’t know how to do something, you can just learn how to do it and it’ll be fine. Even when said thing is the kind of department that requires a lot of specialized knowledge and time you don’t have, because you’re constantly being assigned things from nine different departments.

I’ve brought up the possibility of hiring on a person to help/take over the areas I’m not qualified to work, and was told we can look into hiring an (unpaid) intern from one of the local colleges. This doesn’t sit right with me since it feels like an abuse of the system, as there’s no one here with marketing experience to guide them and they’d basically be doing a paid position for free. When I’ve brought up the fact that I feel I’m both under-qualified and untrained for my position, I’ve been dismissed with reassurances that I’ll “get it eventually” and that I can take online classes for 30 minutes a day, despite not having the time to do these things nor access to these online classes. That or Boss tells me to delegate parts of my project to other people, which almost always ends up as a clusterfuck because then there are too many eyes on a project and with the total lack of communication, important things end up falling through the cracks because *no one is telling me what the fuck is going on*. I’m also the only person who knows how to run social media effectively, so I can’t hand that off to other people without negating all the hard work I’ve put in. But we “just don’t have the money for a marketing person” even though they’re constantly dropping large sums of money on new projects. They refuse to see that the lack of structure is what’s causing us to lose money and people (seriously the turn over rate here is insane) and just think we need to do more sales to make up for it. So we’re hiring new sales people instead while I’m told to just grin and bear it.  

We’ve begun amping up for convention season and I’m drowning. I’m told to get in contact with the manufacturers we work with, but I have to go searching around because I wasn’t given this info. Boss likes to remind me that it’s in our database but a) said database is not at all intuitive and I’ve never been given instruction or time to familiarize myself with the program, b) not all of our information is in there because a lot of people don’t add the information in, and c) a lot of the time the information is out of date or wrong because it’s also the same program we use to make invoices so most of these contacts are either not relevant to my line of work or they have since moved on and no one has the new info input. 

Oh, and also I was put in charge of our biggest tradeshow of the year without any real guidance nor any experience in putting together tradeshow booths. This while trying to figure out what trade shows we’re actually attending and in what capacity. Which you’d think we’d know by now but that would involve organization, the ability to commit to projects in a timely manner, sort of halfway decent communication, and a whole lot of other competencies that this company, despite being a multi-million dollar business, just does not have. 

There are a few people who are doing their best to make things happen but they’re few and far between and a lot of the time their efforts are crippled by the bosses and their shoddy management. One boss wants us to be huge and always putting ourselves out there, while the other is content to try and keep things small and the way they’ve always been. It’s to the point where I start having anxiety attacks at work because I have no clue where anything is going and I am tired of not having things done until right before (or sometimes just after) the deadline. I’ve come to fear Friday evenings because half the time I’ll be expected to stay late because something needs more “little tweaks” even though I went out of my way to make sure stuff was everything approved earlier in the week (which big boss will often deny doing, even if you bring them a paper trail with their signature on it.) 

The good people at work know I’m beyond done with this place and are trying to keep me to stay but I’m really at my breaking point. I’ve been struggling with depression for most of my life, with the last two years being some of the worst, and this place honestly makes me want to end it all just so I don’t have to deal with this constant level of stress. I’m tired of crying at my desk once or twice a week because I feel so fucking frustrated, underappreciated, and overworked. I can't sleep at night because I'm so stressed out that I end up having nightmares and anxiety attacks at the thought of what's awaiting me in the morning. The only reason I haven’t quit outright is because I’m the only one in my household working; my other half is going to school full time and I’m doing my best to support them through this. After all, they did the same for me when I was in school - it’s the least I can do. 

When I talk to my SO about this and how I feel I have to work to support us both, they always tell me that it’s not worth killing myself over and that we’re currently financially stable. But at the same time, we were just starting to get out of the red due to medical debt, and one of our cars just died so we have to deal with that as well. The job market where I live is decent but there’s no guarantee that I’ll find something quickly if I quit, and I’ve only been here two months so I’m afraid that I’ll look like a job hopper. Plus I’d be leaving less than a month before the big tradeshow so I feel like I’d be burning a massive bridge if I abruptly quit. But because I’m pulling long hours, have to deal with a decently busy commute, and am constantly swamped at work I feel like I never have time to work on finding a new job. And honestly, I’m so fucking depressed that during the weekend I just want to sleep the whole time. 

I really don’t know what to do. I can realize that I’m in such a stressed out state that it’s hard for me to step back and look at everything rationally. But I also don’t see anything changing any time soon, despite the reassurances of my decent coworkers that it’ll get better, we’re finally starting to get more competent people in, and to just wait one more month. A lot of these are issues that have been going on for years, and unless management has a sudden total change of heart, they’re going to continue on in the same vein because “that’s the way it’s always been.” And I just can't take it anymore.

7yph92,170,2018-02-19,Our journey with oligospermia - initial success,oh-hes-a-tryin,TryingForABaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/7yph92/our_journey_with_oligospermia_initial_success/,"Hi friends.

I have been lurking TFAB since the second half of 2016, when my wife and I started trying to conceive. I have learned a lot by reading what you all are going through and frankly, I ended up getting a pretty sophisticated (at least I think so) understanding of the female reproductive system, despite not having one myself. I am 30 and my wife is 29. We started trying to conceive at 28 and 27 years old, respectively.

Anyway, I decided to come on and post to add a data point for some of the folks like me who felt pretty despairing with male factor infertility. When the wife and I hit 11 months of negative tests, we made an appointment with a RE. This led to me getting a semen analysis and my wife getting a couple blood tests (she hates needles) and a hysterosonogram (she REALLY hates saline infusions in her uterus). All of her tests came back normal. 

My blood tests came back normal, with a slight imbalance in the testosterone:estradiol ratio. It wasn't that bad, but it was off a bit. My semen analysis, however, was very disheartening. I had  total of 3 million sperm. Only 1.6 million were motile. My counts were so low, that the lab couldn't collect the morphology. For what small amount of sperm I did have, the motility % seemed okay. While disheartening, I did have one monumental blunder of mine that did, in fact, leave me with a great deal of hope. You see, I had to produce a sample in what can best be described as a roomy closet, that was somehow sterile and gross. It was across the hall from the office window and I did not want to sit anywhere or touch anything. In that moment of deep discomfort I ""missed the mark"". Or rather, as my urologist would later term it ""missed the cup on his 'first squirt' but got the rest in"". Anyway, my mistake gave me hope. Cruel, unremitting hope.

After some research, I discovered that most motile sperm rush to the front lines to best commence their fallopian siege. That means, so thought I, that I killed off a huge portion of my troops. My urologist seemed to hold a bit of my failure induced hope as well.

Sample 2: One month later I gave another sample in the clinic. I did not miss. And even with all that, hanging my hope on this thread, my sperm count actually decreased. I went to 2 million total sperm. I did not even have 1 million motile sperm. We were devastated. We had follow up appointments with the RE and urologist. We go to all of these appointments together. We were fighting back tears for both of them. To add insult to injury, I have had two rectal exams in these urologist office visits to check for prostate issues. One of which was teaching an intern meaning two people were feeling an prodding me. This is not relevant, just an annoying asside. My wife contends that the hysterosonogram is significantly worse than my exam. She's probably correct.

Both the RE and urologist said that most likely, our only hope was to try IVF as I would not produce enough sperm for IUI to be cost effective and that natural conception would only occur under an incredibly rare circumstance, if not technically impossible. That was so hard for us to hear.

We explained that we would not consider IVF as an option. After that was clear, my urologist said he would try to help balance out my testosterone and estradiol. He did not sound very hopeful that it would yield much of a change. Our RE basically thought we were out of options and kind of left us with a good luck, you'll probably never conceive. 

Health wise, we are both overweight, not morbidly obese, but we are not being contacted with modeling offers by any stretch of the imagination. We decided to diet (I swear we really did try). I had quit cigarettes in 2016 when we got married, but I would use other forms of tobacco - namely pipe tobacco - somewhat regularly. After 2 back to back failures, I decided to quit all tobacco completely. I would also cut back on caffeine and alcohol (I swear I really did try).

In the meantime, we continued to focus on starting a family, under the belief that it will probably never happen naturally. We started the path to adoption, which, apparently, is incredibly expensive. We have started to save money for adoption costs. Regardless of what happens with us biologically, we may still adopt or foster. There are far more families who want to adopt than there are children needing adoption, so we don't want to take that joy from someone else and there isn't necessarily a huge urgency for open homes.

I was prescribed Anastrazole to help balance my hormones. Desperate for any help, I also started taking CoQ10, Vitamin C, a Multivitamin, Zinc, and Ashwagandha. I also had read that BPA and phthalates could lead to male infertility, so I started buying all natural organic soap, shampoo, deodorant, fruit, and vegetables. I also had tests for microdeletions and some other genetic issues. Those tests seem to take an eternity to result. When they finally came in, I was cleared of genetic issues. Phew.

I started my pill cocktails back in August or September. I had another blood test for testosterone and estradiol in December. The ratio improved to where it should be. Even though that's good news, I knew that my initial results wasn't actually that bad, so I didn't think much of it. I continued to try to cut back on alcohol and caffeine, to work out, to strategically light prayer candles when the opportunity presented itself. I also switched to boxer briefs and sleeping without any bottoms. I do try to stand up from my desk more often as well.

My last SA was the beginning of this month. This time it worked out that I could provide my sample at home and take my specimen in on my way to work. My wife tried her darnedest to get me 'worked up' (I swear she really did try). After we laughed at the silliness of that, she left me to my own devices and I was ready to hit the road. I am nothing if not efficient.

Sample 3: With the lowest of expectations I woke up one morning and saw that my results were available in the patient portal. I sighed and looked at it. I read through my latest results calmly. My wife rolled over and asked what I was looking at. I told her my latest SA was resulted. She asked what the results were in a flat way, anticipating nothing, hoping for nothing, resigned to be supportive and help me through another round of disappointment. ""Well"" I said ""my first result was 3 million total sperm, my second result was 2 million, and my third result says I have 120 million sperm"".

It took a while for the news to sink in, but some combination of low dose prescription medication, vitamins, some Indian plant extract the effects of which I am still uncertain, personal health changes, strategic prayer, and riding the extremes of this emotional roller coaster, we were able to get good news. My motility rate was high, my first morphology result looked good, and my count went way up.

While not pregnant (so far as we know), this feels like we reset the game and we can do the things that we used to find exciting, like tracking on Ovia and FertilityFriend (I even have that little FF certificate you get when you answer all those quizzes), reading through the posts on TFAB, and Googling pregnancy symptoms and hitting confirmation bias in overdrive.

Thank you all for what you do, and keep on keeping on.

TL:DR Me had bad SA, then another worse SA, then me had great SA. Keep your stick on the ice, we're all in this together."
7ypjhd,1,2018-02-19,Parents [50s F&amp;M] Don't Approve of Me [18F] Dating,Blueskiesfrompain-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ypjhd/parents_50s_fm_dont_approve_of_me_18f_dating/,"I dated my ex for a few years and the relationship has recently come to an end due to unrelated issues, but I can't forgive/forget how my parents treated me when they found out. They saw me with him back in January last year when I was still 17 and were angry that I didn't tell them. (Seems reasonable but I didn't tell them because they'd freak out).

They saw me talking to him (no physical contact or kissing) before work (we worked together) and came into the store and created a huge scene. Yelling at me about how I was ""immoral/loose"" and this was embarrassing but I still understand because they were lied to. 

Then when I got home after my shift they said ""give me your phone and unlock it"". I refused and my dad slapped me. Honestly it didnt hurt but I am still seething over being hit. He used to hit/beat me when I was in elemenery school and when he used to drink a little too much but he has since apologized and said he'd never lay a hand on me again. So it was just a slap but given our past it hurt me on a really deep level.

Then, since they knew we worked together they made me quit so I couldn't have contact with him, they took away my car, and grounded me for an indefinite amount of time. (They didn't say one or two months it was just for as long as I'm in their house I assume). I was only allowed to go to school and nothing else. I had to quit a pretty amazing internship which I am bitter about.


My boss was also Indian and aware of ideals/taboos of dating and also liked my work ethic so he called up my parents and said that he'd schedule my boyfriend and I at different times if they allowed me to work there. They agreed. The next few weeks were so embarrassing and shameful. My mom would take me to work, walk me in, sit down at a table for HALF AN HOUR just watching me to ensure that I didn't have any contact with this guy.

This went on until the end of my senior year and I missed a lot of events having to stay home. I've hidden my relationship with my BF and we broke up a few months ago and I am terrified of dating again and I need to find a way to move out so I can have some freedom. I live in the Bay Area and rent is so freaking high I'd have to move somewhere far and I have no family other than here.

Also, I just want to have a good relationship with my parents and it's not their fault they are like this it's the culture they were brought up in. However, its unfair how sexist they are because they encourage my brother who is one year younger to date.

Tl:Dr Parents decided to raise me in America but are not okay with me being American/having American ideals. Does anyone have any experience/advice on how to navigate cultural differences?"

Me [20M] and my current girlfriend have been together for about 6 months. Now I'm a long time lurker and I know this sub has an inclination to tell anyone under 25 that relationships won't last, you're young you'll have plenty of women in your life, it's just a girl, etc. I just want to clarify that all of your advice is appreciated but the last thing I want right now is to break up with my girlfriend. The first night I met her I knew she was special, it was like I was staring at the most precious and beautiful thing ever. When we started dating we instantly clicked. I've been through my fair share of heartbreaks and relationships, but I truly believe it's because I didn't see a future with them. Something about her is different and I very realistically see us having a future together. Like this is my best friend and someone I can say I'm in love with. So yeah, our relationship is healthy, no issues between us to clarify that.

Anyways moving on to the actual issue. So my girlfriend's parents immigrated here from India before she was born. They wanted their kids to have the American dream, wanted to provide the best everything for their children, and they have, very, very, well. They sacrificed so much for both my girlfriend and her little brother since they were children. I am not at all trying to make her parents out to be bad people, they have done above and beyond their responsibilities for both children. My girlfriend has a great head on her shoulders, someone you can tell was raised with decency and respect, both her and her brother. It's very obvious that her parents love both of them.

Everything sounds great right? Well, my girlfriend told me her parents don't like her to date, which I thought was weird as she was 20 and living on her own, but coming from a middle eastern heritage I understand the whole parents being permissive about who you see. I originally thought she meant they allowed her to date, but didn't like it. Later came to understand that until she was out of college her parents didn't even want her to look at guys, which is ridiculous to enforce on a 20 year old who is going to school, working, paying for her own car and apartment, etc. About a month into us dating her father found out her mother was having an affair with his brother. Since then, he has become obsessive about everything. He calls his wife from 10am when she leaves for work until 6pm when she closes their family business. He has also started checking his whole families phone logs and bank statements, which in my opinion is a huge breach of privacy for a father to look through their independent daughters phone logs and financial statements for absolutely no reason. Anyways, in doing that he obviously discovered thousands and thousands of texts and hundreds of calls between us because we are currently doing long distance. He also knew she was in my state because of atm withdrawals.

Needless to say, both her parents had a huge issue with this. When she came home from college for a weekend her dad laid out the printed statements and logs and gave her three options;
1. ""I can kill you right now and take the jail sentence as punishment but it will be worth it.""
2. ""You can leave your car keys and bank cards at home (the car she pays for and the money in her account is her saved money from working, her parents no longer support her financially so this is basically theft) and run away with him""
3. ""You can stop talking to him, finish up your year at (her current school) and then move home.""

My girlfriend told them that she would choose option three, obviously without the first part. Here's the issue; at my girlfriends current school she is in an accelerated medical major. Instead of finishing her school in 8 years it would only take six because of the course load and her transferred high school credits. She has scholarship opportunities, she's found a great mentor in her field that has been helping her secure interviews for internship opportunities which at a school as big as hers would be an incredible opportunity given the network and high class professors and research doctors that work at her school. Taking her out of this school and transferring her home would not only destroy her happiness because she would have 0 freedom, it would destroy the academic and professional rapport she's built at her current university. Not to mention the lack of credit transfer and all the difficulties of actually transferring.

Anyways this last week her dad called her on average 41 times A DAY. When she didn't pick up her phone one night when she fell asleep super early he called her 97 fucking times and sent her a voice message that said ""if you don't pick up right now I am coming to get you."" Which is absolutely inappropriate behavior for any father figure. Both of her parent's argument is basically ""we gave you freedom to pursue your education and you used that trust and freedom against them, and we raised you for 18 years so we know what's best for you, and that you're too young to be making decisions like that, and that they wanted her to have the American dream."" At this point is obvious her parents are so close minded that not even a compromise is available, she has no bargaining chips against her dad. He doesn't respect her or her happiness at all, my girlfriends brother left the family when their dad started going crazy and now he has become obsessed with ""improving"" my girlfriends life since she's basically the only child they have left. Her and her parents are in a constant argument now because my girlfriend is simply not replying to them. 

So basically the way this is looking is at the end of this semester she's leaving the house. Her apartment lease ends in July, and she can't resign because next year she is focusing 100% on school work, and has chosen to only work a part time job, as being a full time pharmacy technician and a full time pre-med student is very taxing on her. There is a school 2 hours from me that has am almost identical medical program, and because I had to take a gap year to figure out personal shit and save up money, I will also be going back to school next semester. Now I love my girlfriend, and we've discussed her coming up here for school and moving in with me, she was very into the idea, it would benefit her financially as it would be cheaper, and her happiness and profession are actually being taken into account in this decision. The problem is that even though I know it would make her much more happy, she would have to leave her current program and everything and her friends and basically everything, as I live 8 hours away. I could never ask my girlfriend to leave everything and come live with me so I'm having trouble with how to go about this situation. Any insight would be appreciated. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend's parents have basically self imploded and ruined their relationship with both their children. They won't allow her to date, and because she did they want to punish her by moving her back under their roof and under their rule. My girlfriend is obviously not at all happy about how they are acting, and wants to follow her brother out of the family. How do I help make this issue as smooth as possible without overstepping my role as her boyfriend?"

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at UNR *thinking* about transferring to UNLV and moving back home after my sophomore year (I miss the food a little too much :/ ).

I just have some questions regarding UNLV's job placement, internships, and research for current or former CS/CompE students.

1. How is the CS/CompE program? More specifically what is the curriculum is like and the professors? Is it more theoretical or practical?

2. How abundant are research opportunities at UNLV? Any professors/researchers that are good mentors/cool research that could use undergraduates?

3. What are the job placements like for recent graduates of the CS/CompE programs? What kind of companies do they typically work for? Do some graduates go to big name companies or do they typically work for more local places?

4. Have you enjoyed UNLV for learning Computer Science/CompE?"

I'm a 20 year old fresh graduate from the Philippines. I was offered an internship in New York which got me so excited so after graduating, I flew straight to the US. 

The first couple of days were fine. I was based in an office which was sort of accessible from my home (i live in Jersey city) and my boss was really nice to me. 

After a couple of weeks, things started going downhill for me. They moved to the office farthest from my home (it takes me around 2 and a half hours to get there and another 2 and a half to go home), my new boss is treating me like shit (one time I was 10 mins late because the subway malfunctioned and when i got to his office he sent me back home because I was 10 mins late) and the CEO has been telling me that if I go to the office late again, they will terminate my contract and send me home which of course I don't want because I worked so hard to get here and my family spent so much money to set me up here. 

Also, they're only paying me $500 a month and i'm paying $400 for rent,  $210 for transportation and around $200 for food. My parents are devastated with my situation and they're still spending a lot of money to sustain me.

What I plan to do right now is transfer to a different host company but I don't know the process and I don't know where to start. I also can't find any company who's willing to accept j1 interns.. i'm losing hope, i'm so stressed and I feel like i'm gonna lose my mind. 

PLEASE, i'm begging all of you, HELP ME OUT. I've lost 15 pounds because I haven't been eating, I'm always sick and I cannot afford medicine.. 

I'm a 20 year old fresh graduate on j1 Visa, i finished college in the Philippines. I took up Psychology. If anyone's out there, please help me.

tl;dr - I'm a j1 intern from the Philippines who's being mistreared by the company i'm working for and I need help :-("

I go to a school that is pretty much entirely focused on public interest. That's great and all and I thought it was for me but to be honest I am just not into it at all and I have been faking it for appearances. 

I have not received any internship offers but I feel so limited with my options because the ones that the school presents are all focused on public interest, including the clubs, events, etc. I would ideally like to do something more concrete (contracts, real estate, whatever) but its too taboo to go to my career offices and say that I am not interested in what the school offers and to ask where else I could look. 

I feel stuck and nervous. I have nothing on my resume that's non public interest related except a personal injury law firm. I feel like even for public interest positions I am constantly competing with really passionate activists and I dont have a chance. I guess I just wanted some advice and to hear from anyone who ended up in a similar situation. "

He’s the best man I know. But am I realizing this too late?,LSCV1981,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yrbkk/my_best_friend_m37_and_i_f37_have_known_each/,"I don’t want this post to be so long cause he’s been my best friend for 16 years so there’s a lot of things I can say. I’ll try to be brief.
Things that make me think he may be:
We were in class together for our Master degree and at the end we have the internship and he found me one at the same place he was.
One day, the first snow storm (my first time seeing snow) he was waiting for me outside of our internship place and it was very cold when I asked what are you doing outside he said he wanted to see my face of happiness walking in the snow.
One day he took me out for dinner and didn’t let me pay and actually we had a great time then he walked me home.
I was living in a city far from him for work but I lost my job so he found me a job in the same place he was working so I moved and live with him and his parents for 3 weeks while I found an apartment.
Then he drove me (5 hours drive) to help me move. On the way there I got a random fever very high so he stopped in a small town and since the doctor wasn’t working he took me to his house to give me something then he took me to the first gas station he saw and practically make me eat a sandwich and some water (I don’t really remember everything apparently I got really bad).
Then next weekend he drove again to finish with the moving an before dropping me in my old apartment he showed me a song a drove in circles so I can listen to it twice. The song really doesn’t apply cause it is about a couple who slept together and they woke up and they don’t want to get up just stay together.
He’s always been there for me and even though I moved to another country we’re still in contact not as much but we still check on each other at least every other month.
Things that make me think he is not:
He never said anything or try to kiss me I never saw anything that made me think he was in love.
I had a boyfriend for 1 year he was nice to him.
I got married here in another country and the morning of my wedding he was the firs message I received (very early in the morning) wishing me happiness and telling me to tell him if my husband doesn’t treat me right he would come and break his legs.
He sent me a wedding present a beautiful poem with a personalized shirt of my favorite soccer team.
When I got pregnant he got excited and he was texting me at least once a week to make sure I was feeling ok.
He is always asking for pictures of me and my daughter.
He recently told me he didn’t know I have the most beautiful baby girl in the world.
He has a girlfriend for the past 6 years but no married or kids. 
And finally a couple of days ago for my birthday he sent me a message saying he missed me very much, that I was the best person and friend he ever met.

**TL;DR; : He’s done some things that make look like too much for just a friend on the other hand he never showed me or told me anything about loving me in a different way. Do you think he’s in love with me or just the best friend ever?**.

7yrv2z,1,2018-02-19,M4F- I feel the need. The need to breed (Multi-prompt),DPPscenefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7yrv2z/m4f_i_feel_the_need_the_need_to_breed_multiprompt/,"So as you can tell from the title, I really want to knock you up.... or at least put in a lot of work where I'm barebacking and filling you up with as much cum as I can possible give you. The question to ask is how did it come to this, well luckily we can come up with a few *fertile* scenarios to *impregnate* with lust.

**Husband's Best Friend**- So your husband and yourself have been trying to conceive and it hasn't been stuck, not for a lack of effort. After doubting yourself you convinced him that you both need to be tested, only to find out that he has an incredibly low sperm count that would make it next to impossible to give you what you want.  After you both secretly confide in me what is going on, I offer to help out just planning on donating some sperm. But the cost that it would take is a little out of the price range that the two of you can afford, so we reach a deal where you are able to call me when you are ovulating and we fertilize the egg, the old fashion way.

**The Biological Clock**- You've been single all your life, not wanting to get married... but wanting to be a mom. Adoption agency aren't in a rush for single business women, but you can feel the clock starting to tick down. Do you want to seduce the young intern in the office or maybe hash out a deal for a FWB deal with your black co-worker.

I have a few more ideas brewing, but they don't feel like full scenes just yet, if you are into helping craft a new scene and turning it into something.... I'm more then happy to *reproduce* with you"
7yrxe5,1,2018-02-19,I need help on approaching this girl from 4 months ago.,prophetman124,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7yrxe5/i_need_help_on_approaching_this_girl_from_4/,"A little backstory I’m a 22 m college student so naturally I go to a career fair in a public event on September and afterwards I ended up talking to and meeting this girl who’s also has the same aspirations as I do when it comes to getting an internship.

So as I talked to her she tells me she goes to a state school hours away from here. So I felt less nervous into asking her for her number since she was happy that I share the same interests as her. So she seems eager about it even going as far as to send me a text in front of me to confirm that she has my number. So afterwards I say good bye and we parted ways 

and the next week I texted her about how was the other career fair next to her state school (like the month of September was prevalent with other career fairs). So the texts keep going about her event and my other event. And then I kind of didn’t pursue the texts for two reasons 1: School work was coming in and didn’t have time or forgot about it and 2: I thought it would be tiresome having this potential thing when she’s in a far away university school. 

So now it’s the next semester and I want to get in touch with her. When we met she explains she barely uses social media and prefers direct phone stuff like texts and calls. So Recently  I checked her Facebook and shows her and her lady friends hanging out and to me looks like she barely updates her Facebook so I check her twitter and Instagram and it’s all in private mode and all the available pictures is of course her and her lady friends posing. 

So I’m believing there’s a great chance that she’s single. And with this new semester I want to her in touch with her since there’s a chance she’s single and my friends pointed out she’s a 7/10 so it kind of reinforces my hope for her being single and all. 

The problem I have no idea how to approach her do I try to friend her on twitter knowing she might have a hard time remembering me or do I think of an alibi to go to her university and run into her. Since personally I do better when I see a female face to face rather than contacting her on social media when I know she’s not very active in.

I can’t stop thinking about her, knowing that she might be potentially single and the fact we share the same interests has me ecstatic and on the other hand at the same time my mind is making me think of the worst like she might have a boyfriend and that every day I waste is another potential for her to not be single. So I have to do something and I regretted not consistently keeping touch with her. 

So please I need with this!"
7ys51c,9,2018-02-19,I don't know what to do about my job application fears...,VoilaTada,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/7ys51c/i_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_job_application/,"I'm 27 (28 on the 1st), mtf, live near Philly, and a year and a half ago I graduated with a bachelors in Game Design. I took a month off to relax since that was some kind of accomplishment and then that month turned into 2, and then 3, and now it's a year and a half. It sounds as if this is just me refusing to look for work, and while it kind of is, it's not intentional at all. My debt is only growing and I continue to put my loans on forbearance because I have no money to pay them. I do want a job and I feel more capable than ever. I'm not evading entry level positions. I know I don't have real world experience in my field and I'm not going to assume I can land a dream job right away. But I do feel capable of handling a QA position or even interning as most other positions on a dev team. I'm confident in my ability to start one of these positions and that if I were simply given one of these positions right now, I'd perform at it well enough to keep the job.

But I can't just be given a job. This is a capitalist society and people aren't just given jobs to do. They have to prove they can do that job to someone that doesn't even necessarily know exactly what that job entails. I have to prove I can do that job. And then I go and look at my work for school that got me As and Bs and I see it as junk because I never really gave school my all because it was school and NOT work. I only gave it what I needed to to get these As and Bs to get through it so it doesn't show what I can really do, which is why diplomas these days don't guarantee jobs. I'm willing to move anywhere for a job but I have no money (actually negative in my bank right now...) and I can't drive so any expenses like that would fall on my employer (or family and I'd rather not ask for even more money). And so here I am without a portfolio I can be proud of, 50 grand of debt that I can't afford, and no way to move where the jobs are in my field.

I've heard various people tell me that I should get a more mundane job, like retail or dining, till I can get enough money to move. But I don't feel like I can do those things since I'm trans. I live full time as a woman (Clothing, under garments, women's restrooms, etc...) but haven't started transitioning because I have no money so I'm extremely uncomfortable dealing with the public eye. Especially since when I tried to work at my local Dairy Queen as I was coming out, I was told by my boss that I had to work the less busy hours (thus less tips) since customers complained about me interacting with their kids (which is ultimately why I quit). As for physical labor, I have back pain from scoliosis that flares up when I do dishes for 10 minutes, let alone move furniture or something like that. So mundane non-desk jobs seem out of my league and I have no idea what kind of other desk job I could even get with a degree in Game Design.

So back to applying for QA/programming jobs. Even assuming that employers will be willing to ferry me to their offices and pay me enough to pay for rent somewhere within walking/public trans distance (which is absurd on its own), I still have to apply, right? Well I've opened job listings and looked at these jobs at least a few dozen times. Every time I find one that seems reasonable to my abilities by the expectations, the requirements say they want 3+ years of programming or a CS degree or 2 years of QA and I can't rightly say I have these qualifications. I've heard people say to lie about it since no one really knows what that vague unit of 'years of experience' even means and I can't bring myself to do that. I'm not going to say that I've spent 2 years programming even if I made a non-graphical checkers without any AI in C++ in high school and know how to make a break-out clone or platformer with C# in Unity or build a castle with traps using prefabs, because I don't have that experience in a working environment. 

I don't know the kinds of pressures and expectations clients will have for me. I don't know what my deadlines will be like or if I work fast enough to meet them. (Especially since I wouldn't consider my typing speed very fast and for whatever reason a 40 wpm typing speed is required for these jobs.) I just don't have that 'experience'. And the only QA experience I have is making sure my work was good enough for a C-A grade in school. So I'm not comfortable saying I have any experience and even these entry level jobs seem to expect some, which is beyond me. If I were applying for game design jobs then I could show a few GDDs I've written and prototypes I've made. But usually that's not an entry level position so I don't feel comfortable seeking those jobs either since their requirements often go as far as to expect 5+ years of industry experience, regardless of the field...

And so I close the applications because I can't rightly put a checkmark next to the requirements for the jobs. Defeated. And this has happened multiple times over the course of a year and a half. I've started a couple personal projects since I graduated but I don't feel comfortable sharing them as portfolio pieces either since I'm not a great programmer and they're buggy as hell. If I was QA for them I'd say 'we can't ship this,' and as it turns out I AM QA for them. So they aren't shipping (to my portfolio). 

This is long and probably seems stupid to anyone who's landed jobs and no doubt someone's going to want to reply with, ""Just do it."" To those people I say that if it were that easy then I'd have already done it. I contacted a crisis hotline multiple times and that's pretty much what they've ended up telling me each time before disconnecting even though I'm still crying in a little ball on my bed, but I'm not suicidal so I'm low priority, I guess. (Which is completely fair. Don't get me wrong. If there's a queue on the hotline, suicidal people should be top of the list every time.) I'm a late 20s college grad who still lives in her mom's basement, eating her mom's food, using her mom's utilities even though it's still her just living paycheck to paycheck, and I'm filled with guilt and depression and fears and debt and pain. And look who's still here afraid to submit applications. This is clearly an issue I have and I don't know how to resolve it and no little Shia Lebouf clip is going to help me in particular so please think of something else...

EDIT: I think a lot of people are misunderstanding my advice request. Don't get me wrong, you're all giving fantastic advice for finding jobs and I appreciate the thought and time put into all the replies here. I've even learned some new things about it from reading these replies, even though a lot of job stuff is copy-pasted everywhere. But what I'm really asking for advice on here is how to get over this anxiety. It's not interview anxiety, I'm not too concerned with how to act or be seen in an interview. I know how to clean myself up, be presentable and respectful, and I'm a really genuine and open person, even if people bring up my gender. It's the requirements listed that literally scare the hell out of me. Not the expectations for the position. I've had online friends that are programmers read my code and say, ""I'd hire you, your code practices are better than half my team.""  Not the interview possibilities. I've talked with strangers all through school. Just the requirements. 

The ""X years experience"" stuff, because no matter where I look for listings I don't see ANY that don't have experience requirements, even internships and entry positions. This is a fear. I open applications. I go and fill out my name, and my skills (soft and hard), and start to write my cover letter and then I glance at the listing and see: ""1 year programming experience."" I panic. I start to sweat. I tab out. And before I know it it's been 2 hours and I close the tab. Even if I feel confident that I can do everything that's listed in the 'Expectations' section! I know this isn't a normal job help post. I'm sorry it kind of masks its own question in job stuff. But this seems to me like it's part of the job process and I just felt like knowing my whole job process train of thought would help people give me more personalized advice, but it really kinda derailed it... So yeah, if anyone has any advice on this particular fear I have, please reply some more! I don't know why I'm so afraid of these requirements, but it's ruining my adult life..."

TRIGGER WARNING: 

[!!!---The following post contains descriptions of emotional, physical, and verbal abuse, as well as emotional incest, and self-harming behavior. After a few people wrote that the experiences described below triggered them, I got concerned because that's the last thing I want for anyone healing and recovering out there.---!!!]



INTRODUCTION

After lurking here on the forum for over a year now, I finally signed up for my very first Reddit account. I thank each and everyone of you, who has shared their experiences here. There were many days and nights where coming here reading your stories and kind replies left me sobbing with relief, just because maybe I am not alone........maybe........I am not bad, and maybe it was not my fault.........


INTENTION

The reason why I am writing all of this down is because I want to:

1.) ..... heal.

2.) ......hold myself accountable for self-harming behaviors I still use at times and stop these.

3.) ......validate my perception and experiences once and for all, removing all remaining doubts.

4.) ......make sure my own narcissistic tendencies are being replaced with compassionate behavior.


BACKGROUND

To dive right in, I am a 33 year old married female, who works as a college level lecturer (foreign languages) and suspects her mother is a narcissist, and her stepfather (my mother's 3rd husband) an enabling father. I am originally from Western Europe, but moved to the USA for my husband years ago. I have been very low contact with both ""parents"" since February 2012. The only contact between us right now is via email and only on birthdays and Christmas. I have a brother who is 8 years older, and he is the currently the golden child. We switched roles somewhere around the time he turned 30 and got a prestigious job. At the moment, I am the scapegoat/lost child/black sheep. My enabling stepfather has two children. One of them, my stepbrother (scapegoat/black sheep) has been no contact with his father and my mother for over 15 years. Him and I are quite close and have validated each other's experiences. I am lucky to have him.


ABUSE

My therapist believes there has been severe neglect, emotional abuse, emotional incest, as well as physical abuse in my childhood all the way up until early adulthood. Most days.....I do believe him and my own perception.....however, at the end of the day I am a human being and social mammal.............programmed to crave and need connection with my family of origin.........and I am grieving the fact I never had a mother, and will most likely never have one. Meaning, I doubt myself at times because it is ""easier"" to believe I did something bad to deserve this, that explains all of this shit, than to feel and let in that my own mother may have never really loved and wanted me. Ouch. Yeah......

-------&gt; In fact, I am STILL learning what her behavior has done, and how I can make the best of my life now. Some days are good, others suicidal thoughts pop up, head and belly filled with toxic shame, and like I am an utter failure that needs to make herself go away...............and I wish......... I could just LET GO......... of the pain....... the anger........ the sadness......... the grief......... more anger.........more sadness.....the hopelessness........... the wishing maybe she can change.......the 'maybe she loves me and it's just another difficult mom-daughter relationship'............. the emptiness that bubbles up whenever I see Hallmark Mother's Day cards............. or how friends gather with their families around holidays................... I wish I could just STOP feeling anything about it at all................ It often feels like being on the outside, looking in on the world and others............. I also wonder if others can see the brokenness of me somehow........... Some days I even worry my husband only puts up with me because he feels responsible for me, and is backed into a corner. These are false beliefs, and I am working on that in therapy.


SELF-HARM

There is a history of a variety of self-harming behavior I used in the past to numb the pain, to punish myself, or to somehow have control over life in a twisted way. Behaviors I have used included:

1.) ----&gt; Slapping myself. With a flat palm on the cheek. Usually when I felt like I ""messed up something"", or ""had been a lazy."" My mother used to often call me ""lazy sow"" in a rage. Other situations that trigger me include ""feeling like I don't clean my home well enough"" or ""lacking real success in life."" The last time I did this was just a few weeks ago, and my goal is to stop all self-abuse now. For good. 

2.) ----&gt; Using a brush to hit my head. Same triggers usually. Feeling ashamed of myself or lazy or like a failure resulted in hitting the brush so hard until my scalp bled at times. I also used my fists to punch myself in the stomach, but luckily that stopped years ago and haven't used a brush or fists in a long time.

3.) ----&gt; Onset Bulimia and Anorexia. Starting in my senior year of high school and escalating in college, I had a few years where I'd binge-eat and then make myself throw it up. Combined with phases where I'd withhold food to punish myself for ""getting fat."" 

4.)----&gt; Cognitive Self-Punitive Behaviors.  I am incredibly hard on myself, and have not considered having children yet as I am worried about how much of me is like my mother. I do not want to pass this generational ""gift"" on. My maternal grandmother was a cold and shitty person, and I believe my grandpa was an enabling father as well. I tend to have ridiculously high expectations of myself. I am often cruel and impatient, self-criticizing myself with thoughts. 

5.) ----&gt; Substance abuse (Alcohol). About a year ago I decided to get 100% sober from alcohol. After one relapse 140 days into my first attempt, I started over and am now over 300 days sober. The plan is to stay that way forever. Since I have used alcohol starting around age 17/18 to numb it all out, learning how to feel and what to do with these feelings has been a ride......... to say the least.....and it has been so so worth it. I recommend sobriety (with the right support alongside you) to anyone. 





RECOVERY TOOLS

-----------&gt;


Here are the tools I have used so far to help me recover:


1.) Bibliotherapy 

Lots of reading, including classics such as ""Will I ever be good enough?"" by McBride and ""Children of the self-absorbed"", ""Mothers who can't love"" etc.

2.) Therapy. 

It will soon be four years of bi-weekly therapy with a licensed clinical counselor, who has been a lifeline...to say the least. 

3.) Talking to people I trust. 

This was and still is a trial/error experience. Sometimes I chose the wrong people to confide in. Other times, opening up was a healing experience, and the compassion of others has been transforming.


4.) The internet. Below are some of the resources that helped, and still help me the most/

----&gt; Truly lucky. 


COMMENT

Therapy is not something everyone has access to, and I am aware this is a luxury service ......never take that for granted. It has saved my life. My friends, as mentioned, are supportive as can be. The only problem is.........I feel most people have ""normal-enough"" mothers....... and while they are compassionate, I am often left wondering: ""If it was all in my head. If I was just born too sensitive. If I am being ungrateful. If I was that difficult of a child, and my mother did her best. The poor thing. IF ONLY....... I had been more decisive, more hard-working, more normal, and found a career path right after high school to prevent mom from feeling so angry at me......and so on....and so forth.

----&gt; Below are a few ""highlights"" of what I believe to be maternal narcissism. Any feedback is greatly appreciated, and I apologize for the extremely long post in advance. I will go back and edit the post so that each experience is clearly labeled, in case someone does not wish to read about a specific kind of abuse.


EXPERIENCES


1.) Emotional Neglect / Lack of Mirroring

I have no memories of my mother ever looking at me with true love and compassion. In fact, her eyes sometimes get that ""crazy look"" I only ever saw in one other person in my entire life, namely my abusive ex boyfriend. There are no nice photos of us two, with the typical ""mother gazing lovingly at baby or toddler"" or whatnot. In fact, we have barely any nice photos of me from early childhood. The ONLY portrait in which I smile a bit, and that was clearly supposed to be a happy memory, is from one single photo shoot my kindergarten organized when I was 3 years old.

2.) Verbal / Emotional Abuse

Raging. Lots of it. I remember it was often over something other moms just did, and shockingly other moms seemed to LIKE and WANT to do them. Like...... picking up her 15 year old teenager from the airport after a school trip........helping their teenagers visit colleges to plan a career/college path out.......picking/dropping off their kids every now and then. I always took care of it by myself, using the bus or walking or biking. 


3.) Physical Abuse

- One time I came home a little late from playing with my neighbors when I was 13 years old, the next door neighbors where I'd basically be most days, all day long, as nobody was providing supervision for me. My mother raged and slapped me so hard on the cheek that a corner of my front tooth broke off. She then continued to blame me for being late, and claimed the ""dentist hadn't attached the corner very well."" Yes, that corner had fallen off before in a sports swimming accident, but.....in my opinion the dentist had attached a very very strong artificial corner, so my mother must have used significant enough force to break the fake tooth material. My dentist re-attached the corner after my mother had slapped it out of my mouth, and it hasn't even chipped or weakened at all since then, and that was 20 years ago.....go figure.

-- She would force me into a closed shower as a toddler and punish me with cold water. Fully dressed. ""Because I had thrown a tantrum over wanting to eat cereal for dinner and she could not stop me from throwing a tantrum and was worried I'd hurt myself by slamming my head onto the floor.""

--- Spanking. At times she pulled me off of the toilet and slapped me on my naked butt. I had actually hidden on the toilet one time, hoping that would help me escape the spanking. But it was a mistake in hindsight as it turns out being hit hurts less with pants on. Lesson learned. Thanks, mom.

4.) Emotional Incest

- She would brag about her sexual talents and attractiveness a lot. This could be something ""rather harmless"" like when we went shopping together all my life I remember she'd brag how: ""men my age looked at me!!!! And men mari135's age looked at her, too."" That made me sad........ I wanted mom-daughter shopping trips to be about mom and me, and NOT about which strange men looked at us. 

-- Other times she would share pornographical details such as: ""Your stepfather makes me come first with his hands and fingers, and then he makes me come again when we have regular sex. And my first husband always said I was sooo great in bed. He even tried to sleep with me one last time after we got divorced, and handed the keys for the house over, but I said no.""

*** I found that information VERY disturbing as I was in my early teens/teens. 
My therapist later explained this is called ""emotional incest"". ***

--- My mother would also ask me on vacation (I was 14 years old) to ""leave the hotel room to go do something because they needed privacy, meaning have sex."" So on our ""lovely"" family vacation, where we shared one hotel room, I had to pack up a book and sit alone by the indoor swimming pool in the middle of the Canadian Rockies, waiting for stepdad and mom to be done having sex. Back then we did not have cellphones yet like we do today, so I remember sitting all alone at the cold and bleak indoor pool, wondering if mom and dad are done having sex yet, so I can get back into my hotel room. 

-------&gt; When I did get back, both pretended nothing had happened. My mother was grinning disgustingly, and had a red glow on her face. She pretended like nothing happened. I am pretty sure when I am 51 years old I will be able to moderate my sexual desires, so that I won't have to send a teenager all alone to sit and wait in the hotel lobby. Or....have the decency to get my own room. Heck, I would have had the decency to NOT ask my child to leave the room at any age, regardless of my sexual needs. Children come before sexual needs. Period. Anyone can wait to have sex to protect a child's integrity, if they want to.

4.) EMOTIONAL ABUSE / DEHUMANIZATION

- Shit really hit the fan in 2011/2012. I was forced to briefly move in with them for a few weeks as I needed to job hunt in between getting my master's degree....... and.......well.......actually finding a job. I had graduated from a university abroad with a full scholarship. My parents never had to pay a single cent for tuition. None of that was acknowledged, and they didn't seem happy at all to see me be back. They hadn't seen me for two years. My parents are very wealthy, own property in several European capitals, but the entire two years did not offer to either fly me home for a Christmas visit, I also never received a Christmas or birthday card, let alone gifts. My mother did sarcastically comment in front of her friends how: ""mari135 worked a LITTLE bit over there.""  ..........And ""over there"" being a very reputable state university in the USA. It was not a full-time teaching job, but I was a graduate student, and not allowed to work full-time on my visa. 

-- But that wasn't even the worst of it. During my time with them (12 weeks or so) they forbid me to unpack my suitcases. My mother informed me I would not be given a guest room. I had to sleep on the fold-up futon couch in the open living room, right by the kitchen. My suitcases had to remain right next to the main entrance by the door. She even placed a carpet over them because: ""she was worried what the neighbors thought, and it looked so ugly in the hallway with these suitcases.""

--- I was not allowed (this is a lifelong pattern) to use the washing machine. The shower/bathroom was patrolled by my mother every.single.time I used it because: ""I did not know how to clean up stains from the water off of the appliances well enough."" One time I wanted to make ""mommy happy"" ---&gt; I was 27 when I stayed with them back then ----&gt; and I cleaned the bathroom like there was no tomorrow. 
Hours. On my knees. Scrubbing. 

---- My mother walks in, looks around, scoffs, points at the surface of a plastic box on a shelf and says: ""Most people don't see fingerprints like those right there. You did not see them either, but I do."" That was that. No ""Thank you"". No ""Good job"". That was also a lifelong pattern. But it took me until I was 27 to realize how bad this must have been for a young child growing up. During that time she also complained and claimed often that: ""You did not know how to open up the fridge the right way, and left disgusting fingerprints all over the surface of my designer kitchen."" I remember being worried about leaving fingerprints, walking about her house on eggshells. 

----- One day I got REALLY sick with tonsilitis, and asked her if I could use the car to get meds from the pharmacy. Her response was cold and she just said: ""It's winter and the car would need to warm up for 20 minutes. And you're not allowed to drive the car by yourself so I'd have to come with.""  Again, I was 27 years old at that point. Had successfully worked and studied abroad. My host family in the USA who did not even know me well gave me their car all the time. Parents of friends let me drive their cars all the time. In my entire life I have never had an accident, speeding or parking ticket. I know I am a good-enough driver.

-------Since I needed the meds, I grabbed my bike in -12 Celsius winter weather and rode it to the pharmacy. My mother must have gotten worried about what the neighbors might think. Two days later I needed more meds as my tonsilitis was getting worse. This time, my mother left the house without saying a word. She came back an hour later, walked into the house, with a martyr / self-righteous look on her face, grinning and throwing the meds onto my bed/couch saying: ""Happy now?!"" 

---------A few days before that she had raged over nothing, stormed away and yelled at me: ""Nothing is ever good enough for little madame."" I was in the middle of the worst fever infection I can remember. That night, I wanted to commit suicide for the first time. Things finally got so bad (my mother would frequently position herself in the middle of the living room, at center of the house, and cry and complain how: ""she had the right to not always have to be strong, too."" This is also a lifelong behavior she had. Growing up my brother would be assigned the role (he still has that role and is 41 now) to be a semi-husband for her. He'd be allowed to soothe her, softly pat her back when she was crying. I was sent to my room. My brother would often say: ""I know how to handle this. You go to your room.""



THE FINAL ESCAPE

-------&gt; But back to 2011/2012.......While I stayed with my parents I ended up worrying my suicidal ideation was turning into me actually wanting to carry out a plan, and asked my aunt if I could come visit them for a few days to get a break from my parents. My aunt agreed right away. She has often had periods in her life where she did not talk to my mother, her sister. My aunt understands and believes me. When I arrived at her house, I felt like I had PTSD. I was too scared to use their kitchen, and expected my aunt and uncle to dislike me soon as well. My mother dumped the rest of my belongings I hadn't been able to take with me on the train to my aunt's city in big grey garbage bags a few weeks later. Without saying a word. She just dumped them in front of my aunt's garage. Did not even ask my aunt or uncle if that day was a good day to dump my things on their property. It was raining, and my mother didn't even know if my aunt/uncle were home or gone for days.

During that time, my stepfather once said to my mother he ""was scared of her, and did not dare to criticize or question her ever, as it always came back tenfold later on."" I found that to be quite the impressive and accurate description of her narcissism, but since he is the enabler, he will never understand that himself.

Some of those things had been in an IKEA carry-bag I had used, but I guess that was ""too good"" for her daughter. She removed it all and there they were....all of my things in garbage bags. Thanks, mom.
She then acted like NOTHING happened. My stepfather sent me this shit email saying: ""I hope staying with us wasn't too stressful."" They have always called me ""too sensitive"" so that put the blame yet again on me finding too many things too often too stressful.

My mother did NOT care how/where I lived after I walked out of their house. She was probably just happy to be able to have sex all day wherever she wanted and to have gotten rid of her child yet again. My therapist once translated that into the movement you make with your two palms ""Job well done."" I found that helpful as that was EXACTLY how it felt like. She rid herself of me, and that was what she wants.

I had to move through two temporary apartments to complete an internship first, and finally move to the city where I got a full-time job. From the day of my graduation (December 12th to scoring that good full-time job it took me only 4 months. Given the job market at the time it was remarkable, yet my parents never even acknowledged how hard I worked to get my career going. She just asked things like: ""How is your job? Is it full-time? I hope your students aren't as bad as those I just read about in a book the other day. That sounds like such an awful job, teaching.""

When my replies started getting flat and non-deep (I used to be an open book for her, and anyone, actually, gladly sharing each and every feeling, worry, thought) she started to complain. Then, one day, she just declared: ""This is too hard for me. I will stop writing you now since you never share anything about yourself anymore."" What MOTHER willingly declares she no longer wants to be in contact with her only daughter?
Sure, if I had had a history of stealing money from them, taking drugs in their home, assaulting them and whatnot.....I would understand why a parent stops enabling their child so the child gets help. But....I was a good-enough child and young adult by all means. 

The little girl in me panicked when my mother wrote that, and I replied that I did not want us to have no contact. Emails continued for a bit after that, but my mother became more and more weird, and outwardly aggressive in them. Finally, she attacked me one more time directly, but I had started therapy by then and felt more confident...... and I replied that: ""We can rebuild a new relationship based on trust, but I will no longer respond to passive aggressive emails from you, mother.""

She pouted, ignored my email for a few days (she checks her emails daily, and most of the time reads them all aloud to my stepfather, who then writes replies together with her) and wrote back that: ""She could not promise that she would not relapse."" Meaning, relapse = being passive-aggressive. Since that day, 2 years ago, it's been only ""Dear friends and family"" kind of mass emails from them. She suddenly did start to send me a card for my birthday, which she has NEVER done all those years I was in undergrad etc. That just started suddenly 4 years ago out of nowhere. My therapist said she does that because it helps the narc maintain the illusion of ""a good parent"". These cards usually disturb me, and I throw them out the same day as it triggers me.

MORE EXAMPLES


-----&gt; There is more. I bet like for ALL of you there is so much more......and I am sorry you had to experience that. You have my sincere compassion. 


1.)  Other highlights worth mentioning include that when I lived abroad and dated an abusive man, I ended up being attacked my him. It was a classical domestic violence situation, and I had to go to court to state my case and get a protection order. The entire time my mother did not call me. Not even once. She just sent an email saying ""This was all too hard for her, and I should contact that psychology professor in the USA I once had."" Thanks....mother. I also understand now why I used to be so attracted to abusive, controlling, narc men. It is called ""repetition compulsion"" and it felt....familiar. I was used to that family dynamic. It felt comfortable even when it was dangerous. I was 23 years old at that time of my DV experience, and far away from my home country. One phone call from my own mother would have been nice. Oh....and you'd think when I came back home after the domestic violence ordeal my own mother would have been happy to have her only daughter safe and sound in her arms? 

Negative. Nopety nope nope. My mother complained that the airport I flew into (40 hours trip back home from Australia) was too far from home. (3 hours driving). Fair enough. I took a train to a town 30 minutes from our house after flying/doing layovers for 40 hours. My mother still complained that ""the parking there is so bad and we will have a hard time finding a parking spot.""  My parents are avid travelers and have been, and still are, traveling the world. Certainly finding parking in a city close to where we lived for 30 years would not be too challenging. 

When she saw me walking through the train station all she said was: ""I didn't know you had a red coat."" I was then told my mother had decided to sleep in my old bedroom, and I was given a mattress on the floor in an empty former workroom........ that didn't even have lights on the ceiling. She did place 3 tiny flowers in a little vase on the sink in that room. Not sure if I was supposed to be all grateful about that, but she made it a point to point out that she did that for me. How nice of you, dear mommy. Then, she continued making it all about her. She would tell me about how hard her marriage with my biological father was, and I remember I ended up comforting HER as she started crying when she talked about that. Not sure why my domestic violence experience was the clue for her to make it yet again about her. It felt wrong. She also said weird things like: ""Sent the bill for those shoes to THAT guy."" And then she smirked. I asked her what she meant, and she made it clear she wanted me to contact my abusive ex I had just gotten a restraining order against, and make him pay for my new shoes. (He had cut up all of my shoes and clothes with scissors when I wanted to leave him, a traumatic experience, to say the least) Sure mom, let me text him real quick, I bet he has his credit card ready to go! Madness.




2.) When I was 11 or 12 years old, she would make me take a public bus for over an hour in the middle of winter to get my sick guinea pigs to the vet. I had to go in for 3 consecutive appointments as they had some sort of lice that required several regular injections. The 3rd time, for some reason, she was able to drive me. 
And....when we got into the hallway after paying the fee she raged at me again claiming: ""He charged us more because I came with you. Next time you go alone again.""

3.) Financial abuse. She gifted my brother (GC) all of her savings a few years ago. I do not believe I will ever see a single cent of that money, and am now making my peace with the fact that I will never ever receive even the tiniest bit of financial help from them.

4.) My enabling stepfather is its own bag of shit. He would often leave his flat palm on my butt when we hugged or posed for photos, especially as I got older. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable. My therapist said this was NOT ok and that normal fathers do not do that. I still question it sometimes and worry that I am being too critical of my stepfather. My stepfather would also always pull me REALLY tight when we did any sort of ballroom dancing. It disgusted me. 


5.) When my brother was 3 years old he broke his leg playing outside. He had to be in the hospital, both legs in a cast and tied to a pole to keep them in a certain angle, which left him stuck in bed 24/7. My mother decided this was a good time to go on vacation and she flew by airplane to a resort by the beach for a few days. We had no family in town at that time, I was not born yet. My aunt and neighbors said they felt so sorry for my brother and went to visit him out of pity. My aunt driving 4 hours to get to the hospital. Who leaves a toddler with a broken leg in a hospital and flies to another country to go relax on the beach? I wonder if that is almost sociopathic actually.

6.) She often lied and gaslighted. Like she would go through my clothes and throw away something she thought was ""too old, too slutty"" or whatnot and without telling me it was gone. I would then frantically look for it. She would try and lie to me long enough for the garbage truck to get there. One time, I went down to the street on a hunch and gut feeling....and there it was. My favorite t-shirt I had gotten as a gift from a woman who helped me escape my abusive ex boyfriend. In the trash bin. By the road. My mother had literally walked it all the way down from our house to that trash bin while I was at the dentist. Then lied to me. That...reminded me of what my abusive ex had done. He too....had placed my clothes (all cut up) in a garbage bin by the road. I had to dig through all of that garbage to get them back out. When I told my therapist about that, it suddenly clicked and I made the connection....my mother doing the same as my abuser, just a few weeks apart from each other.

 ------&gt; Another time .......she hid something else that belonged to me, and told me: ""to just sit down and eat and she misplaces things all the time. It would surely show up again."" I was looking for that thing frantically, thinking I had lost my mind....it was there on the table, the second I came back from the using the restroom it was gone.......but I had another hunch, and pretended to go to the bathroom upstairs a few minutes later, but instead quietly sneaking into her bedroom.....and there is was! The thing I was looking for was HIDDEN inside her travel bag on her bed, underneath a pile of her clothes. Thanks, mommy. We never talked about it. I took that thing back, and she never asked. I needed them to provide me with a roof over my head until I could be financially independent and leave.


7.) Grandiose self-esteem. She has this grandiose idea of her own importance. When my brother had a baby, my niece, she bragged to EVERYONE how she, my mother the physical therapist, had ""secretly treated her granddaughter and now her granddaughter was standing up wayyyy better."" There is a whole story to that where my sister-in-law caught my mother giving my granddaughter physical therapy treatment, and when asked what my mother was doing, my mother lied. My sister-in-law had never given consent that her toddler was to be treated by my mother.



8.) Triangulation. When, for the first and last time ever, my mother Skyped with my then boyfriend and now husband, the first thing she told him was that: ""Your girlfriend is an alcoholic and she drinks a bottle a day!"" Then she continued dancing manically with my stepfather in front of the camera, as they had just gotten home from one of their nights out. Pretending to be the cool relaxed dancing queen. My now husband said he found that comment VERY sickening. While I did drink too much in college and for many years after that, I was never an alcoholic and especially not during that time. It's not the nicest thing to say about your own daughter the very first time you meet her new boyfriend. During that time she would try to sabotage my relationship with him, telling me ""I don't like his beard. His gifts are cheap. You should marry an engineer back home instead.""

-----&gt; She triangulated and I once caught her (overhearing through a door) crying to my golden child brother how I ""was not applying to many jobs at all."" (lie, that's all I did all day long) My parents both claimed that physical therapy was a profession that was going to disappear soon. I was told at age 16 that ""Since you're always sick, you better just become a teacher. They get so much vacation."" My mother also liked to compare us kids. One time, she asked my brother and me to ""compare who cost more."" (My brother is 8 years older). And she would always say things like ""Your brother, the get-things-done guy."" Or ""Your brother is very good at getting practical things done. You...well you are good for emotional things.""

This went as far as getting my stepfather on board to manipulate my career choice. I did NOT want to be a teacher. But since nobody cared to visit colleges with me or do anything to help me choose a career, I studied education. I believed them. I was sick quite often growing up. Asthma, a skin rash. Colds.  She later sold her practice to one of her employees. It STILL is a very successful practice, and I am not sure I am finished grieving the loss of ""what could have been"" there yet. I do my best at teaching, but am not naturally cut out for it. It's a hard job. Funnily enough, I have had only two sick days in all my years teaching and since going low contact with my parents, I have been the healthiest version of myself ever. Asthma, gone. Skin rash, gone. Frequent colds, gone.





9.) Blameshifting. She blamed me for outrageous things as a child claiming for example: ""You did not want to learn Dutch"" which is her mother tongue. Now...I am a teacher. I can assure you that IF a mother spends a little bit of time and WANTS to teach her child her own mother tongue...she will. Kids are like sponges. They love learning. I cannot believe she blamed a baby/toddler/small child for her disinterest in passing on her own language to me. 


10.) Medical Neglect. One time when I was 8 years old, I had a VERY bad and seriously dangerous asthma attack. We had been visiting my aunt who lived 4 hours away. She has cats and we did not know my blanket was covered in hair, so at 1am I was barely able to breathe. It felt like breathing through a straw. My mother...raged...and raged....and raged....she packed me into to backseat.....and drove me all those 4 hours back to our house. No ER visit. Nothing. I remember thinking the entire drive: ""I might die. I can't breathe."" That was the only incident where my enabling stepfather ALMOST stood up for me. Almost. I remember feeling so ashamed for years for getting sick, and making mommy angry. 



11.) Neglect of basic parenting obligations. In school I'd miss lots of things and she would brag and joke about ""not knowing in which grade her daughter was"" in front of me to her patients. I missed a 3rd grade reading competition because my own mother didn't know what I was up to at school. I missed a 5th grade trip because she didn't know and I was 11 and had forgotten to set an alarm clock. I lied when my teacher called, saying I was ill because I was too ashamed for not being able to manage my own commitments well enough. 11. Years. old. Jesus.



12.) Delusions. She thinks the husbands of her friends fancy her and are into her.
She also thinks my aunt secretly wishes she had a husband like my stepfather. When I told my aunt, she almost vomited as she cannot stand my stepfather.



13.) My stepfather once looked me in the eye when I was 23 years old and said: ""You would have NEVER filled your mothers shoes."" Meaning, I would have never been good enough to take over her physical therapy practice. It was my dream to do that, but they manipulated me into not doing that.



14.) She is overly concerned with what others think about her, mostly strangers and neighbors. One time while I was staying with my parents and applying for jobs, they left for some gala New Year's Eve event at a castle in our capital, and I stayed back because I had the work ethics of ""applying for a job is my full-time job, so no going out until I have a job. Period.""  Around midnight I wondered if the lonely older lady next door was home, too. To my surprise, she was! So I grabbed a bottle of champagne, and walked over. Her and I had a lovely New Year's Eve. She told me in tears how her own daughter, and only child, had died in a car accident and so ever since she preferred to just be home alone on holidays.

-----&gt; When my parents came back from the extravagant party a few days later, and I told them about having been with the neighbor, my mother freaked out and got this aggressive smirk and hissed: ""Ohh, so I bet you told her allllll about how bad we are to you. Bad parents, right?!!"" ..............How on earth she thought of THAT paranoid stuff instead of maybe ....I don't know.....being proud of having a compassionate adult daughter who cares about lonely elderly neighbors.............Another time she hissed at me: ""I'd kick you out but what would the neighbors think?""

Although, she DID eventually end up writing me a letter, walking away crying when I wanted to discuss a rational solution, and actually kicked me out with a deadline even. ""You need to leave by March 1st."" 
Had it not been for my aunt, i'd have been literally homeless at age 26/27. My own mother could not even wait 3-4 months until I had my full-time job, and that after she hadn't seen me in two years.

15.) When I graduated from high school, just like she had done with my brother, my mother informed me ""I no longer needed a key to HER house since I had no more business to be done there."" I had just moved into my dorm room, and had kept the house key as I had boxes full of stuff left in our attic. Dorm rooms = very small. She expected me to 100% live in my dorm room, which had the kitchen next to my bed, as in literally RIGHT next to it. ""Fair enough.....suck it up, you're a student. Be humble."" I thought back then. That's also when my self-harming escalated and my alcohol consume as well. The next day I was babysitting the children of one of my mother's employees for whom I had been babysitting for 4 years. My mother showed up unannounced at the door of that family's house, and raged at me in front of their 5 year old, accusing me of lying to her about not having the key with me. I did NOT have the key with me, and had left it in my dorm room to go work that night as a babysitter, my mind occupied with college about to begin, moving, work etc. I had planned to drop it off at her house, aka my childhood home for 18 years, the next day. 

After she left, the 5-year old boy looked up at me and asked: ""Who was that?"" And I replied: ""Oh, you know my mother. That was my mother."" He shook his head and replied: ""Didn't look like her."" And went off to go play in his room. What struck me about that was his innate child-wisdom. My mother gets that crazy look in her eyes and on her face when she rages. She really did NOT look like her at all that night. It was her rage-face. That little boy could put into words what I could not even allow myself to feel until age 29 in therapy.

For the record, even my mother's cleaning lady had a key to our house. Whenever my parents were gone on one of their world trips for weeks on end, and I needed to access my belongings that did not fit into my dorm room, I had to call her up and make sure she could open and close the door for me. It was humiliating. I cried a lot during those visits. The house we grew up in was the place I spent so much time at. I was often from age 14/15 onward left alone for weekends when my parents went away to travel. 



RECENT PAST to PRESENT DAY

Last time I saw them, she started a huge fight with my stepfather. I was blamed for it. ""Me being back there"" had put that much pressure on them, according to them. He had been stonewalling/silent treating her for days. That was his MO all my life, by the way. She would often cry to me about wanting a 3rd divorce. So I kinda had a hard time ""bonding with stepdaddy"" over all that, as you can imagine. Then I was blamed for having a bad relationship with him. He also told me to my face that ""meeting your mother put me back ten years in life since you were so young, and my own children already older."" Thanks...dad..... = I am a burden that ruined his life. Instead of being grateful to be given two stepkids to love and guide and cherish....

That day, both in their 60's, she grabbed one of his favorite glass statues and threatened to: ""smash it on the ground if he did not talk to her."" I remember thinking: ""Wow....here I am aged 26/27 overhearing this...what went on when I was....3....4....5...years old I don't actively remember?



-----------&gt; 

There is so much more...but it is time to take a hot bubble bath, continue reading a book about boundaries someone just recommended to me, and then work tomorrow morning...........Oh boy...................if you made it this far..............let me pay you a full hour of what my counselor charges..........haha oh well............it did feel healing and cathartic to write it out, even if nobody ever reads it. In future posts I will focus on sharing healing resources and giving others support.




THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart if you made it this far.

7ysm0a,1,2018-02-19,(M4F) Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ysm0a/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7ysnlm,9,2018-02-19,Thoughts on attempting to transfer?,HeartlandPolitico63,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/7ysnlm/thoughts_on_attempting_to_transfer/,"
So, this isn’t a post about my odds...I’m very familiar with ABA 509 reports. What I’m looking for are perspectives on if I should go through the transfer process. I currently go to a T2 (60s; very well-respected locally) at a flagship school that feeds into a major Midwestern metropolitan area (secondary market) where I’m from and would ultimately like to work in. I’m on a full ride. After the first semester, I’m #4 in the class with a 3.90 and two CALIs. I love the school (my undergrad institution), my classmates, and professors, but I feel like I’d get more out of law school if I went to a more *competitive* one. If I keep my grades where they’re at, I’d have a very good chance at getting a clerkship and then going into BigLaw in the secondary market. 

However, I’m considering transferring because: there’s no guarantee I can keep my grades where they’re at (not gonna get complacent, but it’s always uncertain) and so I’d like to have the security of graduating from a higher ranked school, I have an interest in working in DC for a little bit and I think a degree from a more prestigious school that has more alumni there might be beneficial, I’d like the mobility of the degree in case I do that want to move somewhere else, and (I know it’s vain) but part of me wants it for the prestige factor. 

Ultimately, I’d like to clerk for a federal judge, work for a large firm for a few years, and then go into government, ideally as an AUSA (very original, I know). I do have a summer internship lined up with the USAO in that major metropolitan area. The only schools I’d consider applying to are Georgetown/Virginia (DC connection), Northwestern/Michigan/Chicago (Midwestern connection), and HLS (Hail Mary). 

So anyway, I’d like to hear any thoughts on going through with applying. I don’t really wanna go through the process if it wouldn’t be that beneficial to transfer, because I don’t wanna ruffle too many feathers at my current school. 

I’m grateful for any and all perspectives!"
7ysswn,1,2018-02-19,"I was hacked today on Coinbase, does anyone have any possible ideas how this occurred?",Guisa_Wow,CoinBase,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7ysswn/i_was_hacked_today_on_coinbase_does_anyone_have/,"My story begins with me laying in bed.

I hear my phone vibrate, signaling that I received an email. I immediately see in the dropdown banner message that the email was from Coinbase, and that ""my"" charge of $5000 has been successful in the subject line.

This confuses me, and I wonder if it was possible that I had accidentally purchased the coin as I had been on my account the previous day. I click my email app on my phone and read the email, only to see it deleted right before my eyes. I log onto my email on my computer and do not see the email anywhere in my inbox, AND EVEN MY DELETED FOLDER!

This guy attempted to purchase $5000 worth of bitcoin, and delete the email so I would be uninformed, then after the wait time for bank account transactions had passed withdraw the funds.

He somehow got access to both my email and coinbase account, which was mostly my fault for using the same password and email for both accounts. As of now, I've changed everything, added the dual-factor authentication and called my mom for emotional support. Tomorrow I'll call the bank and make sure that I tell them to tell Coinbase to go fuck themselves and keep their grubby hands off my gold. I also opened a ticket with coinbase so that my account is suspeneded or whatever.

My question is, how is something like this possible? I'm not computer illiterate by any means. I'm in school for Computer Engineering and have a Software Engineering Internship. I don't EVER download things from websites, and cannot remember anything that I'd done that would've caused this. In the future, I want to be able to better protect myself."

Also, how are internships opportunities at SJSU since it’s in Silicon Valley? 

I was heavily considering SJSU because of the environment and due to the school being ranked one of the better CSUS in California. I’m also fairly close to SJSU - about 2 hours away, so I can visit my family still when I want. 


In general, how good is SJSU with preparing you to get a job at a good company after graduating - preferably at a company in Silicon Valley? I’m going to work really hard to do phenomenal in college and learn everything I can. Just wanted to know if this is a good school from the eyes of current students or students thinking of applying as well. "

I have a couple options (as well as any of my previous options or choices of your own)

**1** With the olympics going on I thought it might be fun to do a Coach RP. I will be an athlete and you can be my coach. Maybe it is willing, maybe you force me, maybe a bit of both. I'd love to hear your ideas for this one.

**2** I'm your wife or your girlfriend or your mistress, the catch is I am much younger than you. Maybe you're a successful business man and I'm your intern, maybe I'm a college student and I'm your professor, maybe I'm one of your daughters best friends. 

**3** This one is similar to number 2 as I would be playing the younger wife of an older man. However in this scenario, I would be your step mother. Think sort of like Missy from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. We could play it basically exactly like that relationship, or for some extra fun, I'm actually even younger than you, adding to the humiliation and giving you more reason to take advantage of my body.

**4** This is a classic babysitter prompt. Maybe you pay me with sex. Maybe I walked in on something I shouldn't have seen and so you punish me. Take this in the same old direction, or make it new.

**5** This idea is a bit more open, but it is the darker prompt as well. This could be any prompt really, that gets violent or gross or disturbing in any way. I'd love to here your thoughts on this one. Basically no limits so go wild!

**6** Create your own! I am not the only person with prompt ideas so I would love to hear your unique suggestions!

I'm interested to hear your take on these or your own prompts. I get a lot of messages and with a lot of these prompts that many people are interested in I hear a lot of similar suggestions. So I would absolutely love for you guys to get very very creative with your scenarios. I also really like the dark prompts so if you want to do that one or if you add a dark element to another prompt you will probably get priority. If you have made it this far please put the word Luge in your subject so I know you actually read this.

7ytz63,3,2018-02-20,I’m losing hope in,IdkWhatToDo1121,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ytz63/im_losing_hope_in/,"I can’t say I struggled with depression at all in my early years, or even through my first years of college. I think my first encounter with depression is when I met my now fiancé who has prescribed medicine for her depression and bi-polar. She explained she had a hard time holding relationships because her illness gets in the way whether it be not wanting to get out of bed or being in a manic state with her bi-polar. I wasn’t sure how to take that at first, but to keep a long relationship story short I fell in love with her. Over the years I’ve done my best to support her, and I think I’ve done a good job. But to get to my point idk if I can anymore because I’m struggling with keeping myself happy. 

For the first time I can admit I think I’m depressed. I dropped out of school because financially I can’t go back. It has put me into an enormous amount of debt I don’t think I can repay. I wanted to be a software engineer and had a few internships that I did very well at. But I can never get a degree because math kills me. I’ve spent hours with tutors, and TA’s at the school and I just can’t do it. So I didn’t re-enroll. That was three years ago. That’s when the depression started is when I realized I can never be what I want. I was jobless for about a year struggling to pay back loans private and federal. I finally found a job working as a fundraising assistant at a local non-profit. It was pretty low paying and not very skilled work but at least it was a job. A year went by there and the depression just kept getting worse between being in debt and having to take care of my fiancé whose depression is worse than mine. I was keeping it a secret because I didn’t want her to worry about me. She needs to take care of herself. Then over that summer my fiancé was drugged and raped by a then friend while I was at work. This caused her to go into a deep depression and attempt suicide. She spent some time at a hospital where only family had contact with her, and I was technically not family so I could not talk to her or see her for three weeks. This killed me. I feel it was my fault. He was my friend. I let him into the house because he needed a place to stay. She suffered because of my choices and I just couldn’t bare the thought that I did that. I know she had/has it worse so I shouldn’t be complaining. But it’s been eating me away. 

Fast forward a few months and she is recovering and work is for once going well. I got a raise and the new boss put me in charge of the silent auction for our gala. I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy to work. I felt like I was making a difference and a little bit of a humble brag but I made it look good. We got some really good donations and we raised more in the silent auction than we ever had in past years gala’s. For once I forgot about everything and I was feeling happy again. It was refreshing. That was very shorted lived. My fiancé has some pretty bad ptsd and it took me hours and hours to calm her down after an episode. That’s when I realized idk if I can take care of her. Financially or mentally and it hurts me so much to say it but she deserves better. She such a kind hearted person that deserves much more than I can offer. This realization hurts me so much. 

Today while I was sitting at work I was trying to figure out what to do. It was the first time I wished I wasn’t here so she could find someone else. Idk if I could ever kill myself but if there was an opportunity to endanger myself I might do it. She could move on to someone who could take care of her the way that she deserves. "

We’ve been together for almost 2 years, and it’s been great. Had lots of mini adventures and laughs and so fourth. I am currently finishing off university come April 2019 and thus looking to prepare for full time jobs soon. I’m in tech so there’s tons of opportunity, but I’ve expressed interest in possibly working in the states or Toronto (home). 

Right now, I’m doing an internship at one of the largest tech companies in the world in Vancouver and come summer, will be in New York at an investment bank. I took these internships so I could have a solid resume for when I graduate and thus increase my chances of getting a good full time Position and support my future family. 

For the past month, I’ve been distracted w work, and studying, and going out with other interns, which caused me to put my girlfriend in the backseat. I’d text her throughout the day, but not always and would occasionally call her. Despite this, I feel I could’ve put more effort into setting time aside for her. This made her upset and she ended the relationship about a week and a bit ago. I fly home in 2 weeks for a weekend, which was originally planned so I could visit her, but now it’s just so she could drop off my belongings that she had collected over the past 2 years. 

I really miss her and still love her. I didn’t want us to break up. I told her that I wanted a few days to figure out why I haven’t been putting a lot of effort into the relationship lately, but she insisted that we break up instead of me taking a few days for myself. I know she loved me prior to all this, but she couldn’t take not being a priority. 

How can I or should I try to show her that I still love her and that I’d still want to continue being w her? 

[edit]

Recently I’ve been looking at companies in Toronto and have decided that I will be focusing at finding a job close to home. She does not know this because it was after we broke up and we haven’t spoken since."
7yv986,2,2018-02-20,"Lawmaker who led #MeToo push invited staffer to play spin the bottle, complaint says",Mexicutioner_1,GGdiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/GGdiscussion/comments/7yv986/lawmaker_who_led_metoo_push_invited_staffer_to/,"[California Democratic Assemblywoman and vocal #MeToo advocate Cristina Garcia is under investigation for allegedly groping a former male staffer.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/02/19/lawmaker-who-led-metoo-push-invited-staffer-to-play-spin-the-bottle-complaint-says/?)

California Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, one of the leading voices behind the #MeToo movement, is facing accusations that she sexually harassed staffers — including one who said she fired him after he refused to play a game of spin the bottle with her.

David John Kernick, a former field representative for Garcia, said that the Democratic lawmaker from Bell Gardens, Calif., approached him after a fundraiser at a whiskey bar in 2014 and suggested that they play spin the bottle in her hotel room, according to a complaint filed Saturday with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Kernick said he was written up for insubordination after he questioned the appropriateness of Garcia’s suggestion and was fired two days later.

The complaint also says that Kernick’s time working for Garcia was “extremely stressful.”

“Ms. Garcia was very disparaging to the staff and others, used vulgar language, discussed topics inappropriate for the workplace and showed herself to be very vindictive in nature,” the complaint says.

Kernick’s complaint is the latest allegation of sexual misconduct against Garcia, who has taken a voluntary unpaid leave.

Another former staffer, Daniel Fierro, told The Washington Post’s Derek Hawkins that Garcia approached him after an assembly softball game in 2014, squeezed his buttocks and tried to touch his crotch. He said Garcia was visibly intoxicated.

Fierro, who was 25 at the time, did not report the incident because he worried about the long-term consequences of accusing the powerful lawmaker, who chairs the Legislative Women’s Caucus and the Natural Resources Committee, of misconduct. But in January he told his former boss, state Assemblyman Ian Calderon (D-Whittier), who referred the matter to an assembly panel that is now investigating Garcia.

Politico was the first to report on the allegations earlier this month. In a statement Feb. 9, the day after the Politico story was published, Garcia said she is “certain I did not engage in the behavior I am accused of.”

“However, as I’ve said before, any claims about sexual harassment must be taken seriously, and I believe elected officials should be held to a higher standard of accountability,” Garcia said.

On Wednesday, San Diego attorney Dan Gilleon unveiled new sexual harassment allegations from four anonymous former staffers during a news conference on the steps of the state capitol in Sacramento, the Sacramento Bee reported.

The former staffers alleged that Garcia talked about her sex life in front of employees, drank alcohol at work and told staffers that they were expendable, Gilleon told The Post. One of those anonymous staffers was Kernick. Gilleon said his clients decided to come forward after Fierro went public with his allegations. He also said he is prepared to take legal action against any retaliation against his client.

“They decided to come out not for themselves … but also to let everybody know what it was really like working for her,” Gilleon said. “Had Fierro not come out, my clients would not have talked.”

In a statement posted Wednesday on Facebook, Garcia said that she “will address each of these issues individually after the investigations into these allegations are closed.”

She further wrote: “I will add that in order for legislators to accomplish all we want for the people of our districts and the people of California, we need talented staff who feel empowered to do their work. … I am confident I have consistently treated my staff fairly and respectfully.”

Garcia’s spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday, but Tim Reardon, the legislator’s former chief of staff, told the Bee that Kernick’s accusations were a “complete falsehood.” Reardon said Kernick was fired because he wasn’t doing his job.

“It’s like a malicious, really bizarre alternate universe built on a lot of innuendo and lies solely to destroy the character of Assemblywoman Garcia,” Reardon said of all the allegations against his former boss.

Elected in 2012, Garcia has made women’s issues among her legislative priorities and introduced legislation that would repeal a state tax on feminine health products. Following the outrage after a judge handed down a six-month prison sentence to a college swimmer who had sexually assaulted an unconscious woman on campus, Garcia co-authored a bill that expanded the legal definition of rape to include all forms of nonconsensual sexual assault.

The allegations against Garcia come as she is playing a more prominent role in the #MeToo movement. A few days before Politico reported on Fierro’s allegations, Garcia celebrated the passage of a California law that would penalize a lawmaker who retaliates against a staffer for making a “good faith allegation.” This includes allegations of sexual harassment.

Garcia was also among the dozens of “silence breakers” featured by Time magazine in December. “The Silence Breakers,” or those who spoke out against sexual assault and harassment, are Time’s Person of the Year for 2017.

“I didn’t know I was part of the story. That I was pictured and added to a timeline of this reckoning. It’s an awkwardly humbling experience, but I am proud of this work and the company I am in,” Garcia tweeted in response to her inclusion. She used the hashtags #MeToo and #WeSaidEnough.

Garcia also was a strong critic of male colleagues who had been accused of sexual misconduct.

“I believe the victims who’ve broken their silence on the actions of Mendoza &amp; Dababneh,” Garcia tweeted in December, referring to state Sen. Tony Mendoza and Assemblyman Matt Dababneh. “They have nothing to gain and everything to loose. Let alone it’s multiple victims who’ve come forward. Both members should resign.”

Mendoza (D-Artesia) was accused of making sexual advances toward three interns. Dababneh (D-Encino), who has since resigned, was accused of sexually assaulting a lobbyist."

After I finished with her, she was Sarah.",Spaceninjanate,Rapekink,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/7yvem3/her_name_was_amber_when_we_met_after_i_finished/,"Amber was a girl in one of my college classes (for the few people I've told about A, Amber is *not* A nor is she B. This is a different college from before. That was community college, this one was a state college). Basic is the best way to describe her. Average. She had a few tattoos, nothing huge, just a flower on the wrist and a bird on her collar bone or something like that. She wasn't quiet, but she wasn't particularly outgoing either. 

Amber had a younger sister that was everything that she wasn't. Loud. Slutty. Flashy. Excited. Pierced tits bouncing all over the place, tattoo sleeves and more outlined her body, flirting with everyone and always vying to be the center of attention. Important to know about her, but I didn't meet her till later so that's all you get to know right now.

I hardly paid any attention to Amber herself, until I found her profile. I was on collarspace, fetster, and I think FetLife (is it just me or has FetLife really fucking changed? Site is shit now). I don't care to say which one she was on and I may not even remember correctly anyway. She was into some of the things I was, but that wasn't particularly hard. I was into almost everything. What I remember she was into, the ones that excited me, were blackmail, non-con, body modification and hypnosis. I had taken a psychology class in high school and the teacher had brought in a stage hypnotist, so I knew all I needed to know about that topic. /s

I googled a lot. I spent about a week reading up on hypnosis within bdsm and I learned some neat tricks and had plenty of ideas written down. I created a plan. Blackmail her with her site profile. She had mentioned during one of her class reports that she had an internship with some accounting company or as an accountant or something. So I plan to find out who they are and threaten to expose her there and at school and to her parents. Next, I force her into sex with me, take photos and or video and use those to increase my leverage. Afterwards, before it's all said and done, we have a hypnosis session. I even made a progressive hypnosis ""program"" for Amber, moving her from unwilling participant to willingly making things easier on me, changing her behavior to suit my cravings. I wanted to get her to start checking in with me daily to get an ok on her outfit, sending photos to validate. And to make a habit of being available during my class breaks. I also put down some suggestions for desiring and acquiring particular body piercings and tattoos, trigger words for control over her and to ""make her want it (sex with myself) more"" was the exact wording on my little todo list.

Armed with my plan, I confronted Amber after class one day. I asked who she worked for, as I hadn't figured that out yet. She shared it freely and I gave her one of my biggest smiles and thanked her. I remember that moment and the ones that followed so clearly, like one would remember a first kiss. I showed Amber the screenshot of her profile I had printed out on a sheet of paper. I explained to her that she needed to come with me right then, or I'd expose her to work, family and school. She turned red. Her face flushed with color and her hands clasped in front of her chest. ""Why?""

""Because I'd like to talk to you about it.""

She nodded and away we went to my car. I was trembling with excitement as we got inside the back seat. It was late afternoon and there was snow falling slowly outside. I pulled her coat off as I asked her about her experiences. She had very few and none with hypnosis, body modification or blackmail. She had only experienced rough sex and some bondage, and didn't like the rope, gags or plugs that had been used on her. ""Please don't,"" she said as I was unbuttoned her blouse. ""Do you want your boss to know what you're into?"" She turned red and looked away as I finished unbuttoning and exposed her bra. ""Take it off,"" I demanded, though it make have been more of a whisper. I'm a quiet guy and people tell me I'm soft spoken. But she obeyed regardless, and I was taken away. Very, very perky breasts. I used the same threats to get her fully naked only to come within the first seconds of entering her. I didn't let her leave though. We spent twenty minutes in silence while I fondled her tits till I was ready to go again and that time I lasted a great deal longer. No condoms, I just pulled out and shot on her stomach. To this day, the memory of how her tits bounced as I fucked her on the backseat of my car is one of my favorite memories. It was glorious. After I finished, the windows were very, very fogged, the cold air was soothing to our warm and flushed bodies and she had a light sheen of sweat that made her glow. I felt I was sweating as well, but I doubt I was glowing like her. She tried to sit up, but a hand on her forehead kept her down. I grabbed a little necklace that I had kept in my car for this moment and we both had out first hypnosis session, and then I sent her on her way.

Three times a week I fucked her in my car. It was too good to be true. Socially awkward me was getting laid like the best of them! Except, you know, it was rape. Still, had sex. I learned that missionary type positions usually hurt her (I got a dick that curves downward) unless her legs were way up in the air. Doggy style made her legs quiver in seconds, and I found out that was her having an orgasm as fast as I did the first time we had sex. I missed seeing the tits, but I could feel them really well from this position. I had forgotten to take pictures the first few times. In fact, the second week I was telling her to follow me, she resisted. I lied to her, saying I took photos of us fucking and I'd send them to her work, her teachers and her parents. I made sure to take some that time, with a little point and shoot Coolpix camera (no smartphone, just a Nokia brick at the time). During our hypnosis sessions I was making her repeat things. Making her describe in detail the sex we had, what she liked and making her fixate on it, crave it and tying those feelings to keywords. Some were rare, so I knew only I could set them off. More common words were tied to memories of our sex, designed to make her aroused and desire me while casually talking with others. Eventually I was going over to her place (I still lived with my parents. Yes, I was lame) on days we didn't have class together. We were dating, I suppose. That's when I met her sister, Sarah and when we really began working on body modification. See, as our relationship grew from fucking and hypnosis, she talked to me, as a real person. I learned about her goals in life and who she looked up to. And one person she admired was her sister. She wanted to be outgoing like her. Brave like her. And that this exploration of kink was a part of that. And a dark, dark, low watt lightbulb turned on in my head.

I doubled down. I hypnotized Amber into nipple piercings and a tattoo on her forearm. I hypnotized her into a new wardrobe and new behavior. I used the trigger words to manipulate her into sex more frequently and in increasingly risky places, more public than before. Spring was here and it was time to remind her that I'd ruin her life if she didn't fuck me in the public park, or blow me in the hallway at school. I amassed photos and videos of our activities and routinely jerked off to them on days I couldn't get to her. But most vividly of all my memories of this spring, was how I started to change her name. Slowly, over time, she was becoming Sarah. And during sex, she was admitting it. It was a trigger for her too. Calling her Sarah incited her to strip, it made her *wet.* ""Hello Sarah,"" whispered to her in class caused her to slowly unbutton her jean vest, exposing fishnet and a lacy push-up bra. ""How are you, Sarah?"" Elicited a whimper from her and the reply, ""so fucking horny,"" or sometimes just an embarrassed, ""please,"" with a red face and averted eyes. My favorite was, ""Sarah, come,"" and she would strip all but her fishnet from her body and position herself against me and furiously attempt to grind till she orgasmed. We even went out to clubs or bars and she'd introduce herself to others as Sarah, on the rare occasion we'd talk to anyone.

She never mentioned having an issue with it. But then, when you're hypnotized to want it, how can you tell someone you don't want it? I suspect it leaked into her personal life. A fight with her sister about copying her, or a triggered behavior occurring when it shouldn't have, or perhaps I was boring her. But whatever the reason, she cut all contact with me. A missed outing. A few voicemails, a dozen texts over a week, all unreturned. A single call the next week. A text two weeks after that. And a final goodbye, emailed to the profile online. The profile vanished shortly after that.

I regret the lack of closure. And if I caused harm, I regret that as well. I wonder what went wrong, but mostly... Mostly I enjoy remembering what I did to her."

So far, not much to report on that regard; Laundry is 8 hours of my folding sheets and stocking carts and jamming out to Rick &amp; Morty remixes on the Youtubes . . . And cleaning rooms is exhausting and fast-paced, but far from terrible. 

However, this Sunday, after three days being sold out, I was working on rooms that had all been occupied by idiot [State] teenagers. A lot of the rooms smelled like smoke (and were fucking disgusting, as well, because people don’t know how to drain their tubs, use the trash cans, or flush the toilet in high school, I guess?), but there was no evidence for me to tell the Front Desk to apply that sweet, sweet Smoking Fee. 

Until Room 2xx. Room 2xx had decided to take the illicit activity one stop up from their idiot cohorts, and had smoked marijuana in the room. How do we know it was marijuana? Well, the smell in the room alone was enough to make me nearly gag upon opening the door. There were papers and products in the bathroom trash can. Oh, yeah, and there were *fucking half-smoked blunts in the fucking room that were still fucking hot.* Awesome. So, I call my Inspectress, confirm the substance and charges, take pictures and email them around, call my girl Minnie at the Front Desk and tell her to DO THE THING, and then clean the room and air it out, hoping we don’t have to lose a double-suite for more than a day or two before the weed-smell dissipates. 

Cue my getting called to the Front Desk to help ‘deal with a situation.’ Minnie went ahead and charged for the smoking fee, and the two imbeciles and their coach noticed the charges (Coach’s CC for incidentals, room was DB to the institution from whence they came), and came to chew out the staff.

**Idiot Coach:** Yeaaaaaah, I can’t help but notice you charged us for the room, when [School] is taking care of it. My credit card was just for insurance?

**Minnie:** Sir, I apologize for the confusion, but the charges on your credit card were actually for violating our Non-Smoking Policy. We found cannabis in the room, and have charged the $250.00 fee that you consented to when you signed your registration card at check-in. 

**Idiot Kids:** We didn’t smoke in the room!

**Idiot Coach:** Ma’am, with all due respect, my boys do not smoke weed. And we told them not to smoke in the rooms prior to arriving. 

**Minnie:** Unfortunately, sir, we have evidence contrary to that *(gestures to me.)*

**Me:** Hello, Idiot Coach. My name is Graysonation; I’m the MOD, and also the Housekeeper who cleaned your room. We found papers and marijuana in Room 2xx, along with clearly-smoked blunts on the desk. I have photos. 

**Idiots (Collectively):** That’s not weed / We don’t smoke pot! / You can’t prove it was us / There’s no proof that’s our room!

**Me:** Are you implying that there were more unauthorized Guests in your room, breaking the agreement that you would only have 2 Idiot Kids in each room?

**Idiot Coach:** Where’s your manager?

**Me:** I am the MOD, sir. 

**Idiot Coach:** No, I mean *your* manager. Where is your General Manager?

**Me:** He’s off today, sir. 

**Idiot Coach:** What the FUCK kinda place doesn’t have a manager on weekends?!?

*(I actually agree with this idiot, because it fucking pisses me off that our entire staff is collectively not allowed to request weekends off because of how busy we get (and we have to get weeks’ advance notice before scoring a Saturday or Sunday not on the clock), but ALL of the managers take the weekends off, even our on-call GSM. Shit is annoying, like how the fuck do you wanna inspire me to work weekends if you, getting paid more money and supposedly more dedicated, point-blank refuse to do it?)*

**Me:** I am sorry, sir, you may have is card. Our GM will be in in the morning. 

**Idiot Coach:** Ohno, we’re doing this NOW. *(Proceeds to send an email to the address listed to the GSM on file, likely bitching me out all the while)*

Now, our GSM has his work email linked to his phone, so he got the email immediately, and came into the hotel not twenty minutes later. I gave him a rundown of the situation.

**GSM:** Well, that is an unfortunate situation. 

**Idiot Coach:** This is a scam! I’m going to tear you to pieces online. *(Literally holds his fucking phone out so we can see he’s on TripAdvisor already roasting us for ‘stealing’ from him).*

**GSM:** Well, wait a moment, sir, there’s no reason we can’t work this out! *(Pulls me aside)* Graysonation, I’m going to remove the Smoking Charges from their room and reverse the bill. 

**Me:** WTF

**GSM:** Well, you already cleaned the room, and he’s right, there’s no pictures that clearly distinctly it as Room 2xx on your phone. And we can’t have him leaving bad reviews, not when [School] booked so many rooms with us! *(Turns back to Guest)*

So, I’m fucking standing there with the bag of weed in my smock-pocket, getting grinned at by these three POSs as they realize that they *fucking got away with it.* Just by threatening us with a Tripadvisor, they got to not only break our policy, but the law. AND THE GSM APOLOGIZED TO THEM FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. 

The kicker? [School] stays with us once a year for a tournament, rents eight rooms of our 120, and only pays $83.00 nightly, plus tax-exemptions.

This place gives me IBS sometimes. 

*EDIT: They posted the reviews anyway. Good job, guys.*"
7yw00m,1,2018-02-20,[22/M] my girlfriends[19/F] family send me angry messages insulting me and demanding that we break up. Did i do the right thing?,ConfusedAsFuck12,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7yw00m/22m_my_girlfriends19f_family_send_me_angry/,"So first let me say that English is not my first language so this might be a little bit messy.
I come from Bulgaria and right currently live in Italy about a year ago i met my (ex)-girlfriend in school everything was going as one might immagine amazing. In 2017 we both finished school and started searching for internship in order to get our carriers going we both worked at the same place for a month but after that i managed to get an internship as a developer for a very big firm and i was pretty excited . 
This is where the relationship starts going downhill ,the place where we both worked was not a good place but it was something after i left she completely hated working there she was always negative about here job ,her colleagues were treating her pretty shitty i told her to just leave as i was sure she would find something better but she decided to continue so she could help at her house. This was going on for about a month and a half she became more and more shitty with me in order to balance her unhappines at work until one day i have had enough and decided to treat her like an adult sat her down and told her that she need to quit or she would ruin her life by staying she started to cry talked to her family(i should specify that me and her family were on very good term while i we were studying i would be there every sunday for lunch after i started working sunday was my only day where i could stay at home i was working 2 jobs and training 5/6 time a week and still finding time for her) withing the end of the week she quit her job and after 2 week of searching and doing interviews she managed to find another job. At this point i have become a little bit distant because of all of the negativity i tried to help her while keeping my emotions i should preface that i wasn't cheating or thinking of cheating normally im a very cold person even with my friends and feeling like she was not there for me made me colder. I was still happy with the relationship but needed time in order to go back to normal, until one monday while i was at work her mother texts me without my girlfriend knowledge saying how much she values her family how i disrespected(because i was staying home on sundays instead of eating lunch with them) them how i was a piece of shit,that im useless and that i should break up with her. My response was ""i was taught not to say anything when i don't have anything good to say"" i know not the best response but whatever. That is where her mother and now her father lost it started insulting me even more talking about my family how my father left us because of me how my mother left me and my siblings because of me,how they never liked me because im not italian, how my future children will be bastards just like me her father said that he would come to my house and beat me up come to my gym and beat me up(my gym is a mixed martial arts gym) it didn't scare me mostly because of my background but i was pissed off because i live with my brother and sister and didn't want to scare them , i kept my cool and tried to defuse the situation but it did not work. He never really tried to do anything and i didn't either because of my feelings for my girlfriend. My girlfriend sees them almost as like gods so when she showed me the messages they send her i was not suprised that they continued to insult me and threaten me and she never really defended me but i was still very much hurt. I tried to act normal with her for about a month but she was putting her family before me  when she was my everything coming before ""family"",friends gym buddies etc. and that did bother me a lot, i decided that there is no reason for me to be somebodies second pick even if that means being alone i broke up with her even if it was not easy.
After two months i feel i little bit better still feel lonely sometimes i forgave her parents about a month after the break up i did not speak with them i mostly forgave them because i needed to be at peace with myself and that seemed like the only way. She is a complete mess and constantly tries to convince me to get back together but i just can't get over what happened and how she behaved her parents said that they want to talk with me but i just can speak to people that said all of those things about me and my ""family"" . I still grieve over the relationship and wonder if i did the right thing. Am i wrong for choosing my long term happiness over a relationship that would have surely ended in the future(we spoke about the future a few times and we did not see eye to eye on any of the important things)? She is trying to promise me that she would change that everything is going to be how i want (except the important things) and of course i am tempted. Should i try again ? Am i completely wrong?

Thank you for reading ,again i'm sorry about my English and that everything might seem very chaotic but i still feel very emotional writing this.

TL;DR My girlfriends family decided to insult me about everything in my life and tell me how im useless,how i am bulgarian so im inferior etc and demanded that we break up. Eventually we broke up not because of them and now i dont know if i did the right thing breaking up with her because of the lack of future?

7ywyty,2,2018-02-20,Additional fields/skills,IceStrik3,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/7ywyty/additional_fieldsskills/,"Hi all!

I'm a 3rd year Chemical Engineering student, about to take on the last courses of my studies as a whole. After that I will be going abroad to do a minor in Mechanical Engineering after which I will be doing a graduation internship with an affiliation to the automotive industries. My passion has always been with Thermodynamics, fluids and dynamics in general so I was wondering if there are any suggestions regarding extra courses/skills which would strengthen my resumé and stand out.

I have quite some time on my hands the upcoming weeks and was thinking about learning to program. Some of my friends advised me to first learn Python and look forward from there. Are there particular languages in programming which are more beneficial for Chemical Engineers/Mechanical Engineers? 
It does not have to be fully focused towards either one of those, I really like the Chemical Engineer inside of me, however I would love to chase my ambition of working in the automotive industries as well..

Any suggestion(s) is/are welcome!

I just passed FM last weekend and I was wondering if it would be possible to find an actuary internship this summer.

I am on the executive board of one of my clubs as well as a tour guide that works for the admissions office. Additionally, I have some basic coding experience with Java, SQL, and R.

This semester two roommates moved out. One moved out because she has an internship for her major in a different state. The other one who moved out...well that's who this is about.

She's always been pretty reckless. We're talking goes out and gets belligerent to the point that many of us roommates have had to find her/pick her up/help her. She's done this so many times -- it's honestly surprising that at this point, she still doesn't know her limits. A group of 30 including myself and her went to Vegas last fall. We were all (rightfully) worried about her. Long story short, she ruins a night out for the whole group, makes multiple people upset/cry and then blames it on everyone else. No apologies whatsoever, tried to act like nothing happened the morning after. She told me to ""f*** off, none of you are my friends"" and blocked me after I called her out for what she'd done. Rest of the semester, she doesn't ever come to the house (her family lives in town). Slowly starts taking some of her things out of the house, then tells us she's moving out because she has a job in a nearby town, about 15-20 min drive, and doesn't want to commute from our house (lol). She still pays her rent because she couldn't find a subleaser. Annoying, but at least she's gone.

But now, one of my other roommates recently got a puppy. Dogs aren't allowed on our lease, but she asked all of us living in the house if we'd be okay with it. We agreed, and with 4 months left living in the house, we figure it'll be okay. Worst case, landlord finds out and fines her and the dog goes to live with her parents. Well, turns out said bad roommate from above texts her saying she's going to call the landlord, claiming she doesn't want to dog chewing up her things (some of her furniture is still in the house, she never bothered to take it). She also says she's ""put up with boyfriends illegally living here but a puppy is ridiculous"". (Really quick, this is hilarious. My boyfriend stays over most nights of the week, he comes over after he gets off work around 10 pm, leaves in the morning when I leave. He is never at the house when I'm not and the same for all my other roommates, who also have boyfriends that stay over. Not sure how that's considered ""illegally"" living in our house, but lol) Then she says she's going to start coming over on the weekends and blocked my roommate's number.

ANYWAYS, this was mostly a venting session, but also just utter disbelief someone could be so mean spirited. I didn't even go into what a bad roommate she was in general to live with (messes everywhere, everything needed to be her way, always complaining, etc). I guess some people just can't stand others to be happy when they're not.

UPDATE: My roommate with the dog, who is in charge of collecting rent, just told us bad roommate denied her venmo request for this months rent. The bitterness continues!"
7yxzys,11,2018-02-20,"[ALL] If I could make changes to BTS, this is how the story would go.",JiffyFrose,lifeisstrange,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7yxzys/all_if_i_could_make_changes_to_bts_this_is_how/,"So, as much as I loved the prequel, there were things that I wished they would have done differently. I felt that the first episode was great at setting everything up, but then it just fell apart after Episode 2. And Episode 3 was a mess. I feel like there should have been 4 episodes. And they should not have been as rushed. If I was in charge of the prequel, this is what I think would have made it better.

AWAKE: Leave as is for the most part. The only thing I would change was the fact that James was kissing Rachel’s birth mother. I would make it someone else. Like a secretary or an intern. I’m going to name her Nichole Banks.

BRAVE NEW WORLD: I would leave the majority of this episode the way it is. I would change the ending. At the dinner with Rachel’s family, the truth comes out about James cheating on Rose with Nichole. James and Rose get into a screaming match, and this really upsets Rachel. Rachel asks Chloe to help her pack the rest of her stuff and then they go over to Chloe’s house to spend the night.

HEAR ME CALL: Yep! I changed the third episode name. The scene starts on Saturday night. The two girls sneak into Chloe’s room and see that David completely ransacked her room. Chloe freaks out and decides she’s going to confront David tomorrow because it’s so late. Rachel and Chloe are talking about how they are struggling with their parents. Rachel’s dad cheated on her mom. And Chloe’s mom is dating David. They decide to run away and go to sleep. 

They wake up and they talk about how last night was crazy, and how they can’t wait to run away. Rachel and Chloe decide to take turns taking showers. Rachel goes first and then Chloe goes last. Chloe dyes a section of her hair blue, and they then go downstairs and eat breakfast. On the way downstairs, they see David and Joyce dancing with each other. Rachel makes a comment about how that is adorable and Chloe is just grossed out that David is dancing with her mom. 

They’re eating and that is when David talks about how Joyce and him were talking about giving Chloe more trust. At this point, Chloe can call out David for ransacking her room. If Chloe decides not to call David out, Rachel will call him out on it. If Chloe calls him out, David will be civil and apologize. If Rachel calls him out on it, it will turn into a huge fight. This will make Chloe go into backtalk mode. If Chloe wins, David gives a lame apology. If David wins, Chloe gives a snarky apology (“Whatever, I’m sorry. Cool?”)

At this point, Chloe and Rachel get their stuff and head to the junkyard. Chloe fixes up the truck. Before they head out, they decide to go to the hospital and visit Drew/Mikey. The hospital scene is pretty much the same as it was in the game. Chloe and Rachel go back into the lobby and run into Eliot. Chloe says goodbye to Eliot and that’s when Eliot confronts her and tells her that running away is a really bad idea. She goes into backtalk mode and Chloe will throw in her remarks and at some points Rachel will back Chloe up with hers. No matter what the outcome of the backtalk, the girls decide to run away. 

So, Rachel asks if Chloe wants to run away to Los Angeles because it’s closer. Chloe can either agree or she can ask to go to Long Beach instead. So, on their way to LA or LB, they decide to pick up supplies. So, they go to a store (think Target or Walmart except it’s called something different). And Chloe is to get food, and Rachel is to get other supplies. They then go to a motel (note: very shady motel) and check in a room (note: Chloe uses her fake id) and pays for the room in advance. 

It’s getting late, and they decide to crack into their food stash and eat dinner. Afterwards, they talk about how excited they are to be running away and starting a life together in LA or LB (dependent on which one you pick). They then fall asleep.

HELL IS EMPTY: Okay. So, Chloe has the same nightmare of being in the play with her dad. She wakes up in a cold sweat and is breathing deeply. She goes to go to the restroom, and notices that the envelope where they put the money is not where she put it last night. So, Chloe immediately starts freaking out and digging through everything. Rachel wakes up and asks Chloe what she is doing.

“The money is gone! The money is gone!” Chloe exclaims and she is looking through all their bags. Rachel immediately gets up and helps Chloe. They look in every corner. Every bag. The bathroom. In their beds. Under the beds. Behind the TV. The money is gone. That’s when they realized that they were robbed in the middle of the night. 

The girls are freaking out and are wondering what to do. Chloe tells Rachel that they need to go back to Arcadia Bay. Rachel gets pissed and this triggers a backtalk challenge. If Chloe wins, Rachel will pack without complaint. If Rachel wins, she’ll come up with a plan to get back on track by getting jobs to make enough money to continue going to LA. That’s when Chloe has to burst her bubble and tell her that they need their SS cards and birth certificates. And this is when Rachel starts to completely lose her shit. At this point, they pack up all their stuff and get back into the car and go to Arcadia Bay. 

At one point, Chloe starts feeling a bit drowsy. Rachel offers to drive. And Chloe goes to sleep.
Chloe wakes up in a dream, and she is in the motel room with her dad. William invites her to sit down next to him, and he puts his arm around her. 

He looks at Chloe and says, “It looks like your plans fell through.”

“Yeah, they did. I wish Max was here. She would at least have thought of to get everything before we ran away.”

“Sweetheart, Max wouldn’t have let you run away in the first place.”

“Why couldn’t everything be the same? Why did you have to die? Why did Max abandon me? What did I do to deserve this?”

“Chloe, nothing you did or didn’t do caused any of this to happen. The world can be a cruel place. Life isn’t fair. Bad things can happen to good people. There’s something you can count on. I love you. Your mother loves you.""

“If Mom loves me, then why is she with David?”

“Just because she’s with David doesn’t mean she doesn’t love you. She does. You know she does. She always sees the good in people. She’s doing her best. She’s just struggling to cope with my death. You’re struggling with it too. I wish I could do more. But, I’m dead.”

“I know. Dad. I know.” And then, Chloe wakes up.
They are about an hour and a half away from Arcadia Bay. They see a beautiful meadow on the side of the road, and they decide to stop and eat lunch. They talk about how they are disappointed, but how they also need to plan this for the future, and just to grin and bear it for now. Then Rachel says, “One day Chloe, don’t be surprised if I just leave one day.”

“You’re not leaving me alone, are you?” Chloe replies.

“Of course not! You’re coming with me!”

They finish up and head to Arcadia Bay. They decide the first place they should go is to American Rust. So, they go and hang out for a bit, and work on fixing the place up a bit more. Then who should come but Frank and Damon. Damon demands his money. This is when Chloe tells him that the money was stolen from them. And that they don’t know who did it. Damon goes to punch Chloe in the face, and Rachel takes a wood plank and hits Damon upside the head before he can. Before Rachel has a chance to react, Damon pulls out his knife and stabs Rachel in the arm.

Chloe immediately grabs Rachel and heads straight to the hospital. She is taken back into surgery. Chloe waits a bit, and Rose and James come to the hospital. Soon afterwards, David and Joyce come to the hospital. Joyce immediately runs to Chloe and hugs her and tells her how much she worried about her. And then proceeds to tell her to never pull this kind of shit again. David gives a sincere apology and promises to work on his relationship with Chloe. 

James and Rose come back into the waiting room and say that Rachel made it through surgery. If it wasn’t for Chloe bringing Rachel in when she did, she might not have made it. And that he owes her so much for saving Rachel’s life.

At this moment, Nichole runs through the door and hugs James. And lets him know that she came as soon as she found out. James is politely trying to tell Nichole to leave. At this point, Rose is on the verge of tears. Joyce looks like she wants to rip his head off. But David steps in and tells Joyce to stay with Rose. Joyce and Rose sit down and talk. David persuades Nichole to leave and that it’s not appropriate for her to be here. He then has a talk to James about Rose and Nichole and how it’s not honorable to cheat on the love of your life like that. 

Chloe can eavesdrop on both couples. Rose is talking to Joyce about how Rose’s sex drive has plummeted since she started going into menopause. That it has been extremely painful for her to have sex. And that she is trying everything she can to fix it. She said the problem started a few months after they moved to Arcadia Bay. And that she thought James was supportive. She begins to cry and Joyce comforts her and tells her that she deserves better. Chloe is grossed out and makes a mental note that she shouldn’t listen in anymore.
She then has the option to eavesdrop on David and James. James is very reluctant to talk to David about why he’s cheating. That he made his decision and that he was no longer in love with Rose, and he was going to make her move out during the summer.

Chloe is furious but decides to stay out of it. That’s when they find out that Rachel is able to take visitors and so her family goes back there. They invite Chloe to come in with them. Rachel sees Chloe, and notices that something is wrong. She asks everyone but Chloe to leave. Chloe has the option to decide whether or not to tell Rachel what she overheard (or, if she didn’t eavesdrop, what she saw in the waiting room) in the waiting room or to not say anything.  If you tell her, her relationship with her dad becomes very strained and she ends up moving into the dorms the next semester. If you don’t tell her, then everything seems okay. And then we have the friend montage. That should be kept the same.

And that is the end of it. Tell me what you think. Does it sound great? Does it sound like shit? Let me know 😊

7yy4gf,9878,2018-02-20,You give me a poor raise and bonus i take away annual 300K dollars of business from you,TheflyingLag,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/7yy4gf/you_give_me_a_poor_raise_and_bonus_i_take_away/,"I was lurking for sometimes and here I am ready to tell my pro-revenge story.

To put some context on the story, I was working at a multi-national firm, I did my final internship post-masters degree there and they liked me so they offered me a job as a junior consultant. Fresh from school I couldn’t be happier. As I was naïve, I signed the contract without worrying about the little details, one of the clause was that the leave notice is set to be 3 month, I raised the issue and they said, it's not a big deal, it was just for compliance purposes to the parent firm, fair enough, I started working.

In my second month, a colleague screwed up big time, he did something by mistake jeopardizing one of our biggest accounts, and one of the biggest banks worldwide, easily could have made it to the news headlines. They fired the guy and offered me to work on the account (at the time I had not enough experience to handle working on a team that manages one of our biggest clients) but accepted the offer anyway.

I start working with the team located in a different country to work on the international bank which has branch practically everywhere, so there were a lot of interactions with associates all over the world.

They were very happy with my work and I even had my own team to work for me when I have to multi-account. The manager was very happy with me because I exceeded expectation and I bring more work fees to the firm. 

While I was waiting for a big raise and bonus in the yearly evaluation, the manager said that I did nothing special. I swallowed my anger and continue to work flawlessly the same as the first year but with a big fuck you attitude. They even gave me other accounts and a team to manage and because I’m a petty person I wasn’t going to let this slide that easily.

The second-year evaluation, because of my fuck you attitude, they tried to dig dirt on me so they can punish me, they found nothing, the client was very happy with my work. The manager and HR Director (HRD) went an extra mile to dig dirt on me from my team, they found nothing, my academic background gave me a lot of tools to work with to manage. I was a good team leader, I trained them well, and i took responsibility for every decision made.

On the yearly evaluation, the Managing Partner (MP) and HRD said that I’m very competent and I did a flawless job but i wasn’t motivated enough to climb to ladder even further this year, the SOB gave me the poorest raise and bonus even though they have a set of “objective” rules for that and the defining factor is the client appreciation which was excellent for me. 

The revenge part : 

It was like the stars were aligning for me, In that big bank account, I was the only remaining from the team, and because it requires a lot of international coordination, not everyone could keep tab on everything and there was an account history to keep an eye on, we worked with a lot of high profile associates around the world and they are pretty much zero mistake tolerance. As I was the remaining member of the old team, the account associate requested me to come visit him in another country and expressed to my manager how much he relies on me on the upcoming season. Here comes the fun part.

The hot season for work starts from January until late April, with 3-month notice they hadn’t much to worry about, so that’s what they thought! 

Late December I resigned and demanded to perform only one month notice. I know their drill they ll say they have to consult the MP and they will get back to me with response as soon as possible but in the meantime I should train someone to replace me, at the end of the month and once a replacement is trained, they will say he said no you should stay 3 months or pay up the 2 months (They did this to everyone before me).

As I had one year to plan my revenge I set aside my revenge money, to take away their leverage, I waited a week and went back to see the HRD, she said she’s waiting still for the MP’s Okay.
I went back to my office and I canceled my 5 days paid vacation for the end of December. I had the following conversation by mail:

Manager: TheflyingLag, you can’t cancel your paid vacation as there isn’t much work to do at that time, YOU WILL TAKE PAID VACATION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
ME: I won’t take it, I’m not like everyone else, I’m on resignation notice
Manager: Doesn’t matter you’ll take it nevertheless
ME: As stated by labor laws, the employee on resignation notice can’t take paid vacation otherwise it will extend their notice by the said vacation unless there is an agreement between the two parties on it. WHICH ON OUR CASE IS NOT.

With nothing left to say, she forwarded the mail chain to de HRD and she sent me a mail to come discuss this matter with her.
ME: I’m being professional I demanded my notice reduced and a person to train, 1 weeks passed and no replacement and I’m still waiting for your feedback.

HRD: We didn’t find the right person to replace you and we are still looking.
ME: I don’t care that much, you said in the evaluation I did nothing special and I haven’t what it takes you climb.
HRD: Noticed my evil look, sure it was brutal how we treated you. But you can’t leave you ll stay 3 months and we have a plenty of time to find someone to replace you and you will train him.
ME: That’s not going to happen, at the end of the month I’m leaving and you can’t stop me.
HRD: in this case, you pay 2-month salary which a lot.
ME: no problem! I was prepared for that eventuality, my check is ready.
She panicked and she called the manager and the Operations Director (OD) to the meeting, 
Them: You can’t leave, even with paying we have to accept which won’t happen.
ME: as stated by law, section X paragraph Y, I can in fact leave and I don’t need your approval.

The OD is a poker champion and he was in the meeting just to call my bluffs.
I leaned on the meeting table to give him enough physical reading of my intention so he can see that I'm not bluffing, I said that, I’m leaving at the end the month you have two options, Option 1: I pay you the 2 months but I will train nobody or option 2: I’ll train somebody to replace me but I won’t pay you, you choose wisely.

HRD: This is blackmail.
ME: You called it whatever you want, that’s my offer, take it or leave it, you have less than three weeks to decide.
OD: How we can make sure you will train him well?
ME: You don’t! if you want the second option, I need a written agreement before I start the training.

In the rush they agree to give up the 2-months pay in exchange of training someone, they find a junior without any experience to fill for me, I gave her a lousy training, and after 2 months the client wasn’t happy, he dropped our firm. 

To have some perspective, on the bank account  I alone scored 2000 hours with hourly fees of 200 dollars.  They basically give up over 300K annually from that account because they thought it was wise to screw a junior staff on his raise and bonus for two years.

Easy on my English, it's my third language

TLDR: Manager gave me a poor bonus and raise for two years even though I did an outstanding job, I make one of the biggest clients dropped them.

Edit : alienating to aligning

Edit 2: for the poor girl I 'trained', she was understanding, i did apologize to her in advance, and i suggested to her to take the account on the condition that she shouldn't take the blame for any potential downfall. According to a friend still working there she didn't take any blame. 

Edit 3 : I didn't need their reference, i had already an offer somewhere else and i explained to them that my current employers are dicks and they will try to pull shitty moves on me, i had nothing to worry. For future references, it's not that common in my country, they are required by law to give me a formal paper citing the period i worked there and the title i had, potential employers generally demand that paper to prove that you work there and they will not contact them for anything. 

Edit 4: To add a layer to the reference matter, they are known in the marketplace for being dicks, a colleague and a friend of mine resigned 2 months before me to go work for a branch of a Multi-national IT company, they pulled the same shit on here, but once she left, the CFO of that branch called de HRD to tell her that they got my friend, just to piss her off even more. It turned out the HRD was in that branch before and she burned every bridge there while quitting. 

Edit 5 : to those whom are saying i'm an entitled dick, yes i am! if you offered me (a junior) an account and you stressed to me how it's sensitive and it takes a lot of stress resisting with little to no safety net (A senior got fired for it) and it will be rewarding in the yearly evaluation, i expect to you to deliver!. I didn't quit the first year because i needed that 2 year threshold to have good offer elsewhere.

7yydv7,1,2018-02-20,A saga of sorts,shmirstie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7yydv7/a_saga_of_sorts/,"Hi y’all,

I feel the need to outline my whole relationship and I’m going to try and be as concise and objective as possible but this may be a bit long. I could really really use the advice so thank you in advance.

I am 27f he is 27m and we started dating last March, so almost a year. We met online and clicked but it started as a casual hookup and progressed within a month to a real relationship. From the first time we talked on the phone I was wary. His jokes were off color for me and his personality style wasn’t what I was into. But I did love how smart and funny he was and he was very respectful aside from occasional negging which has since gone away, not without some conflict about it. 

Having done my share of dating people way not up to my standards, I did what I normally do, we hooked up once and then when we disagreed about something and a conflict started a week later, I told him it wouldn’t work out. He called me and I changed my mind, though I remained hesitant for the next 7-9 months.

We spent two months really just hooking up, though we were “official”. We never went on dates, which wasn’t really my thing or his at the time, though I could spend some time conjecturing about what that does to the start of a relationship. I won’t. He meshed with my friends, though, and we enjoyed some nice times together.

That was the spring semester of college though and I went away that summer to an internship across the country. While I was away, we broke up in very dramatic fashions several times and while we were separated, he slept with some other people, tried to get my friend to sleep with him after a concert I hooked them up with, and spent the better part of the summer trying to convince me there was something wrong with me and that was why we didn’t get along. I had very detailed expectations from a relationship and when he didn’t meet them I let him know directly. He always took this terribly. I know most wouldn’t take it well but he didn’t understand at all and so it looked to him like insanity because it’s very opposite of his personality to want to impose standards on someone else that way. To me, his defensiveness made him look dense. 

We made it through the summer and then in the fall semester, it kept up, though things were progressing. We were both growing to understand each other in a way both of us have benefitted from. He has become more conscientious and I less judgmental. We’ve learned to appreciate each other and sometimes wonder if we’re soulmates in a way. But we have still broken up every month and I have no idea why we’re in this cycle other than that growth is hard and we’ve been forcing each other to move forward and grow. 

But we still have big issues. His sex drive is so much that it feels a bit like that’s the number one thing he appreciates and that if I don’t want to have sex he won’t want to stay together. I also worry that he’ll cheat though he hasn’t ever. We don’t have much in common and though he listens well, he doesn’t share much so conversations feel very one sided for me. He gives advice here and there but I don’t really enjoy the conversation much compared to some of my really good friends. I enjoy his personality more than theirs though. He is patient, nonjudgmental, kind, and is good at everything he does. He hasn’t applied to nursing school yet though he’s been saying he would for a year so his lack of ambition and follow through career wise worry me. 

I love him for who he is for the first time, but I also wonder and maybe believe he’s not for me. He’s also respectful of my wishes and of me fully for the first time too. We’ve really formed an amazing friendship under all of the turbulence and we are each other’s best friends. The trouble is that we’ve gone back and forth so many times it’s hard to say.  We’ve both had some hang ups and issues personally that we’ve come a long way in dealing with while we’ve been together so I wonder if we’d met now if it would be such a difficult question to answer. I’m trying to live a healthier life now and I’m looking forward to being in a healthy relationship but it seems like this isn’t the one. 

I don’t even tell my friends and family when we’re together. And I’m dreading telling my therapist that we’re talking again. I know she’s not going to like it. I want to believe that a relationship could survive scrutiny if it’s meant to be, and I love him to pieces, but it’s not the life I want, I don’t think.

So questions:
How do I decide for sure and remain certain of what I want?
How do I stay broken up if that’s what we do?
How do we stay together if that’s what I decide to do?

Sorry this is rambling but thank you for reading!!

7yyob3,1,2018-02-20,Antwoorden op vragen van het lid Kröger over de berichten in de media “GenX aangetroffen in afvalwater ATM Moerdijk” en “Bron GenX op zuivering Bath gevonden”,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/7yyob3/antwoorden_op_vragen_van_het_lid_kröger_over_de/,"^(Geachte voorzitter,  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 29 januari 2018 heeft het lid Kröger &amp;#40;GroenLinks&amp;#41; aan mij en aan de staatssecretaris van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat schriftelijke vragen gesteld over de berichten in de media “GenX aangetroffen in afvalwater ATM Moerdijk” en “Bron GenX op zuivering Bath gevonden”. Hierbij bied ik u de antwoorden op deze vragen aan, mede namens de staatssecretaris.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met de berichten “Bron GenX op zuivering Bath gevonden”1  en “GenX aangetroffen in afvalwater ATM Moerdijk, vervuiling lijkt mee te vallen” 2?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer heeft Afvalstoffen Terminal Moerdijk &amp;#40;ATM&amp;#41; gemeld bij het bevoegd gezag en waterschap Brabantse Delta dat het GenX in zijn afvalwater had gevonden? Was daarbij sprake van een vermoeden of had ATM zelf metingen verricht in zijn afvalwater?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
In welke concentraties is GenX aangetroffen in het afvalwater van ATM?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden 2 en 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is belangrijk om te benadrukken dat de constateerde hoeveelheden GenX zeer klein zijn en dat er in geen geval een risico is geweest voor het drinkwater of de omgeving. Uit een reguliere monitoring van Rijkswaterstaat bleek dat het effluent van de RWZI Bath concentraties GenX-stoffen bevatte. Om dit te verifiëren zijn op 23 en 29 december 2017 extra monsters genomen door waterschap Brabantse Delta. Op 9 januari 2018 volgde de uitslag waarmee kon worden geconcludeerd dat er met zekerheid GenX-stoffen in het effluent van de RWZI Bath aanwezig zijn &amp;#40;13-110 nanogram/liter &amp;#40;ng/l&amp;#41;&amp;#41;. Ik heb u hierover bij brief van 16 januari 2018 geïnformeerd &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 28 089, nr. 56&amp;#41;. Hierna is door het Waterschap Brabantse Delta een brononderzoek gestart.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In dit onderzoek zijn enkele mogelijke bronnen bemonsterd, waaronder de afvalwaterstroom van ATM. De uitslag hiervan kwam op 19 januari 2018 beschikbaar, er werd een verhoogde concentratie GenX-stoffen aangetroffen &amp;#40;500-900 ng/l&amp;#41;. Met een tweede meetronde waarvan de resultaten op 26 januari beschikbaar kwamen, kon de eerdere meting bevestigd worden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
ATM heeft naar aanleiding van de berichtgevingen op 18 januari op de website van waterschap Brabantse Delta en Omroep Brabant contact opgenomen met het waterschap en heeft hierbij aangegeven vooralsnog geen inzicht te hebben in de aanwezigheid van GenX in haar effluent, maar dat zij graag nader onderzoek willen doen naar het eventueel voorkomen van GenX in haar effluent.  
&amp;nbsp;    
ATM heeft op 19 januari het besluit genomen om geen afvalwater van Chemours meer te accepteren en in samenwerking met de omgevingsdienst een intern onderzoek te starten naar de herkomst van de geconstateerde concentraties.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Loost ATM momenteel nog afvalwater op de persleiding van het riool? Zo ja, bent u bereid om samen met het bevoegd gezag en het waterschap ATM te verbieden om afvalwater te lozen, totdat duidelijk is hoe het GenX-afval in het afvalwater terecht is gekomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
ATM heeft een Wabo-vergunning van het bevoegd gezag, de provincie Noord-Brabant. Op basis van deze vergunning mag het bedrijf afvalwater lozen op de persriolering richting RWZI Bath. Het bevoegd gezag ziet geen aanleiding om ATM te verbieden gebruik te maken van deze vergunning. Dit mede omdat ATM al zelfstandig heeft besloten geen afvalwater meer te accepteren van Chemours, alle medewerking heeft toegezegd en een intern onderzoek heeft gestart.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wordt er nader onderzoek gedaan of GenX ook is verspreid door de lucht? Zo nee, waarom niet? Wordt er daarnaast ook bodemonderzoek gedaan naar GenX-vervuiling in de omgeving van ATM? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
In opdracht van de gemeente Dordrecht wordt al onderzoek gedaan naar verspreiding van GenX en perfluoroctaanzuur &amp;#40;PFOA&amp;#41; via lucht naar de bodem, rond het bedrijf Chemours in Dordrecht. De resultaten daarvan komen over enkele weken beschikbaar en kunnen een indicatie geven of verder onderzoek bij andere mogelijke bronnen, zoals ATM, zinvol is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke bestuursrechtelijke en strafrechtelijke sancties zijn er mogelijk als zou blijken dat ATM wel degelijk wist dat het GenX-afval verwerkte?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien er een overtredingen wordt geconstateerd dan heeft het bevoegd gezag verschillende bestuursrechtelijke sanctiemogelijkheden. Naar opgave van het bevoegd gezag, de provincie Noord-Brabant, valt het verwerken van afvalwater waarin gevaarlijke stoffen zoals GenX aanwezig zijn binnen de vergunning van het bedrijf. Daarom is het inzetten van deze sanctiemogelijkheden niet aan de orde.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze zijn de medewerkers van ATM geïnformeerd over deze GenX-vervuiling? Kan worden uitgesloten dat medewerkers van ATM hebben blootgestaan aan GenX? Zo nee, kan de Inspectie SZW in gesprek treden met ATM over het afnemen van bloedtesten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Conform de Arbowet is het aan de werkgever om medewerkers voorlichting te geven over de risico’s, een inschatting te maken of medewerkers aan gevaarlijke stoffen zijn blootgesteld en of er aanvullende maatregelen ter bescherming van medewerkers nodig zijn. Werknemers kunnen uiteraard ook bij hun werkgever om duidelijkheid vragen over de door hen gelopen risico’s voor hun gezondheid. Daarvoor kan een beroep worden gedaan op externe deskundigen. Het is aan de werkgever om in overleg met de werknemers en op basis van een maatwerkadvies van deskundigen te bepalen of bloedtesten een toegevoegde waarde hebben in de bescherming van de gezondheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
ATM is volgens eigen opgave per direct gestopt met acceptatie van afvalstromen van Chemours. Bij de Inspectie SZW en het bevoegd gezag &amp;#40;provincie Noord-Brabant&amp;#41; is geen informatie over de wijze waarop medewerkers door de werkgever zijn geïnformeerd. De Inspectie SZW, die op dit dossier nauw samenwerkt met de Provincie Noord-Brabant als Wabo bevoegd gezag, ziet op dit moment geen aanleiding in gesprek te treden met de werkgever over het afnemen van bloedtesten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is er onmiddellijk opheldering geëist bij Chemours over deze nieuwe GenX-vondst? Is Chemours inmiddels bereid om een lijst aan te leveren van alle ontvangers van GenX-producten in Nederland, en alle locaties waar afvalstromen waar mogelijk GenX in zit naartoe gaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport &amp;#40;ILT&amp;#41; heeft een verzoek gedaan aan Chemours om deze gegevens aan te leveren, conform de toezegging die de staatssecretaris heeft gedaan in het Algemeen Overleg Externe Veiligheid van 18 januari 2018. De eerste reactie van het bedrijf was positief en de ILT is nu in afwachting van de aanlevering van deze gegevens.

7yyvgr,33,2018-02-20,"Some days are okay, some are great, some are complete poop. Today, is poop.",Spacebunzspacebum,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7yyvgr/some_days_are_okay_some_are_great_some_are/,"So I feel the need to write. To share my thoughts and my struggles. To look for support and give support. My brain is a mess today. So writing both what I've accomplished and what I'm feeling at this very moment will help me identify what's going on with my thoughts and my feelings. However, I could always use advice. I and you are not alone in this process. Through reading peoples posts, it's helped expand my perspective which always helps. So here goes nothing: 


i've been doing good actually. Keeping my thoughts rational. Realizing emotion is just a feeling, it's not necessarily what is or what has to be. Keeping myself busy, healthy, in-check. I've been doing so good with missing him, and by that I mean understanding what I'm feeling is normal, all a part of the process and eventually maybe I won't miss him so much. I've been good with trying to think of other things when I'm reminded of him, to try and disconnect my memories of him from things that are happening or things i'm around in my life - shift the focus from him to me. I've been doing good at changing my inner self talk to a more positive, understanding friend. Rather than a negative fight within myself. I've been good with accepting what was and is, and that I don't know what will be. I've been doing a lot better at giving him respect in my mind, rather than hatred, anger, or sadness; because I am who I am today because of him. I've learned what I've learned about life and myself because of him. My brain is better, I am better, more healthy, more optimistic, more understanding, more open, and my heart is stronger because of him. And i am forever grateful of that. I will forever respect that. I've been doing so good with listening to myself and what I need right at this very moment, and in the long run. Giving myself time to listen to myself. Breath, meditate, write my thoughts down, start new projects, new hobbies, strengthen bonds with my close friends. 


But today, I can't. Today I am not so strong. Today i miss you, you as in your whole self - all the big and little things that make you, you - more than words describe. I understand what I'm feeling is still normal. There will always be those extra hard days on this fucking roller coaster. It's only been about a month - It's still a pretty deep wound. It doesn't help that Vday and my birthday also just passed. Those were always days I wanted to be with him, obviously. I think that I realized the next step to this process is letting him go and I think that I don't want to. The funny thing is, there's so many reason for me to not want him. There's so many reasons for me to let go. But I am not strong enough today to see them. The next funny thing is I don't want to see him, I don't want to talk to him, I don't want to get back together with him. I do, oh how I do, but I don't. I know that it won't work. I know that it'll hurt a lot more. I know that we're just straight up not compatible at the moment and I still have a lot of work to do on myself, by myself. But jesus christ, these ""withdraws."" I'm really getting the better of myself today. He’s been in my thoughts a lot lately. This whole past weekend has been really extra tough for some reason. But that makes the good days extra good right? 

Anyway, reddit, i need some help getting out of this poop thought process today. What's your favorite way to snap out of things? How do you motivate yourself? Honestly, I'd love to even hear just how you guys are doing today. My thoughts have fallen into a bad perspective this weekend. I need some new ones. 

It's such a beautiful day. I wish I could spend it outside, listening to myself, instead of inside at my internship. "

Graduating in May, upon which my grandma who I am a caretaker for will be moving in with her son to better facilitate my options. We rent a place now that will no longer be possible after May (nor would I want to stay here)

I work part time for my company now, but will be transitioning to full time upon graduation, presumably making somewhere between 35-40k. I would make 33k as an intern right now, so a small raise is expected but I don't know how much. I'm willing to assume my salary won't change as a worst case option. 

I have no debt whatsoever other than rotating credit card bills that I pay off, and my phone. I have about $3800 in savings right now (I didn't make much money prior to this year) that I think I could get up to $5000, maybe $5500 at the absolute most by May if I really cut costs. 

I live in west TN, where it's pretty easy to find decent property around $135k-160k. I could also find a (likely) much better equipped apartment for anywhere from $775-1000 in rent.

My question is would it even be possible for me to finance buying a house or a condo instead of renting? Should I wait and build up savings? Could I even viably save after moving on the salary I would be making? I'm going in pretty blind here as I've never really lived on my own at all. I have spectacular credit, around an 810 score. I've maintained several lines of credit for about 7 years. I don't think being approved for something would be very difficult unless it was just financially impossible.

Thanks for the help to anyone who replies."

It's **Black Panther** week here on r/popheads as 7 songs from the movie's soundtrack have charted in the top 10.

In its sixth week, 'All The Stars' peaks at #1. Last week's #1 'Pray for Me' loses only 2 spots to #3. 'King's Dead' re-enters the chart by reaching a new peak at #9 on its ninth week, making it this week's highest re-entry. For the new songs from the soundtrack, 'Opps' debuts at #2, making it the biggest debut this week, 'X' debuts at #4, 'Paramedic!' debuts at #6 and 'The Ways' debuts at #7.

For the non-Black Panther songs, 'The Middle' continues to chart at #5. Marshmello's new song with Anne-Marie 'Friends' makes it debut at #8 while MGMT's new single 'Me and Michael' debut at the bottom of the top 10.

bazzi's trending hit 'Mine' is this week's biggest gain, increasing 12 spots to #24. Unfortunately for Camila, one of her popular deep-cuts 'She Loves Control' loses 34 spots to #50, making it the biggest decline of the week.

* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #2. Vince Staples &amp; Yugen Blakrok - Opps
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #9. Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, Future &amp; James Blake - King's Dead
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #24. bazzi- Mine (+12)
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #50. Camila Cabello - She Loves Control (-34)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs

Dua Lipa's 'IDGAF' is out of the top ten, charting at #13. Will the song gain some steam back next week? Paramore's 'Rose-Colored Boy' reaches a new peak at #14 thanks to its music video and last week's #2 entry 'Get Out' by CHVRCHES seems to chart at #17. Will we see the songs gain some more next week?

'God's Plan' by Drake charts at #20. Will we see the song go back to the top 10 again next week with the release of his wholesome music video? Red Velvet's Bad Boy remains in the Hot 50 at #22 on its third week. The remix of Bruno Mars' 'Finesse' charts at #26. Will we see the song decrease more or gain back next week?

It seems like the songs from the Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack have difficulty in gaining people's attention due to the release of the Black Panther soundtrack. 'For You' and 'Capital Letters' charts at #42 and #47 respectively.

Rina Sawayama's 'Cyber Stockholm Syndrome' makes its welcoming re-entry to the Hot 50, charting at #48.

Lastly, for reasons unknown, Britney Spears' iconic hit 'Toxic' debuts on our Hot 50 at #49. This is probably the oldest song that has charted in our Hot 50 so far.

7yz3b4,2,2018-02-20,21 year old MBA student thinking about taking a gap summer - looking for advice!,FI_Bound_Millenial,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7yz3b4/21_year_old_mba_student_thinking_about_taking_a/,"Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking for a little bit and haven’t found the right place to ask this, so hopefully this is the right page.  I’m currently in my 4th year of a 5 year BSBA/MBA program (so my Bachelor’s is completed and I’m one semester away from my MBA) and I’m considering quitting my full-time internship to spend the summer traveling (Alaska, Europe, and China).  I would then come back to finish my last semester and apply for full time positions in the fall. 

What I’m worried about are the effects this might have on my career and long term financial health.  Has anyone else done something like this and had difficulty finding a job? Any other advice/warnings? I’ve spent the last 4 summers working internships full time, and I’m worried this is the last time I’ll get a chance to travel long-term before my career takes off.

7z020j,2,2018-02-20,what should I do?,isteponmushrooms,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7z020j/what_should_i_do/,"x-posting to suicidewatch in case this is innapropriate for here. sorry.

My name is Gabe. I turn 19 in June. I'm a transgender guy. I live in France. I've lost will to live.

I haven't been to public school since I was 13. I got homeschooled because of depression, still graduated. I'm working now, as a graphic designer. The work is good. My coworkers are nice. I have some plans for the future, I'd like to be a tour manager.

I broke up with my boyfriend of a year last december which led me to a suicide attempt and a week of forced institutionalization. This happened again last week. Another week in the hospital. I can't stand it, I hate it. I lied to the doctors so I could get home and rest at home instead. I don't have to go back to work until the 3rd.

My friends are slipping away from me. They're all getting significant others, better friends, new jobs. I talk to very little people, even when I start conversation, people drop me. I don't feel entitled to replies, but it hurts.
My parents support me and they're the reason I haven't truly done anything drastic yet. My mom has bad mental health and losing her son would make her life hell. But lately I've been feeling past that point of guilt.

I have planned a trip for late june-early july. I would be going to California to meet an older friend to drive me around and follow my favourite band. I even got a VIP ticket to get to meet them. I did this so I could tell them how much they have changed and helped me these past few years. I'd like to ask if they'd take me as an intern for tour managing next year, but I don't think I'll have the balls.

I feel like I won't make it to that point. It's hard to wake up. It's hard to do anything. They switched my meds (paroxetine to zoloft, valium, depakene) and I cannot walk correctly, I lose balance, get vertigo, collapse in the stairs. So I've been spending my time on the couch or in bed. I do nothing. I listen to music.

I used to be a musician. It was my biggest passion in life. I wanted it to be my whole life. I think I had a talent. I played every instrument and I loved it all. I didn't care what anybody thought. 

I lost all of this. I lost all will to play, now playing is a chore, I hate everything that I do. Yet I finished up an album with my ex, but I got in an argument with him today because it's only a side project to him and he doesn't care about my feelings (how I'd like to see it come out, because it's a reason for me to carry on). He can be extremely selfish. I'm glad we broke up. 

I'm writing all of this because I have no one to listen to me. I bother my ""friends"" with my depressing words. I think more and more seriously about suicide, not even the idea of the California trip is redeeming it. Waiting months seems impossible. I don't even feel like going back to work, I'm not gonna be productive. It's gonna be breakdowns in the break room again and puffy eyes in the morning. I have to set up a big, stressful festival for june and it's already stressing me out. I don't want to do it at all anymore, but I need the money for traveling and drugs. It's all that makes it worth it. 

Given I make the trip, that means my work contract has ended. I'm left with some money. From there, depending on how I feel, I will visit my friend in Denmark or I will buy more drugs and alcohol. It's how I have planned I will do it if I have to do it.

I can't pinpoint when or where exactly I lost the will to live and when my life became this. Sleeping and doing nothing. When I work, all I do when I come home is sleep. I don't eat in the evenings. I'm fat enough. 
I don't want to see doctors anymore, the hospitals tire me. Doctors don't know anything about me and I'm too tired to tell them everything. They think their pills will solve it all. They might. I will see.

What do you do when you don't enjoy anything, nothing seems worth it, the guilt has gone away, and it feels like the gates are finally opening up for you to go?

I've never felt so lost. I've never felt so alone.

Thank you for listening."
7z0uhd,7,2018-02-20,Girlfriend seems to have lost all interest in having sex with me.,Rather_Not_Say,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7z0uhd/girlfriend_seems_to_have_lost_all_interest_in/,"I was a virgin until I was 21, when I lost my virginity to my current girlfriend of about a year and a half. When we first started dating, sex was frequent and great. She seemed into it and was normally the one to initiate. We would have sex 4-5 times a week. Shortly after we started dating she attended an internship in New Zealand that lasted 2 months. During this time she sent me lots of nude photos and lewd texts about the things we would do when she got back. Upon her return things continued as they had been for a while but slowly sex became less and less frequent.

At first I didn't mind, as I sort of expected things to slow down as the relationship stopped being new and exciting, but recently the bedroom as been totally dead. It has been three months since we have had sex. Every time I try to initiate she doesn't seem into it and as soon as I stop my advances she makes no effort to continue the encounter. The last time I tried to get things going she started giving me a handjob and kept asking me if I was close, I could tell she just wanted it to be over and I ended up telling her to just stop, at which she seemed relieved.

Now I feel so uncomfortable trying to have sex with her because I know she doesn't want it and is just doing it to get me to stop. When we do have sex she always tells me to pull out and finish myself off shortly after we start. The whole thing has made me feel very guilty about my sexual desires to the point where I just won't initiate anymore and it is having negative impacts on my self esteem.

We have talked about her waning interest in sex which she has blamed on the antidepressants she is taking, which she has been taking for the entirety of the relationship. I understand that antidepressants can often have an adverse effect on a person's libido, and I feel awful pressuring her into something she doesn't want to do, but I also feel like I shouldn't have to apologize for my sexual desires.

She was far more experienced than I was at the start of the relationship, and she once told me that when she would sleep with lots of guys she was always hoping that one of them would ""stick around."" Part of me thinks she used sex as a way to get guys interested and was never as into it as she made me think.

I can't blame her for not being interested in sex, but I'm going insane. I don't know what to do."
7z0xxo,1322,2018-02-20,I used to enjoy snooping... not anymore.,leisurelymisguided,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7z0xxo/i_used_to_enjoy_snooping_not_anymore/,"Last year, I followed my boyfriend to his summer internship across the country. I didn't have many job prospects myself given it was a rather economically depressed area so, after applying to some minimum wage jobs and coming up with nothing but a telecom company (which I found way too depressing to entertain), I got on a care giving website to find a family I could nanny for. After a bit of searching, I found a family who needed weekday care for their two toddler aged boys and I went to their house to meet them for an interview the following day.

The Smiths lived in a typical middle-class suburb and as I turned onto their driveway I saw the two adorable boys playing in the front yard with their parents - they were the epitome of an All-American family. The parents, Jon and Sara, were an early-30s, nice, easygoing couple and the boys were sweet so, I instantly had zero qualms about working for them. During our meeting, they described boys schedules, eating habits, my chores, etc… and then, they told me about Ben.

Ben was an old friend and retired war vet, who lived in a side room off the kitchen, away from the other bedrooms. They said he'd fallen on hard times and had been living with them the last few years while he got back on his feet. They understood it seemed a bit strange and went out of their way to explain how Jon had known him his whole life and he was basically part of the family at this point so, he could be completely trusted. Alright. I mean, still kinda weird, but these people were doing a compassionate thing for their friend, right? At that moment I decided to take them at their word and not be creeped out by Ben.

I started working for them the next week and didn’t meet Ben until 3 days in, when I was getting ready to leave after Sara returned home from work at the same time as him. She introduced us and he simply said “hi” in a low voice then averted eye contact when I said hello back and offered my hand. After quickly shaking it, he immediately turned his attention to the 1 year old saying a cursory “nice to meet you” which I returned before making my exit while chatting with Sara. Nothing about the interaction seemed too off to me, except I’d wondered if I'd offended him somehow since he seemed rather cagey around me, but I just took it as him being generally shy or nervous around young women or something. Whateves.

As the summer went on, I didn't see too much of Ben. He left for work between 8-10am most days, and he'd usually return home for lunch, but I rarely saw him and if I did, he’d just offer a nod and return to his quarters. Sometimes I’d see him outside doing yard work. Once, he came to get me as I hadn't left enough room for his car to back out, and that was pretty much my longest interaction with him… to my knowledge.

One day as the boys napped, I was swiffering the house, and although I wasn't responsible for Ben's room, I knew he wasn't home and I was curious about how a man like him lived so, I cleaned what I could of it as well. Upon entering, I saw a room akin to a college aged males space. Most surfaces were covered with trash or clothing and his bed had no sheets on it, just clothes on one half. On his desk was a 3 monitor computer with the desktop on and the file explorer open and so, as a generally nosy person, I was incredibly tempted to click around but, my conscious got the best of me. This is the one time in my life I'm glad I wasn't a snoopy bitch.

To fast forward a bit - I continued working for their family, without event, for the rest of the summer and I really enjoyed my time with them. Working for them was once a pleasant memory in my mind. 

That is, until 2 weeks ago when I got a call from Sara. I had no clue what she could be calling about, as I had stopped working for them in August and returned to school. Perhaps to catch-up?

I didn’t think it’d be this.

Sara’s voiced trembled and eventually broke as she described to me what had just happened to them. Apparently, a few hours earlier, the FBI had busted into their home, booted them out, ransacked it, and informed them that Ben, not only had shitloads of child pornography on his computer but, he'd also installed secret cameras all over their house which he was using to watch us.

I was in a state of utter shock and horror upon hearing this and I don't remember how I responded but she couldn’t stop apologizing to me for subjecting me to such a gross violation which, of course, I accepted - how the fuck could she have known? She then informed me I was going to be contacted by the authorities to give my statement about any odd experiences I’d had with Ben and that I could ask them any questions I had about the case.

When we hung up, I immediately thought about how I almost looked through his computer… and very likely could've discovered his crimes. After that, feeling sick to my stomach, I screamed into a pillow for a while and took a long shower, attempting to get his disgusting pedophilic voyeur stink off of me... It didn't really help and I cried myself to sleep that night wondering if he’d ever hurt those little boys and questioning if I could have done something to stop it.

A few days later I was contacted by a homeland security agent (idk why both agencies were working on it), and he asked me a ton of questions about Ben and I told him what little information I had, but that I'd never knowingly experienced any abuse from him. He then told me about the extent of Ben's crimes.

Thankfully, they had no evidence that Ben ever harmed the boys and his crimes only revolved around females. But, in addition to the hidden cameras, apparently he sometimes upped the ante by creeping around outside the house, taking stealthy pictures of us through the windows. Was he ever really doing yard work? Not only that but, during one of the few times I napped when the boys did, he snuck into the living room where I laid on the couch and had a whole photo shoot of me sleeping consisting of dozens of shots - some right in my face... As if that wasn't horrifying enough, the sick fuck also had an entire folder dedicated to when I used the bathroom. Sara, however, he captured naked all the time and apparently she was the main focus of his disturbed attention. There's more but he said that was all that was pertinent to my situation and I opted not to learn anymore about it as I already felt way too overwhelmed.

Having never been the victim of a serious sex crime before, I'm still figuring out how to handle all of this and move past it. Beyond myself though, I'm disgusted that such kind, wonderful people were able to be hurt like this. To basically be fucking stalked in your own home and by a close friend… I just can't imagine how you’d ever get over that huge violation of trust. It chills me to my core.

Ben, let's NEVER fucking meet again and I hope you spend the rest of your meager life in prison.

Currently in college, on an extended internship that lasts a semester and a summer. I'm in my hometown and currently live with my parents because this may be the last chance I have to spend a long time with them before life really starts. Before that, we need to back up.

Had a high school sweetheart. It was pure, young, unadulterated love. I'd known them all high school, and things finally got romantic our senior year. It lasted 6 months and ended due to upcoming distance. This was right before college.

My first year of college was a hot mess, doing everything I could to show them that I had moved on: Excercise, best GPA, meaningless meaningless sex that not only hurt me as a person but hurt others. The summer after that we reconnected and hit it off, this was gonna be the one, this was gonna go all the way. It ended recently, and some of those reasons were my fault. Once again we have to move back to move forward.

Before I lost this person I told them a story my parents don't even know. How I was raped as a child by a neighborhood friend that was stronger than me, that was my biggest secret in life. 

Back to the present. I live with my parents, and don't have any friends here anymore. The good news is I feel free. I love going to work, I love doing what I do outside of work, and I love the new hobbies I'm picking up. These two shitty years have taught me what not to do.

I'm pledging to be happy. I decided to give up trying to hook up for lent so that I don't fall into that vicious cycle of self-destruction. I got new hobbies, I'm taking a trip, I'm off social media, I'm building up relationships with my friends.

I still feel like an empty shell, and I don't really know what feeling is in there but at least, I feel free. Thank you for reading this, it puts my mind at ease knowing that someone else has seen my thoughts."

7z1erp,3,2018-02-20,My girlfriend [22 F] of 2 years seems to have lost all interest in having sex with me [23 M].,Rather_Not_Say,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7z1erp/my_girlfriend_22_f_of_2_years_seems_to_have_lost/,"I was a virgin until I was 21, when I lost my virginity to my current girlfriend of about a year and a half. When we first started dating, sex was frequent and great. She seemed into it and was normally the one to initiate. We would have sex 4-5 times a week. Shortly after we started dating she attended an internship in New Zealand that lasted 2 months. During this time she sent me lots of nude photos and lewd texts about the things we would do when she got back. Upon her return things continued as they had been for a while but slowly sex became less and less frequent.

At first I didn't mind, as I sort of expected things to slow down as the relationship stopped being new and exciting, but recently the bedroom as been totally dead. It has been three months since we have had sex. Every time I try to initiate she doesn't seem into it and as soon as I stop my advances she makes no effort to continue the encounter. The last time I tried to get things going she started giving me a handjob and kept asking me if I was close, I could tell she just wanted it to be over and I ended up telling her to just stop, at which she seemed relieved.

Now I feel so uncomfortable trying to have sex with her because I know she doesn't want it and is just doing it to get me to stop. When we do have sex she always tells me to pull out and finish myself off shortly after we start. The whole thing has made me feel very guilty about my sexual desires to the point where I just won't initiate anymore and it is having negative impacts on my self esteem.

We have talked about her waning interest in sex which she has blamed on the antidepressants she is taking, which she has been taking for the entirety of the relationship. I understand that antidepressants can often have an adverse effect on a person's libido, and I feel awful pressuring her into something she doesn't want to do, but I also feel like I shouldn't have to apologize for my sexual desires.

She was far more experienced than I was at the start of the relationship, and she once told me that when she would sleep with lots of guys she was always hoping that one of them would ""stick around."" Part of me thinks she used sex as a way to get guys interested and was never as into it as she made me think.

To add to this, she rarely kisses me and all physical contact (cuddling, hugging, etc.) is initiated by me. I'm struggling to think when she last told me she loved me without it being a response to me saying it. I worry she is just with me because it is easier than breaking up. Sometimes when I am feeling down I will ask her if she is still into me which she always tells me she is. We live together and have 2 cats so I'm sure it won't be easy to have a clean breakup.

I can't blame her for not being interested in sex, but I'm going insane. I don't know what to do.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend seems to be totally disinterested in me but when we try to talk about it she reassures me that everything is okay. Our sex life is nonexistent."

The question to ask is how did it come to this, well luckily we can come up with a few *fertile* scenarios to *impregnate* with lust.

**Husband's Best Friend**- So your husband and yourself have been trying to conceive and it hasn't been stuck, not for a lack of effort. After doubting yourself you convinced him that you both need to be tested, only to find out that he has an incredibly low sperm count that would make it next to impossible to give you what you want.  After you both secretly confide in me what is going on, I offer to help out just planning on donating some sperm. But the cost that it would take is a little out of the price range that the two of you can afford, so we reach a deal where you are able to call me when you are ovulating and we fertilize the egg, the old fashion way.

**The Biological Clock**- You've been single all your life, not wanting to get married... but wanting to be a mom. Adoption agency aren't in a rush for single business women, but you can feel the clock starting to tick down. Do you want to seduce the young intern in the office or maybe hash out a deal for a FWB deal with your black co-worker.

I have a few more ideas brewing, but they don't feel like full scenes just yet, if you are into helping craft a new scene and turning it into something.... I'm more then happy to *reproduce* with you"

7z2r90,3,2018-02-20,I'm still kind of reeling from today,asukawashere,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7z2r90/im_still_kind_of_reeling_from_today/,"BPD Mom decided awhile back that a needed to see my gynecologist (I was like 6 mos. overdue for my yearly checkup, but since I'm not sexually active I made the determination that my lady bits did not imminently need examination and was planning to wait for the summer, when my workload was lighter). I'm 29 and have Asperger's. BPD Mom uses this as a golden universal free pass to try and control my life (""but you'll never do this right; you've got Autism, you can't!""). Somehow, ""you'll never make an appointment; I'll set one up for you when I go see the doctor"" (the whole family uses the same OBGYN) got into her head. She may or may not have mentioned something about this awhile back, when I was neck deep into a project and not paying enough attention. 


Anyway, needless to say, I missed the appointment I didn't entirely know I had. Mom calls me at lunch today and is like, ""you missed your appointment but, but, but! I fixed it and they'll take you at 7pm today, don't worry; I took care of everything, you just have to be there at 7."" Sure. Be there at 7. Except I'm busy working an hour away in the complete opposite direction from my house to get to the OBGYN, who's a further 30 minutes past my house. i.e. the Gynecologist is a solid hour and a half from my location, assuming traffic is normal for rush hour. And I usually don't get out of work 'til 6–6:30. Do the math there.


I work hourly. Freelance. Leaving work early costs me pay. I don't work every day of the week. I don't work every week of the year. Friggin' summer comes around and everyone and their brother gets a slave-wage college intern and nobody gives me work at all. (That's when I like to go to non-emergency doctor things.) But Mom's convinced herself she's helping me out by scheduling an appointment I have to leave work early to make it to, on a work night (I don't like to stay out late when I have work the next morning), with exactly zero prior notice. If I try and point any of this out to her, it'll be the same ""but I was only trying to help; why don't you appreciate anything I do?!"" song and dance I'm sure you're all familiar with.


So here I am, trying to not get kicked with a double whammy of ""you missed your appointment so we're going to charge you a missed appointment fee that your insurance won't cover."" I show up at the gynecologist's office, and I've just spend an hour and a half sitting in parking-lot rush hour traffic contemplating the wreck that it my life, and I'm sitting in the waiting room, and some toddler is screaming at his mother, and I'm just increasingly overwhelmed, and finally I get to the exam room and there's the gyno (who's also my BPD mother's gyno) and she's all, ""how are you today?"" and I. Just. Break. Down. And I'm sobbing and snot is getting all over the patient gown and I attempt to relate to her exactly why I'm breaking—I suspect she probably has to deal with something like that on a daily basis, what with all the raging pregnancy hormones visiting her office—and she's handing me a tissue and telling me I'm doing a good job and all and I finally choke out something approximating an explanation, and then she goes and sums it up with OH YOUR MOM'S JUST TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU THAT'S JUST WHAT MOMS DO—oh, and ""you know, you can always call to cancel an appointment if you don't think you can make it."" 


And now I'm just dead inside. Stupid me, breaking down in front of a doctor Mom shares, one who's probably been fed her woe-is-me-none-of-my-children-love-me routine for years. Mom is a goddamn master of the ""but I'm the victim here!"" mind games. What the hell was I thinking?


So, yeah. Feeling a little broken right now. Finally hop in my car and get home—it's 8:30 when I walk in the door; (presumably) sees I've probably been crying, and asks, ""long day at work?"" Either it doesn't even compute in her brain that anything she does is messed up or she's baiting me so she can go on another ""my children hate me and all I do is sacrifice for them!"" wailing spree. Maybe even both. I'm not sure which is worse.


…and she just walked into my room and is baiting me again. ""I put myself out on the line for you and all you do is get angry all the time. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!"" And crap, now she's pulled out the tears. The tears are a daily event. Like clockwork. I CAN'T COPE WITH THIS! I'm sure tomorrow I'll hear all about how nobody has any sympathy for her suffering. "
7z38wi,6,2018-02-21,[Ask] I aspire to become an Architect more than anything in the world. I have come here for guidance on how I should get there. Is it in any way practical to get my Master's online and have a legitimate shot at making this work?,FlixterMC,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/7z38wi/ask_i_aspire_to_become_an_architect_more_than/,"Hello everybody, thank you for your time.

I am 23 years old, dropped out of school in the 10th grade. I do have my GED. I live in Florida.

I've wanted to follow my dream of becoming an Architect since I was 15, it is 100% what I want to do with my life. I know I'm not getting into this for the money, and that this proffesion is a lifestyle in itself. I wish to practically devote my life to this, as a hobby, passion and career. 

Mathematics and Creative Design is what I love and am better at than anything else, I truly believe if I follow through with my golden path, in 20 years or so of living and breathing Architecture I'll have developed my own order of operations and style in this art. I wish to syncronize aestetics and functionality in my future designs to realistically bring works of art in our every day lives..

The spacing of units and how they relate to eachother, elevation and non symetrical flowing is what I feel I can bring to the field. Striving to think outside of the box.

I know this isn't going to be easy. There's a good chance I'll be stuck designing bathrooms for business plazas in a cubical for a corporate firm, but I feel like shooting for the stars is what life is all about.

I want to design Residential High End Homes. I plan on studying close to endlessly on how to maximize my budget.. obsessing on knowing what material to use and when, based on aestetical contrast and structural sound.. I don't know much about the actual process of design, but the concept is something I hold so dear to me.

I don't care if I am 'succesful' or not, my goal in life is to learn Architecture and become the best I can in this field. I'm sure a lot of you will tell me that I have no idea how the day to day life of an Architect is, and what the job description actually is. I'm ready to work my ass off to make this happen, I'm diving head first. Pretty balsy, but I am oh so set to go all the way on this. This is my purpose.

So, now I need to get there. I have trouble figuring out how things work in this world and communicating with the people around me. Mostly why school didn't work well for me, I'm am as interverted as it gets. I learn better alone, am Zen at heart. I feel like I really would get the most out of getting my degree completely online (except in person exams of course). A book works better than a teacher for me, or in this perspected case, the computer screen. 

Is it plausible at all to teach myself this way of life? Could I get my Master's of Architecture through online schooling and still hold legitimency in the field, or would that be too much of a blackmark to be considered in such a competitive market? 

I know there's certain accrededations I'll need - NAAB is the only one I am aware of, I was informed that I practically need to go to a NAAB accrededated school to be tooken seriously.

If this Online School fantasy is practical in any sense - does anyone have any reccomendations on which school to go to? I have no clue on this type of thing, I don't even know where to begin. I've been looking into different schools but don't know what to look for. Have my eyes on 'Academy of Art', has a Master's Degree plan with NAAB accredidation.. I'm sure there's a better option out there, that's why I am here to pleed for guidance.

I dropped out of school as mentioned before, am hoping that if I bust my ass I can still make this work. If not graduating high school will disqualify me from these programs, what can I do to make this work?

I'm ready for the mission of 5 years of schooling - following years of internship to actually be considered an Architect, and still not be ""good"" in my field. From what I understand, you start getting good at this when you're older. 

This is a hell of a long road, but this is my destiny. I am willing to do anything to make this work. It's going to be a rough start but I'm going to give it my all to redeem my lack of graduation.

Thank you for your time everybody!

In early January 2018, I bought a Surface Book 2 (13"") and loved it. 

Unfortunately, exactly one month later it started having random slowdowns, and then wouldn't turn on at all. This happened a few days after I spilled a very small amount of water on it that I immediately cleaned up. I'm still not sure if the water had anything to do with it, since the amount was genuinely quite small (maybe two or three tablespoons) and was cleaned up immediately.

I opened a ""repair and replacement"" request with Microsoft and was immediately sent a UPS label. I shipped them my broken computer and five days later received a totally brand new Surface Book 2, no questions asked.

Given the high price of the Surface Book 2, I was quite saddened by it breaking down and worried that I had screwed up a serious investment. It was a huge relief to be met with such outstanding support and to receive a new laptop only five days later and with such an efficient, no-nonsense support process.

I am currently typing this on my new Surface. I think it's important to share this story so that Microsoft gets the credit it deserves for this great customer service.

I don't think I'll be buying a different kind of laptop in the future -- a decision I had made earlier anyway given how awesome the Surface Book 2 is.

(Disclaimer: I am a former research intern at Microsoft Research, but strongly do not believe that this influences my opinion either way.)"
7z4ak4,7,2018-02-21,"Depression, an academically rigorous college experience, and giving up on being a teacher...",mynameisnt_katy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7z4ak4/depression_an_academically_rigorous_college/,"I went into college without a solid idea of what I was going to do, and instead of increasingly loving my major and finding it more and more useful, the opposite happened. I loved aspects of things I was studying, but after sophomore year, I had an overwhelming sense of being in the wrong place. Depression and anxiety sabotaged my will and motivation to do much of anything. I barely was able to graduate after re-doing a thesis that I had no real interest in. I only wrote about it because I thought it was what my advisor wanted me to do. 

The As I got in high school suddenly became Bs and Cs, and I didn’t feel like I was really learning very much about anything, even when I did manage a rare B+ or A. I was just writing papers and talking about theoretical issues that often felt irrelevant and not at all relatable, unless I was studying history or education. I’ve always cared about equality and fairness, and I think that was what drew me to Sociology. But, instead of feeling increasingly free throughout college, I felt increasingly trapped, and like I just kept making the wrong decisions. I wanted to take internships that related more to my field, but they often did not pay anything, and I had to pay for my books, which were not covered by financial aid. 

So, I would go home during breaks and work at the local movie theatre for $10/hour, more than minimum wage in Oregon at the time. And I was too afraid to be away from my family during breaks from college, because despite the arguments I had with them about various things, they were all I really knew, and they still provided me with an ironic sense of stability during my time in college (I say ironic because we fought constantly, but I still got a sense of stability by being around them), which felt like being in a foreign country the entire time I was there. Part of it had to do with the fact that I wasn’t rich. I’ve never been poor, but I definitely felt inadequate compared to my rich friends that were able to travel to foreign countries during the breaks, and all I was able to do was work a barely-above minimum wage job that the movie theatre during breaks in school. It was a highly stressful job, and I took all of the hours I could get. I barely had any time at home with my family, and working those hours after being in a grueling college environment would sometimes start to push me over the edge. 

I think my parents were also being overworked by their jobs, and they were frustrated with me for being in the state of mind that I was, and I don’t think they knew how to help me. I had no idea how to help myself, and I had not had any serious depressive symptoms before college, so I was on my own, away from my family, not recognizing my slow but steady decline. 

I think it took them years to really see how bad my mental health actually was. I tried telling them that I didn’t want to live anymore and I fantasized about jumping out of my dorm window or in front of a car in November 2013, and their response was to get angry with me. My response was to throw a piece of pie I was eating onto the floor and break it, which they guilted me about for a long time, and they used that as an excuse for why they didn’t want to do anything to help me. I regret doing it, but looking back on it, I wish they would have tried to help me out more because I don’t just go around throwing things. Instead, they guilted me for something I did when I felt suicidal and like nobody cared. That made me even more bitter and angry at the world, because I felt like the people who were supposed to care about me and had encouraged me to go to this high-stress, “foreign country” college in the first place were abandoning me. 

Even so, I definitely made some good friends while at college, but I also found myself in toxic friendship and relationship situations where I am still not sure if I was the toxic one, or if they were, or if we both were. The events that happened along with those relationships continued to erode my trust in people and furthered my sense of being bitter, anxious, and generally angry with the world. I did still have some good friends that I never had any problems with, so I knew there was some good in the world, but I felt like the work I was doing in college was not relevant to the real world, I felt abandoned by some people that I had really cared about, and I felt alone and like I was enduring perpetual culture shock. 

It was often the little things about being there that carried me through. Once in a while, I would become extremely passionate about a paper topic or a book we were reading. I did actually like most of my professors. I knew I was getting a really good education. I had the opportunity to meet people from around the world, and I know I became even more tolerant and open as a result of this. I wish I had used my college experience better, or at least known when to find another major or college. I don’t know what I was thinking. I just got very lost. 

I saw getting into the Masters in Teaching program at University of Puget Sound as a way to find purpose again. Teaching was more real-world than anything I had done in four years, so I was excited and passionate to start. I did well academically for 6 months until I had to write a unit plan. I failed it miserably, and was told to re-do it over winter break. I felt terrible, because I knew I hadn’t asked for enough help on it, but I had felt relatively confident that I had understood it as I wrote it. I re-did it, and I improved it. Then, student teaching started. It was with a classroom of kids that I already knew from the previous fall, and I was excited to work with them again. But, I just started on a bad path yet again. 

I liked learning from my mentor, and I liked working with the kids, but being up in front of the room and managing the behaviors of all of those kids felt terrifying, no matter how calm I stayed through it and no matter how firm I made my voice. The kids didn’t really listen to anything I was saying, and there was a noticeable difference in how they behaved when their ‘regular teacher’ was in the room and how they behaved when he wasn’t in the room. 

I found it exhausting and overwhelming to have to stop the lesson several times just to re-direct them and try to assert authority and purpose in the room. I felt there was no way for me to get better at teaching a lesson when this just kept happening. I secretly felt like kind of a victim, but I rationally knew that this is what kids will do: they test authority. But, even though I had no actual resentment for the kids at all, and I actually enjoyed working with every single one of them on all of their subjects, I just didn’t see myself in a place where I could get better at it. I felt like the mentor and my advisors were doing everything they could to help me, but I increasingly saw that I was lacking in knowledge on things that they couldn’t provide me with. 

The Common Core lessons asked me to teach things that I don’t think I ever really learned to do. It was totally different from my own school experience, even though I was only 22 years old at the time. It’s not like it’s been 30 years since I was in elementary school. It’s only been fourteen years since I ‘graduated’ 5th grade. I was in 1st grade in 2000. Yet, it’s already a totally different world. 

Picking out character traits from a character in a story was something I don’t think I was asked to do until I was maybe 15-17 years old and in high school English classes. In 1st grade, our teacher read us stories and we got phonics worksheets. Read-alouds done by our teacher were for fun more than anything else, and it got us to enjoy the book. Now, they are asking us to have kids pull out character traits, when back then, it was just story time, or getting the kids to like the story. That doesn’t really seem to matter anymore. I found the atmosphere stifling, rigid, and I was totally unprepared both for the management part of it and what I was being asked to teach. You can’t teach something if you know nothing about it. It was a sad realization, but I knew that because of it, I had to stop before I kept failing. The last thing I wanted to do was to work hard on the EdTPa certification test thing, and fail yet again because I never even learned what I was supposed to be teaching, at least not in a 1st grade context. 

I didn’t really know how to explain that I didn’t really understand what the standards were asking kids to do. They were, oddly enough, questions that I had never really considered. It was my sense of social justice and wanting to work with kids that pushed me to become a teacher. Plus, since I had gotten straight As throughout my K-12 years, I started thinking that because I had figured out how to do well, at least regarding grades, that I could help others also do well in that regard. I didn’t think I was better than anyone, it was just a desire to help people. I’ve always known that while grades truly don’t measure everything, it was what colleges and future employers would be looking at. I thought I could help kids get the best grades that they could, and hopefully learn some meaningful things in the process.

But, back to why I dropped out of student teaching. Classroom management was exhausting. I soon needed to film some of my lessons for my EdTPa segment, and I couldn’t even keep the class under control. I felt like there were 80 different things that needed my attention when I was at the front of the room, and it was basically sensory overload. I had to attend to my own feelings, which were pretty much just telling me to run and get the hell out of there, and I had be aware of what all of the kids were doing, and I had to actually be teaching somewhere in there. I had never experienced anything like it. I of course believed that I could get better, but probably not in time for this test that I was supposed to take to get certified. I just wasn’t progressing fast enough. There didn’t seem to be much natural ability there to help me through. 

Despite all that, the passion for wanting to help the kids never went away, and I loved getting to know and work with each and every one of the kids in the classroom. I still miss them. 
I think part of it is that I’ve tended to function better in small groups for my entire life. I’m also an only child, and I’ve always had at least 1 or 2 close friends to confide in, but in giant groups of people, I would just leave the room unless I was immersed in some small-group activity. I wish that had occurred to me before I went into student teaching, but I guess you never know what you’ll be in any context until you try it.

Routine morning- CeraVe gentle face wash, LaRoche Posay spf 50 sunscreen night- CeraVe gentle face wash, Tazorac 0.1% cream -starting minocycline twice a day tomorrow

Hey guys 18 year old male here, so I used to get a few pimples but I was relatively acne free but suddenly since December I had a SEVERE cystic break out and my skin got throroughly fucked up. I started using Tazorac again .01%, it's been 7.5 weeks and my skin is like what the imgur post shows. ITS SO BAD. I have deep redness and weird scarring that's in the shape of a line as if someone slashed me with a knife. I'm not sure how much of that is scarring and whether the Tazorac will heal it. Am I still in the healing process? How badly is everything scarring?

Since these are all new marks I was wondering if they would heal, also are there any scar creams I should use along with my tazorac or incorporate anything to help treat the scars? Since this is new maybe early treatment will help?

How badly will I be disfigured for my life, what grade is the scarring? I'm so fucking scared dude, on the brink of depression and having really bad thoughts right now. I don't feel like I'm the same person I was a few months ago before the acne, I've lost happiness and confidence smh. I'm in Berlin right now for an internship and wanted to meet people, girls, and have a good time but this is really affecting my personality and outlook. The possibility of permanent scarring is also FREAKING me out. Everyone on the internet says scarring is forever and basically untreatable. I used to have a smooth ass face and my girl used to always comment on it and I used to love my face. It doesn't help that my girlfriend dumped me two weeks ago and my self confidence is completely gone bc Idk if my acne had to do with it. I'm fucking out of my mind sometimes because of this shit mannnnn."

7z7ec3,9,2018-02-21,Unleashed - an oldschool indie RPG about sins and virtues (demos for Windows and Linux),Maszuka,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7z7ec3/unleashed_an_oldschool_indie_rpg_about_sins_and/,"Hi.

**Long story short**: I've been leaving the IT companies world to live the dream of indie game developer. Unleashed is my first big project, and it will probably define how I'll live in the future. That's why I've made a demo that you can download to test Unleashed in its current state. See below for the links.


&amp;nbsp;


**Full story**: I believe I'm not the only one in my case; living games as a passion since my childhood, dreaming of making my own someday. I've done my best to go towards this goal, and I ended up in an IT engineer school. I've been able to learn a lot until I got my diploma, but the internships I had left me with a weird feeling. I was like ""is this really what I wanted to do? I mean, this has nothing to do with game development, and... I don't feel like I belong here"".


&amp;nbsp;


I've still tried to continue this way, while making video games on my spare time. But then Unleashed appeared in my mind. At first, it was just developed as a hobby. Then, I started spending all my time on it, putting all my guts in it even though it killed what was left of my social life. I was in an IT company and I told myself ""I'll never be enjoying it. I can't continue like this without trying to do what I want"". But you know, I had constraints: parents that paid studies so I get this diploma, girlfriend that expected me to have a good salary... So living as an indie was a social suicide. 


&amp;nbsp;


But I did it. I left my job, endorsed my responsibilities in front of my surrounding and said ""Let me give this a try. I don't want to live like this if I haven't even tried to do my thing"". I didn't tell the entire truth though. It's hard to say to your family that even if you have pretty much everything to be happy, you kinda feel depressed. Because everyday I was telling myself ""So is that my life?"". It can seem stupid to complain knowing that some people live way worse than I do, but I was like ""Why couldn't I be happy? I'd like to try"". Being a 9 to 5 employee would not allow me to find happiness, while spending dozen of hours and even working at night would be fine if it is for game development.  


&amp;nbsp;


And that's where it led me now. Almost a year later, Unleashed has reached a state where it can be shown to the public, and hopefully you'll feel all the efforts that were put in it. There are two versions: one for Windows and one for Linux.


&amp;nbsp;


To talk just a bit about Unleashed, it is a 2D RPG set in a dark fantasy world. You'll find traditional RPG elements such as open world exploration, inventory and team management, but also sandbox features like crafting, harvesting, housing. The battles are turn based, and you will use creatures representing either a sin or a virtue to fight in 3v3 battles. We've decided to replace the traditional fire/ice/water elements by sins &amp; virtues. It is of course still a dev build and you should expect bugs and unfinished elements.


&amp;nbsp;


If you want to take a look at what the game looks like: [Game's early trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6zAHkCpyiE)

7z7u4z,11,2018-02-21,Missed the Phore AMA? No problem take a look.,aBitToTheLeft,PhoreProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoreProject/comments/7z7u4z/missed_the_phore_ama_no_problem_take_a_look/,"Here is a little transcription from The Real Zerpbox hosting Phore's AMA. A lot of great questions and great answers.

&gt; Q: With a lot of new Masternode / privacy coins doing planning market pace (shield) or payment gateway (GBX) how do you plan to stay in front? Or do you see multiple existing next to each other?  In short why is Phore different?

A: Phore is more than a masternode or privacy coin, or even the marketplace. We are building a blockchain platform and ecosystem to solve a number of use cases, focused around real world mainstream use of cryptocurrency. The project will continually be adding new blockchain technologies and even new blockchains to the Phore ecosystem using sidechains, with programmable smart contracts being the first, adding more decentralized applications with crowdfunding coming next, and working to break down the barriers that exist today preventing mainstream use of cryptocurrency for commerce and other purposes.
One of the things we think will distinguish Phore will be execution. We have a lot of talent and experience on the team, more than most other crypto projects, both within crypto as well as many other areas that are important to our success. We have met all of our milestones up to now and plan to meet or beat every one of them. We will also be building relationships and partnerships that are needed in addition to the technology to make this happen. We also want to make cryptocurrency much more user friendly and accessible than it has been up until now.

&gt; Q: A large part of creating a successful project is making the cryptocurrency available to the masses. Will you be joining other exchanges?

A: We are actively working to get on more exchanges. I expect there will be more announcements on that coming soon but I cannot give details, there are NDAs that prevent that.

&gt; Q: With goverment regulations surrounding privacy coins,where do you see yourself in a year's time

A: Its hard to say for certain as nobody can tell whats around the corner. Everybody here knows this space is evolving rapidly. We rely on a customized zerocoin protocol to make private transactions. Let it be noted that although we are a 'privacy coin', transactions do not have to be exclusively private. There also the option to remove this in order to comply with regulations.

&gt; Q: What do you think about the critics about the rebrand? I'm referring one of the twitter og here and do you think it will damage the simplicity of the phore? How are you planning the manage the transition?

A: Well, with regards to the rebrand, we feel it's necessary. It's a natural progression from being a simple cryptocurrency to offering much more in terms of an ecosystem. Phore remains the fuel of the Phore Blockchain, and always will.

&gt; Q: I saw an infographic comparing different privacy coins.  It showed some (including Phore) having an infinite supply. Can you talk a little about that?

A: Regarding infinite supply: We are a 100% proof of stake coin. This means that instead of paying a bitcoin miner possibly very large transaction fees to clear your transaction quickly, every participant running a Phore node can make new blocks and are rewarded for doing so with staking rewards. It also means that transaction fees are vastly smaller than something like bitcoin, and are burned when they are used so they actually reduce the supply. However, that incentive to mine blocks has to be there, so staking rewards have to be there permanently as well. There is a schedule of specific blocks when the staking rewards will be reduced, and the inflation rate will be continuously decreasing over time.

Also something to remember is that ETH currently has an infinite supply too.

&gt; Q: At a certain point there will be an equilibrium reached in the supply of coins and burning of fee's right?

A: The masternode governance is an interesting feature. Essentially people with enough Phore can lock Phore into a Masternode. The masternode works to help with transactions and other network operations. In return for locking in the Phore you get coin rewards. Every month, everyone that owns a masternode has the opportunity to vote on proposals that were put out by the community. If these proposals get enough votes, whoever voted for them gets funded to work on their proposal. This way Phore really is a community driven coin. The community is in charge of the direction, not just one or two people.

I think its also very important to note that anybody at all can put up a proposal, this isn't limited to just masternode holders. Masternode holders are the ones given the power to vote on these proposals however. Having a vested interest will nearly always cause them to act with Phores best interests in mind.

&gt; Q: Can you elaborate on what types of decentralized apps you’d like to see involved on your ecosystem and what distinguishes you from the rest that are out there attempting the same thing.

A: Regarding types of decentralized apps: Given that we already have a strong foundation of a fast and efficient currency blockchain, we will be focusing on use cases that involve commerce in many areas, although we are not limited to only doing that. Given our privacy features, we will be looking more at decentralized applications that benefit from adding optional privacy and may otherwise be suffering from censorship or oppressive consequences today. Crowdfunding is a perfect example where far left or far right activists are being shut off from funding sources by centralized applications or providers if they don't agree with their views, and having decentralized crowdfunding where you need no permission to start a fundraising campaign, and where people can choose to contribute anonymously we think is a great fit for us.

&gt; Q: Could you tell a bit more about why some team members still anonymous? reaching a bigger audience and profile means also more exposure for persons but i could see that would be a benefit if there is a so called public face or faces for the project

A: We have gone a long way to revealing the identities of most of the people behind the coin. Some remain anonymous due to their personal situation, which maybe down to their main employer or another issue.  As part of the relaunch we are adding pictures to the site which will bring further transparency.

&gt; Q: Is it only a phore wallet I can use or do any other wallets support phore

A: currently it is only a Phore Wallet which supports. We are actively looking into hardware wallet integration, however we left this out of our roadmap (alongside things such as exchange listsings) as we don't have the power to control the results of these - its down to a third party to accept Phore and therefore we can't guarantee.

&gt; Q: is it an ERC20 token?

A: We have our own blockchain, we are not an ERC20 token running over Ethereum. When we have smart contracts we might be able to host some ERC20 tokens on our blockchain though.

&gt; Q: What would you consider to be your biggest competitor in the space, and is there another project who you kind of see as an example?

A: We don't see other coins as competitors. We have a lot of respect for them. They're doing their thing, while we're doing ours. Also, we're going our own separate route with Phore Blockchain. We're interested in expanding to the real world, and real world usage as one of our key areas of operation. Both myself and Sage are totally focused on this.

&gt; Q: As most projects in Blockchain/Crypto rely on the technical/dev side but seem to lose focus on the Business/Marketing side- in which becomes very important- does phore strive to have a balanced Tech to Business/Marketing ratio?

A: As Each Blockchain is Singular- are there plans for Interoperability? We are definitely interested in this, whether it is leveraging Ripple's interledger protocol or similar methods to open payment channels and other relationships between blockchains. We just have to work out exactly how it best fits into our plans and architecture.

Great question. We value both tech development and marketing. Our budget has been set out to be 40% tech development, 20-30% or so for marketing, and the rest for corporate costs. We also hired a Marketing Director with amazing experience and dedication. We're also growing our development team as well, in fact had at least 3 interviews in the past couple of days.

**Additional Information**

 - We're also about to start an internship program for young, promising Devs

 - You can then fund a smart contract by ""depositing"" Phore onto the Phore smart contracts blockchain. Much later, possibly only every 2-3 months, smart contracts Phore tokens would be ""withdrawn"" back onto the Phore mainchain. There are important reasons for this. But people will not want to wait months to get their Phore of course, so we will be enabling instant, no fee atomic swaps between the Phore mainchain and the smart contracts sidechain.
If you want to see a rough model of the architecture we are looking at, here is one example for bitcoin and ethereum: https://github.com/etherex/btc-swap

 - It's important to note that our team consists of over 30 members spanning many departments: Developers, Marketing, Partnerships, Research, Legal and more. The tech development is a very important aspect of Phore, but it certainly isn't the only one!"

My current job is a Project Engineer with State Government and my duties include both design and construction administration on smaller projects ($100K - $3million) relating to recreational facilities, ie. roads, campgrounds, trails, boardwalks, boat launches, floating dock systems, etc. I recently passed my PE in October so now I have started looking at other work in the private sector. Generally, I feel annoyed working for the government (where I am at, I'm not saying all government is like this and do not want to get into arguments about politics) as I feel its an environment that promotes complacency and doesn't encourage doing anything above the bare minimum. However, the local economy is not doing great and there isn't a lot of work out in the private sector, so as far as job security goes the government is pretty good. 

Due to the size of my office (about 5-8 engineers), most of the projects that I have worked on have been smaller in scope with minor complexity. This has had a benefit as I have been able to work on these projects through their entirety, but I feel that the longer I stay where I am at the less competitive I become in the private sector. Additionally, my job requires me to spend the majority of my summer out in the field, and after 5 years (plus an additional 3 years as an intern) I'm over it and want a more office focused job. 

Yesterday I found out that my direct supervisor accepted a new job with a different Department, which will be the second manager to leave in 2 months, and 5th employee to leave in 3 years. The office manager is a good technical resource but not very good managing people and as a result, we are hemorrhaging staff. With my direct supervisor leaving, it opens up his project manager position to me as currently, I'm the only one in the office with the qualifications for it. 

My dilemma is that I don't know what is going to be better for my career, moving to a private firm and getting more experience on larger complex design projects or getting project management experience. Now I know I haven't even applied yet and I'm sort of counting my chickens before they hatch. My current plan is to keep applying for design jobs in the private sector and apply for the project manager job when it opens up. 

So anyway what are your thoughts?

TL;DR at bottom

Hi everyone, I’ve been a long time lurker over on Personal Finance and just converted to Dave Ramsey methods after reading TMM over Christmas Holiday and I’m $252k in debt.

 A little back story to understand how I got to where I am. I’m 25, married (25y.o. wife, teacher) and in a decent hole. I graduated in 2014 with approx. 38k in student loans with an Engineering Degree. My car’s transmission died 2 months before I graduated and I had enough of a nest egg from internships and everything that I bought a barely used Chevy Malibu. My dad is a VERY HIGH ACHIEVING car salesman and told me ‘you will basically always have a car payment so just get used to it.’ When I graduated college I was about 60k in debt. But my thought was ‘everyone has student loans and I’ll have a car payment forever so oh well. My wife had almost the same had almost the same car scenario as I and also bought a slightly used car. When she graduated she was 70k total in debt, 45k student loans and 25k car loan.

I took a job out of college as a Manufacturing Supervisor and made almost 100k that year working my life away on 2nd shift and weekends. I was putting in almost 80hrs a week for an extended time. I took all of this money and paid off a large private Sallie Mae loan that I had that was at 10%. Then saved a big chuck for an engagement ring and wedding. We had been dating for a long time and wanted to get married. We paid cash for everything, 0 debt and minimal help from family. 

With both our families being in the mindset of “rent is wasting money” we bought our first home for 220k with 10k down on a 30yr fixed @ 4%. We felt like we were really doing great. We were so far ahead of most people at our age and were feeling really accomplished. Top of the world.

Right before we got married I took a “promotion” to Engineer to get back into my field and ensure I would work 1st shift. It ended up costing me about 20k/yr but I was a lot happier so oh well. 

As a young couple making ~115-120k we felt we were able to spend money on things and I never really thought about it. We would go on random trips to Costco or Marshalls and walk out with random CRAP that we really had no plan on buying and really didn’t need. But I always found a way and we were always on time with everything.

Fast forward to end of last year and I am pulling money from one account to another to make everything work (I take care of a majority of the bills and just ask my wife to pay random ones as I need her too. We had separate accounts). I set up a second checking account for auto bill pays and it got me going in the right direction but I felt like I was just treading water.

I started listening to Dave’s podcast while driving to and from work and started reading some of the stories on here and thought ‘I might as well read his book.’ So over Christmas holiday I read TMM. I was probably the most eye opening experience of my life. The ‘rants’ about the ‘math people’ saying he was wrong about the snowball method I took as a personal attack. I always thought it was dumb anytime I saw it. The math isn’t right! And then it really hit me what Dave always says: “If I had been doing the math all along, I wouldn’t be in this mess.” That was it, I was hooked. I created an excel spreadsheet that tracked every payment on our debt on every account since May of 2015. We were $258,425.29 in debt. Of that $57,365.78 were Student and Car Loans. Dave really made me think about how bad I was actually doing and how great my future could be if I just tackled it head on.

I took this spreadsheet and a Budget rough draft to my wife and told her I wanted to fix our mess. There were some arguments and some tears but we got through it. We are on our 1st month of using cash for all purchases that we can. Everything else is on the debit card. We stop using all 7 of our credit cards. (I played the system for points since our spending was so high). I know it’s only our first month and things will change but it has been really liberating not being able to buy things. I like it so much more that I can’t impulse anything now. We gave ourselves $100 of fun no judgement money each per month. It really forces you to think what is truly needed.

We emptied our excess savings from our EF and applied it towards Student Loans, received our Tax Refund yesterday and it is already gone to pay off 2 more Student Loans. I have about $2500 in savings bonds from childhood in a safety deposit box at my parent’s bank and am getting those this weekend. That will knock off another Student Loan.

From when I read TMM to now we have paid off $6,231.47 in student loans. I’m used to having a minimal EF due to always stealing from it to make ends meet so that isn’t bothering me that much.

I’m not big on using apps for budgeting because I like the ownership of the excel spreadsheets I have created. They let me see everything the way I want to see it. I keep going back and forth on starting to use Everydollar but just haven’t pulled the trigger yet. I’ve used Mint in the past and realized I just didn’t pay it as much attention as I do tracking everything on my own. (Plus it allows me to project how long it would take to pay off dependent on different payment schedules)

If you’re still with me sorry for rambling and I can’t wait to update everyone along the journey.

TL;DR: 25y.o. couple with household income of ~125k in debt of $252k including mortgage, Baby Step 2 amount of $52k currently. Paid off $6k in last month. Trying to change the family tree mindset on debt.

MSG/Knicks appealed the ruling, but eventually settled for $11.5mil a couple months later apparently [at the behest of David Stern](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/11/sports/basketball/11garden.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin). MSG/Knicks and Isiah Thomas deny any wrongdoing til this day. 

&gt;Stern has been coy about whether he has the power to punish the Garden over the sexual harassment case or to take action to diminish the powers of James L. Dolan, the Garden’s chairman.

&gt;On Oct. 29, he offered a tart response when asked by ESPN what the Browne Sanders case said about the state of the Knicks. “It demonstrates that they’re not a model of intelligent management,” he said. “There were many checkpoints along the way where more decisive action would have eliminated this issue.”

[What also came out during this trial was a similar 'Corrosive Workplace Culture'](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-marbury-admits-luring-woman-car-sexual-harassment-testimony-article-1.247206) 

* 1) Stephon Marbury's cousin sexually harassing an intern
* 2) said intern having sex with Marbury because she said *""I felt like I had to""*
* 3) Brown Sanders telling President Steve Mills about 'the encounter between Marbury and the intern and complained that she heard from others that Marbury had called her a ""black bitch"", but that Mills warned her that if she didn't stay quiet Thomas would start rumors she was having an affair with MSG executive Jeff Nix'.

Since the SI-Mavs article came out, there has been speculation about whether the Mavs would lose draft pick(s) and/or Cuban possibly forced to sell the team. This was during a different time, but this would be the precedent of whether or not the Commissioner has the power to punish Cuban. "

So I worked at a data science research center for about 6 months from Spring until the end of Summer in 2017.  I have been recently CCd in some emails between a new intern who is taking over a project I did and the intern keeps criticizing my work, saying how it’s “ridiculous I didn’t keep track of everything as I did it” how it’s “nearly impossible to keep up” and the project is really “horrible.” I find this to be VERY inappropriate and I honestly don’t think he realizes I’m reading this. I don’t know if my boss realizes it either. 

I told her that if they need help or clarification I’d be willing to pitch in because the project is important to me and it’s data researchers are relying on. But I haven’t been asked directly any questions, just CCd on this email chain. I’m hoping to professionally bring this up with her and not burn any bridges - I was hoping to have them as a fallback for another summer internship and she offered to write me a letter of recommendation. But idk now if my work is such shit apparently. Advice?

More on the project if you’re interested:

Over summer I was given a project to collect and synthesize census data over several decades. The two weeks I was there I was told to record all of my steps and create a read.me file. But there’s some complications with the project . A lot of terms differentiated back throughout time (Black Population was Negro Population) and some of these definitions changed the data (People per Household was Families per Household... but that didn’t involve people who were unrelated for example). Then I had to calculate some statistics myself (such as labor statistics) and many files had to be hand recorded from old PDFs. Then they wanted to combine similar titles into a master file to run large statistics on. 

So anyways it was a bit messy but I did the best I could to record everything I did, uploaded my scripts and raw data files to github etc. Uploaded the PDFs, definitions of attributes, and talked about what things changed through time. I only had two weeks to record all of this (didn’t know I had to do it at the time and wasn’t told to until later).  My boss okayd everything and I left on good terms. Boss offered to write me a letter of rec and other boss told me I was welcome to another summer internship. Now I’m torn.

**tl;dr: Old boss has me copied on an email chain with a new intern who is finishing a project I worked on months ago. Intern is bad mouthing me and my work and I find it to be inappropriate. What do I do to keep professionalism?**"

7z9jn6,6,2018-02-21,I have accomplished nothing in my life.,DumpAccount56,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7z9jn6/i_have_accomplished_nothing_in_my_life/,"(Long) - Need all the help I can get. 

Literally everything and anything that I have ever done has been given to me. I feel useless and bored. In high school, my parents pushed me to volunteer. The only girlfriend I've ever had was the one who showed interest in me and was pretty transparent until I asked. This ""prestigious"" camp I got into after 11th grade accepted me because my brother was one of the best ones there in his year. My parents have paid for all of my college tuition and mistakes and never complained. During my freshman year, they asked me if there was anything they could do to convince me to go to an instate college and I scoffed at them, but I should have. It would have saved them so much money and stress. 

I'm nearing the end of my junior year and I have never had an internship or job. My parents don't want me working at a service or retail job, but all the other jobs are difficult or I don't have any motivation. All my friends are thriving in college and doing well, meanwhile whenever it comes to me, my fraternity is brought up but it's a joke. I went to events as a joke because my brother was a DKE at Cornell, but I joined the same fraternity at IU where it's super easy to get into. Even I think of the organization as a discount version of actual fraternities. I was the risk manager for a semester and I survived by being kinda drunk at the door and my friends would always be like ""Gotta help him"" and do my job with me and make it easier. So I couldn't even be a risk manager by myself. The only reason I stick around is because I have few friends and there are select individuals that I'm close with but other than that I could not care less for the frat. The only thing I could assume as myself is my grades as I've rarely gotten help, but that makes me feel even worse because I only have a 3.1 GPA in Policy Analysis which seems to be a useless major. I'm too scared to get help for classes, that I end up acting like I know what I'm doing and then organizing study groups so I can learn from the other kids. I can't even help myself by talking to the teacher. The only times I've been motivated to work out and help myself has been in high school when I joined the crew team and everyone worked together and the times I tripped on acid and decide to work on myself. I can't even get the motivation to start or teach myself discipline. I can stop myself from smoking nicotine and weed only for a bit and then I crave it so badly for a week so I can't even accomplish quitting these two. 

I sound like a whiny little brat but every time I go to a psychatrist to get some advice or help in whatever I'm doing, all we do is talk about how doing all this makes me feel. I know how it makes me feel so it doesn't help and I spiral even worse. I binge-eat and waste money. I start wanting to drink more and I've lost 4 phones in the last year from blacking out and I just increase the burden on my parents and they're the most amazing people. They're already struggling because they're the most responsible siblings in their family and are taking care of the grandparents on both sides. (with help from their siblings, but they're doing the most work even though they live in a different country) 

The only reason I want to keep living is because I'm the most goddamn expensive investment my parents made and I'm determined to make them happy, but I can't do anything. Soon I might move back in with them to reduce costs and start a job nearby but the real reason is because I can't find a job and they need to hold my hand the whole time and are helping me by making me talk to our family friends parents and ask for a job. I just can't do anything alone. But I will. One day. It just hasn't been like that for the last 20 years of my life and I feel bad about it. If you read this all, thanks. 

TL;DR - My parents have always given me anything I need to the point that I can't really do anything and I might have to move back in with them and burden them even more.

7z9x3i,2,2018-02-21,Convince me why I should not become an Accountant(CPA).,crispytank,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7z9x3i/convince_me_why_i_should_not_become_an/,"TLDR::Business Analyst tasked with many financial/accounting duties and living in a big city. Want to leave said city, get certified, and either work for small CPA office or start my own in a small town. But is it worth it in the end?



Hello all!

After years of working for startups and working my way up through the ranks as a business analyst (focused on revenue), i have learned how to at least package a business's balance sheet to be delivered to our accounting department. Additionally, my wife and I have also spun up a LLC, began investing in retirements, light day trading, etc - so I am learning more and more about the tax code beyond a basic ""HR BLOCK"" return. This has lead me to have enough confidence in myself to take night classes at a local college to become a CPA.

My goal is that I can one day escape the city and return to my country/redneck upbringings and either join an existing CPA office or simply start my own practice, since my current career is pretty limited to working in tech centralized and/or dense metro areas. I plan that the career transition should take around 5-10 years. 1-2 years for certification, 3-5 to transition into the roll full time, after that gauge the industry to either get hired or hire staff. I am 28 yrs old, extremely happy with how life has turned out so far but always looking to better me and my wife's situation (but aren't we all ;P).

The concerns I have of the accounting life cycle are as follows:

**1) Actually getting Certified** - It appears that after I get the degree, but I have to basically intern under a CPA for one year? Can my past experience be considered at all? If not, then am I going to have take serious pay cut an be a pee-on intern for that year, then what(leads into #2)?

**2) Salary** - After interning for a year, is it still worth it? The avg salary for a CPA in my area(central TX) is about $66k. I make about $70k currently with only a few years experience. The CPA salary max is about $98k, where as my current career path gets upwards of $120k *(working towards director position, if no CPA, then I plan on an MBA or take additional comp sci/finance/data science courses to keep en edge)*. I may have naively thought that accounts/CPA's made far more than ~$66k a year. Do small town CPA's have enough business to stay comfortable outside of tax season? Seems like building a book of business from the local companies to stay afloat, but I'm sure my rates would have to be lower in comparison, no?

**3) Existential Crisis/Why did I become a CPA?** - Imagine everything went flawless, I have my own CPA office in a small town making a nice wages in consideration to my surroundings and everything is going great. Then I slowly discover that X,Y,Z make doing this line of work unbearable. What would X,Y,Z be? In other words, what aspects of the being an accountant really dulls the sheen on that shiny accounting certification? I am literally a robot, absolutely love working with numbers and crunching through towers of data to delivery concise summaries - but are there any catches to being the ""numbers guy""?

I appreciate your input, anything from personal anecdotes to insights to the clandestine under belly of the accounting world are exactly what I want to hear!

Thank you very much!

Sometimes I tend to overthink the decisions that are very important to me so this may sound a little bit complicated. So, I am in my last year in college and I will soon graduate. Now, I have to think about what I am going to do next. My choices are:

1. Choose a master degree in another country ( and possible get better opportunities and jobs than those in my country, but on the other hand I will have to pay for rent, clothes, food, a loan, etc. + I may not find a job at all and lose money)
2. Choose a master degree in my hometown (I am pretty much bored with this uni and the city but I get to stay with my parents and save up some money; it`s a capital so I have pretty much everything I need)
3. Postpone the master degree for later and take an internship or a summer job, possibly in the US. ( this is temporary).
4. Take a master degree in my hometown and go to another country for a semester with Erasmus.

I have to say that my parents are not 'annoying' at all as some other people my age use to say and it s not a problem for me to stay with them, but sometimes I feel like I need to leave even if it breaks my heart and makes me feel selfish. Anyway, even if they don`t want me to leave, they are supportive and they will accept any decision I take.

I'm a third year computer science major here and I don't know what to do. I feel worthless and hopeless, I don't even really know what. 

I feel totally alone. I lived on campus my first year and failed to connect with anyone, even my roommate, and felt like people didn't like me. I overheard my roommate, on several occasions, telling his friends not to invite me out places when they tried to invite me. For my second year, and this year, I moved back home with my parents and am commuting for financial reasons. I haven't made any friends in my classes no matter what I try, and anyone I've met through clubs and organizations already have their own group of friends and don't have time for or want me. I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone to spend their time on me. I used to just ignore how it made me feel but I can't do it anymore and I want so bad to have someone who cares about me and I can talk to. 

Academically I keep flipping between doing really good or doing average to below average, and I feel like everyone else in my major is better than me. I'm afraid for the future because I don't think anyone will want to hire me when it seems like everyone else is so good at everything, and lots have complex projects they've accomplished in their own time or cool internships and work experience. I feel unmotivated because I feel like there's nothing I can do to keep up or stand out. 

Every day I wish that I could just go back to my first year and start over and do everything differently, this feeling of loneliness and inadequacy makes every day exhausting, I feel like I'm not me anymore and I'm just on autopilot, like it's not even worth it. 

I'm sorry for my blog but I just need to talk about this with someone and hopefully hear that it'll get better. I'm trying to meet people and do better but I always fail and I'm right back where I started. "
7zb5ks,94,2018-02-21,I am a young adult who has received a life-changing windfall... now what?,Another_Millenial,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7zb5ks/i_am_a_young_adult_who_has_received_a/,"*Disclaimer: Yes I have read the r/personalfinance wiki on windfalls, as well as a few other books relating to handling windfalls. However, not many of them are good for focusing in on FIRE in my opinion (maybe I am reading the wrong books?). I have been sitting on this money for a a period of time now, and am feeling emotionally ready to start making it work for me.*


Hello fellow friendly folk of r/financialindependence,

I am in a situation not many people my age (&lt;25) find themselves in, and would appreciate any advice or insight you would have for someone like me. We've all been asked the question of ""if you had a million dollars, what would you do?"" and I am sure all of us at some point have fantasized on receiving such a windfall. In my case that fantasy is a reality, and due to such a unique situation I am kind of at a loss of what to do. Below is a brief summary of my situation:


* I have received a sum of money to the tune of $1,030,000 as a result of a personal injury lawsuit. Due to the state I live in, this money is untaxed, so I literally just have this sum of money sitting in a savings account earning me essentially nothing in interest. I am aware keeping it in one place is risky and am considering which direction I should take to diversify this risk while helping realize my FIRE goals.


* I am graduating from college with a STEM degree complimented with valuable industry internship experience that is strong enough to get me a full time career in my field of study if I choose to work upon graduating. As of writing this post my goal is to figure out my future before I commit to either starting a career or doing something else with my time.


* The personal injury I sustained is predicted to give me lifelong complications in terms of health and finances which I will need to consider when planning out the rest of my life.


* I live in a HCOL city that is always going to be a desirable location, and ideally I would like to stay in the area for the rest of my life because I like being close to family. Real estate will always retain value here, and being a homeowner is something I am interested in. On the flipside I am aware that this sum of money might be enough for me to FIRE immediately in a cheaper state in the US.


* I have told absolutely zero people the exact amount of money I have, but people close to me do know that I am sitting on wealth due to the nature of how I got my injury. I have not given anyone a frame of reference for what I am worth. 


* I am incredibly frugal by nature with how I spend my money, living on around a budget of $1,500-$1,700 a month. I have not used any of my settlement to support myself. Like many of you, I view money as a tool for freedom rather than a tool used to solely buy material possessions. I don't mind living a frugal lifestyle and since I have never really experienced lifestyle inflation, I aim to keep it that way.


* To my knowledge I have no tax advantaged space I can utilize except for either a Roth or Traditional IRA. I do not have access to a 401k as of this time, or to my knowledge other tax advantaged accounts. Right now I have no money in any tax advantaged spaces except for old 401ks (~800 if I had to guess) from previous employers that I intend to put somewhere. I have not opened up an IRA because I am unsure given my situation which one would be the most beneficial.


* I have zero debts, and am reasonably debt-averse unless it makes financial sense to carry debt (i.e. mortgage property so I can invest the money elsewhere).

As of right now I am putting together a list of Certified Financial Planners/other wealth management professionals and reviewing the different ways folks in the financial industry make their commission before I decide to hire someone so I don't get taken advantage of. Ideally I would like to be able to manage my finances entirely on my own and am more than willing to put in the time to learn how. At the same time, I recognize I really only have one shot at making my money work for me correctly so I am hesitant to take this journey alone without honest professional advice.

My question to r/financialindependence is this: if you were in my situation, what would you do regarding making your money work for you? Would you hire a professional adviser, and if so what would you look out for when picking one? Would you start a career? Get into real estate? Become a home owner? Start your own company? Invest your money and live off the dividends, and if so, where would you invest your money?

As you can tell there is a lot of opportunity for great success, and for great failure. I am hoping that you guys can take a look at my situation with financial independence in mind, so any help, insight, or tips are genuinely appreciated! Thank you in advance for your time and thoughts."

7zbalf,5,2018-02-21,How to deal with being a narcissist’s target?,docilecat,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7zbalf/how_to_deal_with_being_a_narcissists_target/,"TL;DR: My Naunt verbally attacks my body, intellect, personality, achievements/skills every time we’re together, as well as tries to make me feel like my boyfriend is too good for me. I no longer know how to deal after trying many approaches.

I have on and off been my Naunt’s choice target for bullying over the last decade (I’m 21F). It’s “off” when she realizes she’s walking on eggshells with my parents, but she always eventually goes back to tormenting me. When I was 12 my parents banned her from coming to our house because of her treatment of me, but she smartened up for a few months then again, reverted.

Here’s a brief background on myself since my parents seem to think I’m treated this way because she is threatened by me. I’m in my final year of university doing a chemistry degree, I’m naturally very petite and am active, and I am not insecure/I am someone who actively stands up for myself and other people. I am also in a 3yr relationship. (She has no post secondary education and has fluctuating body weight issues). 

I have gone to therapy to learn how to deal with this, but if I greet her insults with humour, denial, agreement or even if I fire back at her or even blatantly ignore her, it never stops! There are people in my family and her husband’s family that have gone NC because of her.

My Naunt is extremely social and can win anyone over, it takes knowing her for a year or so before her true colours show. The reason I can’t go NC with her is because she hosts all the family gatherings for holidays/anniversaries/etc, I’m not willing to miss out on time with the rest of my family because of her. (It’s a large family).

I’ve had my final straw recently. She’s always inviting me out, which I usually decline but once in awhile try to give a chance. She invited me to a closed event shopping party through her gym, where we get 25% off our purchase at an expensive athletic wear store. She picked me up, and forced me to sit on the muddy seat cover her dog uses (her friend was in the front). I tried to take it off but couldn’t since all the buckles were concealed, so she looks at me and says “I guess *that’s* where a college education gets you” then drives off so I *have* to sit on it and dirty my pants. So we’re on the way there, and she starts asking about my job (I have a well-paying job in my field), I finish telling her and her friend and my Naunt’s immediate response is “well I guess even people with shitty personalities can get lucky with their job”.  I was taken aback and just laughed it off. She then starts asking about my boyfriend’s internship, so I shared good news about that and she turns to her friend and says “now *that’s* someone with a good personality, good for him”. I just didn’t talk to her for the rest of the drive. We arrive and do our shopping, when I go to pay, it miraculously turns out the discount didn’t apply to me and I had to pay full price. I’m not sure if this part was an intentional set up of hers but it wouldn’t surprise me if it was. Then they left without getting me after making me wait 40 mins and made me chase them down a block to catch up. As I’m walking behind them she starts asking about how much I spent and what I bought. I told her I got some shorts on sale that were originally very expensive, and she jokingly said “oh man shorts would only be worth that price if they took 10lbs off your ass” and I jokingly replied “haha well I’m not sure I would want them then!” because of my small frame, including my butt. She then stops dead in the centre of the sidewalk, turns around and says “what are you laughing about? You shouldn’t be laughing at all” so I asked what she meant. “You have the flattest ass ever, you shouldn’t be laughing”. Then she looks me up and down, turns back around, and keeps walking. I got dropped off at home, and since then my aunt tries tagging me on photos, posts funny things to my fb wall, asks me to hangout. I’m tired of the gaslighting! She is cruel to me **every** time we’re together and then the second we’re apart she acts like everything is fine and we’re best friends. This is a regular series of events! 

I’ve decided to be LC; not be in touch with her at all aside from family gatherings, but I don’t know how to handle her behaviour anymore, she is narcissistic in general and everyone suffers but she is only this evil with me. Comments like “well it’s a good thing you have a pretty face...” (because apparently I lack brains) and things of the sort are far too common. Help."

The need to breed (Multi-prompt),DPPscenefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7zbk2e/m4f_i_feel_the_need_the_need_to_breed_multiprompt/,"So as you can tell from the title, I really want to knock you up.... or at least put in a lot of work where I'm barebacking and filling you up with as much cum as I can possible give you. The question to ask is how did it come to this, well luckily we can come up with a few *fertile* scenarios to *impregnate* with lust.

**Husband's Best Friend**- So your husband and yourself have been trying to conceive and it hasn't been stuck, not for a lack of effort. After doubting yourself you convinced him that you both need to be tested, only to find out that he has an incredibly low sperm count that would make it next to impossible to give you what you want.  After you both secretly confide in me what is going on, I offer to help out just planning on donating some sperm. But the cost that it would take is a little out of the price range that the two of you can afford, so we reach a deal where you are able to call me when you are ovulating and we fertilize the egg, the old fashion way.

**The Biological Clock**- You've been single all your life, not wanting to get married... but wanting to be a mom. Adoption agency aren't in a rush for single business women, but you can feel the clock starting to tick down. Do you want to seduce the young intern in the office or maybe hash out a deal for a FWB deal with your black co-worker.

I have a few more ideas brewing, but they don't feel like full scenes just yet, if you are into helping craft a new scene and turning it into something.... I'm more then happy to *reproduce* with you"
7zbl6x,22,2018-02-21,I can't stop crying.,SirGraq,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7zbl6x/i_cant_stop_crying/,"She broke up with me yesterday. 3 1/2 years. We'd talked about how our wedding was going to be, kids, etc. She was unhappy because I haven't been able to get my shit together for the last 2 1/2 years. Took me forever to find an internship to graduate, and here I am unemployed 2 years after graduating. In the last couple of weeks or so I feel like I'm finally getting my shit together. I've been networking recently and I was feeling like I was finally making actual progress. 

Yesterday I got home from my therapist and she tells me the news. We're long distance, have been since I graduated. She said there's to much resentment from the last few years. She needs space. That even if I magically found a job tomorrow she would still be unhappy. She said if she didn't do this now she wouldn't have the strength to do it later. 

I can't stop crying. I found a fucking shirt she had given me years ago and I started balling my head off. All the plush toys and little things she's given me over the years set me off. My phone is full of pictures and random videos. I know things are supposed to get better with time but right now I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know which way is up."

I really need advice. I [M 25] recently moved back to my home town to move into my parents old home that they're renting to me. They bought another house 75 ft away that they're living in now. Im not signing a lease so I'm not legally bound to the property, but ill be here for a little while (less than a year) because I benefit so much from being here (very cheap rent, low cost of living, 2 acres of land, quiet). It's a really small town (800 ppl), but it's very comfortable. My boyfriend [M 23] who is from France and here on a Tourist Visa is planning to live with me for a few months while his visa is active. Weve been together for 7 months. We actively planned this out while on an internship together. I believe this is the perfect opportunity for our relationship to grow and prosper and hoping our time together leads to marriage potentially. We love each other so much.

Here's my problem. I recently accepted a fulltime position for a job within my concentration/major that pays a decent starting wage and health benefits. The job is 1 hour away from my home so that's 10 hours a week I'll be commuting back and forth to work. My boyfriend doesn't have a car and will literally be trapped at home while I'm working. Theres absolutely nothing here for him besides me. I'd be sacrificing so much time with him for my job. I'll be able to spend a maximum of 3-4 hours a day with him when I'm not sleeping, working or taking care of my dog.

I recently got another offer for a job that pays a little less, but even out because it's 20 minutes away, completely unrelated to my concentration/major, seasonal, part-time (30hr weeks), very flexible hours, will pay all of my bills with little extra. I'll have so much time with my boyfriend and the job will be a lot of fun for me.  This job can perfectly revolve around our lives. 

I talked to my parents about it and of course they want me to take the job that helps me career wise, but hurts my relationship with my boyfriend. They live to work and both commute 2 hours per day to work and back. 

I haven't talked to my boyfriend yet, because he'll get so excited and will put emotional pressure on me to take the second one. I'd do it for him.

I need honesty. I value my relationship so much, but I also value my career path. What do you think?

It’s just kind of a short term thing to gain some experience and get some money in my pocket until my summer internship with a public accounting firm. 

I started off whatever and started to low key think I would fired (it’s probably all in my head). However since then I have been picking up things really fast and have starting to knock out a ton of work. At first I was happy I was impressing my boss but now I’m a little worried. He has been giving me less time to do work recently and I don’t have as much time to homework/fix schedule/browse internet. Last week I was able to schedule every meaningful thing on google calendar until my summer internship. This week I have been putting every ufc and football event into my calendar but due to the increased workload I can’t.


So how do I slow down and look like I’m doing a lot of work but actually not pushing myself too hard?"

[NSFW]",TheIrishWerewolf,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/7zcbdh/m4f_various_prompts_including_rape_bestality/,"So, i'm going to make this short and simple. I'm going to post a whole bunch of prompts i'm interested in doing. Some involve bestality, while others involve more lighter things.

You work at a dog kennel within your small town, its an internship while you go to a veterinary school. This means you often have to take the night shifts while dedicating the day to school. One night you are working rather late, only one there. There is a rather large storm going on outside and your ready to go home, all you have to do is clean out the last of the kennels. Though, this kennel contains the more aggressive dog(s), meaning you usually have to take the dogs out before cleaning it. Though, you skip that step, wanting to get home as fast as you can. Right as you enter the kennel, and start to clean the lights shut off.. The electronic lock shutting, and leaving you all to yourself, and the dog(s)

You are out hunting, its one of your favorite past times since you were a child and spent it with your family. You miss that feeling so you decide to bring your dog(s) along as company. Though they've been acting strange lately, staring at you and sniffing at your crotch. You don't think much of it at the time until you make the mistake of bending over, your dog biting into your pants, leaving a rather large and revealing hole..

You are a young girl, still a virgin and never once has had the thought of experiencing sex. Though that changed once you started to view online porn, you were craving it, but had no one. That's when you spotted your dog, laying against your door with a full erection. You just found your first ever fuck buddy. But how will you get his attention? Shove a doggy treat up your pussy, maybe go right for it and suck him off? Thats all up to you.

You are the trophy wife everyone could ask for, the girl everyone desired. Your husband though is sadly out of town on a work trip. You are craving cock, though you promised him long ago you wouldn't ever cheat on him with another man.. Though, that's when it hit you. A dog isn't a man, its a mans best friend..

You are a beginner Pokemon trainer, and managed to get a variety of Pokemon from your father from his old days of training. One day you were bored, alone within a nearby forest. That's when got the thought, ""What Pokemon has the biggest and most pleasuring cock?"" your new mission wasn't to collect them all, it was to fuck them all..

You are an operator from any unit within the Rainbow Six Siege universe. You are the hostage, though your rescue team doesn't seem be arriving anytime soon. Your captors, deciding to take full advantage of the situation. (Ill be any operator you want!)

This takes place in a world where both furies, and humans exist. Though there is a twist! The furry's are slaves to the human kind, some are forced into manual labor, some are forced into.. Well, you could guess it. (I'm willing to be a furry dominated by a female, or be a male dominating a furry!~)

This is another furry one, i am a young orphan human boy. You are a young furry girl, your family recently decided to adopt me. This allowed for the both of us to get very.. Close. After all, i'm not technically your real brother!

Those are the few ideas i have, if you'd like to try any of them just hit me up on kik, please include your kinks along with the idea you want to try, and i'm open to any other ideas if you wish to try em. The password is ""boi"" so include that anywhere in your message.

Now fast forward two years. My salary is at ~$63,000 and I just got a job offer (it's a promotion to a higher level) within the same company. I have all the security clearances and certifications required to do the job. So guess what they offer me? $65,000.... And this is a promotion.... So, I countered to about 15% more than that, because it is a move up to Denver and it is more responsibility... but feeling like a total idiot for not negotiating my first jobs salary. I feel they were able to low-ball me because they were able to see my current salary.

I live in NYC, he lives in Arizona on the Mexican border. I went to college with him and then we both moved to Utah together for our internship. That was back in 2015. We were just friends. I liked him, but I didn't do anything about it because I knew we only had 5 months together in Utah before moving away from each other.  But while living in Utah, we literally spent all of our free time together and even went on a few road trips together.

We lost touch for a year or so because I went through a major life change, we both were Mormon, but I left the religion.  It was a major life change, I faced shunning from the religion and friends and family. It was a HUGE change, so I basically stopped talking to everyone while I figured out who I was without the religion.  We recently started taking again in the past few months. And all of it came back. We will talk for 3 hours multiple times a week. We never run out of things to talk about. I miss him so much, my heart hurts I miss him so much. I haven't seen him in three years! But my heart misses him like it has never missed anyone else.

I graduate from grad school this May and have considered moving out to Arizona to be close to him. But I feel like that's crazy, we've never actually dated. 

I don't know what to do. First of all, we live thousands of miles from each other, second of all, he is still mormon, he doesn't know I left the religion either. I know that sounds silly, but we can't be together because of that. But I love him, I miss him. What do I do? I'm sick of my heart hurting like this. It's been three years since I've seen him. Why is this happening? What do I do about it?"

7zdi9e,5,2018-02-22,I [21/M] just learned that my gf [21/F] doesn't have any feelings toward me anymore for now,Throwawayinopenfield,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7zdi9e/i_21m_just_learned_that_my_gf_21f_doesnt_have_any/,"I don't know who to talk to about this. I've been crying for the past 3 days and I just want to tell someone, anyone about how I'm feeling.  This is the story from my point of view with a lot of bias, and I really appreciate any opinion or feedback, no matter how hurtful it is.    
  
I screwed up. We are in a LDR spanning almost 12 hours timezones, and we've only been able to spend some of our breaks together. It was amazing. My depression prevented me from enjoying it sometime, but we were best friends and we enjoyed exploring and learning new things together. We do everything together and we talk every day and night, what over each other's sleep, plan a future together once we leave school and can settle down.  
  
One thing about our relationship tho is that it's rough. We aren't the best at communication and we both have a lot of insecurities and bottled up emotions. Sometime, even the smallest misunderstanding on a Skype call can blow up into an argument. Within the last year we almost broke up 3 times already. Each time it takes around 2-3 days before everything settle down and we make up, trying to learn from what happened. It doesn't help that we're both in college and studying very hard while looking for internship, so the argument is usually coupled with tons of stress on both sides.  
      
So about what happened. It was a particularly bad day for me, my dad just dragged me because of my grade (which is really not bad at all), and I just failed my two recent tests, and I have so much work pending that I can't see how I can finish them. It was around 11PM where I am and 10AM where she is.  
She just came back from watching Black panther, which is a movie we both really liked. We talked a bit about it and it was really nice, until she mentioned when they were in Busan, which is in South Korea where we both visited (she spent a semester there). I mentioned how it was weird that the woman they talked to was Chinese and not Korean because of how she sounded. To be fair, her accent was strange even for native Hanguo speaker's ears, and I thought it sounded much more like Mandarin. She face palmed and started making fun of me for being an Asian and still be racist like that.  
Look, I get that it was a joke, but for me at the time it did not feel funny. I told her that was not what I meant and I just thought she seemed like people from the Chinese streets we saw in Seoul. She asked if I'm insinuating that immigrants were bringing in troubles then. At that point I just yelled out ""No!"" and went silent. Then I asked her to not make fun of me for not knowing something without attempting to explain it first. She said that would make her sounds like an asshole. I replied that she sounded like an asshole right then.  
We went silent for about 15 mins. I hoped for her to say something, maybe an apology, maybe an explanation. I feel like she might be thinking about what to say and didn't want to cut her off. But after a while she just left her seat and went out of the screen. I waited there for a little longer before having to go to sleep because I have class at 9AM. On my bed I hear her voice and the sound of Skype closing.  
  
Next morning, I woke up from a nightmare. I thought I would share it with her, kinda as a probe to start a conversation and see if she's mad at me. There were no response. I just went to classes as usual. Then in the middle of my class I received a message from her saying that because of last night she skipped her classes, will skip a presentation and is hurting and does not have the energy to validate my feelings right now. She said that I was giving her the silent treatment and disappeared without resolving what I said, which made her feel like she fucked up and drained all of the energy out of her day. I was completely blindsided and confused. I replied that I'm sorry for overreacting and just wanted to learn something without feeling stupid about it first. She replied that she was just joking around and this kind of humor is something she is not willing to change for me, and if this is something I'm not willing to compromise then we can't be friends anymore.  
I was absolutely numbed. This was really not that big of a deal for me and right here is where I should have just backed off and realize we're both compromised right now. But no, my idiotic ass decided to get worked up about it, as I can't see how this is an issue that's worth our relationship. I made the EXTREMELY stupid mistake of trying to explain how it feels like to me, as I felt like I'm being condescended upon and my feelings invalidated. I compared how I felt to if I made fun of her for not having a job while she's owing me money, which is such a terrible thing to do. If I can go back I would punch my own guts out for saying something that I know she's insecure about and ruined the trust between us. But I was angry. I guess that excuse it /s?  
After that she claimed that she cannot stay with someone who would consider not knowing a movie fact to being a freeloader. I quickly realized my mistake and started trying my best to back track and apologize. I really didn't mean it like that. I guess I was really angry about how she keeps bringing our relationship on the line when we have arguments. It might have been some build up resentment, because to me, she either doesn't care enough about it, or she's exploiting it to shut down any arguments from me. Any of those options are painful to me. It didn't even occur to me that she may just thought it was something that we can't move on without resolving first. I know that she's angry too, and when she's angry she's just so cruel. Like, she would act like I mean absolutely nothing to her, replying to my message with this technicality tone that's just chilling considering the subject, constantly remarking how we're done now, how she won't be there to find out when I become abusive to get. But I don't care. At that point I was just at damage control mode, crying non stop in my room and trying to salvage whatever I can so that once we come around we will heal faster. I just started blaming myself for everything and do anything I can to deescalate the situation.    
  
Our conversation lasted for days, in which she just claim that we have broken up and she started paying back the money I lend her and make plans on returning my gifts and mementos. This absolutely devastated me as I take some pride in being able to support her and help when I can, and seeing our relationship being undone in just horrifying. Everytime she sent a text denoting how she'll buy me a replacement headphone or pay me back by next week, I just break down crying because I'm such a fucking monster for ruining our trust and say that dumb sentence. There are so many claw marks on my body now. But I still believe in us. We've survived so much and we made plans for pretty much forever. I still love her and I just tried to reply to those messages with pleas to give us a chance and tried to show my acknowledgement of my mistakes.  
  
It all accumulated to now. She replied to me that it's not just about what happened. That she actually has no feelings for me right now. She said That may change in the future, but right now she thinks that this is for the best.  
I just dropped to the floor and cried for what felt like hours (but is probably just minutes). Finally, I gathered a little bit of myself and replied that I'm so sorry for interferring with her decision to leave. I'll always be here if she needs me, and I asked her to stay safe.  
That just happened an hour ago. There was so much more that I wanted to say. I won't leave her because I made a promise, and even if I don't feel anything for her I would still stay because I made a commitment. Feelings come and go but I love her because I want to be with her eventually and I want us both to grow into a healthy couple. I am so depressed that I actually didn't eat or drink anything for a whole day (it's funny how heartache stops hunger). But I'll hold on and won't do anything stupid because I need to have a home ready for when she needs me.  
Now I can do nothing but wait. I don't want to say anything cheesy or post about my pain on social media because I really don't want to interfere with her process. I don't want to manipulate her into staying with me if it's truly toxicating to do so. Reddit anonymity is my only outlet rn, and I need you guys'help. What should I do to cope now? How should I brace myself if we never get back together? I can't imagine myself without her and my room is covered in our pictures and postcards. I don't know what I'll do.

7zdqww,16,2018-02-22,Me [23F] with my boss[67F] taking advantage of my fellowship hours/working me overtime,Saraisa23,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7zdqww/me_23f_with_my_boss67f_taking_advantage_of_my/,"If this should be referred to a different subreddit, let me know. So I've recently graduated. During my last semester, I started a paid fellowship at a small company (about 6 employees), that's well respected in my industry. The school pays me my stipend. It covers my rent short of $50. My parents send what they can for food while I transition. My boss is a successful alum of my university. After I graduated my boss offered for me to continue the internship since I didn't complete the hours to receive the full stipend. She also said I could be trained and take over her production assistant's position for March while he went to visit family overseas. Every time we trained she would beam and say how excited she was to see us become a great production team.

At the end of January, I completed the hours to receive the rest of my stipend. My boss said she'd extend my internship as an alum and the school would continue to pay me. As February progressed we had a large industry event to prepare for. I usually worked 3-4 days a week. My boss asked me to start coming in 6 days one week, and then the next week I worked 8 days straight. I did this expecting more hours to be reported to the school and to be paid accordingly. When I tried to confirm my hours with the school, they told me that they can only pay the first stipend and that's it. Anything beyond that was out of their hands. My boss also ignored emails to confirm my hours from me and the school. When I asked her about it yesterday she played dumb and said she knows nothing about my hours. She asked why I had to get the school involved (maybe because they pay me??) and she told me to go talk to the production assistant about my hours. When I asked him he said she told him to stop discussing my hours and stipend with me!

When she finally confirmed with the school it was only for a little over half the hours I worked for January and she wants to hold back the rest of the stipend until I finish working for her in March. Along with that, she changed the conditions for March. She only wants me there two half days a week. Not full time anymore. She said, ""That should be enough time for you to find something else."" I was holding onto this for so long, hoping to have a good first job out of school in a high position. I feel so taken advantage of. I want to quit and just get my full stipend and pay my needs for March while I look for other work. I also want to demand she pay me for the hours I worked beyond the stipend. I did so many things preparing for the event especially since most of the office caught the flu. 

I just don't know how to not leave things on a sour note. I want a good reference on my resume and I don't know if I should bother demanding those extra hours paid or just collect the remaining stipend and go. She wants me in again next Wednesday now and I don't feel its right to continue to work another day for her. My mom wants me to report her to the Department of Labor but I feel that may be drastic. 

I'm not a bad employee. I'm on time, I'm respectful and enthusiastic. Everyone says I'm sweet and get along well. I always stay after the time I'm supposed to leave. My boss complimented on all the work I did for the event and the precise skill of it and said she appreciates having me around. Now it's as if she pulled the rug from under me. Because I see through her now and how she took advantage of my position for free labor and I think she's pissed and being vengeful. All because I asked why she wouldn't confirm my hours.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Continued a paid fellowship after graduation. Boss promised me a full-time position and worked me beyond stipend hours. Boss lied about extending fellowship for continued payment. Boss won't confirm all hours with school. Boss withdrew full-time position plan. Boss owes me money for hours worked beyond stipend limit. Should I demand the money for hours worked beyond? Should I quit now for my own moral sake? Should I just take the stipend and accept it? Should I report her to the Dept of Labor?"

The issue is when I click Lookup and it gives me the column headings to choose, not all the ones in the specific list are available. The columns I need to link in the lookup aren't an option for me to choose.
Any ideas at how I can select any column i need. 
the idea is to basically create a template to link to lists: 
process - sub process - risks - controls . 
This is all fine, however I want to also have other columns in these lists to automatically appear, as the goal is to automatize as much as possible, so a user only needs to select a process, which then gives certain columns, then linking the process with a sub process, and again the sub process shows more columns from that list , and so on with risks, and controls.

7zf738,2,2018-02-22,"Go solo, hit that send button, and land your dream internship!",internshipabroad,InternshipHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternshipHelp/comments/7zf738/go_solo_hit_that_send_button_and_land_your_dream/,"There’s an old saying: ‘If at first, you don’t succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.’ Wise words, especially when applying for career advancing opportunities and internships.
 

Have you developed a yearning for an especially juicy foreign summer internship? If so, chances are that shed loads of others have too. Welcome to the world of summer internships — a world more competitive than formula one racing.  Competitive or not, these offer a great route to some amazing post-college opportunities.

 

Applications for internships rain down on countless organizations and various professors from top colleges, as applicants hope against the odds of landing a dream internship to set their head spinning with delight.  It’s a lot to ask. Especially since a high proportion of applicants are already qualified up to their armpits. Is the competition tough? You bet.

 

The basic math is easy. More applicants, less chance of success. Hence, unless you make the first move and go at it solo, there’s more chance of a unicorn winning the Kentucky Derby than landing your dream summer internship.

 

It may seem like more fun than a day at Coney Island to apply for internship programmes along with your friends – the camaraderie of the group, and all that. But, tempting as this sounds, think about it. A company or professor may have 50 applications and only three places to offer. This makes things much more difficult for applicants.

 

Performance is important:
When an intern joins a company or interns under a professor, the professor or company get a chance to test the intern’s mettle during their tenure. If they’re happy with your performance and you haven’t broken any of the furniture a job offer may be made after graduation. So, remember, even if you and your best buddy ever land in an internship programme together, you would still be competing like knights in a jousting tournament in case a job opportunity were to come up later.

 

Finding the right internship:
Moreover, the process of searching for and finding the right internship can be as boring as watching a snail race. You would already have a cold-called or emailed all the professors and organizations you wished to intern with. You’d have spent week after week preparing and perfecting your resumes and cover letters, researching your field, and following up for responses. The $64,000 question is: Would you want to throw all that away by asking your friends to apply with you? And so reduce your chances of getting through?

 

Think smart, act smart, and get going. Now! Acting now will increase your chances of getting through. Here are some tips to make getting that summer internship easier:

 

Start early with the application process:
Many organizations and professors accept applications early for summer internships and as a result get buried under applications early too. Hence, the sooner you start your application process, the better are your chances of beating the competition and bagging that most elusive of creatures, the summer internship. An early start would also mean getting your resume prepared, cover letter written and research done much in advance.

 

Fly solo:
Don’t invite your best buddy to double up on the applications. Go it alone and make that impression.

 

Be discreet:
Just imagine your back in the era of the Cold War. Avoid giving away information such as who you plan to intern with, how you plan to go about applying for it and how you are preparing your resume or cover letter. While you are at it if you know anything about secret rocket fuel programs I suggest you keep these close to your chest too. Being discrete will help you ward off the enemy — sorry, the competition.

 

Use your professional network:
Professors, professional contacts, and even other students — anyone who might advance your case for the internship, without of course giving too much away. This is not selfishness. But it is about being smart.

 

Take advantage of social media and websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn too. Make professional connections, seek internship opportunities and make yourself known to those whom you wish to intern with. However, be careful of the kind of profile you create if you are using websites such as Facebook and Twitter in case you unwittingly create a negative impression. A few ill-chosen phrases are all it takes to come across as sharing many of the personality traits of  Freddy Kruger.

 

Follow relevant groups on social media:
Many organizations, communities, and colleges have official and unofficial groups on LinkedIn and Facebook where they put up information about their various internships programmes, including details on how to go about applying for them, whom to contact and when they are open. Follow these groups to keep a tab on these opportunities, and apply to them. Here is a page that contains details of various internship groups:

 

https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/gtype=groups&amp;amp;keywords=internship&amp;amp;orig=GLHD&amp;amp;rsid=140880881

486111250568&amp;amp;pageKey=voltron_federated_search_internal_jsp&amp;amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1486111244920&amp;amp;trk=global_header&amp;amp;search=Search&amp;amp;openFacets=G,L&amp;amp;page_num=2&amp;amp;pt=groups

 

Given the choice, be a tiger, not a sheep. Don’t apply for a post just because your friends and classmates have. Consider what you want to do, and do it! Know who you need to contact? Then go right ahead and contact them. By yourself.

 

Explore on your own:
After you secure that prestigious internship, don’t just hang out with people you are comfortable with. Explore on your own, dive off the topmost board into the refreshing pool of local culture, and your experience will be all the richer.

 

Don’t let others drag you down:
If you are determined to ignore my advice and decide to blab your career secrets to friends, classmates and even some professors, there’s a chance they may try to discourage you from applying. All things considered it’s best to keep things under wraps until you get through, to avoid disappointment.

 

Bag it!

Remember, you have it in you to get that dream internship that you always wanted. All you need to do is start the application process. Here are three take-aways to keep in mind to get the most out of your application process:

 

Believe in yourself. Don’t let others dissuade you from your goal. Stick your fingers in your ears and hum your favourite rock song if you have to — anything to avoid listening to worthless negative chatter.
Go solo. Don’t depend on others or wait for them to make the first move.
Get going. Do your research by yourself. Find out who you need to contact and make sure that you send that email which will get the ball rolling. And, if you are wondering where to start, enlist the help of Foreign Bound Interns – your application process would become that much easier."
7zg56r,3,2018-02-22,On J1 visa. Being badly mistreated by my employer. Idk what to do with my life..,TheManilaBro,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7zg56r/on_j1_visa_being_badly_mistreated_by_my_employer/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 20 year old fresh graduate from the Philippines. I was offered an internship in New York which got me so excited so after graduating, I flew straight to the US. 

The first couple of days were fine. I was based in an office which was sort of accessible from my home (i live in Jersey city) and my boss was really nice to me. 

After a couple of weeks, things started going downhill for me. They moved to the office farthest from my home (it takes me around 2 and a half hours to get there and another 2 and a half to go home), my new boss is treating me like shit by embarrassing me in front of the other employees (one time I was 10 mins late because the subway malfunctioned and when i got to his office he sent me back home because I was 10 mins late and he said everything out loud in front of everyone. And there are many more similar situations) and the CEO has been threatening me that if I go to the office late again, they will fire me and terminate my contract and send me home which of course I don't want because I worked so hard to get here and my family spent so much money to set me up here. 

Also, they're only paying me $500 a month and i'm paying $400 for rent, $210 for transportation and around $200 for food. My parents are devastated with my situation and they're still spending a lot of money to sustain me.

What I plan to do right now is transfer to a different host company but I don't know the process and I don't know where to start. I also can't find any company who's willing to accept j1 interns.. i'm losing hope, i'm so stressed and I feel like i'm gonna lose my mind. 

PLEASE, i'm begging all of you, HELP ME OUT. I've lost 15 pounds because I haven't been eating, I'm always sick and I cannot afford medicine.. 

I'm a 20 year old fresh graduate on j1 Visa, i finished college in the Philippines. I took up Psychology. If anyone's out there, please help me. Is there anyone out there who's willing to take in a j1 intern? Please. I'll do my very best :-(

tl;dr - I'm a j1 intern from the Philippines who's being mistreated by the company i'm working for and I need help :-("

There's nothing either of us can really do about it, but I just feel so shitty  :/ What's worse is that I was planning to work inTokyo so that we could live together after I graduate, but now I don't see an ""end"" to our long distance anymore (there are limited job opportunities for me in Osaka).

How did Avesta learn Bruce's secret? etc. etc. etc.,wsba910am,TellTaleBatmanSeries,https://www.reddit.com/r/TellTaleBatmanSeries/comments/7zhjd7/backstories_explained_where_has_catwoman_been_all/,"**Although the Gotham Gazette is Gotham's more highbrow and accustomed journal of city news, the truly dirty and macabre tell-alls of the sins of Gotham's elites are only uncovered in The Gotham Gutter, truly the filthiest and most poorly sourced watering hole of news in the now trashy city. Tales of sex, drugs, incest, betrayals, cheating, the most outlandish parties wasting taxpayer dollars, and other such nonsense flood the Gutter on every page. It's down to The Gutter we go, because the Gazette has failed once again to honor the citizens of Gotham with the truth, by refusing to get its hands dirty to explain some of Telltale Batman's truly darkest secrets.**

Catwoman, according to the ""Gotham Gutter"" tabloids has been desperately trying to keep alive a sexual affair with Alfred, Bruce's butler. From the Gutter's January 26th edition, page A6: ""*Done using Harvey to get to Bruce, and rejected by Bruce for stealing his favorite bat-toys and selling them to his nemeses to get him killed by them, Selina has tried a final avenue to get back into Bruce's destroyed life: Alfred. While Alfred has been shoeing her away whenever he catches a whiff of guano approaching the batcave, lately he's been hard-pressed trying to live two identities: as Selina's lusty paramour and Bruce's trusty butler. This has caused a great deal of strain on the poor old man-servant, leading to high blood pressure, forgotten tea times, and even a nervous breakdown in the batcave after Bruce nearly walked in on them playing footsie on the desk.*"" Episode V will likely see the return of the night kitten, and whether she betrays old Al to get Bruce's next toy, or whether Alfred has enough catnip to keep Selina purring in their fragile romance remains to be seen.

Tiffany's disappearance from the series in TEW draws on two options the player can choose. Does the player let the cat out of the bag and tell everything to this entitled and spoiled brat? Or does the player keep her at arm's length and wait for her to earn their trust back? Many players have opted to welcome the untrustworthy and impulsive teenager into Bruce's inner sanctum, nominally due to a desire to see the batgirl emerge, but mainly because the players are mostly men who are weak in the knees whenever any woman shows signs of liking to the user. That said, The ""Gotham Gutter"" also wrote a short bio on the young Fox, but only based on the realistic outcome of players opting to keep Batman's identity a secret from her instagram feed. Reporting from January 17th, this year: ""*Saddened by the explosive news of her father's demise, Tiffany has been searching for answers to life, the universe, and everything. Neglecting to help provide for a jobless mother and three hungry sisters, Tiffany dropped out of school, got her boss's boss arrested by GCPD, and has been aggressively courting a shadow government group that has demoralized the very police force her father worked so hard to uphold. The Gutter has learned from sources within the Agency that the young Fox found employment there last week, and has been making an almost four-figure salary there as an intern. She has reportedly also been rising in the ranks since her admission into this clandestine government league called The Agency, and according to multiple sources familiar with the teenager, is being considered by Waller to replace headless Agent Blake as Waller's right hand man. Waller, shocked by how close Tiffany resembles her drive for power and desire to blackmail good men, secretly - and this report comes exclusive to the Gotham Gutter - sent DNA samples of Tiffany's blood to discover a remarkable and shocking truth: Tiffany is Waller's long-lost daughter. Twenty years ago, during Waller's rise in The Agency, she met a young scientist in Sanctum named Lucius Fox, and while they had a passionate yet testy relationship, they broke up after a one night stand when Waller apparently told Lucius he works for her now and to start cooking her bacon and eggs, delivering her coffee orders, and pressing her suits. Sources familiar with the split confirm that Lucius allegedly threw her out of his studio, and Waller kept the baby a secret to nurse her wounded pride.*"" Now with Tiffany's backstory fully explained through the Gotham tabloids, what remains to be seen for the headstrong young upstart is whether she uses her newly obtained salary from The Agency to help put food on the table for her mother and sisters, or whether she continues to ignore the living in search of the dead.

And just how did Avesta learn Bruce's dirty secret? What odors did she smell that enticed her to follow windy wisps of Batman's guano right straight to the Wayne mansion? It should not come as a surprise to players of TEW that this new agent Iman Avesta is smart. Yet, in a universe where nobody knows Bruce's identity except Alfred, Tiffany, John Doe, Catwoman, and now THE ENTIRE AGENCY, Agent Avesta does not actually have to be that smart. She just has to be lucky. Nevertheless, how she came across Batman's true identity is something that the ""Gotham Gutter"" reported on in a chronicle dated back just last week to February 14th, 2018. From the Gutter: ""*Although the Gutter has previously disclosed reports detailing Alfred's moonlight kisses and sexcapades with Selina Kyle last month, Gotham Gutter journalists were surprised to see the old butler sipping wine with Agent Avesta at Gotham's famed White Rose Restaurant on Valentine's Day. Not only were journalists shocked that Alfred was dining in one of Falcone's old fronts for his money-laundering operations, or that he was two-timing Catwoman to get close to an Agency operative, or even that Alfred would need more woman than Selina could provide ........ but most that Alfred was sat on the busiest day of the year for restaurants without needing a reservation at the most popular restaurant for Gotham's beau monde. After the endless feeding each other chocolate strawberries and sloshing down glass after glass of $100 bottles of Prosecco, sources familiar with the couple's steamy intrigue discovered that Alfred spilled the beans to the Agent one night over pillow-talk.*"" Episode V leaves much to be revealed and a lot of loose threads to be tied down. Yet perhaps the biggest story of them all is: Which woman will Alfred bed down with next? Agent Waller? Tiffany? Or Commissioner Gordon's untrimmed, temptatious mustache? "
7zhycl,27,2018-02-22,Terrible Terry [mf][mff][ff][Fdom] Ch1,thethreecats22,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/7zhycl/terrible_terry_mfmfffffdom_ch1/,"I’ll start by giving some background here. I was in college at the time and dating a very special girl. Her name was Theresa, but she went by Terry. This is the story of how we met, but not how we fell in love. That is a long and disastrous story with a lot of insane encounters. I honestly have a hard time even believing it and I fucking lived it. But to start, I’ll tell you about me.

I’m about 6’1 and 175 pounds. I’m not a huge muscular guy, but I played soccer at our little D-II school on the West Coast and so I didn’t have a single ounce of fat on me (if only that were still true). I kept my hair short on the sides because of the heat, but I kept the top long so I didn’t look like I was trying to join the Marines or something. I studied Digital Media and harbored some pretty intense ambition at the time, that I’m still working on, so even then I studied my ass off.

I had just turned 21 and as anyone who has ever turned 21 in the States knows, once you turn 21 you have to buy for all your underage friends. I admit it. I served alcohol to a minor. On numerous occasions. I didn’t really go out a lot, between practice and trying to be an academic all-american, but I did have one girl *space* friend, Catherine, whom I talked to every so often. We had tentative plans to hang out and enjoy my new found liquor license that evening. She had spent the spring semester studying in France and then interning in San Diego so it had been a while since we talked.

I was expecting to hear the typical girl spiel about how amazing it was in Europe and how everything was perfect and about all her favorite wines and dinners and the amazing connections she made with local men, so I suggested she meet me after practice and I’d take her with me to get some alcohol. That way I could at least make this bearable.
As I walked off the practice field with my bag over my shoulder she ambushed me from behind.

“It’s been so longggg!” she squealed as she threw her arms around my neck. Her feet were hanging off the ground as she put all her weight on my back.

“Agh! It’s too hot for this!” I swung her off me and as I did I caught just a tiny peek of her nipple through the side of her tank top. She wasn’t wearing a bra, but she wasn’t exactly the type of girl that needed one. She was very slim and short, maybe just at 5’2 and her breasts were small, but exquisite. The kind that just seemed to fit right on her frame. Smooth and supple and she wore them well, like a fashion model almost.

She’d changed a lot since I last saw her. Her ash brown hair was cut short, just above her shoulders, and it seemed like her face had finally made that change from teenager to young adult. Everything about her was…sharper. Her eyes, her jaw, her nose. Everything seemed livelier and demanding. Maybe it was the haircut. She was wearing a dark purple tank top that draped loosely around her shoulders and frayed white denim shorts.

“You cut your hair.” I said to her to prove that I actually noticed that sort of thing.

“Do you like it?” She asked as she ran a hand through it and struck a goofy pose.

“It’s better.” I smirked and ushered her towards the car. She slapped my back lightly.

“Don’t bully me, stinky.” She retorted. I threw my bag in the trunk and stepped into the driver’s seat.

“It’s not my fault you couldn’t wait till later. I would love a cold shower right now.” I called through the window as I turned the car on and plugged the auxiliary cord into my phone. Catherine was a music junkie and I knew she would bug me to play some song or another. She fumbled around with her purse behind the trunk before throwing it in and slamming it shut.

She strutted up to the passenger door and as she swung it open I once again got a glimpse of her chest. I felt myself get a little stiff. She was my best female friend here and I’d had some close encounters with her before, but I’d never acted on them. Sure, I’d had a fap or two with her making an appearance, but I really didn’t think of her that way. She slid into the car seat and snatched my phone to start playing music. Some indie funk electro non-sense that I couldn’t understand. Then it began. She gave me the spiel. Her time in Europe. The weekend trips. The food. The culture, the art. I’d heard it before from each one of my sisters. I nodded my head and responded at the appropriate times with an “oh wow” or “yeah that’s crazy”. 

I’ll never know what prompted her to bring this next part up, but it really threw me way off. I don’t know if she noticed I wasn’t really paying attention or what, but she just threw it out there.

“I gave two guys head at the same time.” My jaw about hit the floor. She wasn’t an angel, but that was something I didn’t even consider was in her realm of possibility. I guess mainly because I didn’t even know that was a thing that happened. Consider me naïve.

“Uhh. What?” I didn’t know what else to say.

“I took a surfing lesson with this guy in Portugal when I was there for a weekend. We went out for drinks as a big group from our lesson later that night. I was definitely into him and I let him know at the beach, but that night he was being distant like guys do. I was out there dancing and then this other guy came up and got me some drinks. He apparently knew the other guy. They start talking. One thing leads to another and we are back on the beach.”“Woah. Who are you!? What happened to my innocent Cat?” I glanced over at her.

“I’m right here! It was so hot. It was an awakening for sure. They finished at the same time too. Riiiight here.” She ran one hand down her tank top towards her chest and in doing so pulled it down dangerously low. The slight dip of her cleavage, however small, was burning into my eyes.  

“Ugh gross. I don’t even know you anymore.” I rolled my eyes and pulled into the parking lot, trying to ignore the swelling in my boxers.

“You’re just jealous you weren’t one of them.”

“Can we talk about something else!? What do you want?” I motioned towards the liquor store.

“I’d like one fifth of Smirnoff and one fifth of Bacardi Dragonberry. I have a new friend I met over the summer that’s coming in tonight. You’re gonna love her. We are turning uuppp.” She tossed a couple twenties at me.

I went in the store and cooled off a bit. When Cat left she was that girl that only ever kissed a boy once in high school. Now she was braless, flashing her body at me, and telling me about how she let two guys cum on her. Once I got back in the car she tried to convince me to come out that night.

“What are you doing tonight? You need to get out more. Stop studying. You’re so straight edge.”

“It’s hot. I’m tired. Maybe tomorrow.” “It’s always tomorrow with you!”“Ugh but everything is so far from my house.”“Ok. Easy solution. Come shower at my place and take a nap. I have to make some phone calls about that internship and turn in a couple assignments. We can pregame at my place then head over to Allen’s place. No problem.” She put her hand on my arm, leaned over, and looked me dead in the eye. Her tank top sank down in front of her chest and I knew from my peripheral if looked down now I could see both of her breasts fully exposed. It took everything I had to keep my eyes on the road. I could barely make out the light brown of her areola against her tanned skin. I knew better than to argue at this point. My dick was straining against my shorts. I just wanted to get out of the car without her noticing.

“Ok whatever. But I want a clean towel this time!”____________________________________________

It’s usually not a big deal. I shower at Cat’s place all the time. I live in my Aunt’s vacation house, which is way out in the woods, so I sometimes even spend the night at Cat’s if we are doing stuff in town. So I was pretty comfortable with the whole process.  

“Are you sure there’s a towel in there?” I asked Cat as I began to pull my dirty clothes off at the door. Cat unlocked the door and stepped inside. I peeled my sweat-soaked shirt off. I’m naïve, but not retarded. If I couldn’t feel the tension before, I could now. I could feel her eyes raking over my body as my shirt came over my head.

“Uhh there’s a towel in there right?” I jerked towards the bathroom with my thumb.

“Mm? Oh, uh, yeah. Under the sink. Do you want me to wash your stuff while you’re in there?” She said trying to pretend she was busy examining the contents of her fridge. I don’t think she noticed she was doing it but one hand grabbed the crotch of her shorts and pulled it down as if to free it from something.

“Yeah if you don’t mind.” I pulled my shorts off and threw them at the foot of the laundry machine with my shirt and socks. I still had my compression shorts on which fit kind of like a European bathing suit really, so I didn’t feel too self-conscious. I walked into the bathroom and turned on the water. There was a wet towel hanging on the rack. I pondered it for a moment. That’s the towel Cat used this morning. It probably touched every part of her. The image of her running the towel down her legs as she bent over in front of the mirror flashed through my mind. Her standing exactly where I was standing, naked, with her nipples probably tightening and shrinking because of the cold air on her skin as she toweled each droplet off of her flat stomach… I shook the image out of my mind and checked under the sink for the clean towel. Nothing under that sink, but tampons and toilet bowl cleaner.

I opened the door to yell at Cat to give me a clean towel. I was going to give her a ribbing just to mess with her, but when I got the door all the way open I was once again flabbergasted. There she was, her face almost buried in my dirty shirt. I quickly looked away and turned to look at the shower, if she knew I’d seen her she would have died of embarrassment on the spot.

“Hey where’s that clean towel again? It’s not under the sink.” I slowly turned now to give her time to adjust.

“Shit. Sorry. It must still be in the dryer. Here.” She tossed the towel from the dryer into my hands. I nodded appreciatively and jumped in the shower. It was getting out of hand. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. There’s no way this is happening like I think it’s happening, I told myself. I turned the water to a freezing rain. I must have been in there a while because she came and knocked on the door.

“Did you fall in the shower? Where’s your Life Alert?”

“No, no, just uhhh making sure I’m clean... Sorry.” Wow was I smooth or what? As if I couldn’t embarrass myself enough I followed it up with, “Your body wash smells amazing.”

“It’s the same I’ve always used...?” she said giving me a curious side eye, “I’m going to make those phone calls and fuck around on my computer. I’ll be in the living room. You can just nap in my bed.” I hopped out of the shower and toweled myself off. I put on some spare clothes I keep in the car. Nothing special. Just some sweatpants and a dri-fit shirt form some soccer camp I went to a couple years ago. I couldn’t find the boxers I usually pack so I was going full commando in those fleece pants and it felt amazing. There really isn’t anything quite like soft fleece rubbing against your head as you drift off to sleep.

Cat’s bed was covered in pillows of all shapes and sizes. It was more like a pillow pit than a bed really. Though it did provide an extra degree of comfort. I slunk down between two large green body length pillows and stared at the ceiling. I wasn’t sure what I was feeling, but I was definitely turned on. My mind was still racing about what I’d seen earlier. Cat’s breasts flashing in front of me, her smelling my clothes. I wondered how many times she’d laid in this bed and got herself off. Did she lay here and touch herself and think about me? I bet she would lay down flat on her back and bend her knees up. Spread them just a bit and slide one hand down into her panties. She was definitely the type of girl who did it with them on. I knew that for sure, I thought. Slipped a finger between the wetness of her lips and twirled a finger around her clit. Her mousey moans slipping out of her lips...I couldn’t hold it any longer, I blame the sweatpants really, I put my hand in my pants and ever so lightly stroked my cock. I knew I couldn’t finish here, but it felt so good. This was rudely interrupted when the pillow next to me cleared its throat.

“What in the fuck?!” I tried to roll over to get a look at the noise I’d just heard, but I ended up completely thrashing my way out of the bed and onto the floor. 

“Oh. You must be Cat’s soccer player friend. I’m Terry,” A girl’s face poked out from the top of the covers. 

“God you gave me a heart attack,” I picked myself up off the floor. Cat had mentioned she had a friend coming over, but I didn’t know she was already there. Thanks a lot, Cat. I was filled with terror at this point. Did she notice me? Was she asleep? There was no way she didn’t know. I was practically on top of her. 

“I got here when you were in the shower. I guess I should have said something,” She came to the edge of the bed. Her skin was pale, a rarity in this part of the country, her eyes, behind a hipster pair of dark glasses, were a pair of light blue eyes and her long hair was so blonde it was almost white. She had a round face and sort of elfish ears. I had never seen anyone that looked anything like her. On one hand she was odd looking, but on the other, her face was feminine, beautiful, and her lips were such an astonishing shade of pink that I couldn’t help but stare right at them. 

“What is there something on my face?” She said rubbing her nose.

“No. Sorry. I’m just still in a bit of shock.” I sat down on the edge of the bed. 

“Here you can have that half of the bed. We can even use this pillow as a divider,” Terry began to rearrange the cushions on the bed like a kid building a fort. 

“I think I’ll just go sleep on the couch actually. Thanks though.” I stood up to leave.

“You don’t want to do that.” She said rolling her eyes around the room and giving me an impish smile. I froze. Looking back on it now, this was the moment I knew I was dealing with someone who could own the rest of my life.

“Why’s that?”

“Because if you leave now... I’m going to tell Cat what you were doing in her bed.” Terry stood up out of the bed now and casually blocked the door. I finally got a full view of her body. She was wearing a 3/4 sleeve baseball cut Raider’s shirt and those tiny sleeping shorts that lingerie stores sell. I could tell from first glance her body was amazing. Her legs were long and toned. Her hips were wide and her breasts were large. She too was braless. I could tell from the way they hung on her chest. Thick and full. She was insanely attractive and she fucking knew it. Every guy has had this feeling before. You meet that chick and you know she’s bad news. Your gut tells you to get the fuck out. To run, because this one won’t be tamed. But you never ever do. Because this one owns you the second it lays its eyes on you and part of you wants to be destroyed.

“And what was I doing in her bed?” I feigned ignorance. My eyes latched onto her breasts and I didn’t bother to try to hide it. My hormones were betraying me.

“Don’t play. Look at your sweatpants,” she laughed at me with her eyes. She was right. My sweatpants gave me away. I was pointing right at her at almost full tilt. “Not the first time I’ve been given that salute... I wonder what Cat would say if she knew you were rubbing that thing all in her sheets,” she continued
“Please don’t say anything. She’s my only friend,” I conceded. I really didn’t think it would be a big deal if she found out with the signals I’d been receiving lately, but part of me was already gone to this succubus. I wanted to know how this would play out. Terry just oozed mischief.

“I won’t,” She said as she retreated into the covers, “If you do what I say.”

“What do you want?” I knew where this was going. Or I hoped I knew where this was going.“Come. I like your body heat.” She patted a spot on the bed next to her. I laid down on my side and faced her. Her eyes were a radiant blue. The more I stared the more beautiful she became. The way her hair pooled over her shoulder. I never would have let it go this far if I wasn’t edging already. All the looks from Cat and the gentle glow of her skin. I had to see where this led. 

Ever so gently, she reached out her left hand and put it on the side of my head. She ran her hand down my shoulders and arms like a potter at her wheel. 

“You’re hot,” She said as she lifted up my shirt and ran that same cool hand over my stomach. She bit her lip.

“Mmm,” She closed her eyes and ran her hand up to my chest. Her light touch sending electric signals through my body I’d never felt before. I don’t know how it happened, but the next thing I know her lips are on my neck and my eyes are rolling into the back of my head. I felt her teeth brush against the bottom of my neck. What the fuck was this? She has to be some sort of vampire, I thought. It was like a spell. I knew I could stop her at any point I wanted, but at the same time I couldn’t. 

Her hand was running up the length of my shaft through my sweatpants and I felt like bursting. She was pushing every button, and she pushed it perfectly. Her lips were like velvet or cashmere. I couldn’t tell which because I was preoccupied with a handful of her hair at the base of her neck as I tried to pull her into me. I wanted to grind into her. She pulled away from me. Without missing a beat she pulled her shorts off and flicked them across the room. 

“Here’s what’s going to happen,” She said as she took my hand in hers and guided it between her legs. It felt like a sauna. I could feel the warmth of her pussy radiating through her lace panties. I used the palm of my hand to just lightly rub the top to the bottom. She lifted her hips off the bed and pushed against my hand. 

“I’m going to call Cat in here, and no matter what happens you won’t stop,” Terry’s cheeks began to light up with a pink hue. I nodded my head in agreement. She could have told me to eat her ass and I’d have buried myself neck deep in it. 

“Hey Cat what’s the schedule tonight?” Terry called at the door. I could hear Cat’s footsteps echoing down the hall. Should I pretend to be asleep? Should I roll over and face the other way? Before I could decide she pulled her panties to the side and I felt her wetness for the first time. Soaked. Shaved. Smooth. Without a second thought I pushed a finger inside her. She squeezed her legs together and I felt the contractions inside her. She wanted it so badly and I was more than happy to give it to her. 

Cat opened the door. There was just enough space between Terry and me to not arouse suspicion, but if she pulled the cover down an inch or two she would be able to see how my arm twisted towards Terry’s pussy. “Oh shit, I forgot to tell you Terry was here.” Cat laughed as she realized her mistake. 
“We’ve been chatting. He’s even nicer than you said,” Terry said, locking her eyes with Cat’s.

“Well just remember that he was my friend first!” Cat said. Terry was slowly grinding her hips down on my finger. I decided to add another one. She tilted her head up at the penetration. A light sweat broke out on her forehead. I could feel her dripping down onto my palm. 

“So what’s the plan for tonight?” I asked Cat.

“Mmmm. I’ve actually been working on a little something on the balcony as a surprise...”“I’m excited. I like where this is going,” Terry said. Her voice now a subtly higher pitch. I knew I had her on the ropes now. My fingers churning away at her g-spot and my thumb running slow circles on her clit. I pushed down with my thumb and curled my fingers up and slowly traced them across the soft wet bumps of the roof of her vagina. 

“And what’s that?” I asked.

“I got this inflatable kid’s pool at Target and filled it up on the balcony.”“Whaaat! That’s awesome. I didn’t bring-” Terry started to say, but her body began to shudder. I could feel the climax rolling through her from the inside. Her muscles tightened and I thought her thighs were going to break my wrist for a moment before she finally let go.

“Sorry, I thought I was about to sneeze. I didn’t bring a swimsuit though,” She said. Wow. What a recovery.

“Just borrow one of mine. Let’s take some shots!” Cat strolled back out of the room. Terry jumped out of the bed and slid her lace thong to the floor. 

“Can’t wear these anymore,” She said. I got my first full glance at her mound now. It was completely shaved and fairly prominent. A smooth curl to it as it dipped between her legs and her lips almost completely covered her. I could make out a small mole just barely inside her right thigh. A tiny imperfection on her flawless body that made her all the more human and all the more desirable.

“Thanks for that,” She said as she stripped her shirt off as well. I was right about her breasts. They sat perfectly on her chest and she had large pink nipples that were juxtaposed perfectly by her pale white skin. Her breasts rounded out across her torso and below them her stomach was smooth and gave way to wide hips, but it didn’t stop there. As she turned to rummage through Cat’s drawers she bent over and revealed the thickest ass I’d ever seen. A true bubble butt. Thick, but tight. So pronounced she had ass cleavage almost. She turned back around to look at me.

“You should probably go now.”

I nodded and made my way out to the kitchen, not sure what to think, so I didn’t think. I took the Smirnoff out of the freezer and pulled straight from the bottle. 

“Uh. Ok,” Cat said as I lowered the bottle from my lips.

“Sorry. I just feel like it tonight,” I could tell tonight was going to be a shit show. I just hoped it was going to be one I didn’t regret. I took some shot glasses from the cabinet and poured us each a ‘healthy’ amount. 

“No, no, don’t be sorry...yet. I haven’t out drank you in a while,” Cat nudged me. I never really drank much, mostly because of soccer practice and trying to keep that place on the Dean’s list, but also because of my very obvious lack of self-control when I did. Long story short, I’m a bit of a light weight.

“Whatever,” I rolled my eyes at her.

“Don’t whatever me mister!” She surprised me and leaned over and grabbed me by the balls. Literally. She squeezed. I think it was supposed to hurt, but in the end all it felt like was a solid cupping. I swatted her hand away before she could feel me stirring.

“Terry come take your shot you slow slut,” Cat called down to Terry. Terry emerged from Cat’s bedroom with her clothes back on, and I imagine a bikini underneath. 

“What are we drinking?” She asked.

“What’s it matter?” I responded. She shrugged in agreement and we downed our first round.

We took another round of shots before we decided to try the homemade pool. Terry and Cat went to Cat’s room while Cat changed and I went back to the bathroom to change. All I had dry at this point were my compression shorts so I slipped them back on. When I checked myself out in the mirror I laughed. My dick was so obvious in these, you could always tell where it was no matter how I adjusted it. I just shrugged and told myself it was better than boxers. The girls were taking forever to get ready (go figure) so I went ahead and dipped myself into the pool. 

It was still in the 80’s so the cool water actually felt good. It had soaked up some heat from the sun for sure and I felt myself slouch over and finally relax. God knows I needed to. I could still feel my blood stirring below my waist and every muscle in my body wanted to tear into someone. If I was at home I probably would have jacked off two or three times and then tried to go to sleep, but I would have to exercise some self-control. I pushed my hands through my hair and took another gulp of my drink. I could feel a buzz building. 

I was giving the horizon an absent stare when Cat and Terry finally came back. Cat had on a colorful purple and yellow bandeau bikini top that and string bottoms. The tiniest sliver of her tanlines showed on her hips and ass but I knew from stories she’d told that she sunbathed topless on her porch regularly. God, her legs looked amazing though. Long and tight and muscular. You could tell she ran and worked out hard. I wanted to run my hand from her ankle up her thighs and in between and kiss her stomach. Her whole body just seemed so... tight. 

“We couldn’t find a bikini top that fit her,” Cat rolled her eyes jokingly, “So we just had to slap a bra on her. It’s the only one she brought so she can’t get it wet.” 

Cat dipped a toe in the water to test its warmth before finally lowering herself in across from me. In one hand she had the bottle of vodka and a red solo cup full of some sort of juice, and in the other she had her iPod dock playing some more French music.. Terry came out onto the balcony a second later with towels and the Bacardi. True to Cat’s word she had on a plain black bra with a shined finish that made her pale breasts swell against each other. At her waist she had on what should have been a normal navy bikini bottom, but her ass practically swallowed the thing. She stepped into the water without hesitation and settled down next to Cat. She then unscrewed the cap from the Bacardi and threw it off the balcony. 

“It was only going to get in the way,” she said as she took a long drink. Her cheeks flushed up with red and I could tell she was feeling it a little already. Glancing between the two, I couldn’t decide who I wanted more. They both had insane sex appeal, but Cat was a close friend and Terry was obviously out of my league when it came to adventure. Either way, my cock was bulging in my shorts at this point. Luckily, between the water and the dim porch light, it was hard, if not impossible, for the ladies to tell.

“Let’s play a drinking game!” Cat said. 

“Have you ever played Russian Rogue Roulette?” Terry asked.

“You mean with a gun?” I asked like an idiot. Terry snorted at the suggestion. It was actually really cute.

“No, not with a gun. We get six shot glasses. three of them are filled with water and three of them are filled with vodka or rum. Switch them around so no one knows which one is which. Then we draw a card from one to six, also shuffled. You have to drink the one that corresponds with that place in the shot lineup. If you drink one that’s full of liquor you have to keep drinking until you drink one that’s water,” Terry explained. Cat’s eyes lit up at the suggestion.

“Go get the shot glasses and cards!” Cat pointed at me and ordered.

“Uh. Ok. But just for the record, this game sounds like a bad idea. We are gonna get wasted real fast,” I cautioned.

“I think it’s cute when guys are scared,” Terry said mockingly with a flick of her long blonde hair. I just shook my head and walked inside. Sidenote, the worst feeling in the world is being wet and having to walk through air-conditioned rooms. I took six shot glasses from the cabinet and started opening drawers to look for the cards. I knew they were around here in the kitchen, but couldn’t remember exactly which drawer. I peeked my head around the corner to ask Cat which drawer, and caught a glimpse of something I was not expecting. Cat and Terry were sitting much closer than when I had left. Terry’s hand was sitting on Cat’s thigh and she was whispering in Cat’s ear. Cat was listening intently and giggling and nodding. This scheming could only end poorly for me. I turned back to the kitchen and continued to ransack it. I found the cards sitting directly on top of the kitchen counter, right in front of me. Of course. I walked outside and handed the shots to the girls who were both sporting sly grins. 

“One last thing,” Cat said, “will you move that stool into the middle of the pool so we have somewhere to play?” 

I rolled my eyes and shook my head, but obliged. I picked up the little wrought iron stool and dropped it in the middle of the pool. The girls placed the full shot glasses on the table and then Cat placed the cards, one through six, facedown on the table.

“Since you’re such a gentleman, why don’t you go first?” Terry said.
I shrugged and figured since the best odds of not drawing a shot were at the start, it wasn’t a big deal. I drew from the deck and got a six. I took the shot from the end and downed it. This one was straight Bacardi. Smooth enough though. The girls laughed.

“Keep going!” Cat laughed.

“You’ll get yours,” I drew another card. A four this time. I took the fourth shot glass and put it to my lips. It was also rum. I poured it back and sighed. What are the fucking odds? Cat and Terry were cracking up. I guess I deserved it for being the most unlucky bastard in the world.

“You guys suck,” I said. I drew another card. One. I took the first shot and before I even tasted it I knew it was liquor. I put it back and looked at the girls. My stomach was grumbling at this point and I could tell I was about to slide into that slippery euphoric drunken state.

“You two drink one now,” I said.

“Why? It’s only water left,” Cat said. 

“Oh? Is it? Or did you fill them all with rum to fuck with me!” I picked up one of the shots and smelled it.

“Oh you bitches,” I took the shot and splashed it on Cat’s face. She squealed but she was too busy laughing at her stupid prank to care. I slid over next to her and grabbed another shot. I was feeling a little drunk now and a little handsy. I started tickling her ribs to try and make her take the shot.

“Oh nooooo! Help Terry he’s gonna have his way with me!” Cat reached out a hand to her friend for help.

“Pfft. Why would I want to stop that? That’d be hot. I’d watch,” Terry said taking the last shot off the stool and downing it.

“Terrryyyy!” Cat thrashed around trying to avoid my fingers. As her body wiggled my finger slipped and I pulled her bikini top down. Way down. “Oh shit,” I froze. Her left nipple was fully exposed and the top of her right one poked over the top as well. Just like I thought. No tanlines. Her nipples were small and a light brown that complemented her tan skin. Cat let it sit for just a beat before she pulled it up. 

“Just like in Portugal,” Cat smirked thinking she’d won the battle when really all she’d done was  begin the war.

“I vote Cat takes the damn shot and the next one,” Terry interrupted. She took the shot from my  hand and handed it to Cat. She then poured another one to the brim and pounded it back. As if that wasn’t enough, she refilled the glass and handed it to Cat. 

“You have ten seconds to finish both of those shots or I’m going to tell him what I found in your purse tonight,” Terry pushed the shot glasses towards Cat’s face. 

“Wait what?” I said.

“You wouldn’t...” Cat began to protest.

“Five seconds,” Terry moved closer. Cat dumped the first one back and before she could swallow it all she tossed back the other one too. It dribbled down her chin.

“Oh no you spilled some. Now it doesn’t count. I think I’ll have to tell him anyway,” Terry teased. She ran her thumb across Cat’s chin to wipe away the liquor. She licked the excess off her thumb.

Terry was about to open her mouth and spill the secret, but Cat slapped a hand over her mouth.

“Why don’t we play a new game? One that people can’t rig or cheat at?” Cat blurted out to try and change the subject. She held up three fingers. Following her lead Terry and I held up three fingers, a game of never have I ever that would change my fantasies forever.

I could feel those shots really powering through me now and based on Terry’s gentle swaying she could too. My head was light and warm and my stomach fuzzy. My dick was still uncomfortably hard in my shorts, and unfortunately, now that Terry had closed the distance between all three of us, it was pretty obvious. I put my hand over it to try and block Terry’s gaze. She smiled at me from the corner of her mouth as if to she knew that I knew.

“Never have I ever smoked weed,” Cat said. Terry put a finger down. I put a finger down. Getting drug tested was part of playing sports, but I had risked it once in high school and I didn’t smoke again until after I graduated college, but that’s another story. Terry went next.

“Never have I ever fingered a girl,” Terry said. Cat put a finger down with me. I had to interject.

“What the hell have you been doing!?” 

“Oh, Cat didn’t tell you? She fingered another girl over the summer. It’s amazing the things people reveal with the right amount of tequila,” Terry said nonchalantly. She’d only known Cat for half a year, but knew more about her sex life than I did.

“This is crazy. I feel like I’m sitting here with two strangers!” I said.

“Well to be fair,” Cat said with her sweet innocent voice, “You never asked, and it’s not exactly something that comes up in normal conversation.”

I shook my head in disbelief. I was beginning to think I had been wrong about this little So Cal Christian school girl after all.

“Ok. My turn. Never have I ever...masturbated in public,” I said. Cat and Terry put a finger down. It took all of my self-control not let me jaw hit the floor or to fall over backwards. I was in way over my head. I always thought guys were the uncontrollable gender, but these two were living life on the edge. We were all down to our last finger and Cat would get to decide the loser. She could easily strike us both out. I was trying to think of what she would say to win when, not for the first or last time on the evening, she surprised me with:

“Never have I ever hooked up in my friends bed while she was standing right there.”Terry put her finger down and poured us both a shot. We’d been had.

“What!? How’d you know?” I was floored.

“Terry’s shorts were literally sitting on the floor and she was practically moaning her sentences...plus the smell? I would have to be blind and/or deaf not to have noticed. I thought you were supposed to be the wholesome one too,” She said with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. Her cheeks were red and flushed. I could tell she was feeling the drink as well. Her eyes had that sparkle that comes with drunkenness.  

“And here I was thinking the same thing about you,” I took the shot from Terry’s hand and poured it down my throat. I couldn’t even taste the alcohol anymore.

“So what’ll it be your highness?” Terry asked wiping the last bit of liquor from her lips, “What is it you command of us peasants?” 

“Strip,” she said. Without missing a beat Terry unclasped her bra and threw it towards the door. Her tits looked amazing in the dark light. The pale glow made her seem so exotic. I wanted to reach out and touch her skin again. 

Cat was staring at them with as much amazement as I was.

“First, I meant him. Second, are you kidding me? Ugh, some girls get all the luck.”

She looked down at her own chest and rolled her eyes. Terry tilted her head back and pushed her chest out, as if to say, “don’t mind me”.

“You don’t feel...uncomfortable?” I asked squirming now. I wasn’t fully hard yet, but it was definitely getting there.

“They’re just boobs. Besides, you’re about to feel waaaay more uncomfortable. You heard her. She wants you to strip,” Terry said with a smile. 

“I can’t strip. I’d be totally naked,” I protested. The girls both smiled simultaneously, they already knew I wasf going to cave. They could tell how drunk I was. Cat leaned into Terry’s ear and whispered something. Terry’s eyes widened and she glanced at Cat from the corner of her eyes. What happened next sent me over the edge. Cat reached up and began playing with Terry’s breast. Her slender arms and small hands just seemed like the perfect juxtaposition to Terry’s swollen chest. Terry instinctively bucked her hips forward ever so slightly. Without thinking I slowly slid my shorts off and laid them on the edge of the pool. I could feel my cock twitching so I did what every guy would do in this situation and stroked it. Just slow and deliberately. I didn’t want to cum too soon and I wanted to put on a show for the girls. Cat’s hand slid from Terry’s breast to between her legs. She slowly traced circles on the outside of her bikini bottoms. Cat’s face was still buried in her neck and I could tell she was whispering something naughty in her ear. Terry’s face was flushed and she had started kicking her hips rhythmically with Cat’s hand. Her eyes fluttered between open and closed, between Cat’s body and my cock. She eventually took her right hand and started tugging on her nipples and used the other to pull Cat’s bikini bottoms loose. “I don’t want us to be the only ones having fun.” Terry said trying to pull the bottoms away from Cat.“Mmm, not yet.” Cat reaffirmed her dominance over Terry by slipping her hand past her clothes and finally onto her bare skin. “But look at him...He’s about to pop.” Terry managed in-between soft breaths. Cat did nothing except continue whispering and maybe speed up her fingers on Terry’s smooth sex. She wasn’t wrong either, my cock was swollen and I could feel a huge and slow orgasm building behind my balls. The head of my cock was shining as the skin tightened and I massaged the precum down my head and shaft. 

“What are you whispering, Cat?” I started to move closer."
7zhz0q,4,2018-02-22,PSA: Bluehole/PUBG Corp you need to follow a better release pipeline! WARNING: Text wall and programmer rant.,GlazedHam13,PUBATTLEGROUNDS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/7zhz0q/psa_blueholepubg_corp_you_need_to_follow_a_better/,"I've mentioned this before in other posts but I wanted to go into detail. I have been a professional developer for many years and I am disappointed at the state of PUBG releases. This most recent one is about the 4th in a series of releases that have shit the bucket. So, I am going to give some pointers on proper development and hope that you read an incorporate these changes. Make note, I am not ranting about the chosen updates we have gotten so far, just about the development process. I also, for what it is worth, do enjoy the game and will continue to play it.

TL;DR This post is a TL;DR, I can go into a LOT more detail.

So let us talk about current issues. I do not know the culture of work in this field in South Korea so I may make assumptions here or there.

1. You push updates to live server that have barely 24hrs of test server uptime. This is a laughably small test window, seriously, you need to have an update on the test server for at least a week that has remained **stable** before you push to live.
2. Your transparency is god awful. When I read patch notes I take them with a grain of salt. When you push to live servers there is no guarantee that features from your patch note shave even made it into the game. I feel like your developers are tossing shit in last minute and ignoring your process.
3. Frequent roll backs. You really would not have to do this if you addressed number 1. This is like an, ""Oh shit!"" button that you should only press if you need to, not with almost every release since 1.0.

So what can we do? Well I will start with the basics.

1. I hope you are using viable version control for something like this. You should be using **git** or even **SVN** and have proper branching/merging structures that resembles a branch/development/release/test/master structure. Look up Git-flow so see what I mean. The state of your releases makes it seem like you have an intern ripping builds from an FTP site.
2. Please make correct atomic unit tests... the amount of weird ""other"" things that break each release... I have seen that behavior indicate that there is sub-par unit testing that would have caught crap like that.
3. Please have automated builds via some system like **Hudson** and only flag builds for transition to test/master/release if they have passed. Automated those unit tests on there as well.
4. You should be using tracking software such as **Redmine** or **JIRA**. Not an excel spreadsheet.

Those are prerequisites for a successful software project of any kind. The rest boils down to process. Here is a itemized process flow that may help. I am most familiar with Scrum and agile to I will show what that kind of process looks like.

1. Generate a backlog of the bugs/features/actions that you need to accomplish.
2. Organize and prioritize those backlog items.
3. Prepare a development cycle or **Sprint** of no more than a month (usually less) in which logically complete-able portions of these backlog items may be accomplished. Allocate those tasks out to your development teams. A typical Sprint will consist of; planning, grooming the backlog, development, testing, demonstration. That order is fixed except for grooming which can take place multiple times.
4. Only push your completed builds to the test server **AFTER** the demonstration phase. And you should be testing and demonstrating the product END-TO-END, which is what your QA team is hopefully doing.
5. Leave that build, unchanged, to incubate on the test server for at least a week. Got updates to make to the test build? QA bounce something back? This is where your hot-fixes go but you should always extend your incubation time on the test server to give those changes enough time to be thoroughly tested by the gaming community.
6. Everything stable? All good for at least a week? Now you can move it to the live servers.
7. Repeat from step 1 for the life of your game.

I don't mean to sound condescending to the developers. I just have been in the business a while (usually in the vein of salvaging broken projects for other companies) and this particular game is exhibiting a lot of the symptoms I typically see. I'll end my rant now but feel free to ask me any questions in the comments."

I've been struggling with my mental health from a young age. My parents
were always fighting when i was younger which resulted in me being a little
rebel and acting out. This got me pushed into getting help from a youth psychologist.

After 2 or 3 years i was diagnosed with performance anxiety. Which i also got treatment
for. 

fast forward to 18 years old and i got myself an eating disorded  which im still suffering
from but at the moment its dormant. 

At age 23 i was diagnosed with a depression. So thats my backstory. (the short version).

On to the present day.

I'm almost ready to graduate college. I only need to do my last internship. And for some reason
i'm being bugged by a crippling performance anxiety. Ever since i started school i've been told
that whatever i do, its not good enough. I made my homework not good enough. I did my
projects not good enough.  I mostly got told that what i did was relatively bad, but not
how i should improve it. During my previous internship it got to the point that i was crying
behind my desk everyday. I lost my job recently not because i did it bad, but because i didnt do
something extra. (i didnt have the right papers for the job yet, so i had more of an observing role)
was not good enough. So now i almost have to start my final internship and im falling apart. To
the point that i dont want to do it, i have no idea how to do it,  what if they also dont think
i'm good enough, what if i fail and cant graduate,  what if i never graduate.

Im incredibly scared to adult.  Not because i dont want to work. But because im incredible scared of losing my job
 and living in poverty Im always losing my job because im ""not good enough""  ""dont take enough initiative""

This makes me feel like i'm at the end of the line of my life, like i've done everything that i'm able to do in this
lifetime. I'm not actively seeking suicide,  but i dont really want to live like this anymore.

I have no idea why i'm writing this,  but i really want to know wtf is wrong with me.

7zj8np,65,2018-02-22,2 years ago I started to quit gaming. I haven't played games in over 723 days. Here is my story why I did it and how.,itrytogetthingsdone,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/7zj8np/2_years_ago_i_started_to_quit_gaming_i_havent/,"Hello everyone!

It has been a while since I have posted here. My last post was 1.5 years ago where I celebrated the 90 days-detox. Since then a lot of things have changed in my life. This will be quite a long post so if you are too lazy to read this, read the TL;DR below. I hope this story will help some of you to become a better person and improve your life. 

**Who are you?**

Well, you can call me Jack. I am 23 year old male currently in college. Two years ago I decided I want to quit gaming because it has been affecting my life negatively in many ways and I wanted to become a better person. I stumbled upon this subreddit and the Game Quitters forum which has been very valuable for me changing into the person I am today. But first let's go back two years in the past.

**What type of person were you two years ago?**

Two years ago I was a person who was insecure, depressed, almost a shut-in, isolated and very addicted to playing video games.I was in my first year of college and I was playing Battlefield 4 (I think) in my room.

Now I have been a gamer my whole life. I grew up playing games since I was 3. My first gaming console was the Super Nintendo. After that I had a GameBoy, a PS1, PS2, XBOX360, Wii, PS4, Nintendo DS and built a gaming PC. I loved playing games because it gave me the opportunity to escape the shitty real world I was in and played in a virtual world I was happy and comfortable in. I thought I was happy, I thought I had fun. I realized I was lying to myself. 

At that day when I was playing Battlefield 4 I saw the amount of time I have spent playing this game. It was 3500 hours. 3500 hours. I have spent that much time playing a fucking game. I looked at Steam and saw I spent 3k hours in just CSGO. I also spent 1.5k hours in playing League of Legends. Everything in total I spent 8000 hours playing games. When I saw the amount of time I have spent playing these games, I realized I was wasting my time. 

**Why did you spend so much time playing video games and realized it was a waste of time?**

I have spent playing  games for the wrong reasons. In short, my whole childhood was quite a mess. I got bullied in elementary school and some years in high school. I had no friends and was quite isolated from everybody else. It was tough and it negatively affected my confidence and trust in people. In response of this I played videogames. I came home and the first thing I did was playing games. It gave me the opportunity to enjoy the virtual worlds and escape the shitty world I was in. Gaming was the only place where I was comfortable with who I was. 

However, this became worse in years later. I gained weight, isolated myself more and pretty much became a shut-in. I keep playing games and the situation became terrible and terrible each day.

When I saw how much time I have spent playing BF4 that day, I was shocked and realized I had to change. I remember I cried after that moment, because I wanted to change my habits for a very long time but was always too afraid to do it.  However, that day I told myself: ""Enough is enough. It is time for change."" I got rid of pretty much everything. I sold my LoL account, sold my Blizzard account, sold my XBOX and PS4. I dis-assembled my PC and sold each component. With that money I bought a relatively cheap laptop which was capable to perform the tasks I needed to do. 

I looked online for any help regarding gaming addiction/ compulsive gaming disorder, but to my surprise there was very little resources out there to help people with these addictions. After some time I stumbled upon the Game Quitters YouTube channel and a video of Camerondare. The website and his videos were a huge help in changing my life.

**How did it change your life?**

I tried the 90 days detox first. I quit playing games cold turkey and tried to improve myself. It was DIFFICULT in the beginning. I mean, gaming was pretty much everything I knew of. So there were definitely days where I was tempted to relapse. However, to my surprise I was able to not play any games during the 90 days detox. During those days I was trying to figure out what I actually wanted and try a lot of different hobbies.

I realized I enjoy programming a lot. I love building things and solving problems. It gave me sense of reward and decided to do focus more on programming. I have decided to work out more intensely at the gym. I decided to train hard and slowly developed healthy eating habits. 

I also became less shy and became more happy with the person I was becoming. I even had some dates with some nice chicks, which was back when I was addicted to gaming definitely unthinkable. I became more confident with the person I was becoming.

**So in what phase of your life are you now?**

I am currently in my final year of college. I just finished studying abroad in Japan and finished my internship. Last week I heard I can work at a Fortune 50 company and also write my thesis at that company. I was so fucking happy when I heard that!  Looking back quitting gaming was for me personally the best choice I have ever made. I went from becoming a shut-in who was depressed and isolated from others to a person who has goals, became somewhat confident and developed healthy and good relationships with people from across the globe. 

I am not satisfied with the place I am yet, but looking back I realized I made a lot of progress and achieve a lot of great things. I have still goals I want to achieve this year and in the upcoming years, so I am focusing on that. I also gained a little bit of weight unfortunately so I am focusing my time to spend more time at the gym and develop a healthy diet. 

But overall, I am pretty happy with the person I am today. I want to become a better person, learn new things and achieve a lot of goals. And that was something I was missing two years ago. I had no goals. Now I have and I am more than disciplined as ever to achieve this. 

**So what tips do you have to help me?**

Well, this is honestly something I cannot answer simply. Everyone here has their own shit they have to deal with and thus there is a different approach needed to tackle your addiction. However, here are my tips which hopefully will help you:

* If you are really sad, depressed, hopeless and/or isolated, I highly suggest to visit a professional knowledgeable of mental health issues. Often gaming addiction is a consequence and not a cause. There must be something in your life that is causing you to become addicted to video games. So do that.
* Take small steps when quitting video gaming. I decided to quit cold-turkey and it somehow worked for me. But I am sure other people in this sub are having a hard time trying to quit. For example limit your time when playing game. So instead of 2, you play 1 hour. And each time you try to restrict your time more.
* Look for other hobbies and interests. When you quit playing video games you have suddenly a lot of time you can spend on something else. My advice is find a hobby. I know it sounds cliche, but it will really help you in the long run. There are lot of there so try them out!
* Unsubscribe from gaming-related subreddits, YouTube channels and Twitch channels. If you are trying to quit playing games, these things can cause you to relapse. 
* If you relapse, don't feel bad. It happens sometimes.Try to find the cause why you relapsed and take action to make sure you don't relapse again.
* Be prepared to lose some gaming friends. Some will understand, some will ignore you and other will tell you are an idiot. I have encounter all of these three and this is something many of you will probably also face.

That is much pretty it. I hoped I helped some of you with this very long post. To anyone on this journey, good luck and don't give up. You got this.
For me it was the best decision ever to quit playing games. I am happy with the person I am today and I am looking forward what the future has to offer. It will be tough, but I have goals I want to achieve and I am determined to accomplish them. 

Have a nice day all!

TL;DR

Was an overweight shut-in who was bullied, depressed, isolated and sad. Realized I had to change so I decided to quit playing games. I haven't played a game for 723 days and I am pretty happy with who I am today. 

*Some final words*

**Some has asked me why I didn't simply played games in moderation and restricted my time. I tried. Multiple times. And every time I failed. It didn't work for me so I have decided to quit gaming completely. I am happy with who I am today. This approach may not work for you because it is maybe too radical or not the solution you need. Furthermore, I realized I was the problem. Not games. I ignored my problems and I had to address them to improve myself. Gaming had nothing to do with it. It was merely a symptom. To anyone who has fun playing games, I say the more power to you. If you have control over your life, then I think playing games a couple hours a day doesn't hurt. You do you. I don't judge.**"

I’m waiting for these chemicals to snake out of my system and my body is doing its best, I just wish there was some way to expedite things. Naturally i can't sleep or eat or enjoy anything in this state, so I’ll just write about something i saw today. 

Stepping out of the cab and there's an expanse of sand colored concrete in front of me, windows finding the sun and reversing the rays into my eyes. Through a gate outlined in metal spikes and a set of stained double doors is a room, dim and cramped with torn furniture, that sharp cold smell of sterilization, some thin undefined whir and staccato voices finding their way in through the cracks that divide up the walls, from under the doors, out of the vents, wherever they can make their entrance. That familiar heaviness dumps itself into the acids of my stomach and stirs it up until it's stormy and foaming. I cross soaked palms and levi my weight against speckled formica and say, 

“I have an appointment.”

Miles into her face through dense clouds of shadows eyes beam back at me and she says, voice tattered from years of inhaling smoke, 

“Inpatient or outpatient?” 

And i say outpatient. She types and waits then depresses a hidden button somewhere under the desk, a light beams over the room painting things red for a moment then she tells me to go down the hall and to the right and find room 116, and so i do. Through the halls voices circulate around me from an ever changing source, some distressed and some sobbing and some surprise me with faint, high pitched tinges of optimism. 

I walk through door 116 and interrupt something more personal than I anticipated. There’s a room bare besides fifteen thin decayed figures seated in a circle, one healthy being the figurehead. They all shift towards me and lift their heads as i enter, weak muscles undulating at the strain and grey eyes lifeless and full of tangible resentment that punches through the bones and muscle and tissue in my chest. I stand there paralyzed with all their gazes tearing through my body until the main one dressed in nurses scrubs says,

“Sit down.”

So i do, and when I do she sasy,

“Before you arrived, we were discussing the actions that prompted us to seek help. Katies just finished up, I believe next is Jacob.”

This one communicates steady and mechanical and robotic. I guess it was a voice in the sense that there was some vibration coming from her when she opened her mouth, those vibrations translating into something with meaning as they drip into my brain through the ears, but there was nothing past that. No emotions, nothing really there besides a sense of something utilitarian and bare. She’s a mediator at her most positive.

She’s talking again now, watery noise spattering against the room and all of us. She tells who I assume is Jacob to tell the group how he ended up here and that it’s important to be honest and open and that no one here will judge him. He’s probably late twenties with thin yellow hair already retreating, light blonde pathwork spreading over his cheeks and under his jaw. He’s as thin as i've ever seen another human, flesh loose and discolored over his face, like maybe he'd borrowed a corpses. Light blue orbs outlined in cloudy bloodshot red and brows furrowed into strange arcs and there's some dissonance, I can't find the meaning behind his expressions. He's trying to coax some noise out of himself, hydraulics in his leg engaged and forcing it up and down and up again over and over and over, jaw hanging open loose and eventually some twitch in the muscles near his left eye and he swipes at it then wipes his nose and when he does there's swashes of red staining his hand. The android at the front tells him to take his time and after a moment he tries again and gets out words and words and words, all of them tense and strained and popping as they come up from his diaphragm. He said,

“ Uhm….well...I had a normal childhood I guess. My family was always really great, besides my dad.. I did really well in track in highschool and USC offered me a scholarship so of course I took it, that was like….you know, it was a huge achievement for me. That was my biggest goal at the time. I studied psychology, I wanted to uhm...just help people I guess, especially veterans. My dad is a vet and growing up I saw how much he struggled with ptsd and i guess he felt guilty that he came out alive and most of his friends didn't. So, I wanted to be able to do something to help my dad and everyone else like him. I got my PHD and was ready to start an internship then after that set up my own practice. It was great, I had everything i wanted and i felt like i was about to make a difference, a real difference you know, like actually make some sort of impact. Right before i was supposed to graduate I got injured really bad, I broke my leg in an event. It was a long healing process and they prescribed me oxycontin. That was the first opiod i was ever exposed to, and immediately it was like...like nothing else id felt. It was so warm and so peaceful. Every anxiety i had, every negative thought, it just drained out of me. Of course my leg healed and they took me off of the oxy but i couldn't stop thinking about that feeling. I got really depressed around that time. My dad was getting worse, he didn't want to talk to anyone. He would lock himself in the bathroom and he wouldn't let me or mom or my brother in, and we could hear him sobbing in there for hours. He would just cry and cry….for hours. Then he'd come out and eat dinner with us or watch tv with us and he'd sit there with this blank expression and he wouldn't even talk about anything, if we brought it up he just would act like we weren't even there. I felt so helpless, I just wanted to help him, do something to make...I dont know. I wanted him to be himself. 

I had someone that knew where i could get more pills and i couldn't help myself, I thought I needed them. After a while i started smoking them. I knew i could get heroin for so much cheaper but I told myself I’d never get to that point, that would be when it was really a problem. Fuck, i was delusional. It was already a problem i just didn't want to see it. One day my mom found the pills and burnt foil, I broke down and told her what i was doing and she told me I had to stop, that I had to go somewhere that could help me stop but i didn't want to think about it and i didnt want to come to terms with it. Eventually my savings were low and…..I knew i couldn't afford to keep buying the pills….I tried to stop but it made me so sick, god i felt like i was dying. So, I called my dealer and bought heroin. I remember the first time i shot up, it was in the bathroom in my parents house…..it was like….pure warmth and bliss. I cried as i did it. I knew what i was doing and i knew exactly what would happen but I didn't care. I’d failed out of college six months before i was set to graduate and my dad was only getting worse, more isolated. I guess i didn't really care at all what happened to me. That was without a doubt the most horrible decision i ever made. I stole from my parents, I was homeless, my veins are collapsed, Im sick all the time but I cant get tested because i'm fucking terrified of what the results probably are. Iv'e done so much shit for it....I can't sleep anymore. I'd give anything to be able to just...just go back and…..”

He hides his face and his wiry frame shakes as he cries into the bends of his arms. He goes on like that for a bit, just vibrating as the tears and whimpers come out. When he looks back up his whole face is wet and red and he snorts before leaving a few more words in my head, 

“I wish I could just take it all back, I wish I could restart. I can't fix this.” 

And he falls back into himself again and goes on sobbing."

I angrily tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves. For a moment I’m reminded of some Asian girl whose name I’d already forgotten. She was prettier when she cried.

I sigh loudly – more of a growl – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns there any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing when guests arrive is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

I'm not sure on exact location, it could anywhere in DFW area, so I am mainly looking for something in the middle of the two, or possibly to the north of them so I will have a decent drive to either one if I can't get an exact location before finding housing..

Anyways, it will be me, my fiancé, and our service dog. I was planning on just getting a studio apartment to save some money, but it seems that 1 bedrooms aren't much more expensive.

Anyways, I'd love for some recommendations on houses/apartments/duplexs/etc. that are decently nice and safe enough to feel comfortable walking at night. &lt;$1,000/month including utilities is a must, but if I could get something $5-700/month for rent that would be fantastic as we will be paying for two apartments during this time period.

Also, if anyone has any good furniture rental places or furnished apartments in the area. If I can get a good deal I'd prefer to not have to move the bulk of our furniture for just 3 months.

Thanks you guys!!

I had friends I was really close to last year who I haven’t spoken to since October. I know my weight is a problem but the only time I leave my dorm is to go to class or eat and I think that’s had a bad psychological effect on me. I don’t really know what to do, I’m so alone and the only thing that keeps me safe at mind is my cat who I can only see over spring break, and I have to get an internship over the summer which means I won’t be able to see her really at all. I don’t know what to do, I look through Instagram and see all my friends from high school and here at college having a great time, having serious relationships, going places and doing things, when I am nothing. I fear the day my cat dies because I don’t know what I’ll do then, and she’s already almost 8 so I don’t know when that day will come, and if I’ll miss is because I’m getting a degree to work a shitty job to stuff my face with more food. Can someone empathize with me or something?"
7zkspa,5,2018-02-22,Dave Ramsey seems to pigeonhole all degrees and all curricula. [Rant],PhD_in_Dumb,DaveRamsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaveRamsey/comments/7zkspa/dave_ramsey_seems_to_pigeonhole_all_degrees_and/,"I have noticed that DR will often tell potential students that every school will give them the same education, so don't spend on a name.

This may hold for your standard underwater cat grooming degree, but there are some degrees where the school does in fact matter.
School rankings in STEM degrees are reflective of not only the curricula, but the quality of instruction, the access to funding, research grants, post grad employment networking, equipment, and yes... pedigree.
A PhD from Caltech is worth far more and can be leveraged much further than a degree from Cowdunk U not only on name alone, but the sheer quality of education. At some schools you can't squeeze blood from a turnip...

The ROI for a top school in a high paying career is well worth it, even if you have to borrow for it.

I just listened to todays segment where DR told a kid wanting to study Aerospace Engineering at UCLA that the curriculum would not be hard until his Jr year, and that he should do a bunch of stuff at a free two year school before going to UCLA.
The kid had saved $40k of the estimated $120K needed to get a degree from UCLA. The ROI of $80k in student loans for that particular STEM degree, from that particular institution and all the opportunities a degree from that institution would offer is much greater than a free CC and a zero loan education from an nth rate school.

Yes, the kid should work... yes, the kid should go for all the scholarships he can... yes he should leverage an internship and such... but Dave outright told the kid that he was going to UCLA to play beer pong... and with my vast experience with Aerospace Engineering students, they are near the bottom of the list of people who do not take their education seriously.

One size does not fit all WRT to schools, degrees, or opportunity.

There's a guy in a café and me, busy thinking about RBN-stuff and knowing he left home early in his life I asked him questions. He never gave me a distinct reaction and I was baffled at the lack of interest on his side. I then asked whether he could imagine still having some scars from that time he wasn't aware of? He got defensive and I realized that I should not ask another question.

Later I was going to the front to get another drink when he was walking towards me and I saw a pretty hateful look to me that naturally vanished to his usual expression.

I think I don't want to go back there.. He is the repressed very friendly type and I thought there was sympathy. And I had already deemed that shop as dangerous emotionally but I came back. Out of convenience. Out of me underestimating my previous judgement maybe..


I've noticed that I choose people that are potentially narcissistic and then I play the game in which I offer up too personal information and see if they react accordingly. Maybe that's what I do or I was just looking for someone to talk to about this mess... I don't know which it is. But I do something that I shouldn't that provokes Ns a lot and quickly. Maybe it is asking for empathy. Yeah. I keep going back to the same places asking for empathy where there is none.
And maybe if I don't get it I provoke. Or rather if the reaction is a certain kind of off.

Any advice on how to stop doing that because depending on the place that can be very dangerous I imagine. The place I'm talking about is a coffee shop in the Netherlands so the criminal world isn't far. That's why I'm scared. My smoking habit + isolation + narcissistically wounded criminally touched people = danger? I think they don't like being reminded of those times because none of them have dealt with it really and I have been reminding. The guy with which it happened can't express anger or disagreement and I should've quit when the first answer of the questions was not really engaged.
Now I have that look in my brain and I fear for my life on one side and a voice that says ""come on it was still in time he didn't mean to show you"" on the other.

Edit: I have already indirectly caused 2 Narcs within the medical world to cause me trouble for months and when I trained to enter the medical world as a professional I had fights with all the Narcissists I came across. I'm not going to enter the world because I don't want to but also because my internship ratings were abysmal. I got scapegoated. I don't know I'm playing and I don't back down once I do. This time I want to badly though.

However, my exact return date is still unclear at this point (my internship technically ends the 1st of December, but evidently interns in the past have asked to extend their internship through until mid to late December). Without having that date information at this time, does anyone know what the date change fee would be for a return trip on an international flight from Korea back to the US? Delta's website gives a rather ambiguous figure of $200-500, and I'm wondering if that fee is nearer to $500, if it'd be cheaper for me to a buy a one-way ticket to Korea, figure out the dates there, and then purchase a one-way ticket back to the US (as opposed to buying a round-trip ticket and paying to change the date of my return flight).

Any help is really appreciated. Thanks y'all!"

## Anthology Episode 3

**The Oval Office**

The presidency of Donald J. Trump, known in some circles (but not in ours) as Donal Jim Drumpf, had been one wild ride for America, characterized by myriad gaffes and off-hand remarks, but, as they have a tendency to do, the American people persisted through this great hardship nevertheless. As it would turn out, however, another quirk of the American psyche dictated that the people were slow to learn from their mistakes, and so just four years after the country had finally got rid of one Trump, they got another, this time in the form of his daughter, Ivanka. Running as a moderate (relatively) Republican challenger to then-President Oprah Winfrey in 2024, the young (again, relatively) Mrs. Trump capitalised on the fact that Oprah was, if we’re being honest, black, and, realistically, a shit candidate against anyone other than El Cheeto Demento, beating her. Ivanka also managed to prove how pathetic she was on this campaign, due to the fact that she literally beat Oprah by about 10,000 votes. Since then, Trump’s presidency had been a real disaster, with notable accomplishments including losing a war to Iran, and having her entire Mexican border wall stolen by gangbangers to build the world’s first Giant Metal Cigar, which could be smoked by the entire village at once, using a complicated piping system. This has prompted Vincent Kennedy “Vince” McMahon, a former friend of her father’s and media mogul, to primary her, running alongside the former White House Opaque Media Job Title Anthony “The Mooch” Scaramucci. Trump had defeated McMahon and Mooch in the primaries (in no small part thanks to the help of our old friend Shlomo), but the greatest double act since the construction of the North and South towers of the WTC had called baloney on this shit, and combined their vast personal wealth to run as independents against Trump and her running mate, the twice-Vice President Mike Pence, as well as the Democratic ticket of Kamala Harris and literally Chadwick Boseman in character as T’Challa, the title character from the hit movie Black Panther, which, as we all know, was based on a true story. President Trump, who we’ll call sheeto to distinguish her from cheeto, was currently in the oval office, deep in conversation with Pence.

**PENCE:** - I really do appreciate you letting me take the time off to deal with Karen’s cancer. It’s been a tough time for the entire clan, but the restorative power of the Lord Jesus has taken us through it, and by golly, we’ll emerge on the other side. 

**IVANKA:** Wow, Mike, I mean just… wow. That was beautiful, just really inspiring. And it gives me a great idea that I’m sure you’ll just love: why don’t you go sit down with the press and tell them exactly what you just told me? They’ll eat it right up! 

**PENCE:** Ivanka, I really don’t think - 

**IVANKA:** I prefer Madame President, actually.

**PENCE:** Of course, Madame President. I’m not really sure about that one. According to Christ, suffering in silence is one of the most noble things that you can do. I think if we went public with Karen’s illness, it might seem like we’re just asking for sympathy. I don’t want sympathy, I want compassion. 

By this point, however, the President had stopped listening to what Pence had to say and was busy adjusting her hair, which she now wore in that “strong, career-driven female” (read: dyke) style so popular among female world leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and that woman who was Prime Minister of Poland before their version of the Deep State had her replaced, in her hand-held mirror. 

**PENCE:** You’re probably going to hell, you know. 

**IVANKA:** Huh?

**PENCE:** I said: “The election sure is going swell, y’know”. 

**IVANKA:** It could always go better, though. 

That was an understatement. Most polls put the current administration trailing behind McMahon/Mooch and Harris/T’Challa, often by several percentage points. Saying that it could go better was like saying that Jared from Subway could had some wiggle room to become less of a creep. 

**PENCE:** Well, I have faith that we can bring those poll numbers up if we stay true to our conservative principles. 

However, before Pence could preach the gospel of limited government and the Constitution, as well as the actual Gospel, we assume, the President and her VP were startled by what sounding like arguing coming from the next room over and went to go investigate. As they entered the room, they found Ivanka’s father, former President Donald Trump, sitting about four inches away from the TV, which was showing Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. Beside Trump was the former national security adviser and current national toiletries commissioner H.R McMaster, who was clearly trying to watch the movie.

**MCMASTER:** Sir, I can’t really see the movie if you’re sitting in front of the scr-

**TRUMP:** The American people want to watch the gorillas again! Gorillas are just beautiful, magnificent creatures, especially when they gather around that big black domino.

**MCMASTER:** First of all, it’s a monolith, not a “big black domino,” and second, is a fourth viewing of the opening scene of 2001 really necessary? What more could you possibly get out of it a fourth time around?

Trump stared at McMaster, who eventually gave in and started the movie up again at the gorilla scene (We almost said rewound, but no one does that anymore, do they? It’s just drag n drop). The great apes began jumping around, and doing their whole screeching business. 

**TRUMP:** This is bigly funny. Look at the cacoffinoon of monkeys! Great!

**IVANKA:** Daddy..? Is something wrong? I thought I heard fighting from the Oval Office.

Ignoring the fact that Ivanka, who was well over forty years of age, still referred to her father as “daddy,” the President was clearly concerned for her father’s well-being and general mental state, which had rapidly deteriorated after he left office. 

**TRUMP:** The only thing wrong here is the size of this TV, Melania! It’s smaller than Little Marco’s little Marco! 


**IVANKA:** It’s me, daddy, Ivanka! 

**TRUMP:** Ivana?! No, I divorced you years ago and had you deported back to Slovakia! Get out of here! Nasty woman out, out, out!

As this was going on, the door to Trump Sr’s room opened, and in walked Melania Trump. Well, we say in walked Melania, but she was actually being pushed in by her son, Barron. Melania had been wheelchair bound ever since her brutal three-hour rape by Robert Mueller, the fired US special counsel who had been tasked with taking down Donald Trump. Although Mueller was currently on death row, it could be said that he’d got the last laugh, having, y’know, crippled Melania and driven Donald Trump insane, ending his presidency.  

**IVANKA:** Remind me again never to let him go in front of the press, Mike… 

The sight of his crippled wife seemed to unearth some unpleasant memories in the toupee-covered head of 45th president, who let out a cry comparable to how one might imagine a ‘Nam vet might sound waking up in cold sweats. McMaster and Pence, who had not said a word since he and Ivanka entered the room, rushed over to try to calm the Donald down, but this only seemed to further set him off. 

**TRUMP:** SAD! SAD! SAD! 

It turned out that at the end of the day, whenever Trump said “sad!” he was talking about something bigger than politics. He was talking about…his feelings.

**TRUMP:** Mueller is too busy covering for Crooked Hillary and Obama’s many CRIMES to go after the **real** lawbreakers! Newsflash, folks: our borders still need protecting! 

Paying little attention to Trump’s recitation of one of his past tweets, Pence, McMaster, and the President herself huddled up in the corner to think up a way to pacify him. After about a minute of this, McMaster was suddenly struck with an idea.

**MCMASTER:** I can’t believe I’m even saying this, but I hope to god someone still has a copy of *the* tape lying around somewhere.

It seemed that someone did, as the newly-returned Steve Bannon burst into the room, holding a master-copy of the tape. We should take the opportunity to note that Bannon was, in actuality, the LCD Soundsystem front-man James Murphy, having successfully infiltrated the Tribe many years ago under an assumed identity, on the instructions of David Bowie and Brian Eno. Just sayin’. 

**MURPHY:** I’ve got it. It’s a good thing I found it, too, because any longer and this tape would’ve been losing its edge, just like the current neoliberal system that we’ve used to rule the world for the last half-century. We’re losing a battle of the bands to Daft Punk. Uhh...I mean, we’re losing a civilisation war to China. Alright!

After imparting this great political wisdom on Trump 2, Pence, and McMaster, “Bannon” handed the President a CD and then promptly fucked off, presumably for the nearest bar. Ivanka promptly passed it to her brother. Barron had been mute since the attack on his mother. It was rumoured that Mueller had actually found him riding Melania, and brutally attacked him before the rape, which is why he now can’t speak, and has a curious fear of bricks. Still, he did cyber well, and had soon got the CD/DVD/HD DVD (lol)/Blu Ray hooked up for his father. A few seconds later, and the Trumps were witness to a bunch of chimpanzees engaging in a turf war (we literally mean chimps, not ‘chimps’) over the control of some patch of jungle. Donald soon calmed down, and started clapping along to their screeches. 

**TRUMP:** I like the way you hit him, gorilla!

Don’t we all.

**The Sanctum Sanctorum, Venice**

Welcome to the Sanctum Sanctorum, home of secrets, centre of cliche names, origin point of villainy, and general headquarters for a bunch of extreme meansters. On an island in the Venetian Lagoon, purged from all maps, removed from google images by a DCMA takedown request, and generally unmentioned, was the sprawling fortress-like headquarters of the Tribe. “Hold up”, you might say, “The Tribe are based in Los Angeles”. Well, yes, they are. *A* Tribe. Shlomo’s Tribe, to be exact. Occupying this imposing Isengard-esque island was another Tribe, not belonging to the Grand Yid, but to the Merchant of Venice. Again, you might be wondering if this is Shylock, the character from Shakespeare’s wokepill of the same name, but the Tribe’s founder (In reality nothing like the fictional character) was long dead. The current Merchant of Venice was Moshe, currently - as is the way of these things - sitting alone at his desk in the European Tribe’s rather un-dungeon like mansion headquarters. A rather queer looking mime came to the door of his room, and opened it, allowing another of the European Tribal elders - Abraham - to enter the room. 

**ABRAHAM:** Your Grace, I -

**MOSHE:** “Oy”, I’m saying. Do you hear that? Oy, and now, gevalt. Oy gevalt, why can’t you wait until I come down to meet with my fellow High Priests, Abraham? Is whatever you have to tell me so pressing that you’ve got to make like a gentile and display such a lack of manners?  

**ABRAHAM:** Oy vey, I’ve been an impolite minion! Please forgive my interruptions, Your Grace.

**MOSHE:** Tell me what the issue is, then. 

**ABRAHAM:** It’s, uh, it’s that uppity Merkel, Lord Moshe. She’s formed a coalition deal with the SDP -

**MOSHE:** Oy gevalt, even after we expressly told Schulz to torpedo her chances? I’ve never been able to understand why all of these gentiles try to cling onto power even after we’ve told them that time’s up. Are you sure they’re doing this on their own? 

**ABRAHAM:** Nothing so far has indicated that those mashuganas in America are remotely involved, Lord Moshe. 

**MOSHE:** Good, I’m glad to hear that. Those mashuggas would be wise not to trifle with us again after we defeated them on Brexit, or rather, we muscled them out of the scene with our Liberal goons! 

We’ll let the reader decide the validity of this expository dialogue. 

**MOSHE:** Something must be done about this. 

**ABRAHAM:** Such as….? 

**MOSHE:** Take this message to Lord Shimshon, Abraham: The time has come to eliminate Merkel. This goyess can no longer be allowed to defy the will of the Tribe! We will…..we will send one of our golems to her house! Not one of the fighting golems, no, one of our….sexual conquest golems….and this great stone beast will….crush that balabusta and her husband with each successive thrust! In, out, in, out, in, out, dead! That’s what happens when you stand against the Tribe, Abraham. That’s what’ll happen to her. Oy vey, can you imagine the reaction of the goyim afterwards? The CDU and SDP will be ours for eternity.

**ABRAHAM:** Of course, Your Grace.

Abraham, one of the European Tribe’s high priests, bowed and headed back out the door, which was closed behind him by another sad mime. Moshe returned to his work, in which he had to make the final decision on many pressing questions, like: Macron, what do? How to take down the regime of Mohammed Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, and, finally, decide between two concrete action-plans to defeat Shlomo and reunite the Tribe under his rule.

**The McMahon/Scaramucci Campaign Headquarters**

In the main conference room of the McMahon/Scaramucci campaign HQ, a cadre of staffers were hard at work determining where the two political dynamos would stop on their tour of the country. The group of political science majors, who looked how one might imagine a group of quirky millennials to look, had gotten a large map of the continental US (sorry Alaska and Hawaii) and sprawled it out across the long table, placing pushpins on the different cities they felt were worthy of being blessed with McMahon and the Mooch’s presence. There was, however, some disagreement among the campaign staff, particularly over which Springfield (Missouri or Massachusetts), if any, they should visit and other questions of geography. 

**MILLENNIAL #1:** As a well-educated white male from an affluent family, I’m primarily concerned with Republicanism with regards to how it’s co-opted economic liberalism following the capitulation of the democratic party to nigg- er, I mean, socialists.

**MILLENNIAL #2:** I rather disagree, respectfully. I think we should focus more of our efforts on winning over Democratic voters who may feel alienated by that party’s recent embrace of black nationalism.

Before the young fella known to us as millenial #1 could offer up a respectful retort to his fellow millennial, another staffer raised a shaky hand to ask a question. 

**MILLENNIAL #1:** What is the issue on which you would like to speak, my fellow enlightened millennial? 

**MILLENNIAL #3:** Uhh, d-do you happen to know if that Kyle guy is gonna be at the next debate by chance…? 

**MILLENNIAL #1:** The next debate isn’t for weeks, but to tell you the truth, I really have no idea if he is or not. 

The third intern sunk down in his seat upon hearing this, his face turning a shader paler. 

**MILLENNIAL #3:** He just always seemed to have a retort ready for every point we raised… 

**MILLENNIAL #4:** He *is* called the master debater for a reason.

**MILLENNIAL #1:** Guys, we can worry about Kyle later, alright? Now we have to decide whether we want to include North Carolina on the list. After all, it *is* a major swing state.

**MILLENNIAL #4:** Well, actually… North Carolina hasn’t been in play for decades, if I may respectfully butt in here.

**MILLENNIAL #1:** Well, to counter your point, actually, I strongly believe that North Carolina will, in fact, be in play this time around. Candidates are shown in almost every case to do significantly better in their home state.

Little known fact: Vince McMahon was, in fact, born in the great state of North Carolina. 

**MILLENNIAL #2:** He’s so OLD though!! I mean, do you really expect people to vote for someone who won’t even be able to complete a full term in office? 

This outright hostility towards the man whose campaign they ran might seem rather jarring to hear, but such talk was actually far more common at the campaign HQ than one might expect, as another intern would soon demonstrate. 

**MILLENNIAL #4:** Yeah, the minute he gets his wrinkly ole ass beat in the election by my kween Kamala Harris and BASED n-word T’Challa, I’m jumping ship. I was only ever in this so I could have something impressive on my resume anyway! 

**MILLENNIAL #5:** Yeah, he’s *such* a reactionary too! 

**MILLENNIAL #1:** Shut up, guys, I think I hear something. 

The first millennial, who might be called something like Toby or Brett, though this is mere speculation on our part, rushed to the window overlooking the parking lot where he thought he heard the noise coming from. 

**MILLENNIAL #1:** Shit, guys, it’s the fucking Bang Bus! 

The other staffers practically leapt from their seats at the mention of this “Bang Bus” and joined Toby/Brett by the window. The Bang Bus, it turned out, was not some sort of mobile brothel-on-wheels as the name might suggest, but rather a large tour bus that had the images of McMahon and Scaramucci emblazoned on the side of it over an American flag, with each giving a big ole thumbs-up to anyone who might happen to drive past it on the highway. Before any of the interns could react, the door to their conference room was practically kicked off its hinges by the independent candidate, and in walked Vince, Anthony Scaramucci, and a third hispanic man with a box full of snow-cones, which he began handing out to the millennial goons.

**MCMAHON:** Goddammit pal, I love snow-cones! Make sure all of these kids get a snow-cone, dammit!

**MILLENNIAL #3:** Thanks for the snowcone, boss! 

**MOOCH:** I think this guy might be waiting for you to whip it out, Vinny Mac. 

**MCMAHON:** Goddammit kid, you know I don’t have time for that shit! Eat your snow-cone instead of my grapefruits! 

**MILLENNIAL #3:** Y-yes sir… 

**MCMAHON:** They’re firm, healthy grapefruits! You know, they gave rise to two great kids, they’re goddamn overripe, if anything, but I don’t have time for you wanting to eat them! I’ve got a business, I mean I’ve got a campaign to run!

**MOOCH:** Speaking of running this fucking campaign, have any of you, probably fucking overpaid if you get paid, workers actually compiled those fucking documents I rang ahead about? Y’know, the fucking rape-files on Trump? Just pages and pages of fucking vocaburaping, to expand our lexicon of fucking fuckage. Any of you done that?

There was a silence in the room that lasted almost a minute until one of the interns raised their hands. 

**MOOCH:** Yes, you, what the fuck have we learned today, huh? 

**MILLENNIAL #6:** Uh, actually, sir, we were trying to figure out campaign stops.

**MOOCH:** What the -

**MCMAHON:** WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN YOU WERE “TRYING TO FIGURE OUT CAMPAIGN STOPS”, HUH? YOU PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK! YOU CAN’T EVEN DO ONE SINGLE GODDAMN THING WHILE I’M OUT THERE EVERY DAY TRYING TO MAKE THIS GODDAMN COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN! YOU CAN’T EVEN MAKE THIS OFFICE GREAT IN THE FIRST PLACE, PAL!

As McMahon, filled with a great patriotic rage, berated his young interns, he slammed his fist down on the table, causing at least two of the millennials to lose their snowcones to that great ruiner of dreams known as the floor.   

**MILLENNIAL #1:** Sir, we can, uh, we can get started on those… r-tapes as soon as possible. 

**MCMAHON:** WHAT THE HELL’S AN R-TAPE PAL? ARE YOU TRYING TO INSINUATE THAT I’M SOMEHOW MENTALLY LACKING, HUH? 

**MILLENNIAL #1:** Not at all, sir- 

**MILLENNIAL #2:** Mr. McMahon he was just trying t-


**MCMAHON:** SHUT THE HELL UP, I WAS TRYING TO HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION WITH TOMMY HERE AND YOU JUST HAD TO BUTT IN, PAL! 

**MOOCH:** Why don’t you fucking clarify things for the soon-to-be 48th President of this great nation, huh?

**MILLENNIAL #1:** The uh….the…..the…..r…..a...p…..e tapes.

**MCMAHON:** WHAT THE HELL’S WRONG WITH YOU, PAL? WHY WOULD I WANT TO SEE A RAPE TAPE, GODDAMMIT?! DO I LOOK LIKE BILL CLINTON? 

**MOOCH:** You stupid fucking dipshit, I clearly said rape files! A rape tape’s just fucking twisted!

The cowed interns sat in silence, not really knowing how to progress. 

**MOOCH:** Well, don’t just fucking sit there! Get to work on those fucking rape files! 

**MCMAHON:** Someone get me another snow-cone! This one’s goddamn melted!

Someone did, and that was that. Another day, another challenge for America’s prospective President 48.

I was in college at the time and dating a very special girl. Her name was Theresa, but she went by Terry. This is the story of how we met, but not how we fell in love. That is a long and disastrous story with a lot of insane encounters. I honestly have a hard time even believing it and I fucking lived it. But to start, I’ll tell you about me.

I’m about 6’1 and 175 pounds. I’m not a huge muscular guy, but I played soccer at our little D-II school on the West Coast and so I didn’t have a single ounce of fat on me (if only that were still true). I kept my hair short on the sides because of the heat, but I kept the top long so I didn’t look like I was trying to join the Marines or something. I studied Digital Media and harbored some pretty intense ambition at the time, that I’m still working on, so even then I studied my ass off.

I had just turned 21 and as anyone who has ever turned 21 in the States knows, once you turn 21 you have to buy for all your underage friends. I admit it. I served alcohol to a minor. On numerous occasions. I didn’t really go out a lot, between practice and trying to be an academic all-american, but I did have one girl space friend, Catherine, whom I talked to every so often. We had tentative plans to hang out and enjoy my new found liquor license that evening. She had spent the spring semester studying in France and then interning in San Diego so it had been a while since we talked.

I was expecting to hear the typical girl spiel about how amazing it was in Europe and how everything was perfect and about all her favorite wines and dinners and the amazing connections she made with local men, so I suggested she meet me after practice and I’d take her with me to get some alcohol. That way I could at least make this bearable. As I walked off the practice field with my bag over my shoulder she ambushed me from behind.

“It’s been so longggg!” she squealed as she threw her arms around my neck. Her feet were hanging off the ground as she put all her weight on my back.

“Agh! It’s too hot for this!” I swung her off me and as I did I caught just a tiny peek of her nipple through the side of her tank top. She wasn’t wearing a bra, but she wasn’t exactly the type of girl that needed one. She was very slim and short, maybe just at 5’2 and her breasts were small, but exquisite. The kind that just seemed to fit right on her frame. Smooth and supple and she wore them well, like a fashion model almost.

She’d changed a lot since I last saw her. Her ash brown hair was cut short, just above her shoulders, and it seemed like her face had finally made that change from teenager to young adult. Everything about her was…sharper. Her eyes, her jaw, her nose. Everything seemed livelier and demanding. Maybe it was the haircut. She was wearing a dark purple tank top that draped loosely around her shoulders and frayed white denim shorts.

“You cut your hair.” I said to her to prove that I actually noticed that sort of thing.

“Do you like it?” She asked as she ran a hand through it and struck a goofy pose.

“It’s better.” I smirked and ushered her towards the car. She slapped my back lightly.

“Don’t bully me, stinky.” She retorted. I threw my bag in the trunk and stepped into the driver’s seat.

“It’s not my fault you couldn’t wait till later. I would love a cold shower right now.” I called through the window as I turned the car on and plugged the auxiliary cord into my phone. Catherine was a music junkie and I knew she would bug me to play some song or another. She fumbled around with her purse behind the trunk before throwing it in and slamming it shut.

She strutted up to the passenger door and as she swung it open I once again got a glimpse of her chest. I felt myself get a little stiff. She was my best female friend here and I’d had some close encounters with her before, but I’d never acted on them. Sure, I’d had a fap or two with her making an appearance, but I really didn’t think of her that way. She slid into the car seat and snatched my phone to start playing music. Some indie funk electro non-sense that I couldn’t understand. Then it began. She gave me the spiel. Her time in Europe. The weekend trips. The food. The culture, the art. I’d heard it before from each one of my sisters. I nodded my head and responded at the appropriate times with an “oh wow” or “yeah that’s crazy”.

I’ll never know what prompted her to bring this next part up, but it really threw me way off. I don’t know if she noticed I wasn’t really paying attention or what, but she just threw it out there.

“I gave two guys head at the same time.” My jaw about hit the floor. She wasn’t an angel, but that was something I didn’t even consider was in her realm of possibility. I guess mainly because I didn’t even know that was a thing that happened. Consider me naïve.

“Uhh. What?” I didn’t know what else to say.

“I took a surfing lesson with this guy in Portugal when I was there for a weekend. We went out for drinks as a big group from our lesson later that night. I was definitely into him and I let him know at the beach, but that night he was being distant like guys do. I was out there dancing and then this other guy came up and got me some drinks. He apparently knew the other guy. They start talking. One thing leads to another and we are back on the beach.”“Woah. Who are you!? What happened to my innocent Cat?” I glanced over at her.

“I’m right here! It was so hot. It was an awakening for sure. They finished at the same time too. Riiiight here.” She ran one hand down her tank top towards her chest and in doing so pulled it down dangerously low. The slight dip of her cleavage, however small, was burning into my eyes.

“Ugh gross. I don’t even know you anymore.” I rolled my eyes and pulled into the parking lot, trying to ignore the swelling in my boxers.

“You’re just jealous you weren’t one of them.”

“Can we talk about something else!? What do you want?” I motioned towards the liquor store.

“I’d like one fifth of Smirnoff and one fifth of Bacardi Dragonberry. I have a new friend I met over the summer that’s coming in tonight. You’re gonna love her. We are turning uuppp.” She tossed a couple twenties at me.

I went in the store and cooled off a bit. When Cat left she was that girl that only ever kissed a boy once in high school. Now she was braless, flashing her body at me, and telling me about how she let two guys cum on her. Once I got back in the car she tried to convince me to come out that night.

“What are you doing tonight? You need to get out more. Stop studying. You’re so straight edge.”

“It’s hot. I’m tired. Maybe tomorrow.” “It’s always tomorrow with you!”“Ugh but everything is so far from my house.”“Ok. Easy solution. Come shower at my place and take a nap. I have to make some phone calls about that internship and turn in a couple assignments. We can pregame at my place then head over to Allen’s place. No problem.” She put her hand on my arm, leaned over, and looked me dead in the eye. Her tank top sank down in front of her chest and I knew from my peripheral if looked down now I could see both of her breasts fully exposed. It took everything I had to keep my eyes on the road. I could barely make out the light brown of her areola against her tanned skin. I knew better than to argue at this point. My dick was straining against my shorts. I just wanted to get out of the car without her noticing.

“Ok whatever. But I want a clean towel this time!”____________________________________________

It’s usually not a big deal. I shower at Cat’s place all the time. I live in my Aunt’s vacation house, which is way out in the woods, so I sometimes even spend the night at Cat’s if we are doing stuff in town. So I was pretty comfortable with the whole process.  

“Are you sure there’s a towel in there?” I asked Cat as I began to pull my dirty clothes off at the door. Cat unlocked the door and stepped inside. I peeled my sweat-soaked shirt off. I’m naïve, but not retarded. If I couldn’t feel the tension before, I could now. I could feel her eyes raking over my body as my shirt came over my head.

“Uhh there’s a towel in there right?” I jerked towards the bathroom with my thumb.

“Mm? Oh, uh, yeah. Under the sink. Do you want me to wash your stuff while you’re in there?” She said trying to pretend she was busy examining the contents of her fridge. I don’t think she noticed she was doing it but one hand grabbed the crotch of her shorts and pulled it down as if to free it from something.

“Yeah if you don’t mind.” I pulled my shorts off and threw them at the foot of the laundry machine with my shirt and socks. I still had my compression shorts on which fit kind of like a European bathing suit really, so I didn’t feel too self-conscious. I walked into the bathroom and turned on the water. There was a wet towel hanging on the rack. I pondered it for a moment. That’s the towel Cat used this morning. It probably touched every part of her. The image of her running the towel down her legs as she bent over in front of the mirror flashed through my mind. Her standing exactly where I was standing, naked, with her nipples probably tightening and shrinking because of the cold air on her skin as she toweled each droplet off of her flat stomach… I shook the image out of my mind and checked under the sink for the clean towel. Nothing under that sink, but tampons and toilet bowl cleaner.

I opened the door to yell at Cat to give me a clean towel. I was going to give her a ribbing just to mess with her, but when I got the door all the way open I was once again flabbergasted. There she was, her face almost buried in my dirty shirt. I quickly looked away and turned to look at the shower, if she knew I’d seen her she would have died of embarrassment on the spot.

“Hey where’s that clean towel again? It’s not under the sink.” I slowly turned now to give her time to adjust.

“Shit. Sorry. It must still be in the dryer. Here.” She tossed the towel from the dryer into my hands. I nodded appreciatively and jumped in the shower. It was getting out of hand. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. There’s no way this is happening like I think it’s happening, I told myself. I turned the water to a freezing rain. I must have been in there a while because she came and knocked on the door.

“Did you fall in the shower? Where’s your Life Alert?”

“No, no, just uhhh making sure I’m clean... Sorry.” Wow was I smooth or what? As if I couldn’t embarrass myself enough I followed it up with, “Your body wash smells amazing.”

“It’s the same I’ve always used...?” she said giving me a curious side eye, “I’m going to make those phone calls and fuck around on my computer. I’ll be in the living room. You can just nap in my bed.” I hopped out of the shower and toweled myself off. I put on some spare clothes I keep in the car. Nothing special. Just some sweatpants and a dri-fit shirt form some soccer camp I went to a couple years ago. I couldn’t find the boxers I usually pack so I was going full commando in those fleece pants and it felt amazing. There really isn’t anything quite like soft fleece rubbing against your head as you drift off to sleep.

Cat’s bed was covered in pillows of all shapes and sizes. It was more like a pillow pit than a bed really. Though it did provide an extra degree of comfort. I slunk down between two large green body length pillows and stared at the ceiling. I wasn’t sure what I was feeling, but I was definitely turned on. My mind was still racing about what I’d seen earlier. Cat’s breasts flashing in front of me, her smelling my clothes. I wondered how many times she’d laid in this bed and got herself off. Did she lay here and touch herself and think about me? I bet she would lay down flat on her back and bend her knees up. Spread them just a bit and slide one hand down into her panties. She was definitely the type of girl who did it with them on. I knew that for sure, I thought. Slipped a finger between the wetness of her lips and twirled a finger around her clit. Her mousey moans slipping out of her lips...I couldn’t hold it any longer, I blame the sweatpants really, I put my hand in my pants and ever so lightly stroked my cock. I knew I couldn’t finish here, but it felt so good. This was rudely interrupted when the pillow next to me cleared its throat.

“What in the fuck?!” I tried to roll over to get a look at the noise I’d just heard, but I ended up completely thrashing my way out of the bed and onto the floor.

“Oh. You must be Cat’s soccer player friend. I’m Terry,” A girl’s face poked out from the top of the covers.

“God you gave me a heart attack,” I picked myself up off the floor. Cat had mentioned she had a friend coming over, but I didn’t know she was already there. Thanks a lot, Cat. I was filled with terror at this point. Did she notice me? Was she asleep? There was no way she didn’t know. I was practically on top of her.

“I got here when you were in the shower. I guess I should have said something,” She came to the edge of the bed. Her skin was pale, a rarity in this part of the country, her eyes, behind a hipster pair of dark glasses, were a pair of light blue eyes and her long hair was so blonde it was almost white. She had a round face and sort of elfish ears. I had never seen anyone that looked anything like her. On one hand she was odd looking, but on the other, her face was feminine, beautiful, and her lips were such an astonishing shade of pink that I couldn’t help but stare right at them.

“What is there something on my face?” She said rubbing her nose.

“No. Sorry. I’m just still in a bit of shock.” I sat down on the edge of the bed.

“Here you can have that half of the bed. We can even use this pillow as a divider,” Terry began to rearrange the cushions on the bed like a kid building a fort.

“I think I’ll just go sleep on the couch actually. Thanks though.” I stood up to leave.

“You don’t want to do that.” She said rolling her eyes around the room and giving me an impish smile. I froze. Looking back on it now, this was the moment I knew I was dealing with someone who could own the rest of my life.

“Why’s that?”

“Because if you leave now... I’m going to tell Cat what you were doing in her bed.” Terry stood up out of the bed now and casually blocked the door. I finally got a full view of her body. She was wearing a 3/4 sleeve baseball cut Raider’s shirt and those tiny sleeping shorts that lingerie stores sell. I could tell from first glance her body was amazing. Her legs were long and toned. Her hips were wide and her breasts were large. She too was braless. I could tell from the way they hung on her chest. Thick and full. She was insanely attractive and she fucking knew it. Every guy has had this feeling before. You meet that chick and you know she’s bad news. Your gut tells you to get the fuck out. To run, because this one won’t be tamed. But you never ever do. Because this one owns you the second it lays its eyes on you and part of you wants to be destroyed.

“And what was I doing in her bed?” I feigned ignorance. My eyes latched onto her breasts and I didn’t bother to try to hide it. My hormones were betraying me.

“Don’t play. Look at your sweatpants,” she laughed at me with her eyes. She was right. My sweatpants gave me away. I was pointing right at her at almost full tilt. “Not the first time I’ve been given that salute... I wonder what Cat would say if she knew you were rubbing that thing all in her sheets,” she continued “Please don’t say anything. She’s my only friend,” I conceded. I really didn’t think it would be a big deal if she found out with the signals I’d been receiving lately, but part of me was already gone to this succubus. I wanted to know how this would play out. Terry just oozed mischief.

“I won’t,” She said as she retreated into the covers, “If you do what I say.”

“What do you want?” I knew where this was going. Or I hoped I knew where this was going.“Come. I like your body heat.” She patted a spot on the bed next to her. I laid down on my side and faced her. Her eyes were a radiant blue. The more I stared the more beautiful she became. The way her hair pooled over her shoulder. I never would have let it go this far if I wasn’t edging already. All the looks from Cat and the gentle glow of her skin. I had to see where this led.

Ever so gently, she reached out her left hand and put it on the side of my head. She ran her hand down my shoulders and arms like a potter at her wheel.

“You’re hot,” She said as she lifted up my shirt and ran that same cool hand over my stomach. She bit her lip.

“Mmm,” She closed her eyes and ran her hand up to my chest. Her light touch sending electric signals through my body I’d never felt before. I don’t know how it happened, but the next thing I know her lips are on my neck and my eyes are rolling into the back of my head. I felt her teeth brush against the bottom of my neck. What the fuck was this? She has to be some sort of vampire, I thought. It was like a spell. I knew I could stop her at any point I wanted, but at the same time I couldn’t.

Her hand was running up the length of my shaft through my sweatpants and I felt like bursting. She was pushing every button, and she pushed it perfectly. Her lips were like velvet or cashmere. I couldn’t tell which because I was preoccupied with a handful of her hair at the base of her neck as I tried to pull her into me. I wanted to grind into her. She pulled away from me. Without missing a beat she pulled her shorts off and flicked them across the room.

“Here’s what’s going to happen,” She said as she took my hand in hers and guided it between her legs. It felt like a sauna. I could feel the warmth of her pussy radiating through her lace panties. I used the palm of my hand to just lightly rub the top to the bottom. She lifted her hips off the bed and pushed against my hand.

“I’m going to call Cat in here, and no matter what happens you won’t stop,” Terry’s cheeks began to light up with a pink hue. I nodded my head in agreement. She could have told me to eat her ass and I’d have buried myself neck deep in it.

“Hey Cat what’s the schedule tonight?” Terry called at the door. I could hear Cat’s footsteps echoing down the hall. Should I pretend to be asleep? Should I roll over and face the other way? Before I could decide she pulled her panties to the side and I felt her wetness for the first time. Soaked. Shaved. Smooth. Without a second thought I pushed a finger inside her. She squeezed her legs together and I felt the contractions inside her. She wanted it so badly and I was more than happy to give it to her.

Cat opened the door. There was just enough space between Terry and me to not arouse suspicion, but if she pulled the cover down an inch or two she would be able to see how my arm twisted towards Terry’s pussy. “Oh shit, I forgot to tell you Terry was here.” Cat laughed as she realized her mistake. “We’ve been chatting. He’s even nicer than you said,” Terry said, locking her eyes with Cat’s.

“Well just remember that he was my friend first!” Cat said. Terry was slowly grinding her hips down on my finger. I decided to add another one. She tilted her head up at the penetration. A light sweat broke out on her forehead. I could feel her dripping down onto my palm.

“So what’s the plan for tonight?” I asked Cat.

“Mmmm. I’ve actually been working on a little something on the balcony as a surprise...”“I’m excited. I like where this is going,” Terry said. Her voice now a subtly higher pitch. I knew I had her on the ropes now. My fingers churning away at her g-spot and my thumb running slow circles on her clit. I pushed down with my thumb and curled my fingers up and slowly traced them across the soft wet bumps of the roof of her vagina.

“And what’s that?” I asked.

“I got this inflatable kid’s pool at Target and filled it up on the balcony.”“Whaaat! That’s awesome. I didn’t bring-” Terry started to say, but her body began to shudder. I could feel the climax rolling through her from the inside. Her muscles tightened and I thought her thighs were going to break my wrist for a moment before she finally let go.

“Sorry, I thought I was about to sneeze. I didn’t bring a swimsuit though,” She said. Wow. What a recovery.

“Just borrow one of mine. Let’s take some shots!” Cat strolled back out of the room. Terry jumped out of the bed and slid her lace thong to the floor.

“Can’t wear these anymore,” She said. I got my first full glance at her mound now. It was completely shaved and fairly prominent. A smooth curl to it as it dipped between her legs and her lips almost completely covered her. I could make out a small mole just barely inside her right thigh. A tiny imperfection on her flawless body that made her all the more human and all the more desirable.

“Thanks for that,” She said as she stripped her shirt off as well. I was right about her breasts. They sat perfectly on her chest and she had large pink nipples that were juxtaposed perfectly by her pale white skin. Her breasts rounded out across her torso and below them her stomach was smooth and gave way to wide hips, but it didn’t stop there. As she turned to rummage through Cat’s drawers she bent over and revealed the thickest ass I’d ever seen. A true bubble butt. Thick, but tight. So pronounced she had ass cleavage almost. She turned back around to look at me.

“You should probably go now.”

I nodded and made my way out to the kitchen, not sure what to think, so I didn’t think. I took the Smirnoff out of the freezer and pulled straight from the bottle.

“Uh. Ok,” Cat said as I lowered the bottle from my lips.

“Sorry. I just feel like it tonight,” I could tell tonight was going to be a shit show. I just hoped it was going to be one I didn’t regret. I took some shot glasses from the cabinet and poured us each a ‘healthy’ amount.

“No, no, don’t be sorry...yet. I haven’t out drank you in a while,” Cat nudged me. I never really drank much, mostly because of soccer practice and trying to keep that place on the Dean’s list, but also because of my very obvious lack of self-control when I did. Long story short, I’m a bit of a light weight.

“Whatever,” I rolled my eyes at her.

“Don’t whatever me mister!” She surprised me and leaned over and grabbed me by the balls. Literally. She squeezed. I think it was supposed to hurt, but in the end all it felt like was a solid cupping. I swatted her hand away before she could feel me stirring.

“Terry come take your shot you slow slut,” Cat called down to Terry. Terry emerged from Cat’s bedroom with her clothes back on, and I imagine a bikini underneath.

“What are we drinking?” She asked.

“What’s it matter?” I responded. She shrugged in agreement and we downed our first round.

We took another round of shots before we decided to try the homemade pool. Terry and Cat went to Cat’s room while Cat changed and I went back to the bathroom to change. All I had dry at this point were my compression shorts so I slipped them back on. When I checked myself out in the mirror I laughed. My dick was so obvious in these, you could always tell where it was no matter how I adjusted it. I just shrugged and told myself it was better than boxers. The girls were taking forever to get ready (go figure) so I went ahead and dipped myself into the pool.

It was still in the 80’s so the cool water actually felt good. It had soaked up some heat from the sun for sure and I felt myself slouch over and finally relax. God knows I needed to. I could still feel my blood stirring below my waist and every muscle in my body wanted to tear into someone. If I was at home I probably would have jacked off two or three times and then tried to go to sleep, but I would have to exercise some self-control. I pushed my hands through my hair and took another gulp of my drink. I could feel a buzz building.

I was giving the horizon an absent stare when Cat and Terry finally came back. Cat had on a colorful purple and yellow bandeau bikini top that and string bottoms. The tiniest sliver of her tanlines showed on her hips and ass but I knew from stories she’d told that she sunbathed topless on her porch regularly. God, her legs looked amazing though. Long and tight and muscular. You could tell she ran and worked out hard. I wanted to run my hand from her ankle up her thighs and in between and kiss her stomach. Her whole body just seemed so... tight.

“We couldn’t find a bikini top that fit her,” Cat rolled her eyes jokingly, “So we just had to slap a bra on her. It’s the only one she brought so she can’t get it wet.”

Cat dipped a toe in the water to test its warmth before finally lowering herself in across from me. In one hand she had the bottle of vodka and a red solo cup full of some sort of juice, and in the other she had her iPod dock playing some more French music.. Terry came out onto the balcony a second later with towels and the Bacardi. True to Cat’s word she had on a plain black bra with a shined finish that made her pale breasts swell against each other. At her waist she had on what should have been a normal navy bikini bottom, but her ass practically swallowed the thing. She stepped into the water without hesitation and settled down next to Cat. She then unscrewed the cap from the Bacardi and threw it off the balcony.

“It was only going to get in the way,” she said as she took a long drink. Her cheeks flushed up with red and I could tell she was feeling it a little already. Glancing between the two, I couldn’t decide who I wanted more. They both had insane sex appeal, but Cat was a close friend and Terry was obviously out of my league when it came to adventure. Either way, my cock was bulging in my shorts at this point. Luckily, between the water and the dim porch light, it was hard, if not impossible, for the ladies to tell.

“Let’s play a drinking game!” Cat said.

“Have you ever played Russian Rogue Roulette?” Terry asked.

“You mean with a gun?” I asked like an idiot. Terry snorted at the suggestion. It was actually really cute.

“No, not with a gun. We get six shot glasses. three of them are filled with water and three of them are filled with vodka or rum. Switch them around so no one knows which one is which. Then we draw a card from one to six, also shuffled. You have to drink the one that corresponds with that place in the shot lineup. If you drink one that’s full of liquor you have to keep drinking until you drink one that’s water,” Terry explained. Cat’s eyes lit up at the suggestion.

“Go get the shot glasses and cards!” Cat pointed at me and ordered.

“Uh. Ok. But just for the record, this game sounds like a bad idea. We are gonna get wasted real fast,” I cautioned.

“I think it’s cute when guys are scared,” Terry said mockingly with a flick of her long blonde hair. I just shook my head and walked inside. Sidenote, the worst feeling in the world is being wet and having to walk through air-conditioned rooms. I took six shot glasses from the cabinet and started opening drawers to look for the cards. I knew they were around here in the kitchen, but couldn’t remember exactly which drawer. I peeked my head around the corner to ask Cat which drawer, and caught a glimpse of something I was not expecting. Cat and Terry were sitting much closer than when I had left. Terry’s hand was sitting on Cat’s thigh and she was whispering in Cat’s ear. Cat was listening intently and giggling and nodding. This scheming could only end poorly for me. I turned back to the kitchen and continued to ransack it. I found the cards sitting directly on top of the kitchen counter, right in front of me. Of course. I walked outside and handed the shots to the girls who were both sporting sly grins.

“One last thing,” Cat said, “will you move that stool into the middle of the pool so we have somewhere to play?”

I rolled my eyes and shook my head, but obliged. I picked up the little wrought iron stool and dropped it in the middle of the pool. The girls placed the full shot glasses on the table and then Cat placed the cards, one through six, facedown on the table.

“Since you’re such a gentleman, why don’t you go first?” Terry said. I shrugged and figured since the best odds of not drawing a shot were at the start, it wasn’t a big deal. I drew from the deck and got a six. I took the shot from the end and downed it. This one was straight Bacardi. Smooth enough though. The girls laughed.

“Keep going!” Cat laughed.

“You’ll get yours,” I drew another card. A four this time. I took the fourth shot glass and put it to my lips. It was also rum. I poured it back and sighed. What are the fucking odds? Cat and Terry were cracking up. I guess I deserved it for being the most unlucky bastard in the world.

“You guys suck,” I said. I drew another card. One. I took the first shot and before I even tasted it I knew it was liquor. I put it back and looked at the girls. My stomach was grumbling at this point and I could tell I was about to slide into that slippery euphoric drunken state.

“You two drink one now,” I said.

“Why? It’s only water left,” Cat said.

“Oh? Is it? Or did you fill them all with rum to fuck with me!” I picked up one of the shots and smelled it.

“Oh you bitches,” I took the shot and splashed it on Cat’s face. She squealed but she was too busy laughing at her stupid prank to care. I slid over next to her and grabbed another shot. I was feeling a little drunk now and a little handsy. I started tickling her ribs to try and make her take the shot.

“Oh nooooo! Help Terry he’s gonna have his way with me!” Cat reached out a hand to her friend for help.

“Pfft. Why would I want to stop that? That’d be hot. I’d watch,” Terry said taking the last shot off the stool and downing it.

“Terrryyyy!” Cat thrashed around trying to avoid my fingers. As her body wiggled my finger slipped and I pulled her bikini top down. Way down. “Oh shit,” I froze. Her left nipple was fully exposed and the top of her right one poked over the top as well. Just like I thought. No tanlines. Her nipples were small and a light brown that complemented her tan skin. Cat let it sit for just a beat before she pulled it up.

“Just like in Portugal,” Cat smirked thinking she’d won the battle when really all she’d done was begin the war.

“I vote Cat takes the damn shot and the next one,” Terry interrupted. She took the shot from my hand and handed it to Cat. She then poured another one to the brim and pounded it back. As if that wasn’t enough, she refilled the glass and handed it to Cat.

“You have ten seconds to finish both of those shots or I’m going to tell him what I found in your purse tonight,” Terry pushed the shot glasses towards Cat’s face.

“Wait what?” I said.

“You wouldn’t...” Cat began to protest.

“Five seconds,” Terry moved closer. Cat dumped the first one back and before she could swallow it all she tossed back the other one too. It dribbled down her chin.

“Oh no you spilled some. Now it doesn’t count. I think I’ll have to tell him anyway,” Terry teased. She ran her thumb across Cat’s chin to wipe away the liquor. She licked the excess off her thumb.

Terry was about to open her mouth and spill the secret, but Cat slapped a hand over her mouth.

“Why don’t we play a new game? One that people can’t rig or cheat at?” Cat blurted out to try and change the subject. She held up three fingers. Following her lead Terry and I held up three fingers, a game of never have I ever that would change my fantasies forever.

I could feel those shots really powering through me now and based on Terry’s gentle swaying she could too. My head was light and warm and my stomach fuzzy. My dick was still uncomfortably hard in my shorts, and unfortunately, now that Terry had closed the distance between all three of us, it was pretty obvious. I put my hand over it to try and block Terry’s gaze. She smiled at me from the corner of her mouth as if to she knew that I knew.

“Never have I ever smoked weed,” Cat said. Terry put a finger down. I put a finger down. Getting drug tested was part of playing sports, but I had risked it once in high school and I didn’t smoke again until after I graduated college, but that’s another story. Terry went next.

“Never have I ever fingered a girl,” Terry said. Cat put a finger down with me. I had to interject.

“What the hell have you been doing!?”

“Oh, Cat didn’t tell you? She fingered another girl over the summer. It’s amazing the things people reveal with the right amount of tequila,” Terry said nonchalantly. She’d only known Cat for half a year, but knew more about her sex life than I did.

“This is crazy. I feel like I’m sitting here with two strangers!” I said.

“Well to be fair,” Cat said with her sweet innocent voice, “You never asked, and it’s not exactly something that comes up in normal conversation.”

I shook my head in disbelief. I was beginning to think I had been wrong about this little So Cal Christian school girl after all.

“Ok. My turn. Never have I ever...masturbated in public,” I said. Cat and Terry put a finger down. It took all of my self-control not let me jaw hit the floor or to fall over backwards. I was in way over my head. I always thought guys were the uncontrollable gender, but these two were living life on the edge. We were all down to our last finger and Cat would get to decide the loser. She could easily strike us both out. I was trying to think of what she would say to win when, not for the first or last time on the evening, she surprised me with:

“Never have I ever hooked up in my friends bed while she was standing right there.”Terry put her finger down and poured us both a shot. We’d been had.

“What!? How’d you know?” I was floored.

“Terry’s shorts were literally sitting on the floor and she was practically moaning her sentences...plus the smell? I would have to be blind and/or deaf not to have noticed. I thought you were supposed to be the wholesome one too,” She said with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. Her cheeks were red and flushed. I could tell she was feeling the drink as well. Her eyes had that sparkle that comes with drunkenness.

“And here I was thinking the same thing about you,” I took the shot from Terry’s hand and poured it down my throat. I couldn’t even taste the alcohol anymore.

“So what’ll it be your highness?” Terry asked wiping the last bit of liquor from her lips, “What is it you command of us peasants?”

“Strip,” she said. Without missing a beat Terry unclasped her bra and threw it towards the door. Her tits looked amazing in the dark light. The pale glow made her seem so exotic. I wanted to reach out and touch her skin again.

Cat was staring at them with as much amazement as I was.

“First, I meant him. Second, are you kidding me? Ugh, some girls get all the luck.”

She looked down at her own chest and rolled her eyes. Terry tilted her head back and pushed her chest out, as if to say, “don’t mind me”.

“You don’t feel...uncomfortable?” I asked squirming now. I wasn’t fully hard yet, but it was definitely getting there.

“They’re just boobs. Besides, you’re about to feel waaaay more uncomfortable. You heard her. She wants you to strip,” Terry said with a smile.

“I can’t strip. I’d be totally naked,” I protested. The girls both smiled simultaneously, they already knew I wasf going to cave. They could tell how drunk I was. Cat leaned into Terry’s ear and whispered something. Terry’s eyes widened and she glanced at Cat from the corner of her eyes. What happened next sent me over the edge. Cat reached up and began playing with Terry’s breast. Her slender arms and small hands just seemed like the perfect juxtaposition to Terry’s swollen chest. Terry instinctively bucked her hips forward ever so slightly. Without thinking I slowly slid my shorts off and laid them on the edge of the pool. I could feel my cock twitching so I did what every guy would do in this situation and stroked it. Just slow and deliberately. I didn’t want to cum too soon and I wanted to put on a show for the girls. Cat’s hand slid from Terry’s breast to between her legs. She slowly traced circles on the outside of her bikini bottoms. Cat’s face was still buried in her neck and I could tell she was whispering something naughty in her ear. Terry’s face was flushed and she had started kicking her hips rhythmically with Cat’s hand. Her eyes fluttered between open and closed, between Cat’s body and my cock. She eventually took her right hand and started tugging on her nipples and used the other to pull Cat’s bikini bottoms loose. “I don’t want us to be the only ones having fun.” Terry said trying to pull the bottoms away from Cat.“Mmm, not yet.” Cat reaffirmed her dominance over Terry by slipping her hand past her clothes and finally onto her bare skin. “But look at him...He’s about to pop.” Terry managed in-between soft breaths. Cat did nothing except continue whispering and maybe speed up her fingers on Terry’s smooth sex. She wasn’t wrong either, my cock was swollen and I could feel a huge and slow orgasm building behind my balls. The head of my cock was shining as the skin tightened and I massaged the precum down my head and shaft.

“What are you whispering, Cat?” I started to move closer."

I'm not sure this kind of question is categorized in NewZealand subreddit so please correct me know if I am wrong.

I'm a international student who is studying at The university of Auckland and I need a practical experience to use my knowledge that I learned in university and to build a way for my career. It seems like getting an internship is very helpful but also it has been quite hard for me so far. And personally when I assess myself, possibly,  writing English would be a problem (English is not my native language).

So instead, I want to find an extra curriculum for practicing coding for Python and R-studio (I'm interested in data science area) or any club/association that I can invest my time on.

Or any advice would be helpful. Thank you!

1. Would a memory stick of 16 GB be enough to hold on to whatever the OS would need? [Link to the USB im planning to buy](https://www.sandisk.com/home/usb-flash/ultra-fit-usb)

2. How would this whole thing work?

So I made up my mind and decided to look at other agencies for conversions. 

I keep on getting encouraged to apply for jobs. The thing that’s keeping me back from wanting to apply is my personal issue with the GS levels. Due to personal financial problems and future budgets, I think I’m better off skipping straight from GS-5 to GS-9. I don’t want to apply and get accepted for a job for a GS lower than a GS-9 if I’ll be eligible for that in 3 months.

1. *The slutty-moan worthy attraction of primal fucking.*

2. *The fun power-reversal dynamics of being owned by an animal.*

3. ... *Fuck it, knots are pretty hot too...*

*Anyway, without further dallying, the prompt:*

---

No one at work knows who I am. Not really. To them, I'm just the skinny, introverted, effette intern who does the photocopying and makes sure a pot of coffee's always on the boil. Most of them assume that I'm gay - I'm bi, actually, but my history of hetero behaviour is so minute I don't care to correct them - but if they knew who my current boyfriend was... Well, I wouldn't have a job anymore, that much is certain.

Now, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. 

To be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.

I first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.

You, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.

However, your owner was far from concerned. ""Happens all the time,"" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. ""Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.""

Needless to say, I was far from impressed.

Twelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.

I revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.

Come the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. ""Come on, man,"" he pleaded. ""It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you."" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.

No such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...

About a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. 

I strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.

I keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.

I don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.

And with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.

I've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.

I find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. 

The mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.

Our eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...

---

*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*

*I'm also open to incorporating a third, human character (male or female) that gets off on my living situation, with possible blackmail involved. That said, I'd prefer the story's focus stay with myself and my canine lover.*

*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*

*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*

*Edit: Please try and be creative, or at the very least informative in your reply. One-liners are... Less than ideal.*"

I first got to know Kate when I was a junior in highschool. I didn't really know her but I had her on facebook for whatever reason since we went to the same school I guess. She messaged me and we hit it off pretty quickly. We started hanging out and hooking up and I don't remember what happened but for whatever reason we stopped talking she just didn't want to be with me. This was kind of always the way it was. I wanted so badly to be with her and she just couldn't be with me. I went off to college and she didn't and I went far from home so I saw that basically as a good time for me to try to forget this girl exists.   

I'm sorry I feel like I am skipping around it's just that in almost no time after getting to know her we became extremely close friends. I first started talking to her a few months after my dad died and she was the only person I could really talk about my dad with who didn't just feel sorry for me. She helped me through a really hard time in my life and during this time she was having severe issues with depression and self harm that I would try my best to help her through.   

So several times while at college we reconnected and started up again. During the summer after my freshman year we actually were getting together all the time and it was feeling great. At the beginning of my sophomore year she came up and we had one of the best weekends of my life. We were officially dating. We were constantly talking throughout the day and this was one of the happiest I had ever been. In the back of my mind though, I knew she had been with a decent amount of guys and I had only been with her and it did make me feel a little insecure. Especially to think thhat she chose really shitty losers over me.   

We eventually break up that same fall semester. It's really hard for me and every time we stop talking I'm still thinking about her and try my best but fail to not look at her social media all the time even though I've unfollowed and blocked everything I can still creep on her instagram etc. So this is when I start making a serious effort to forget this girl. I want to think highly of myself and I mostly did but thinking about her not wanting me affected that. Every day I work harder and harder to not think about this girl. I focus on school and my friends. She pops up again talking about how great I am and how bad she was and I don't know how it happened but I ended up hanging out with her a lot that summer not hooking up with her. I knew that she was with some kind of abusive boyfriend, but I was just happy to see her and I didn't talk much with her about that. We would go into the city or go cayaking do whatever over the summer, probably at least once or maybe more a week.   

Typing this out I know she probably doesn't sound like a great person and I sound like a pushover but I loved this girl and she struggled with a lot of things. The ""Kate"" I know is an amazing person and the only person I've ever been able to connect with anywhere close to this level.   

I'm losing track of the timeline myself but we eventually have not talked for quite a while. She gets in contact with a friend of mine to get me to unblock her so she can call me. She calls me and asks if she could do it over text. She tells me she's pregnant. I am freaking out at this point. I say, Kate I always thought eventually it would be me and you, once I can be at home once I'm done with school. You can't do this. You can't be pregnant. She tells me she is going to have the baby. That was the last push I needed to really be able to not talk to her again.  

I don't ever speak to her and one day she reaches out to me again. This is during my last semester of school. I finished this past december so this must have been around September. She wanted to just thank me for being who I was and say that it was all her fault and if there was any blame I put on myself for us not workking than I shouuldn't. At this point in my life I have basically gotten all of my confidence back. I was never really heavy but I was a bit overweight and I started running and lifting most days and eating well. I lost 20 pounds in that fall semester. That previous summer I got my first really great internship in my field. It had been so long since I saw this girl and I had stopped trying not to think at all about her. I asked if we could have dinner while I was home for Thanksgiving. We ended up talking a lot. Now I've graduated and accepted my first real job. It's a good job. I'm right on the cusp of my future. This past week I got to hang out with her twice and I've been talking a lot with her. I think I want to be with her. I love being around her. I love her so much, I never want to lose her. I don't want her to end up having to take some piece of shit for a partner because she's a single mom. I don't think anybody deserves her. She is so beautiful and such a great person. At the same time she has already hurt me in a way that I decided was unforgivable. How could I respect myself if I go back to this girl who left me, chose other men over me, even chose to have a child with someone else.   

I can see this is really scattered and I'm sorry. I partly thought it would help to get all of this out of my mind. I feel like I only wrote the bad parts about Kate, but I know that I don't want to meet someone else in an attempt to just find someone like her.  

I am right at this stage in my life where I am going to have ultimate freedom. Financial freedom. I am doing so well. I don't want to be ashamed jumping into basically almost a step father role when I'm so young. Being embarassed that I'm taking back my girlfriend who had someone's kid. I don't know what else to say, I might end up deleting this. I honestly don't even think I've given you guys enough information to help me.

7zp1h1,1,2018-02-23,[23/f] I am having difficulties supporting my lifelong friends [26ish/f] through their life decisions.,blirdy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7zp1h1/23f_i_am_having_difficulties_supporting_my/,"First off, I know the title already sounds conceited - it's their life, and my opinions and advice shouldn't matter in this situation. Ultimately, I'm hoping to gain some additional perspective to hopefully change my mindset when they approach me to be an ear for their issues. 

I have two friends, who I will call Abby and Danny for the sake of asking advice for dealing with each. I've known them both since I was 15, and we've been through high school and college together. 

Abby is somewhere around $80k in debt for her bachelor's degree, and she decided to get a masters on loans leading to an additional $40k debt, at least. She's worked at the same campus job for the past 6 years, and got a promotion into a leadership role about 3 years ago. This promotion allowed her to take on more projects and implement processes that saved the department money overall. 

Abby has decided to take a break year from her masters, which means her loans are apparently becoming due. Abby has also decided that she won't apply for a real job, and is only applying for internships that don't offer the stability, pay, or insurance that she needs, as she can't afford her depression or ADHD meds on her own. From my understanding, real world experience is more applicable than internships when it comes to her degree, and it kind of feels like she's just avoiding getting into the working world because she's too afraid of not being a student anymore and what that will entail. 

She's also decided to stop taking her medications altogether to help her be prepared for working at an internship without insurance, and it's lead to some crazy impulsive decisions with her hair and her diet - I'm not exaggerating when I say that every week for the past month, she's been on a new diet and has a new hair color (for the people who know hair dying, she's cycling the bleaching out the old color and adding the new color every week). First it started with keto one week, then it was intermittent fasting 16:8, then it was intermittent fasting 23:1, and then it was total water fasting multiple days in a row before we told her that she shouldn't be switching her diet so frequently like that without at least talking to her doctor due to her other more seriously health concerns. 

She's also taken on a very expensive hobby, buying upwards of $200/week in supplies while living off of ramen, rice and beans, and beer throughout the rest of the week. I'm genuinely worries about her. She seems to be going completely manic and I don't know what to do or how to help, being so far away and without a car. 

My other friend, Danny, has been making similar decisions as well, almost as if they're feeding off each other. 

Danny is $120k in debt from her undergrad in a degree whose median pay in 1/4 that. In college, she took out max loans while she was working full time, and spent the money frivolously, not realizing how much her payments were going to be when they came due. She left the job she got out of college that would have paid her her entire masters degree if she stayed with them for another year, which is something she needs in her field is she's ever going to pay off her loans, and decided to go to a different company that pays $2/hr more than her old one but has less overall benefits and does not pay for additional schooling or accrediting. She also began a rampant purchasing of accessories related to a hobby that she wants but can't afford the main component to have. Identifying the hobby would identify Danny, but last time I visited her at her parents home, she had 15 similar pieces of the hobby valuing around $6000, if the items she were purchasing were the absolute cheapest available. Mind you, these are only accessories for the hobby - she does not own the main component that would allow her to use any of these accessories because the main component is too expensive and too much of a commitment. 

All of this would be fine, if they didn't also try to involve me in these decisions and ask my advice as well. I'm the most financially stable of all of my high school friends, and I've figured out most of the big stuff just by doing a lot of research on how to manage your finances at this age to maximize your benefits in the future. It's not like I grew up privileged and got all the knowledge from my parents, either - I grew up poor with parents who couldn't handle their money, so I made a commitment to myself that I would learn how to manage my finances on my own. 

I don't want to cut these people out of my life, but the fact that they constantly ask my advice for saving and budgeting and jobs and don't take it is getting to be too stressful. It sucks seeing the people who I love and respect and care for constantly put themselves in these dire financial decisions because they won't see how their spending habits are affecting them overall. 

How can I approach this situation or change my mindset to be more accepting that this is just the way they are and they aren't going to change?

7zp4gy,1,2018-02-23,Help me not feel guilty for hypothetically quitting my job?,nottheexpert836,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7zp4gy/help_me_not_feel_guilty_for_hypothetically/,"Hi everyone,

I’m a student who’s working a (paid)  internship in the government. Long story short, there was some shuffling and now I’m in a different department than when I started. 

I’ve been here about three weeks now, and I find that I’m really dreading coming to work. I don’t click well with my boss- it’s kind of awkward whenever we talk. I think it’s because we both speak to each other in our second languages? Regardless, there’s just a lot of awkward staring and not knowing when the conversation is over. 

As for the job itself...I feel like I’m not really learning anything. I think maybe I was spoiled by my old department. They were always really enthusiastic about me sitting in on meetings, learning new skills, going on-location whenever possible, etc. In my new department, they have me organizing files. That’s what my long-term project is right now. 

I also just got an opportunity to join on a trip to a marginalized community (my community) to recruit students to come work for the government. I ran the idea by my manager, and she said no right away because it would put me over my work hours in my contract. I totally understand that, but it’s a really stark contrast to my old boss, who would have definitely gone to bat for me to get that kind of learning experience. 

Anyways...I’m working part time now with the promise of working full time during the summer. The thing is, I’m already counting down the days and dreading having to be here 9-5 all summer long. I’ve been thinking of applying to different departments for the summer, always as a student employee. 

I feel bad, though, because my manager has a few projects planned for me this summer and I was only hired for this part-time work now with the unwritten ‘condition’ that I would work these summer projects. Is it wrong to quit? Would I be screwing them over? It’s worth noting that these projects are kind of in a sketchy development stage right now and I don’t really get my position in them. 

For reference, I think I was only hired for being part of that aforementioned marginalized community. It’s the community our department works with, and I know it looks really good on the managers to have a high percentage of workers (especially student workers) who come from it. As a result, I just don’t think there’s much work around that actually needed to be done. 

I’m also going to law school next year, so I think it would be really cool to get a position in our ministry of justice, if it was possible. 

So...what do you guys think? Am I being a brat and a screwing them over if I try and find something else, or is it understandable?

Thank you!

**TL:DR** I really don’t like my student job and don’t feel like I’m learning anything. I’m wondering if it’s a bad move to quit for something else (possibly in the same building) after giving them the impression I will be here all summer. "

7zpc6e,70,2018-02-23,"[Swatch] Arrival, unboxing, and review of the grail SUON120",2Cthulhu4Scthulhu,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/7zpc6e/swatch_arrival_unboxing_and_review_of_the_grail/,"After spotting it in another /r/watches thread, I immediately knew that there was one watch I absolutely had to have. One piece to be the cherry on top of the watered down Shirley Temple of my collection. How is a Shirley Temple even watered down, you say?  Who knows... maybe the soda gun was running low or they're trying to stretch the grenadine. Whatever.  Not my problem.

I scrimped and saved for literally days, tacking a photo to my cube wall to remind myself that every packed lunch, every coffee grind poured into the reusable kcup instead of a pod, would eventually pay off, and 2 weeks later, it did.  

There was no shopping - I knew what I wanted and I sought out to get it.  I called into the deep internet abyss, and the great blue and yellow retailer called back. Cyber strutting down the virtual aisles, I passed the likes of [diamond encrusted Pateks](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Patek-Philippe-Patek-Philippe-Aquanaut-5167-1a-with-21-5-Ct-VS-Diamond/797411638) and [garish Royal Oaks](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Audemars-Piguet-Royal-Oak-Offshore-Volcano-Chronograph/193315469) to the true gem of the fine jewelry sorted tab, the SUON120. 

Not 2 days later, I received an email from the front desk that I had a package waiting. And wait, it did not.  I threw my work aside, because it was 415 and time to go home anyway, and raced back to collect my precious cargo. [Although arriving a little worse for wear](https://imgur.com/KsDpfHm), the cardboard had succeeded in protecting the invaluable contents within. [The package contained six (6) pillow packs, split into two, 3-pack strips, filled with the finest Swiss air from the peak of the alps, and the plastic Swatch branded case. ](https://imgur.com/5131VGo)

Bold white lettering on the red case immediately informs the customer that this product is from none other than the same design house that brings you Speedmasters, Khakis, and Heritages.  The case is held shut by a [plastic tension clip](https://imgur.com/woxsuNg), and the band locked in place with [curved plastic strips](https://imgur.com/q8kHcAf).  Inside, [Sir Dog awaits](https://imgur.com/FakeJcF).

[Bold, stoic, and regal](https://imgur.com/tbUcBNz), he stares on, unflinching.  Highly polished and squared off gold hands shrug off the need for numerals, indices, or chapter markings, and reach out to show the time that any true gentleman should be able to read at a glance. His face protected by a microfilm, ([the removal of which](https://imgur.com/19hxUgB) is an orgasmic experience that seems to have been overlooked by the ""luxury"" brands), he ~~awaits~~ commands the user to pick him up and wear.  

**Case** [A matte purple plastic, complemented by a polished gold crown, the 41mm case exudes luxury at every moulded turn. ](https://imgur.com/ylkUToQ)  Solid lugs complete the graceful package as a [domed acrylic crystal ](https://imgur.com/C3AcAoK) adds presence and refinement to the face. The [caseback](https://imgur.com/9sQCvx2) is simple, showing pertinent information and the battery - speaking of battery, 

**Movement** - Only the finest of in-house quartz movements graces Sir Dog. VPH?  Sir Dog has no time to do long division of numbers in the tens of thousands. One second is one tick.  And tick it does.  The tick can be described as nothing short of thunderous, echoing between rooms if not locked away safely in a watch box. Awkward silence in a meeting?  The echoing *tick tick tick* let's the intern know that not only are they wasting your time, they're also wasting Sir Dog's time. And that is unacceptable. 

Hacking?  Is this a job interview, where we try to spin our weaknesses as positives?  Sir Dog does not *hack*.  You do not sync watches *with* Sir Dog, you set your watch *to* Sir Dog.  He waits for no man. 

**Strap** - Many know that purple is the color of luxury and kings. For this reason I decided that I, a mid-level engineer of projects with budgets that would make the layman tremble and say ""that actually seems very reasonable... also, is there a draft?"", decided I was not worthy of the stock rubber.  As Sir Dog refuses to be dressed down with a filthy Nato, the case incorporates notched lugs and a steel bar press fit through plastic grommets, rather than the easily broken spring bars of common men. [Honestly, I'm running out of steam here and need to get back to work.](https://imgur.com/a/IgHCb)

Due to this design, you're unfortunately limited to Swatch brand straps, but I suppose that is to prevent messing with perfection. I don't love the contrast stitch or clear plastic buckle of the rich, brown leather I purchased, but the Swiss know more about matchmaking than I ever will. 

**Wrist presence** - Sir Dog wears light due to his plastic case, and the integrated lugs make the 41mm feel closer to a 38mm.  The domed crystal catches the light and the gold hands sparkle, drawing the attention of many an onlooker to say ""wow, you sure are compensating for a lack of personality here, huh"".  It's the most regal and decadent of my collection, and I feel will turn into a daily wear, as there is no situation where Sir Dog is inappropriate. And he is a constant reminder, glowering on stoically, whenever you look down, not to take yourself too seriously.

I thought it would e a good opportunity to get my grades in order, and to save some money, but after the first day, I realized how much I had let myself go. I had stopped working out. I was taking sleeping pills and smoking every night just to go to sleep. I was staying up really late from insomnia nearly every night and missing my morning classes. Even when I went, I couldn't pay attention or retain any information. I was drowsy for most of the day, up until the late afternoon.

Now, I genuinely feel better. I feel more in control. I don't have insomnia, and I'm not only going to my classes, but actually learning in them. I've been looking for summer internships and studying for exams. I don't want to start again, at least not for a pretty long time. I offered sober monitor for my fraternity's party tonight, giving me extra reason to not break down. I got rid of the extra weed I had from before I quit, and I'm hoping to keep things like this for a long, long time. Everyone else quitting, keep it up!"

7zqq2s,1,2018-02-23,What a productive day,AnotherLongAssDay,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/7zqq2s/what_a_productive_day/,"We had three documents that needed to be signed and a groupmate said that we should go early tomorrow.

Next day.

The day started awesome for me, woke up at around 7 AM, I watched Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas because I think I woke up too early and had some time to kill. I ate my breakfast, then when the movie finished, played Big Hero 6 then I proceed to take a bath. It was around 8:30 AM that time, so I sent a message saying I'm on my way to school just to let her know. I get things done, left the house at around 9 AM and went to school.

I arrived at around 10:30 AM and saw that she wasn't there. I figured, ""No biggie"" since I'm not always the person that always come on time when we have things to do. I went to do the other things that I needed to do and finished it.

Now, the document that needed to be signed is highly important and it has to be checked thoroughly before it can be signed by each person. And we needed five signatures.

Anyway, I got a message saying that if I were to arrived before her, I should start getting the signs for our document since she has another document to be signed for her other subject and it would take some time before she arrive.
So I did. I printed the documents, and started collecting the signs. I got 2/5 signatures since it's from our advisers. Then I went to get the third, but our professor said to return to him later.

It was 12 NN by this time and when I tried to get the fourth signature, the professor said that I should let him eat first. It's already lunch time, so I Ieft him. I went to our room to leave my things, and buy some food, and when I was about to leave I saw my groupmate coming. This gave me my first tick, like ""YOU FUCKING SAID TO WAKE UP EARLY AND YOU FUCKING ARRIVED AT NOON"". This isn't the same as those times when I arrived late when we are doing our prototype. And I always make sure that I did something meaningful when I was late. Anyway, I just gave her a smile and explained to her my progress till then.

So I bought my lunch and ate. And she also did the same. We finished at around 1:30 PM and we went to see the fourth professor but he has something to do together with the 3rd and 5th professor. So I suggested that we should stay outside of the room where they were staying. So we went there and the other groups who are also doing the same are also waiting for the professors. There's an adjacent room there where you can stay and be able to see what the professors are doing. So I briefly went there and left my groupmate outside to check up on them. It didn't take even a minute and I left. When I saw my groupmate outside, she was comparing our documents to the other groups. Just to see where we went wrong (and there's a lot), She asked whether all documents should have a reference coming from the school documents, in which they responded that they should. Now, we have three documents to be signed. And the document that I am initially required to do contains that reference. But the other two doesn't have. She gave me a look and said ""I told you."" (while blaming me). Now this gave me a second tick, like ""WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO WRONG, MY DOCUMENT CONTAINS THE FUCKING REFERENCES."" During this time, she quickly walked away and left me there. Since she was gonna change the documents. So I followed her but she was walking so fast like she was angry at me. Which gave me a third tick, like ""WTF ARE YOU ANGRY AT ME FOR? IT WAS YOUR FUCKING JOB TO FIND FOR THE OTHER REFERENCES.""

Anyway, you may be wondering why we have 3 document to be signed, and there's only two of us. We have a third groupmate but he is on an internship so we have to do his part. So she gave me a part of the third document and said to edit the other parts in which I did. Anyway, she gave it to me before saying that she has to finish the document from that other subject so I should edit the third one. I was pissed that time since I also have that subject and I wasn't using it as an excuse all the time on her.

Back to the story.

We went to the room, and she started editing the documents and I was just sitting there looking at the surroundings and playing cards with my other friends.

Now, you may be wondering why the fuck am I not helping her on the documents. You see, I forgot to mention that when I edited my part of the 2nd/3rd document and gave it to her for compilation, she wasn't happy about my work and she said that she would re-do all of it since it looks like I'm not even trying anymore. So I was like (WTF DID I EVEN WASTE MY TIME FOR? GO AHEAD, SINCE YOU'RE SO FUCKING GOOD. This was the start when I got pissed at her). Keep in mind that we are only doing minor changes on the document and this wasn't the first time she did this. Our other groupmate always experienced (and I mean always, like all the time, he also got to the point where he doesn't want to cooperate) this and I just stared at them during that time since I don't want to get myself involved.

Got side tracked again. Going back, she was editing the documents, I was playing cards.

It was around 4 PM and the other groups have already started getting their documents signed. Anyway, she asked me to search for some references for the paper. And I did. Found two for two documents and gave it to her. Now she was editing the other part of the documents, and said that I should continue since she has a headache and since I was not contributing (LIKE WHAT THE FUCK? ARE YOU SERIOUS?) whilst editing the document.

So I finished it, got it printed. We finished around 4:30 PM and went to the professors.

We first went to the fourth professor to get it signed. Now, I also forgot to mention that this professor is known to piss off a lot of students but I have a high tolerance for that kind of guys and it wasn't the first time that I went to him to get something signed and I actually think that he's a good person, just harder to please. So I was feeling good that I would get it signed easily.

Anyway, I went to his office, asked him to sign the documents, and boy was I wrong, he asked me why I was late, and I was sitting there wondering why the fuck am I late, and he said that signing of the documents was two weeks after the defense (it was the third week). So I was sitting there, thinking to myself, (WTF WAS THAT, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, NO ONE MENTIONED THAT TO US). Anyway, he said something about ""Ignorance of the law excuses no one."" (WHICH I FIND TO BE TRUE)  But all I want was for him to check the god damn documents. So 15 minutes passed, before he checked it. And god he didn't sign it and asked for us to change something. Altough I expected this so it wasn't a big deal for me. But he was gonna leave the office at 5:15 PM and there's not much time.

So I left the office, told my groupmate what happened and she was panicking since that day was the deadline of the documents since the fourth professor would leave the country for a couple of days. (This is what I hated the most about her, she panics instead of just doing something about it.) Anyway, we went to our room and finished the document. Of course, we weren't able to get the other signatures. So we're thinking of getting it next week, I hope.

EOS

Just had to get this off my chest. I was fucking pissed at her and I just want for this to end so that I will not have anything to do with her anymore.

This wasn't the end of the story, but it's already too long.

TL;DR Woke up in the morning just to end up being frustrated and had to write this to get it off my chest."

[21M] First time long distance,ExpertHour,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7zrgbg/is_my_gf_21f_still_in_love_with_me_21m_first_time/,"I [21M] and my girlfriend [21F] have been dating for over 2 years. We're both doing an internship from Jan-May. She's currently in another country, so this is our first time doing a long distance relationship.

We used to spend almost every day together (we both didn't really have social lives, we only had each other, which is pretty unhealthy, but that's the past) but now with a difference in timezones (4 hours), she has made new friends and hasn't been talking to me much anymore. 

We don't message when we're at work and thanks to hours in finance/computer science, we really only have time between 10:00pm-11:00pm to talk. I need to go to bed at this time because I have to get up at 6am to commute to work (I live at home with my parents to save money for tuition). And as a result, I can't really meet up with friends (work hours end really late and start early because of tax season in my country) during the week and I'm too far from the city to hang out with friends on the weekends. Leaving me feeling really lonely. I've tried staying up to talk to her more, but as you guys can probably tell, going to a long day of work while being low on sleep is not fun. 

Nowadays, she's made a lot of friends at work and often goes out to parties or events with them. This means that I get to talk with her less. Eventually, she only talked to me on Sundays and that was because she needed to do her laundry/chores and was at home as a result. When I asked her if she could spend some more time together, she said that she's drifting away emotionally and that she enjoyed spending time with her friends more than she enjoys talking to me and had been neglecting me as a result. 

Conversations have been sorta dry (how are you/hows work/any plans for the night) so I see where she's coming from. But things we can do are really limited due to the distance between us. We skype for about 1 hour a day 2-3 times a week and she's not really into playing video games or watching tv shows/movies together so we can't really have anything meaningful that she could look forward to doing together.

Obviously, I wasn't happy to hear that I was being replaced and after having a long serious talk with her, we decided that we would stay together. She said that she didn't see us getting married (a whole list of reasons why come up to mind, but for the sake of simplicity, it's because we're different races and her parents are extremely conservative) and also because she thinks that our career paths are too different. Not many good jobs for her program in my country. But she said that she loved me and that she was willing to see it through. She said that she would allocate a few days during the week where she wouldn't make plans so that we could talk for a bit more and I am very happy for that.

I love her (first ever relationship so I'm very confused about love tbh) but we did discuss whether or not we were in love with each other or if we were still together because we were too scared to be lonely. 

I can see her point of view, that it's good to make friends, but from my end, that means that I don't get to talk to her anymore. When I asked if she could talk to me more often, she said that I was being too needy.

She's told me to pick up a hobby to put my mind off of this, but I'm dead tired after work and I only realistically have ~4 hours a day (including the bus commute to and from work) to do something and I often lack the energy or motivation to do something new (Work is really stressful with the deadlines that we get, so I end up rewatching Parks and Rec or any show on Netflix that I'm feeling).

I'm just confused, I think I need to be more independent but I dont know how and I wanted to hear any opinions on how to move forward. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: First serious relationship of 2 years hitting a few kinks over a period of long distance. She wants to go out to party and have fun but I feel neglected due to a timezone difference and I don't know if I'm the problem and if I can do anything to solve this. She says that she doesn't see us getting married but she wants to see if it will work out."

What are some nice safe neighborhoods with things to do? I'll be buying a car but my fiance will need public transit. We like bars, live music, eating out, and would like to be able to walk places without fear once the sun goes down. What should I expect to pay to rent a 2br house/apartment in these neighborhoods? 

How's public transit in town? My Fiance doesn't have work lined up quite yet, but will likely have to take the bus once she finds work.

Are there any nice hikes within reasonable distance to the city? I'm used to bike trails, mountains and lake superior within a 15 minute drive. I know it won't compare to that, but is there any decent nature around?

What is there to do for young, but not quite college aged people?

Ultimately I plan on being there for 2-3 years while I save and plan to move to a big city like Milwaukee, Chicago, Minneapolis or Detroit. But was hoping for some insight from the people who know Lansing best! Thanks in advance!"

Honestly, I feel pretty terrified and I really could use some advice on how to move forward.


I'll be graduating with three B.S. degrees in Molecular Biology, Applied Math, and Chemistry. I was really hoping to get into a Computational Biology Ph.D. program. However, with all the rejections I've received so far, I don't really think that is going to pan out the way I want it to. Until now, research has been my main focus, and while I've volunteered/worked in a lab for over a year, I have very little job experience outside of that. I also don't really know how or if I would be able to get into other jobs in my fields of study.


So far, I've applied to research internships for the summer, but I'm not sure on where to go afterwords. If I do get into one of those, I'm hoping I can turn it into a year-long position and then reapply for Ph.D. programs in the fall. If not, then I'm probably going to apply for masters programs in either Applied Math or Computer Science, but I'm not too sure on which one I should choose. Everyone that I've asked has given me mixed answers. My parents and others argue that getting a CS degree will make me look really unfocused since I'll have degrees in 3 other areas, but looking at what others say online getting a CS degree would make me more valuable. 


Furthermore, I'm just absolutely sick of living in Alabama and the South in general. The dating options here are just pitiful. There's only ever been a handful of guys here that I've actually wanted to date, but it's just never worked out. Maybe I'm just too picky, but even when I forced myself to go out and date people I was only kind of interested in, I ended up feeling more unhappy and unsatisfied than when I was single. Plus the racism and general close-mindedness, the fact that I hate the blistering heat, and that there's barely anything to do (especially in my hometown) makes me just hate it even more. I really just want to move (hopefully to a bigger city), but I have no clue on how I should approach it or even just where to start.  


I know all of this isn't super related to being gay, but I feel like your opinions and experiences might be a bit more valuable.

The last step is getting my tax return from them, since dealing with the IRS is a pain and my tax return got sent to their place instead of mine. I specifically asked my Emom not to open the mail from the IRS, and just forward it to me. Today, I receive [this email](https://imgur.com/fQAymSe) which my mother blatantly admits she deliberately disrespected my wishes and called it ""a mistake.""

Seriously? Was it so hard to not stick your nose where it doesn't belong Emom? It's like she's going out of her way to cross a boundary.

She's gotten so much worse about this. I'm also looking for an internship, and she keep doing job searching for me and she keeps emailing me jobs. I'm a fucking adult, I can find my own internship, I don't need you to do it, Emom. She emailed me asking if I wanted her to continue helping me and promised she ""wouldn't be offended either way."" I said I appreciated her help but I wanted to handle it myself. She called me a couple days later and said ""I know you said you didn't want help, but I know a lot about job hunting, and you're very busy these days so you could use my help. Believe me, I've been laid off like 15 times, I know how this works!""

What the fuck. Who brags about being laid off that much??

Anyway, has anyone else ever experienced narcs going out of their way to disrespect a boundary you've set up?"

[ex-post from r/anxiety],EmptySky93,climatechange,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/7zsy3d/anyone_else_have_recurrent_crippling_panic_and/,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and panic disorder. I'm 26 but have been on antidepressants since age 11.

I started freaking out about climate change in 2014 when I realized that that, coupled with global topsoil depletion, resource depletion, and nuclear threats, will probably mean most of humanity, us included will likely suffer horribly and die painfully as we watch everything w elove go to hell, ourselves, the past, and future, as well, in the next 2 decades or so.

I went to a psych ward in 2014 because of a psychotic episode brought on because of anxiety over climate change. I was crying all day because of the fear of imminent death by starvation, murder, thirst, etc. caused by climate change.

Now I'm thinking about checking myself in the hospital again. After reading g na article saying well reach the world shattering 2C climate change point by 2030, I've realized I have so little time left and all my dreams are crushed I should probably kill myself once that rolls around (around 2030, when the US, where I live, will be reduced to Somalia like conditions and people are starving everhwhers) ...

Still, just knowing everything, past, present, and future, is going to hell and I'll probably be murdered and cannibalize while my loved ones are too... I just want to die sometimes and I'm thinking of dropping school and my internships (I've been in a glorified community college for 8 years because I'm a superloser)

My girlfriend and parents who I live with say I need to stop thinking about it a d my APRN might increase my escitalopram but I dunno. I think I'd rather just die in the next 10 to 12 years.

I'm just so heartbroken. I had so many dreams. I just want all the fear to end.

Please help. I'm so scared and I don't wanna get addicted to xanax which I've been stealing to not feel so scared

Maybe I just have to teach myself to accept that I'll probably die horrible in the next 10 years or live in extreme poverty until I have to resolve to off myself.

This isn't what I wanted for my life. I had so many desires and hopes and dreams and they're all gone because civilization is ending. How to cope with going crazy?"

I am in college, doing computer science in college. Have been following MGTOW forums for a while, been awesome and really helped me wake up. I used to be a cuck, a really bad cuck, but thank god I can look myself in the mirror and not be ashamed anymore. While it sounds great and all, you can imagine it being exhausting for me due to the fact that I am surrounded by lets just say ""blue pilled"" society. Even my roomates a fucking cuck, and he makes fun of me for not showing emotions like love and compassion blah blah blah. He thinks I am gay, but I could care less what he thinks, I have seen him break up with his gf and get depressed, but still go back to the plantation. Id rather not talk to him about MGTOW because you never know who is gonna stab your back.

So recently I applied to some internships. Gotta have experience in the industry. It feels really filfthy tbh. Every interview, I have to put on a mask and act cucked, a happy man, that respects women, #diversity, #womenCanCodeToo.... no fuck they cant, i have been coding for 4 years and never met a female that can write decent code, but in order to pass by filters without red flags, i have to sound excited and illy dilly. It's so exhausting and I really want to graduate and just get a job, but all these interview processes that focus on emotional questions rather than technical questions wear me down. For example, Why would they ask me ""how would you make a sad coworker happy""  hows that gonna help me? Am I here to emotionally support your struggling female workers, suicidal husbands or write a program? When did the interview process become so shit?

Like fucking hell i just wanna do a serious job and get paid, but they put more emphasis on bonding and emotional support than the job itself... its stupid. I gotta do what I gotta do I guess. Been doing this for 2 years now. Thank god there is this sub. If I didnt have TFM, Sandman videos and this sub to keep me on track I might have lost myself again. Thank you everyone.

P.S. if any of you know a redpilled tech company let me know please."
7ztbus,1,2018-02-23,Student; do I need to file taxes? [Illinois],DontThrowawayBiden,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ztbus/student_do_i_need_to_file_taxes_illinois/,"Relevant info:

* I'm a full-time college student
* I receive the vast majority of my support from my parents, and my permanent residence is their house (abroad).
* My parents did not itemize deductions last year.
* I am 100% certain they can claim me as a dependent.
* I didn't file a federal 1040 in 2017
* I earned about $4,400 from campus jobs and an internship stipend last year, and deposited this money in my bank account.
* My parents periodically transfer money to the same account for incidentals and living expenses.
* I paid for $1,400 or so in textbooks out of this account.

I'm currently trying to figure out if I need to file an Illinois tax return. The IDOR website says I need to file if my Illinois base income - which is based on my federal AGI, after a number of adjustments that don't impact me - is over $2175.

My questions:

* As a dependent earning too little to file federal taxes, should I take any deductions into account when calculating my federal AGI?
 (this will be the same as the Illinois portion)
* If so, how much of the ~$1,400 in textbook expenses I paid using my account should I deduct as qualified educational expenses? Asking since money in the account was a mix of my earnings and transfers by my parents.
* As a dependent, I assume I'd need to consider my parents' income in calculating eligibility for tax credits (and the IRS free filing tool - parental income would me ineligible). Is this correct?

EDIT: My university did not withhold taxes on either job or the stipend."

1) The internship I work at that I love offered me a job after graduation, the highlight of the week.

2) I started taking diet and exercise very seriously again after some time off, and already it has improved my mood. I also feel and even look a lot healthier.

3) I finally have a set schedule, and it is making me a lot more productive. From 5 or 7am to midnight, I'm doing something to make myself better; intern, work, school, or social life pretty much

4) I'm going out on Saturday night with all of my closest friends, something I haven't done in forever.

7zu5l3,2,2018-02-23,Seeking advice on transitioning from two incomes to one.,bankdudz,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7zu5l3/seeking_advice_on_transitioning_from_two_incomes/,"I've been working at my job for 6 years, and know the restaurant and the daily ins and outs like the back of my hand. I've been a meat cutter for the past 3, with a key and complete and total schedule freedom. With complete and total schedule freedom, allowing me to raise my daughter, basically. My wife had to go back to work after 6 weeks to finish a college internship for a bachelor's degree in social work. I went down to 4 days a week and stayed home with Mia and my neighbor had her Thursday and Friday, which was a blessing. You can't put a price on good neighbors. After my wife got her degree, she worked at a golf course for a stretch. Until dept. of Human Resources for a full time salary position opened. Mia turned 1 and headed to daycare. Now I take her, work, and get her, all before my wife gets home.

Our son was born in December. Mia is 3 now. My wife has had her social work job for a year and a half, and had up to 13 weeks off. She took 11. Last Tuesday was her last day back to work. Within the past week, we created a plan. I move up to kitchen manager, (position foreseen to be available within the next 6 to 8 months, managing partner is one of my best friends, good leader, takes care of his people)* my wife quits, stays home with the kids, and gets her time with them, and works part time or pickup status at the golf course. She can make 1000 a month with four 5 hour shifts at a beautiful golf course. I had so much time with Mia, to this day, she will hardly lay down with mommy at night.. I was selfishly thinking of how my usual time will change. Not about how my wife hasn't had much time with the kids, at all. For years. I can sacrifice my 'easy' job (because I'm very good), let my wife be a full time mother and save money on daycare, aside from the financial similarities.*

Stats:

I make 15$ an hour, topped out, with bonuses every quarter. I've hit my bonuses consecutively for the past 9 months. Starting at 500, then 1000, then 1500. My next 2 will be 1500, then 2000, then the final is 2500. That's all you can get out of the bonus program, so I'm a third of the way there, money-wise. I can be halfway there by the time the km position was available. I work 32 hours a week, usually. I could get 40 but I spend it with my kids, literally.

My wife's salary is 31,000. That's before tax and blue cross blue shield family plan insurance is taken out. They match her 75 a check 401k and will be paid out when she leaves. She gets mileage when she is on call and has to drive. But sometimes, if she gets a call, and something happens to somebody in mobile, related to something here.. it doesn't matter if it's 5pm or am, she is driving. Yeah that's an extra 300 bucks on a 2 week check but, at what cost. The stress of having to answer a phone that could send you to mobile on a Monday, right before Mia's dance class. Her job has also lost 4 people in her unit the two weeks leading up to her first day back. In a nutshell, more work. More on call.

Right now, before tax: 31,000 + 32,300 = 63,300 10,000 a year on daycare So, 53,300

Plan, before tax: 45,000 + 10,000 = 55,000 *no daycare. So, 55,500

Sorry for all the personal information. Any advice is welcome."

I have been going strong NoFap, no Porn, no weed, no alcohol (unless it is a special occasion with my Tribe Brothers), lift 3-4 times a week, cook my own meals, play basketball with a team, live with a roommate on campus (some positives and negatives), have excluded most distractions out of my life, focusing excellently on my classes, have a summer internship lined up and potentially a new internship now with a big tech company that will pay me well (part-time).

However, my social game is weak, IMO. I have a very small social circle outside of my school who I meet with about two-three times a month. Other than that, I just play pickup basketball at my college. I interact with my roommate, we usually cook together or eat together. But I am contemplating of moving out since he usually doesnt clean up after himself, smokes inside, plays video games everyday in bed instead of being productive in life. Maybe where I am living also affects a bigger part of my life than I think. 

When I am in classes, I don't interact with many people unless we are talking about homework or class. Everyday I am focused on learning the class material, then preparing for more coding interviews, applying for other internships, etc. but usually I am solo wolfing my studies everyday. I used to fuck around with my studies and slack off before, so in a way now I feel like I am very focused on one goal and that is not to slack off. 

In a way, I was a little inspired from the idea of monk moding. But I feel like I am shutting myself out from socializing to my potential. What advice do you have for someone in my situation?

With the domestic traditional investment institutions, and the Internet industry has a good link.

However, how much of Achain's resources can be devoted to as part of a large group company operating? Asked about this issue, Cui Meng without hesitation, ""must be all in, we attach great importance to the Achain project and tilt.""

 

Strategic adjustment, from digital assets to smart contracts
 

Cui Meng frankly, a few years ago did not devote too much resources in the smart contract platform, now it belongs to judge the direction of deviation, ""in the early overall planning, do not think smart contracts can develop so good, so the emphasis on other An app promotion and user accumulation, the smart contract platform only silently research, make technical reserves, no effort to promote.

And now decided to Achain project to the public reasons, Cui Meng said,

""In fact, a large part of the reason is that the rise of Ethereum has caused a great impact on us and made me re-examine the development opportunities in this market and the blockchain. At the same time, we are very confident that at this time, Square of the public chain, we hope to stand up and build China's technical standards and brands. ""
Almost with Ethereum in the area of ​​smart contracts, the Achain team has so far accumulated more than two years of technology. Why do you say that? According to official reports, Achain team from the original letter and cloud and fruit Compal part of the elite team composed. Li Yuan, general manager of letter and cloud are also mentioned in a road show,

""Achain is the open source project of Sino-Cloud before the chain project can be understood as similar to the combination of Ethereum and bit shares, because bit shares in the open source sharing system is a tremendous expansion, and Ethereum proposed smart contracts This new concept.Achain in the bit shares of the prototype technology up the independent research and development to achieve a smart contract.Etherfair is currently doing is to put it based on the POW mechanism to POS upstairs, that is, Ethereum now dry Achain has done two years. ""
 

Multi-party improvements, more suitable for enterprise applications
 

So, as a ""new generation of smart contract platform,"" Achain What are the technical characteristics? Cui Meng introduction, Achain in many ways to improve:

Achain provided a mechanism for 0-cost simulation test smart contracts from the beginning of the design. Users are able to test full paths in a comprehensive test framework to maximize the loopholes in the smart contract, all without user tokens. Unlike other test solutions, this solution enables smart contracts to be tested on the official chain, providing a complete test framework that is closer to the real world than the test chain scenario.

Achain emphasizes the efficiency of smart contracts. Tuning from the virtual machine to start, to maximize the contract call close to the performance of ordinary transactions. At the same time, Achain designed scalable smart contracts to make up for the lack of BUGs in the contracts with limited and supervised privileges. Consensus mechanism, Achain uses a self-developed RDPOS distributed consensus, based on the DPOS to optimize the different mechanisms of consensus required to deal with smart contracts;

Achain's chain trading performance can reach 1000TPS, compared with the theoretical value of Ethereum 25TPS. And its modular design, configurable encryption algorithm, the formula module can be replaced, any combination of flexibility to respond to changes in business needs may occur, to prevent congestion.

Officially, unlike most of the ongoing blockchain projects, Achain has been validated in the marketplace, especially in the area of ​​digital asset issuance"

7zxus8,2,2018-02-24,Double Major CIS or Macc?,momo_tree,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7zxus8/double_major_cis_or_macc/,"Hi everyone, the situation is that if I do the Macc, I would graduate on time, and so far, I have been recruiting for internships in terms of that timeline and program.

The Macc program would also hold may hand and walk me through the CPA requirements that are lengthy in my state, TX.

I always had the thought of double majoring in Computer Information Systems to pair with my acct degree. Doing this would delay my graduation by another semester or year. And I would just let my interning firm know about my graduation date.

I know it is more value and worth it, but I would have to study a lot harder, and figure out the jumps and hurdles to getting CPA accting courses at other colleges.

If I were just interested in tax practice in public accounting, which route do you guys think I should take? Would my CIS double major be utilized only at bigger firms? What future paths and career would best take advantage of both degrees?

I have future interests of being involved in blockchain and crpytocurrency tax practices in the future, if that grows. Thanks.


TLDR:
 Accounting/CIS or Macc, tax focus? TX cpa requirements is easier with Macc. Pros and future opportunities for having the dual major? Interested in blockchain and crypto."

Snowflakes speckled her dark hair. She flipped open the book and scowled at it in disbelief.

Henry came shambling through the portal behind her. He had been her partner and translator and the designated carrier of the gun. They were both dressed strangely: long robes in muted green and orange, the cowls lined in bristling wolverine fur. Their hands mittened and swollen with cold.

They had been gone half a decade, and it hadn't moved. The time showed in their eyes and cheeks.

They could not have survived those long bleak nights under the lightless stars without each other. They took turns sleeping and watching over one another. Watching the dark.

""The pages all got moved,"" she said. ""I have to find it again.""

""Damn time,"" Henry muttered. He dropped his pack and spear to the floor unceremoniously and grabbed a water bottle from the mini fridge. Downed half of it before he spoke again. ""What time is it, anyway?""

Florence snapped her eyes up from the book. Realized she had forgotten all about water, and time. How long she had walked to get here. The very real possibility of frostbite in her aching feet. They were wrapped in two layers of furred elk hide bound with leather cords, and it still didn't feel enough.

She sank onto her desk chair and flicked the mouse. Her face split in a smile. ""Ten minutes later.""

""Don't fuck with me now, darling. It's not cute now.""

""I'm certainly not fucking with you. It's 10:35. We left at--""

""10:24,"" he said, simultaneously. He allowed a rare smile.

Henry collapsed into Florence's pale blue reading chair in the corner. Probably ruined it with his filthy cloak. But she could not bring herself to care now.

He pulled a random book off the shelf: European history.

""Tell me what the book says,"" he told her, flipping through the index.

Florence found the entry and read aloud, ""'The Mongol Empire was infamously culled and conquered by Genghis Khan. The legendary story maintains that the general was slain in his chambers by his master strategist Subotai'--""

""That's us,"" Henry said. His relief obvious and cool as water. ""Holy shit. That's us.""

Her eyes widened. ""Uh. You should *really* let me finish.""

""What?""

""'--but that Genghis Khan was summoned from the dead by a holy sacrifice. The story then purports that Genghis Khan slayed his murderer,' and..."" She paused skimming. ""Conquered the rest of Asia as a ghost until the fifteenth century?""

""Well,"" Henry said. ""That's certainly not right.""

""We can change physics."" Florence's voice pitched upwards in delight. ""We can change the universe itself with *time*.""

""You need to eat something,"" Henry said, laughing. ""Do you hear yourself? Maybe we just proved ghosts exist.""

""That makes no sense!""

""It makes more sense than the nonsense you just spat out.""

But before she could retort, came a voice out of nowhere, deep as the sea, and just as dark and cold. It boomed:

""You have done nothing but make a great big bloody mess of things.""

And then the wall opened up and a woman climbed out. She was dressed rather simply, almost like a utility worker. Dark pants and a dark coat with a belt full of gleaming tools that Florence and Henry could not recognize. Her boots had steel toes and gold wings which fluttered restlessly at her ankles.

If you only looked at her, she seemed nearly human.

She scowled around at the two of them. ""You're the ones, then.""

Henry just stared, open-mouthed.

Florence looked at the wall, which was a flat panel of grey once more. ""Ah,"" she said. ""Who are you, exactly?""

The woman turned her barbed stare on her. Her eyes were the color of a sunset and full of rage. ""I'm the one who has to clean up after you silly humans. Look what you've gone and done.""

She waved a hand and Florence's history books rose off the shelves as one. Their pages flickered erratically, pausing here or there.

""On top of causing the ghost of Genghis Khan to wreak absolute havoc on the eastern hemisphere for an extra century and halting the progression of half a continent for two centuries, you threw off the rest of the Crusades and put the bubonic plague on the wrong place. You have rewritten the whole history of the Western world and set off a million little dominoes that you can't even fathom, imagine, or understand."" The woman surveyed the two of them, her stare burning.

""I don't quite follow,"" Henry said. He seemed rumpled and only mildly surprised. Perhaps at this point he too had seen too much violence to be scared of strange women walking out of walls.

When she turned to stare down Henry, Florence saw the gleam of a gun, holstered in the small of her back. She swallowed the dizzying impulse of terror.

The woman snarled, ""I am a keeper of time and fate. You have gone and rewritten history like it is communal fucking story time. And I've come here to ask just what the hell you have to say for yourselves.""

""We're sorry,"" Henry began.

""Very sorry.""

""You're *sorry*. Well, that makes it all better then."" The keeper of history paced around the room and gripped her pale hair. Tutting to herself. ""You know I'll have to make a report with the rest of the keepers, don't you? They'll find out about you. I don't know why you've done this.""

""Other keepers?"" Henry repeated.

Numbly, Florence pulled a water bottle out of the fridge. Offered one to the keeper, who surprisingly accepted it.

The keeper looked at him, eyes narrowed. ""There is a lot of time. A lot of history. No one could do it alone.""

""We did it to see if we could,"" Florence stammered. ""We're scientists.""

""You call this shit science?""

""Well, it did work...""

Henry shook his head and sighed. ""Jesus, Florence. What my colleague is trying to say is that we did not understand that there was an etiquette to these sorts of things.""

""Laws are not etiquette, boy.""

""I'm forty years old,"" he said, stricken, his surprise obvious.

""And I'm forty thousand at least. I will call you boy."" The keeper's face darkened. ""There is a natural order, and a reason for secrecy in certain things. You've forced me to invent fucking ghost Genghis Khan as a temporary and frankly horrifying fix to this reality until someone with more experience gets here.""

Florence tried to hide her horror. ""What do you mean?""

""Keepers have other lives than wandering this dimension looking for anachronisms and time jumpers, you know."" This earned them another severe look. ""But they are coming. And they will be *very* unhappy.""

""Oh,"" said Henry, still rankled at the boy comment, evidently. His tone was hot as the blood rising in his cheeks. ""So you're just a, what? An intern?""

""We prefer the title apprentice."" She turned sideways and flicked back her coat to reveal her gun. ""And I too have the ability to delete you, buddy.""

""Please."" Florence stood and raised her hands in a way she hoped was calming. ""What can we do to fix this?""

""Go back and undo the shit you just did. And maybe they will be kind to you.""

Henry and Florence exchanged a meaningful look.

He laughed at her, bitterly, instantly. ""Oh, fuck no. No no. I am not going back out there, Flo.""

""Remember you loved the stars,"" she said. It was so hard to tease when her throat was this tight with fear. But part of her did miss those long nights under a sky untouched by light.

Without even looking at Henry she said, ""We'll turn the machine back. We'll do it.""

""Now,"" said the keeper, her face like an angry god.

Henry groaned into his palms and rose out of his chair. ""I just aged five years in ten minutes,"" he snapped. ""Can't we at least stop to eat?""

""You may take something for the road. But I suggest you're finished fixing this shit by the time the others get here. They are not as patient as I am with your kind.""

""But we invented time travel,"" Florence stammered. ""That's part of what we were testing even doing all of this.""

""You're hardly the first."" The keeper barked a laugh. ""Right! I forget you can't see the erasures. Most time travelers get deleted well before they share the good news with anyone else."" She gave both a small, innocent smile. ""I wonder if you'll be the first to live to break the news.""

And then the keeper of time scribbled them a ticket, chirped, ""Good day! See you soon!"" and disappeared back into the wall.

Florence and Henry stood staring at each other for a long moment. Sharing their unspoken exhaustion.

""Let's just go back ten minutes and tell ourselves not to do it,"" Henry groaned.

""Yes, whatever these keepers are will be *delighted* if we break the space time continuum."" Florence hurried over to the machine. She had hoped for a bath, an oven-cooked meal. There would be only time for a modern bathroom and  whatever food sat in the fridge.

And then they would have to leap back through the doors of time."

Someone has provided proof that Apple and Google do in fact admit to being Affirmative Action employers. To me this means that my view is actually the truth and not in need of changing. Thank you all.

***

I do not disagree with AA. I think it leads to a more diverse and equal workforce. I think that the industry should acknowledge that it's happening and call it what it is.

I'm referring to the Big 4+1 and many other ""Silicon Valley"" software companies. By affirmative action I mean preferential hiring practices and opportunities for internships.

Though anecdotal, I have female friends who have been offered internships at amazing companies who were far below the bar of my male peers. Many are average while some are objectively bad at CS. They have internships at Big 4+1, Twitter, Dropbox, NGC, Raytheon etc. Specifically, 90% of my female friends who attend the Grace Hopper women in computing conference walk away with Big 4 internships. Qualcomm's intern class is 50% women but there are like 20-30% women in CS. Those are statistically significant outliers.

At my internships at companies that have this AA some of the stupidest people I've worked with were some of the female interns. A senior CS major from a decent school took 3 months to write a Java class to open an Excel file. She never finished. I was given her task and finished it in 3 hours. I'm not one of those wizards who started coding as a child. I'm just a dude who read the Java documentation. My managers recommended that she not be hired but HR hired her anyway on a different team.

That said, at SpaceX, where this sort of thing is not practiced, the single most intelligent and capable peer I have ever worked with was female. Every woman I worked with was brilliant in their own right.

To change my position I'd like to be convinced that women are not receiving preferential treatment in hiring practices and what is happening is not AA. You don't need to convince me it's an appropriate practice because I agree. Please convince me that the average women is **equally qualified** as every man at these companies. Saying these women are as equally as good because they've gone through more discrimination is AA and preferential treatment and so this won't change my view.

800c3h,1,2018-02-24,My [21M] friend/interest [20F] cut off contact for the second time without any kind of notice and I'm not sure what to do this time..,DependentMeat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/800c3h/my_21m_friendinterest_20f_cut_off_contact_for_the/,"This ones gonna be a doozey of a text wall and its a fresh alt since my main would probably be recognizable to her. I apologize in advance for the mess that follows..

So in the end of last year, I met this awesome girl through common interests/academic courses at school. She was already in a serious relationship with another guy that I kinda knew and worked with on projects. I didn't know much about her outside of our classes. I was going to be taking a semester off for a internship opportunity and my enterprise needed to find someone else to fill in during the time I would be gone. She had asked to do an interview for the spot and that's when I met her. She interviewed and we determined that she was a decent fit for the ""job"". 

As a result, I had to train her in the responsibilities that she would have. We met a few different times for this. We talked about stuff and once all the serious stuff got out of the way, the conversation usually devolved into some sort of discussion with similar interests. We exchange phone numbers so it would be easy to get a hold of each other should we need to. Strictly professional for me at this point.

This is near the end of the semester (think around finals week) and we just start talking/texting/snapchatting as friends more frequently. During finals week, its an everyday all the time, late night thing. We end up having exams at similar times and since we discovered through conversation, we end up walking/driving to exams together a few times. Her cars broken so I end up driving which is completely fine with me. I get done with all mine on Wednesday but because of me moving out of my place, I had to wait to leave on Saturday. She's in the same boat. Things continue and the conversation gets to more of the sexual nature and she starts flirting a bit. I'll spare you the details for the sake of this post but we end up hanging out on Friday night watching movies and eating pizza. I'm not about to make any move on her because of the whole boyfriend thing. She apparently had other plans and we end up making out for a bit. But me and my ability to procrastinate is unbeatable. I still have a lot of packing to do and she has some things to take care of before she goes home so we stop before things get really serious. It was a long night and the next day was horrible from all the driving. I still regret not doing the packing earlier. 

I would like to point out that at this point, I haven't really been in a serious relationship yet in my life. I've been really close to girls before where if I made a move, it absolutely could've been but I was just too oblivious to notice it. This is the first time I've really been attracted to someone. 

So we get to last month and its just even more constant snapchatting/texting and I find out that she was in a kinda open relationship when we hung out. Things progress and we share alot with each other. We have way more common interests than we initially realized and just everything meshes well with each other. I find out that her relationship is really one-sided with her putting way more effort than her bf and I apparently made it easier for her to stick up for herself and try to demand more from her relationship. We talk about it alot and we agree that if she wasn't in a relationship with her bf, we would absolutely be dating at this point. Also, by this point the conversation has evolved to talking on the phone, and then skyping multiple nights per week and nudes were sent a few times by this point. She's not in an open relationship at this point but was progressively getting more and more irritated with her boyfriend to the point where she might break up with him. We had talked alot about her coming down to visit for a weekend since I don't have any roommates and it would be better than having to explain it to her housemates. Doesn't happen due to her car still not fixed. It's starting to be like a LDR but its not..

And then out of nowhere, she stops responding. She basically ghosted me without the all the blocking or unfriending. I'm mildly freaking out since I have no clue what happened. I didn't say anything bad or out of the ordinary for our conversation at this point. I texted her a few times during the next week and a half just trying to get a response to see whats up. I was going to be heading up to school for some stuff the next week so I figured I'd see her at some point then. She breaks the silence and tells me when I get up there that shes actually back home because she had a death in the family and just kinda shut out the world for a bit. I understand completely and we hang out again for a bit before I leave. When I go to her house and pick her up, she lasts about a minute before trying to kiss me while driving. We spent about 3 hours together and it was great. When I go to drop her off, we say goodbye and kiss and she breaks the kiss abruptly and says she had a thought about something and was very adamant about not telling me about it. I have a funny feeling I know what it is and my suspicion is confirmed later when we're skyping that night. If you haven't inferred by now, it was those 3 words that generally come up after you're dating or in a relationship with someone for a while, that came up after spending about 6 hours together physically. It was a little jarring and should've been way worse if I hadn't come up in my mind a few weeks earlier except I dismissed it as me being super attracted to her. We also talked about the thing where she cut off everything and she said she would at least warn me about it if it happened again and not to worry. 

It happens again less than a day later. Same deal as before. Way worse this time because I was thinking about the whole love thing and I come to realize that I'm at the same place as her. I tried way harder this time to make sure she knows that she can talk to me about anything. Its been 2 weeks this time and I feel just helpless and I really want to make sure she's doing all right but thats hard when you're many hours away and have no way of talking to the person. I've never felt this way in any kind of relationship before and I'm scared of screwing it up and losing her as a friend even though shes said it many times that she'd never get mad at me or want to stop being friends with me. Like we both considered that this could be a long term relationship. Since my gut reaction when stuff like this happens is to just forget about that person and stop giving a shit. And I've considered it as like a worst case scenario and I don't want it to get there. I don't want to push anything but I honestly think we'd be perfect for each other. 

Am I right to be freaking out about this? Should I stop worrying and wait for a response or just abandon it and get over it? Or should I keep trying to talk to her and see if she'll respond (probably not a good idea)

I applaud you if you read this whole thing. I just needed to get it off my chest since the last couple days it's gotten really bad and I need to see if I'm going crazy or if I'm right. Any kind of feedback is appreciated.


  **tl;dr**: Get involved with a girl already in a relationship, figure out that shes perfect for me and we really like each other over the course of almost 2 months. She has a family problem and cuts off everyone and the next time we're together, she implies that she loves me, then goes awol again. Now we're here. Not sure what to do. "

My boyfriend and I started out being long distance, very long distance. Cross-continental to be more specific. We knew it would be difficult, and it is/was, but we always thought we’d be able to work through anything and everything. For both of us this was the most connected we’d ever felt with someone else and didn’t think we’d be able to find anyone who could possibly come close in our own countries. Here’s where things get complicated. Although we can’t agree on who suggested it or why we initially started this way, but we’ve been open on and off since our relationship began. I mostly just want to be able to have that intimacy and companionship with someone here, while he mostly can’t go so long without getting laid. 

We worked through the usual issues like jealousy, communication, safety, fear of being replaced etc. as they came up, but there was always an underlying question for him of whether I’m just doing this because we’re distant, or if I’m just a polyamorous person and need things to be this way. Unfortunately, I still don’t have an answer for this. Being open was a lot more difficult for him than it was for me. He would get insanely jealous and although he never really expressed it in an unhealthy way, it would cause him to be anxious and nauseous up until and during the time I was with someone else, and not really feel much better until we Skyped and “reconnected” after. I got jealous, of course, but nowhere near the same intensity as him. I might get angry if I’m surprised he slept with someone, or a bit withdrawn, but mostly I’d deal with the emotions myself and end up being happy that he was happy. He took this as a sign that I neither got jealous nor cared at all. I found the distance to be much more troubling. During the times when our relationship was closed, I found myself getting painfully lonely and outright miserable. I have a mental illness that does make my mood swing intensely, so a need for catharsis looks like self destructive behaviours, and feeling down becomes a deep depression.  I sought out my friends for fun and fulfilling, intimate conversations and even cuddles! It just wasn’t the same for me. As fun, loving, intimate and engaging as my friendships were, for me it just wasn’t the same as having an SO with whom I could do fun things, but also be sexual and affectionate with. Honestly, I’m not sure why. I have been on my own before, I don’t need a boyfriend to feel fulfilled or like myself, I just wanted someone there and feel significantly better when I do have someone. I’m not made for distance, and he, evidently, is not made for polyamory. 

Here's where it gets complicated...In early January, I met someone, a few someone’s actually. How we got together is another adventure entirely, but the important part is the three of us got together and formed a happy triad for a time. Eventually I got really close, very fast with our male partner, and our female partner got more distant for various reasons. We’re all still friends, but he and I decided to continue a relationship just ourselves. 

Since my last visit with my (ex)boyfriend I have to admit things had been getting continuously worse. I don’t know if he realizes this, but I spent most of our last visit being frustrated/annoyed/upset with him. Again, for a variety of reasons that could be their own adventure. We started skyping and talking less, and when we did it usually didn’t include skype sex or a lot of laughs. We would either discuss parts of our relationship we needed to work on, or just recount the events of our day so the other felt caught up. Also a lot more fighting. It didn’t really help that within a few weeks I had introduced two new partners into our lives/relationship and developed real feelings for one of them. 

Here’s where things get even more complicated… We decided to go on a week “break” of just not talking to each other. During which, my (ex)boyfriend asked me to book my flights to visit him so he could know for sure I was coming, and we could begin planning. Not long after, he got a job offer that not only guaranteed him at least a week in the same city as me (wahoo!) but also the chance to work here for the few months preceeding the internship (starting basically immediately after I got back from visiting). The thing was, he assumed that if he came here, I’d break up with my other partner who I admittedly had fallen very hard for very quickly. My boyfriend didn’t understand how I would be hurting my new partner and myself by doing this. I didn’t expect him to be completely fine with me taking time away from him to spend it with me new partner who lives near my anyway, but I at least wanted him to acknowledge what he was asking me to do. We didn’t even really talk about it. We both were busy, he wasn’t really talking to me, and he decided to apply anyway and just assume everything would work out. Eventually, during one choppy whatsapp phone call he told me that he didn’t understand why I wouldn’t be okay with just ending my new relationship in a few months while he’s here, and expect things to go back to the way they were before after he leaves. We planned to have Skype conversation the next day, so I asked if we could put off this conversation until then. He called me later that night and said that I’d left him no choice and he had to break up with me. 

He still wants me to come visit him for 2.5 weeks and act like nothing happens, even though he also doesn’t really want to talk to me right now. I can’t refund the tickets, thanks WOW air…

TL;DR: My boyfriend broke up with me 2 months before I planned to visit, wants me to come anyway and now I don’t know what to do so if anyone wants cheep flights from Toronto to Frankfurt please let me know!?!?

8017au,1,2018-02-24,My [26M] fiancee [23F] and I are taking a break to work on ourselves and I'm not sure if I want to get back together with her or not,throwawaydumb000,u_throwawaydumb000,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_throwawaydumb000/comments/8017au/my_26m_fiancee_23f_and_i_are_taking_a_break_to/,"Okay, throwaway account because this one's a doozy. Will clarify if desired.

My (former?) fiancee and I were together just over 5 years, and in that time her bipolar and depression and my anger and emotional awareness have gone from a mild bother to almost tearing the relationship apart and a recent suicide attempt, and I just don't know if I can deal with it anymore without letting my personal life suffer.

She's always had abandonment and boundary issues, stemming from a childhood period of non-physical sexual abuse at the hands of her mom's boyfriend. When we first got together, I offered to help her as much as I could with it, and I've paid for therapy, paid rent and bills the whole time we've been together, helped her mostly through college, and been there for her as much as I feel I should have, if not more...

Our relationship was amazing at the start, as relationships usually are. She was wild about me and we could just have fun being around each other. As our relationship went on, starting around three months before our engagement (or about 3 years into our relationship), my financial and emotional state started to get very complicated due to being fired, having a car get totalled (couldn't pay for necessary repairs due to the firing and student loan debt), and other environmental factors, and her mental state started to deteriorate. We started to get less and less tolerant of each other, with yelling, screaming, and occasional physical altercations. Most of it stemmed from insignificant bullshit, like her not doing her homework before deadlines or not applying for internships, or me not doing dishes or cleaning up after our cats. We probably should have broken it off back then, but we felt we owed it to each other to get better as quickly as we safely could, and we still loved each other. We started to take less of an interest in each other's hobbies and personal lives, as the dynamic of the relationship shifted to me being almost more of a caretaker than a partner. In trying to reassert my own identity, I picked up Twitch streaming, something I had been wanting to start for a while, and I feel like she saw that as a threat to the closeness we once had, because despite her best intentions to support me, she took little interest in my stream, and got mad every time it accidentally interfered with her plans. I guess, though, that I couldn't expect her to want to watch it if she's not into the games I play, but I had hoped for more supportive stances or at least the consideration to not interrupt my streaming schedule intentionally (which was also shaped around her work schedule). In addition, I had taken on a role as a volunteer with a local high school, teaching kids how to build robots, which ate up a lot of free time. My fiancee, however, works at a local restaurant, dropped out of college over being unable to apply for internships (required for graduation) without panicking, and doesn't have any time-consuming hobbies other than coloring and occasional knitting, and I've felt more and more that she's holding me back in my own personal development, and my inability to deal with it constructively is holding her down as well.

As last year came to a close, she checked herself into an intensive outpatient program at a local mental hospital in order to try and figure out how to deal with everything. Afterwards, she took her medication for a while before stopping because of physical side effects of the drug, and since then her mood has been even less stable, swinging between horrible suicidal thoughts and manic episodes where she sexually fantasized about friends and coworkers, which she recorded and showed me a few times. I wasn't very happy about that because I was worried she wanted to leave me, and she felt so confused by my reaction. I invited my mom up to help us clean the apartment, which had become almost untenable due to our arguing over chores, and my mom pulled me aside and called her out on being lazy, stubborn and entitled, and I couldn't disagree with her. My mom works in a hospital, and while she's not a psychologist or psychiatric specialist, she felt it was more that my fiancee was using her disease as a crutch, and warned me to stop enabling her or I'd be trapped in an unhappy marriage by her mental illness, and with the possibility of having children, it was something I would have to consider seriously before getting married. I tried to think of ways to disagree with her... but I couldn't.

Lately, it's escalated to the point where, after a bad argument, she unsuccessfully attempted suicide by aspirin overdose, at which point I ended up kicking her out and calling a friend to come get her so she wouldn't hurt herself or be unsafe, because I was working at home at the time and was already on thin ice at my new job. After being kicked out, she let me know that she wanted to take a break so we could work on ourselves, and I agreed. She was then admitted to an inpatient mental hospitalization program, which she was released from after about a week, and has been living with her mother on the other side of the county ever since (maybe a 25 minute drive). 

Since then, we attended a local anime convention together (we had bought the tickets in advance of the break, and we stayed in separate sleeping quarters, but spent some time together there just walking around). She made the case to be sexually non-exclusive since we were taking a break, and to pursue an open relationship if we got back together, and I agreed. Later that day, she told me that she had had sex multiple times with a mutual friend since we made that agreement, and I just didn't know how to really take it without being mad, though I had been working on my anger management and self control and didn't yell or get angry, but simply said I was concerned that she's using sex to try and build her self confidence instead of working on her self-care and therapy stuff, and she's responded by telling me how hard she's been working on her daily routine, improving her eating and sleeping habits, and doing things that make her happy. Part of me wants to tell her that she should have had that figured out a while ago, but I want to be respectful of her mental health. I've since signed up for a therapy session to discuss my anger and the loneliness and depression I've felt from the stress of the break with a professional; I'm not letting this become a part of who I am without doing something to try and manage it.

I don't want to be insensitive or put her at risk of hurting herself (I know I'm not the best at empathy or understanding emotions), but I feel very unappreciated and disrespected by her lack of effort to pursue even her basic responsibilities to herself, to her job, to the apartment we share, and to me. She hasn't taken her therapy seriously in the past, and while I know that she's seriously mentally ill and it's extremely hard to get better at that, I can't make her better and she has to put in the time and effort to follow her self-care plan without my regular oversight. I know she wants to move back in and try to restart the relationship eventually, but I'm so jaded at this point I don't expect it to last long. I just can't work up the effort to really explain this to her, or to make a decision whether or not I should break up with her for good, or try and stay together, or figure out some other arrangement. I know some of our friends want us to break up for each of our sakes; some are mad at me for being harmful to my fiancee at the worst of a depressive episode, some are mad or upset at her for seeing other men, and others are still just concerned for both of our mental and emotional states.

I've recently spiraled into a bit of depression from this, including fruitless attempts at casual sex in keeping with the whole ""open relationship"" thing. I've even put my friendships with people from my past at risk because of it, and I know it's unhealthy, but I just don't want to be lonely right now, even for a little bit. I'm not having harmful or suicidal thoughts, but I've been neglecting my chores and feeling achy and tired constantly since she left. I just don't have any motivation to even keep the apartment clean or go buy groceries, and my ability to stream and volunteer has been severely impacted, and I worry my job might see an impact as well if I can't get any decent sleep or eat properly myself.

Anyway, I wanted to get this all off my chest and see what Reddit had to say. I can understand if some of you hate me for how I've treated my fiancee; I hate myself for it too. I just want to know if it's even worth trying to get back together, or if the loneliness, having to separate five years worth of intermingled life stuff, and having to risk watching her depression move into life-threatening levels is worth it at this point so that both of us can move on from what I feel is a toxic relationship."

I'm seeking a long term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it.

801xt9,41,2018-02-24,This Mike got passed around like a bad penny...,NewMendicant,talesofmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesofmike/comments/801xt9/this_mike_got_passed_around_like_a_bad_penny/,"Cracking up over the stories here.  They remind me of the ""Mike"" in my career.  This Mike was unique because he ended up working with both me and my wife at different organizations (we used to be in the same industry).

Mike didn't know how to do his job.  OK, a lot of people don't.  But Mike was aggressive in his ignorance.  At my wife's place, Mike was tasked with sending out letters to clients and reviewing documents before they were sent to the accounting office.  He also supervised a data processor and a data analyst.  Most people could have learned how to do his job in a few weeks, and Mike was sent on more than one week-long training session to learn how to use the database and Microsoft Office.  But Mike just refused to learn, saying this was beneath him.  So Mike just ended up sitting around the office doing nothing most of the time.

Well, almost nothing.  When he did do something it was comically, cringeworthingly bad: 

*Mike was asked to create and send out 500 form letters to clients.  An even semi-competent employee would have downloaded the list of clients from the database, then done a Word merge to create letters and envelopes and let the printer do the rest.  Not Mike!  Mike took the template and painstakingly opened up each client's database record and filled in name, address, salutation....then he'd save the letter under its own file name.  He did the same for 500 envelopes.  Then, even though he was told that the mailing office would stuff the envelopes for him, he insisted on folding every single letter and licking every single envelope!  This was a process that would have taken you or me three hours, but it took Mike THREE MONTHS.  I am not shitting you, he took three months to send out a mailing to 500 people!  When angry clients started calling Mike's boss (who was a terribly weak person who refused to stand up to Mike) to complain, she told them that ""Mike is really busy and the letters will be out soon"".  That was the only project Mike was officially working on for those three months!

*But if you had to do something?  Mike actually stood behind the data processor with a stopwatch and bitched at her for ""taking too long"" to enter data!  He wanted her to cut the time it took her to enter a new client in the database from three to two minutes!

*Mike had endless standing weekly meetings with loads of people in the office:  his subordinates, his boss, and random people he had no real contact with.  Mike refused to cancel the weekly meetings even if there was nothing to talk about, and often scheduled the meetings for two to three hours, insisting that the meetings last the full scheduled time!  Somebody figured out that Mike had 25 hours of standing meetings per week!  Again, Mike's boss pointed to this as a sign that Mike was ""really busy""....

*Mike was asked to get new furniture for an office move, and to get physical plant to repaint the new office.  Mike spent months looking over furniture catalogues and constantly harassed the purchasers looking for ""a better deal"" (it was repeatedly pointed out to Mike that the purchasers had no negotiating power with the furniture supplier on his particular order, but this never seemed to faze Mike).  Then when the painters came he insisted on sitting in the office while they painted, and criticized their work--to the extent that the painters, after unsuccessfully told him to leave, refused to continue working until he was removed from the office.  Security was eventually called to remove Mike.

*Mike noticed that everybody else had two monitors, so Mike wanted two monitors too.  When IT asked him if he wanted them to set up the monitors, he loudly told them ""I'm not stupid, I can set them up myself"".  Of course Mike did not know how to set up the second monitor and it sat unused on his desk for the remainder of his tenure.  Well it did serve one purpose:  it blocked everybody else from seeing what he was doing at his desk.  Which was nothing.

*Mike started acting ""really creepy"" (my wife's words) around the female interns.  When one intern complained, they didn't do anything to Mike, but they did transfer the intern to another department.  That intern worked for my wife and she didn't get a replacement because ""any other intern might be treated the same way by Mike"".  Again Mike's boss did nothing...

*Mike owned a boat and was really proud of it.  Another co-worker once saw Mike wandering around with a captain's hat.  A fucking captain's hat!

Eventually somebody up high realized that Mike was doing nothing and had amassed countless HR complaints.  A quiet word was put to Mike's boss that it was either her or Mike.  She told Mike this and, seeing the writing on the wall, called in a favor from a friend of his to get another job.  That friend was my boss.

So now, since Mike had no skillset, a new position was created for Mike at my place.  He was going to try to get new clients for us, and supervise me and my agents.  I created a list of 300 client prospects for Mike at our first meeting.  Mike snootily said that ""he knew how to find clients"" (he had never recruited a single client in his career) and said he'd find them on his own, thank you very much.  Mike then proceeded to:

*Spend two months ordering mail boxes for the agents to collect mail from.  He once had a FULL-DAY meeting with a secretary to go over catalogues and to try to find a ""deal"" on them.

*During a meeting of our agents, he criticized our best agent then suggested that maybe he was being paid too much.  In response the agent called him out on his bullshit.  Mike then challenged the agent to a fistfight, which the agent refused to have any part of, then later fired the agent for ""inciting violence"".

*Demanded that he get ""a bigger office"" (he already had the second-largest office in the department).  He asked his friend to switch offices repeatedly...his friend was his boss!

*When asked by a consultant hired by the CEO's office to improve office efficiency, Mike was asked what he did for the office.  Mike couldn't answer!  He hemmed and hawed for about 15 seconds before starting a rambling answer about ""improving internal processes"" (none of which he could name) and ""preparing future success"".  After a minute of this the consultant cut him off.  Mike didn't speak again for the entire meeting.

*There were more rumors about Mike ""being creepy"" around interns and other female employees.  

*It was found that Mike had lied, repeatedly, on his resume.  He claimed he had an MBA when he actually had a lesser, less comprehensive business degree.  He claimed to be a supervisor at a company when it turned out he was only a student intern!  And he claimed to be a VP at another company that turned out to consist of only three people...yes, he was the second-in-command, but he never had that title and his main job there was stuffing envelopes.  Mike's boss promised he'd do something as a result of these revelations, but then stalled and stalled and stalled...

*...until somebody in the CEO's office noticed that Mike had not actually gotten any new clients, and that department income was down over 20% from before Mike's hiring.  So HR finally acted and fired...Mike's boss.  Most people would have taken that as a huge wake up call, but Mike was nothing but consistent!  He continued to sit around doing nothing but bothering people, holding endless meetings, and acting creepy around interns until a new VP was hired.  He fired Mike less than a week later.

Incredibly, Mike has caught on at a third company!  Once again he called in a favor and is now by all accounts sitting around doing nothing there.

Yeah, I know it all sounds fantastic, but I swear the above is true.  There's even a bunch of other stuff I didn't add to the story.  Mike was such a bad employee I actually quit six weeks into his tenure at my company and took a job halfway across the country.  He literally broke up my family because of his badness.  Some of the stories I told from my company were relayed to me by my former coworkers.  

The only silver lining with Mike was...next to him, no employee I worked with ever seemed bad again.  It certainly helped my blood pressure at future jobs."

802ep1,4,2018-02-25,I'm disappointing everyone I care about in life,cbarton236,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/802ep1/im_disappointing_everyone_i_care_about_in_life/,"So I am a Sophomore in College. I've been struggling with seasonal depression since Junior year of high school. I used to go to therapy for help with my depression but I stopped that about a year ago. Everything was going fine. This winter though everything came crashing down. First it was one class, then the next and the next. Then I lost my internship and now I am starting to push my friends and family away. They all want to ""help"" me but they don't know what is really going on. I kept it that way on purpose in order to protect them. My life feels so out of control right now and I don't know what to do. I feel like I need to start therapy again but it feels like a regression to me. I know it will help me but I am too stubborn to admit defeat.

Edit: I am going to try going back to therapy. I contacted my campuses counseling services and am waiting to hear a response. Thank you both for your suggestions. I will keep them in mind moving forward"
802xa0,5,2018-02-25,"Opinions on Pre-med, as an iT major?",SyntheticDinosaur,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/802xa0/opinions_on_premed_as_an_it_major/,"Hey guys, I am actually still a High School senior. At first, I applied to a bunch of universities under biology with my second decision as Cyber Security. However, after thinking it over -- and hearing about what my 3 Science teachers say about the major -- I decided to go the Cyber Security/ Information Assurance route since I just have to do med-school requirements. After all -- I really do not know what I will think after seeing what I will see while doing volunteer work and shadowing doctors (and if I am disturbed from what I see). 

The issue comes in when I have to study for certs while also working a job in IT (to get experience so when I get my BS, I can hopefully hop into CybSec easier). I am thinking about taking the ASVAB to see what kind of job I can get in the Reserves and if it is medical-related using that as clinical experience. However if I do that, and I can actually get a medical-related job - I will have to take a year off of school for training and tech training. 

So.. here is my plan so far, tell me if there are any issues with my logic.

 * Get my A+ cert in 1-2 months for basic IT job (I am also studying programming and CCENT right now)

 * Do summer Classes to finish off my basic courses and test for CCENT (this will knock out some hard courses)

 * Attend CC for Associates Degree while working and shadowing doctors

 * Second year, if I find that I can add on more course and still manage - dual enroll at a UNI and take BIO courses

 *Summer - finish off last semester of degree (it is 5 semesters) - also test for ASVAB

 * If the reserves does not work out for me, I will just go straight off to UNI 

 * At this point I will start applying for Internships and ditch my job (whatever it is) or find a nice Network job and work that (if I had not already found one).

 * When I attend UNI, I will be actively taking pre-med courses alongside my CybSec courses - because of this it could possibly take me an extra year or two to graduate, especially since I will be volunteering every so often.

 * After Uni, I will have a Bachelor's degree and I will have had enough IT experience to get a nice cushy job - however while looking for work I will see my chances of Med School if I still have an interest after the past years. If I do not make it the first year of applying - I will try the next, then the next, and then the next while getting more med experience (maybe even some overseas?).

What do you guys think? I really love Bio, however I do not know if I would be able to keep it up for 4 years - it seems like something that leaves you with no life - and the benefits of the degree seem small in comparison. I also, love IT though and honestly it seems like it would leave me with better job opportunities if I do not go into medicine. I also understand being a doctor is not the only way to help people, CybSec appeals to me for such a reason. I have the feeling that I could just ""fit in"" the volunteer work, shadowing, and clinical work in my free time - however since I have never personally experience the load, I am not sure. Looking at it this way, I see no risks in trying out medicine and I am thinking I could even do IT work for a non-profit or something. If medicine does not work out, I will just get my master's in CyberSec - like my father did and break into actual CyberSec work if I had not already.

Sorry, If I annoy you - I am still in that crossroad phase where I just do not want to regret and think about ""what could have been"". I have already experienced that feeling, and worst of all with IT itself. I do not want to burn any bridges and as I result - I know that I will gain so much knowledge and experience in the coming years and no matter the path I choose - I will gain at least that and the memory that I did try and the career just was not suited for me.

I would also love some tips and maybe some ideas on managing the load. I have heard it was possible to manage a full time job - however I would really like to know more people's opinions on it while fitting in pre-med. Maybe people from the same mind as me, I know you all are out there - there are so many pre-med dropouts after all! I am thinking of just dividing my bachelor's degree into 6 years - so that I can have enough time to properly study, or even just completing my pre-med reqs after my degree and go in post.

In the end, I am wondering how a med school would view after all this?

802xr8,7,2018-02-25,"Seeking advice on going from one income to two by taking the KM slot, never managed before.",bankdudz,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/802xr8/seeking_advice_on_going_from_one_income_to_two_by/,"I've been working at my job for 6 years, and know the restaurant and the daily ins and outs like the back of my hand. I've been a meat cutter for the past 3, with a key and complete and total schedule freedom. With complete and total schedule freedom, allowing me to raise my daughter, basically. My wife had to go back to work after 6 weeks to finish a college internship for a bachelor's degree in social work. I went down to 4 days a week and stayed home with Mia and my neighbor had her Thursday and Friday, which was a blessing. You can't put a price on good neighbors. After my wife got her degree, she worked at a golf course for a stretch. Until dept. of Human Resources for a full time salary position opened. Mia turned 1 and headed to daycare. Now I take her, work, and get her, all before my wife gets home.

Our son was born in December. Mia is 3 now. My wife has had her social work job for a year and a half, and had up to 13 weeks off. She took 11. Last Tuesday was her last day back to work. Within the past week, we created a plan. I move up to kitchen manager, (position foreseen to be available within the next 6 to 8 months, managing partner is one of my best friends, good leader, takes care of his people)* my wife quits, stays home with the kids, and gets her time with them, and works part time or pickup status at the golf course. She can make 1000 a month with four 5 hour shifts at a beautiful golf course. I had so much time with Mia, to this day, she will hardly lay down with mommy at night.. I was selfishly thinking of how my usual time will change. Not about how my wife hasn't had much time with the kids, at all. For years. I can sacrifice my 'easy' job (because I'm very good), let my wife be a full time mother and save money on daycare, aside from the financial similarities.*

Stats:

I make 15$ an hour, topped out, with bonuses every quarter. I've hit my bonuses consecutively for the past 9 months. Starting at 500, then 1000, then 1500. My next 2 will be 1500, then 2000, then the final is 2500. That's all you can get out of the bonus program, so I'm a third of the way there, money-wise. I can be halfway there by the time the km position was available. I work 32 hours a week, usually. I could get 40 but I spend it with my kids, literally.

My wife's salary is 31,000. That's before tax and blue cross blue shield family plan insurance is taken out. They match her 75 a check 401k and will be paid out when she leaves. She gets mileage when she is on call and has to drive. But sometimes, if she gets a call, and something happens to somebody in mobile, related to something here.. it doesn't matter if it's 5pm or am, she is driving. Yeah that's an extra 300 bucks on a 2 week check but, at what cost. The stress of having to answer a phone that could send you to mobile on a Monday, right before Mia's dance class. Her job has also lost 4 people in her unit the two weeks leading up to her first day back. In a nutshell, more work. More on call.

Right now, before tax: 31,000 + 32,300 = 63,300 10,000 a year on daycare So, 53,300

Plan, before tax: 45,000 + 10,000 = 55,000 *no daycare. So, 55,500

Sorry for all the personal information. Any advice is welcome.

*I ORIGIONALLY TYPED THIS UP TO POST IN r/personalfinance, THE FOLLOWING IS AN ADDENDUM FOR r/kitchenconfidential*

Hearing from any managers or anybody with experience would be fantastic. I have a wife, two kids, I'm 24, you know the situation. I work for a fantastic company, I love my job. I have been working with some of the same guys for 6 years now. MP is one of my good friends, he trusts me, he takes care of his management team. But I know management changes everything. I'm mentally prepared. I watched my best friend quit because he became KM. Responsibility and power changes people, in some cases. This is also a roadhouse. Steak and taters. 70,000 in sales each week on average. Located in the mall parking lot so we sometimes do 85000 a week during 'restaurant season'."

I already had a UX Design internship out of highschool in NY, and am currently doing a digital marketing internship in New Zealand. I really loved my time as a UX Design intern and fell in love with UX Design then and there. I’m so passionate about it, but there are no UX Design internships in NZ. Recently I saw a digital consultant internship pop up which said that experience with UX and UI Design is necessary, but what else does being a consulting intern come with? 
Also my uni doesn’t have an HCI papers which limits my degree to programming with Java and C+, which I feel is irrelevant for UX/UI Design

8041n2,11,2018-02-25,I'm sad and troubled about one of my friends (41F). I need your input on what I should do.,mcsevigny,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8041n2/im_sad_and_troubled_about_one_of_my_friends_41f_i/,"We've known each other for about 12 years. We met at a previous work place we don't work at currently. We are both health professionals, same age and gender. 

I'm very fond of her. She's smart, has a heart of gold and is all around a very good friend. The only drawback is that since I've known her, her life is constant drama. She's mostly always not doing well. 

The drama started 10 years ago when she became obsessed with her intern. At that time, she just had a baby boy with her boyfriend. The crush and flirting with said intern lasted for about 6 years. She was talking about him constantly, not wanting to leave her boyfriend. It escalated to an affair that lasted for about two years. From the time that guy entered her life, she described him as not nice, seductive and narcissistic. After meeting him, I concur with her assessment. At one point, her boyfriend grew tired of having a distant girlfriend who was crying for ""no reason"" as she was telling him. He left her. Two weeks after, she started an official relationship and a business with the intern and one of their friends. She left her job. 

The business venture with the 3 associates lasted about one year as my friend had a huge fight with the friend associate. Now, the business is owned by her and her intern-boyfriend. It's doing OK. 

A few months after she started the relationship with her intern, she discovered that he cheated on her with multiple women and was simultaneously dating 2 other women. She decided to stay with him because he told her that he loved her and has chosen her at the end. 

Actually, they just bought a house and are renovating it. She's telling me all the time that it's been very difficult with her intern-boyfriend. He's very degrading to her, tells her she has deep psychological issues and that she's damaged. She told me, quote-unquote : the relationship is destroying me. She doesn't want to leave though so she said she doesn't fight back. The last time I talked to her,she seems very depressed. I'm really worried about her. She also joined a MLM business that is very cult-like. 

I tried to talk her multiple times into going to see her physician and a psychologist but she doesn't do it. 
Last week, she started sending me creepy texts about her patients, telling me they were the only good things in her life and that they were helping her working through her father issues. I'm genuinely concerned about the well-being of her patients. 

I've been in remission of a stage III breast cancer for almost two years and since then, have been revaluating certain things in my life. I'm questioning my relationship with her as it's really starting to have an impact on my peace of mind. I always worry about her. 

I would love to hear your takes on this situation. 

TL;DR : Since being in remission of stage III breast cancer, I have been revaluating my relationship with my friend of 10 years whose life is constant drama. I'm tired of constantly worrying about her. "

Or with warframe it drops to 45FPS at times. 
So i would like to know if you people got some good OC suggestions to boost it good.

I would like to explore some older woman x younger man pairings in largely fluffy, humorous, kink-driven smutty goodness devoid of any redeeming social value. Let's have an equal relationship full of warmth, humor/banter, passion, seduction, loving sensuality and (at times) playing up the maternal/motherly affection!

***All characters must be written/played as at least 20+ years old.***

___

**I'm Not Interested In These Things:** Character degradation and emasculation; sex-negative femdom (your character treating mine as her personal punching bag/toilet/rape doll and using sex purely to punish or torment); sadistic bitches only able to achieve orgasm when their partner's broken and stripped of all self-worth

___

Now, there are certain R34 characters I'd love for a partner to play as in any of the above scenarios (we can adapt said scenarios to their canon universe or not, whichever). In full disclosure, I'm not just interested in these canon characters as faceclaims; if you can play their established/actual personalities, I'd love that too.
 
* **Pokemon anime:** Jessie, Lorelei, Fantina, Officer Jenny, Nurse Joy, Professor Ivy
* **DC Comics:** Power Girl, Lois Lane, Chloe Sullivan, Harley Quinn, Starfire
* **Disney:** Elsa (*Frozen*), Esmeralda (*Hunchback of Notre Dame*)
* **Nintendo:** Peach, Daisy (*Mario*); Zelda, Impa, Cia (*Legend of Zelda*)
* **Final Fantasy:** Yuna, Lulu (*FF X*); Knight!Lightning (*FF 13*)
* **Dragon Ball Z/Super:** Android 18, Bulma, Chi-Chi, Fasha/Seripa
* **Avatar/Korra:** Katara, Toph Beifong, Suki, Asami, Kuvira, Lin Beifong, Suyin Beifong

___

✴ College student x older next-door neighbor

✴ Office shenanigans between a boss and employee, or between co-workers

✴ College professor x student/teaching assistant (**no ""sex for grades"" plots, please**)

✴ Female celebrity x personal assistant (perhaps having some “private time”)

✴ Princess or queen/apprentice knight or bodyguard

✴ High priestess/guardian

✴ Mage/apprentice

✴ Colleagues with unspoken mutual attraction for one another are paired up to work on a long-term project together into the late hours of the night.

✴ A typically mean boss becomes vulnerable after learning her job might be in jeopardy. She gets comfort unexpectedly from an employee.

✴ Person B is an intern has a genuine professional respect for the older Person A's accomplishments and intelligence (not wanting to jeopardize this golden academic opportunity), and finds himself increasingly attracted to her. Further, he has a fondness of women wearing stockings or pantyhose. While he doesn’t outright stare, he finds it odd that one day, he can’t tear his eyes away from the sheathed, long legs of Person A, but thinks he was discreet in his observations. Unfortunately, that was ill-assumed, as she approaches him with an...interesting proposal.

✴ An older heroine having my character be her sidekick, or taking an up-and-coming hero with considerable potential under her wing as her protégé.

✴ My character being a do-gooder who has been an annoyance to the older female villainness, but she decides there's a much more fun way to handle him than taking him out..."

Depending on how it goes, it may be *very* stressful. 

I’m in my final year of graduate school, and will graduate with a doctorate in clinical psychology in the spring.  That much is going well enough, but tomorrow is the day that I find out if I’ve been accepted for a post-doc position, which is basically an additional year of specialized training.  The call(s) could come at any time or not at all, and that phone call will determine where I pack up and move to in the fall. 

These positions are very competitive and I spent a lot of money traveling to interview in person.  I’m really hoping I land a particular spot, partly because I really, really want to live in that area and I have friends there. (Graduate school can be very lonely and I’m tired of not being around my people.). To make matters still more stressful, I was turned down for an internship in that area last year and have had to live in a place that doesn’t have much to offer me this year. 

I’ve been managing sobriety, as my badge will attest, for a little while now, but my sobriety still feels quite brittle.  It’s not the end of the world if things don’t work out.  There’s a plan B. Even so, it’s going to feel bad, perhaps very bad, and I don’t want to snap and get drunk because it’s going to make the emotional experience of it all so much worse if things don’t go my way. 

I put it to you guys: how have you successfully managed these experiences, where there seem to be some storm clouds gathering on the horizon?  I ask because I’m genuinely afraid about tomorrow, and tomorrow is gonna come soon.  Any feedback you might have would be really appreciated.

Well so I have been living in my room in college since beginning of January and LC with both of Nparents. 

Operation Leo I was thursday. The goal was to take the train back home, quickly get my last batch of mail and some other things, do driving lessons, do exam and get back. I arrived home only to see that they shut off the garage gate. (I have no key so that was the only way for me to get in) I did driving lessons , passed my exam and got my licence. 

Operation Leo II was today. Now the goal was to get in while they're home, get the things and get out. They weren't home and I stood there again shut out off my own house. It was 3pm but I didn't have the time to wait for them in the cold so I went back almost immediately. 

I opened a new account and the clerk at the bank probably sent my bank card to my home adress. Nmom probably opened that letter already. I have a post box and my mail will be rerouted starting 26 February. I don't know if I should do an third operation Leo or like explain the clerk that my card got ""lost"" or that mom thought it was ads and threw it away and request a new one. Or go to another/ third bank. 

Friday I had my last conversation with my psychologist. Nmom called him (fake) crying before and I think he's been seeing me as the bully in all of this. He didn't support me in my decision to go NC or to live alone/independent. He said he shivers when he hears me talking about it and told me to ask questions and conside the consequences first. 

My internship starts monday. Here I am worrying if I have enough food/ fresh clothes/ supplies while others just chill or prepare by doing research for their thesis.

I'm a 19 year old college student and I want financial independence. I'm majoring in computer science, should be graduating in May 2021, and I'm expecting to have a little less than $10,000 in student loans at the time (I'm taking out 4900 in subsidized loans this year, and next year. I won't be taking out anymore.) I currently do not work while in college but next year I plan on getting a tutoring job to put on my resume. I also plan to work a bunch over the summer. My job has very flexible hours so I can work 0 hours or 100 hours if I wanted to. So I should be able to put away anywhere from $5000-$10000 since I'll have very minimal expenses living with my mom. After this summer I will apply to a bunch of CS internships but if not I always have my old job to fall back on.

**Assets**

Checking: ~$2000

Cryptocurrency: ~$5000-10000 (nature of crypto, most will advise against this but it's a risk that I believe is worth taking.)

Car: ~$3500 (paid in full, will run to ground) 

**Short-term-goals**

Emergency fund: ~$3000 (I don't have any fixed expenses but this will be a nice cushion)

Rent fund: ~$4000 (set aside for my apartment for junior year. Will work during then but not enough to pay for whole apartment.)

Checking: ~$1000 (just a bare minimum cushion I want for my checking)

**Long-term-goals**

Investments: ~$2.5M. I think this would be a good number for me, with 4.5% withdraw that's ~115k which should be more than enough. I want to travel a lot when I'm older though.

Retire Age:  ~40-45. I'm not too sure, I don't even know how much I'm going to enjoy computer science but I think I would actually like to do it longer. But I want this age to be the point where I can if I want.

**How?**

Expected salary: I am going off on basis I can come into workforce and make ~75k a year right away. With CS I think my salary could raise to over $100k a year in less than 5 years experience.

IRA and 401K: Plan to max these out as soon as I graduate and get a real job. That will be around $2000 savings per month. 

Additional Savings: I would say I want to save at least $1000 a month. At $75k salary that would be tight, but I could get a room mate or live at home for that time. As time goes on I would increase that amount.

**Questions-&amp;-Note**

I have a Roth IRA open right now. Problem is the summer job I work is under the table, so I can't contribute. Hoping once I get an internship I can.

What kind of expenses can I expect? With a salary of 75k I estimate a take home around $4200 a month. I'm assuming the company I work for will give match for 401k, so I'd say around $1125 for that pre-tax but then ~$500 per month for IRA. That should still leave me with over $2500. Then if I wanted to put another $1000 into savings, could I survive off $1500 a month? I live in a M/LCOL area and worse comes to worse I could live with my mom for a year.

Throughout my college experience, I've been lucky enough to have parents that have supported my stay. However, because of how long it has taken me to get through my degree, my support is ending after this spring. This means no help with housing or tuition. I will be 100% independent. I'm thankful for their generosity and have no bad blood about being cut off. However, I didn't work at all over the summer of 2017 (instead I took Summer classes), and therefore have nothing to report in terms of income for 2017. Ideally, I'll find a summer internship doing something relevant to computer science and will maybe be able to pay for my housing and such. I am also looking into financial aid, but I am skeptical because I have gone from being a complete dependent to an independent with no income. I only have one more semester after the summer until I have my degree, so I will only be paying for one semester. Anyone have insight as to whether or not I'm eligible for loans? Or what options I might have as to how to get through this last semester financially? Thank you in advance!"

Things were going well and we always talked about a future together. We have been living together for about 6 months now and things have been slowly building up to this moment where we are at a grid lock. 

The problems started about 2 years ago when I graduated college and he was still pursuing his undergraduate degree after 5 years in school with graduation nowhere in sight and raking up a hefty student loan debt. I had a job before graduating in my field, whereas he didn't have an internship let alone a job. I had to push him to get something to get an internship with his professor so he could have some experience before graduating. I also had to push him to graduate with just a STEM degree without the engineering tag because it would have meant he would take on more debt on his already six figure debt total without the investment being worth it. 


After that, he wouldn't spend time looking for a job unless I WAS pushing him. He didn't even know where to begin to update his resume or which sites to apply to. He used his phone to apply to jobs which is ridiculous! I would find him looking at memes and videos. He would spend time looking at porn (doesn't bother me) instead of looking at jobs saying he was trying to prevent prostate cancer???

I understand not many people are ambitious but to be this under motivated at the beginning of your career is unacceptable to me. 

Before all that, we decided to move in together and he agreed because out rent and expenses ended up being the same as before we moved in. Nothing changed expense-wise except that we lived together now. 


I footed the bills and rent and food for both of us while he was looking for a job and a little bit after because we couldn't make ends meet with his student loans. I was supportive and lent the money and said he could pay me back when he got back on his feet. 


Fast forward 3 months and he got a temp job which was something. I was still paying for everything and at this point he owed me 2 months back rent and utilities and I waived off the expenses for food. His job involved working from 11am to 10pm which meant I did pretty much everything around the house. I cooked, grocery shopped, cleaned, paid for rent, utilities, etc and all while working 9-6. I tried to be supportive since it was temporary while his training was going on (1 month). 


I thought once he got his new job and he made more and had normal hours things would be better since we would have more time to spend together. He was saving money now despite his loans and had much more time on his hands. He always promised that things would be better once he was working normal hours and made decent pay but they aren't. I am still keeping track of when to pay the bills, rent and everything. I have to ask him to help around the house. Nothing gets done until I mention it. He just looks at memes and videos on his phone all day. We would watch Netflix all day if I didn't ask to shut it off and do something productive. Its been endless fighting once a week on the same issue. I try to communicate to him in a normal conversational voice about the issue I think are happening and if he thinks its the same but he just shuts down when I try to talk to him about issues. 


I feel like a crazy person talking to myself when I express issues. He doesn't respond and he doesn't even say okay or that he agrees. He just waits for me to stop talking and cry next to him and he hugs me and tells me he loves me then goes back to what he was doing which was looking at f**ing memes. No conversation, then the cycle repeats a week or so later when tensions boil. 


Today, he woke up around 8 and I woke up around 11am (we were up late last night). He was on his phone for 3 hours looking at youtube. I asked him if what he's been up to and he said ""I just missed you and was watching videos to kill time"". I told him he shouldn't wait to do everything with me, I am trying to gain weight and he is trying to lose weight, so I won't be going to gym as often as he should be. He didn't even eat! He won't even make dinner or lunch unless I say we should get up and make something. 


There are a ton of things that bother me about him now and they are just building up over the last few months. I feel like I am slowly losing respect for him and losing hope of a future together. I feel like he is a man child I have to mother all the time. I pay for everything and to me it isn't about the money, its more about his realizing I am doing it to support him but he never remembers to pay me back unless I bring it up once a month even thought he makes enough now to pay me back. He says be feels overwhelmed by his debt and I get that but that shouldn't just cripple you from moving on, he will have this for the next 12 years, does that mean I have to support him financially until then?? Am I being insensitive? 


I am seriously questioning our relationship's sustainability going forward. Lately we have been having more bad times than good. He doesn't do things with me that I like and I ask him if he wants to take a class together for something he likes and he refuses because of money. In the past I would say I can pay for it but I don't feel like encouraging that mentality anymore. He needs to try harder in our relationship and take initiative for events like valentines day or birthdays because I am tired of making plans and doing everything and him taking a back seat to everything.  
  

  ---   
  tl;dr: I 24F can't communicate to my boyfriend 26M, about issues effectively to where he understands and makes changes or takes action. I do/pay/take initiative for most things even though we both are working now. It isn't about the money as much as a mutual respect to understand and make a change. Am I being too hard or being insensitive towards his plight? Should I give it some time or try harder to make things work? "

[Part 2: Maybe a summer apart will do us good](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/7v8u6w/maybe_a_summer_apart_will_do_us_good/)

--------------------------------------------
Luke and I barely spoke that summer. He was off in San Diego. Ever few weeks I would text him something to see if I could start a conversation, but we really hadn’t talked since that day before he left. I spent the summer working an internship and for the most part it was ok. I missed talking to him at lot. He was my main confident and not having that was hard.

It was a Monday in mid-August when my roommate (who I’ll give a name now for ease), Charlie, called me. I was out with some coworkers for drinks after work. I let it ring; I decided to call him later that night I got home. After it stopped, I got a text from Charlie. The message said to call him as soon as possible. My gut told me that I wasn’t going to like whatever Charlie had to tell me. I got up from the table and called him back. Our friend Matt was in the hospital. He’d been in some sort of accident on his bicycle on his way home from work in DC and was in critical condition at the hospital. Matt was a good friend from undergrad. He was part of the gang in my major. I had a picture on my desk back at school of me, Luke, Charlie, Matt, and our other friends together. I made my excuses to my coworkers and went home. I didn’t hear anything for the rest of the evening.

The next day at the office my phone was glued to me wherever I went. I wasn’t getting anything done hardly. I was just after 1pm when Charlie called. Matt had died from the injuries he sustained. I was in shock. Sure, I’d experienced loss before, but this was different. This was the first time someone young and healthy I knew died. It hit pretty hard. After collecting myself, I asked Charlie if he would like help calling the rest of our friends; having to repeat the bad news over and over was a lot to ask of one person. Charlie said we could if I was up to it. We ended and I began to call our friend to let them know the bad news. I saved Luke for last. I called him but he didn’t pick up. I texted him that I had important news about Matt and to call me back when he could. He called me back immediately. His tone full of trepidation.

“Hey, what’s going on? Has Matt’s condition changed?”

“Luke… I don’t know how to say this, but Matt’s gone.”

“Like to another hospital?”

His tone full of denial.

“No, Luke, he’s dead.”

The silence was deafening. I waited for a response. Finally, Luke said something his voice clearly indicating that he was crying.

“Do you know the details for the funeral or whatever?”

“I don’t but I would imagine it will be later this week. If I were you I would look into getting a flight to Dulles for the day after tomorrow. Are you ok? I will stay on if you need me to.”

“No, but I don’t want to talk. I need to process.”

“Ok call me if you need to talk; doesn’t matter when.”

We said our goodbyes. That was the first time Luke and I had spoken since that day. I went to my boss and explained what had happened. He offered his condolences a told me to go do what I needed to do.

The next few days were a flurry of activity. I went to Charlie’s parents’ house in Great Falls, Virginia; driving distance from where my internship was. His parents had offered up their home for any of our friends who’d be in town for the funeral and his mom said she’d cook for us so we didn’t have to worry about food. Charlie and I spent a lot of the time before the funeral waiting near Dulles at a coffee shop as friends arrived at different times. Luke was last to arrive. Charlie had left earlier to take someone back to his house. I was waiting alone till Luke arrived. Finally, he texted me that the plane had just landed. As I arrived at the airport, I received a text from Luke telling me Pillar 5. He was standing there staring off into space. I pulled up and got out.

“Hey man, how was your flight?”

“It was ok I guess. No crying babies.”

I embraced him, but he only half-heartedly returned by hug; I brushed it off and attributed it to sadness. I had missed seeing him - his touch and the smell of his cologne. We parted and I took his bag and loaded it in my car.

“Well, I suppose we should get back to Charlie’s. I hope you’re hungry. His mom makes a ton of food, so you won’t go hungry while you’re here.

Luke smiled uncomfortably. I’d known him long enough to tell when he didn’t want to deal with something.

“Yeah, let’s go. I’m pretty hungry.”

I tried to talk to him in the car, but he was muted. He answered the questions that I would ask, but they were short answers and the conversation just didn’t flow. We arrived at Charlie’s house and five of our other friends were already there catching up. Many of us hadn’t seen each other in many month and for some it had been almost a year; it was an untimely union to say the least, but a reunion nonetheless. The services were scheduled for the next day. We all planned to go to the funeral home at 10am then later to the actual funeral at 2pm.

Everyone was in the kitchen talking and snacking. At some point I noticed that Luke was missing. I went looking for him to find him up in the spare bedroom that I had been staying in. He was sitting on the bed staring out at the sailor sky. He turned briefly as I entered the room then back to the window.

“Sorry I’m being antisocial. I didn’t feel much like talking with everyone. I asked Charlie’s mom where I should put my bags and she told me that everywhere else was full up aside from sharing this bed with you. I’m impressed that you contrived it so that we’d have to share a bed again.”

His tone was not one of amusement. It was cold and cruel, which was so uncharacteristic for Luke.

“Look, I didn’t ‘plan’ this. I asked multiple people if they would share the bed with me rather than sleep on air mattresses or couches, but no one took me up on it, so don’t go accusing me of trying to ‘get you in bed again’. If you had gotten here earlier, you’d have had your pick of sleeping arrangements. Don’t fucking blame me for how things worked out. You can go find a spot on the floor somewhere if you want; I don’t fucking care. I thought you were just sad about Matt, but you’re clearly still fucking butt hurt about what happened at Peter’s. You didn’t want to talk that day at my place before you left town. I got that because it’s a lot to process, but we *never* fucking talked about it because you fucking ignored me all summer. You barely answered my texts. And you *never* fucking picked up when I called or return my calls. Do you know how much that hurts to be fucking ignored like that? Do you!? Clearly not because you’re too much of a little bitch with your head so far up your own ass you couldn’t be bothered with me or anyone else. It’s not exactly been a cake walk for me either.”

I heard Charlie call out from the kitchen.

“Hey, Luke, [dirtyboy12345]. We’re voting on what to have for dinner. Get your asses back in here.”

I yelled back that I’d be right there. I turned back into the room and continued to berate Luke in a kind of whisper yelling trying not to be overheard.

“Oh and fuck you for picking this moment to be a little cunt. Matt’s dead and you’re moping about the sleeping arrangements. Real fucking classy, dude. Figure out what the hell is going on with you. Don’t make this whole situation shittier than it has to be.”

This time I was the one who got to walk away. I rejoined everyone else and lied that Luke was really tired from his journey, wanted to rest and that he might join us later.  Later that night, Luke did appear, reheat some food, and join in on the conversation. Though we were in the same room together, we didn’t talk directly to each other the whole evening. As it approached midnight, everyone wanted to head to bed. We had a long day tomorrow. I walked back to the spare bedroom and got ready for bed. I was standing in front of the sink in the bathroom brushing my teeth when Luke came into the room closing the door to the hallway behind him. He looked over at me. I couldn’t tell what his look meant. His gaze lingered. I had nothing on but my boxer briefs. I realized that I should have had more on probably. Being undressed around each other wasn’t awkward or at least it didn’t used to be…

He proceeded to strip down to his underwear. Luke had a nice body; he wasn’t super ripped, but he was fit like someone who was active and ate reasonably. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see him bending over his bag rummaging for something. He had to be doing it on purpose. Parading his ass around like that. There’s no way that he *wasn’t* doing it on purpose. He finally pulled out a toiletry bag. It couldn’t have been that hard to find in his bag; the bag wasn’t that big. He slipped behind me between the door and my ass. His crotched brushed my ass. I stopped brushing surprised by the contact. We made eye contact in the mirror. He had a slight smirk on his face. Now I knew he was doing it on purpose.

He pulled out his toothbrush and toothpaste, wetted the brush, and started brushing all the while making weird eye contact with me in the mirror. I finished brushing mine and rinsed out my mouth. I went to reach in front of him for the hand towel and he took it as a sign to switch back to the other side where once again his crotch grazed against my ass. He had to have been doing it on purpose; no one absent-mindedly does that twice, but two can play at that game. I wasn’t sure if his homoeroticism was him being cruel – a kind of fuck-you-I-know-you-want-this-but-can’t-have-it kind of thing – repayment for bitching him out earlier. After drying off my face, I went behind him. We looked at each other in the mirror as my dick grazed his ass only separated by two thin layers of cotton fabric. It gave me a smug sense of satisfaction seeing the look on his face.

I climbed into bed. I was actually very exhausted. Ferrying people back to Charlie’s house, dealing with Luke’s bullshit, just generally being up late was draining, and lest it be forgotten that my friend was dead. I wanted to get some sleep. Luke joined me in the bed and we slept with our back to each other.

I woke to the sound of my phones’s alarm at 8am. Luke was spooning me. At one time, I would have enjoyed that, but now I was just annoyed. I pushed him off, put clothes on, and joined everyone at breakfast. Luke showed up just as I was finishing. I left and got ready for the funeral. I was mostly dressed aside for putting on my tie. I went into my bag and pulled out the tie I had brought. In the rush to pack a bag to come to Charlie’s, I had packed Luke’s tie; I had returned it to the hanger with my suit. Great I thought, but I didn’t have much choice though so I put it on. 

Everyone else got ready and we headed over to the funeral home then to the actual service. I won’t expand much more on that day; it’s not a day that I like to remember and the details aren’t relevant to the story. When we returned to Charlie’s house, we all stood in the kitchen eating.  Due to how the timing fell, we didn’t have time for lunch, so we were all starving. At some point, Luke must have slipped away. I went looking for him. Once again, I found him sitting on the bed staring out the window at the sailor sky. His suit jacket was laying on the bed along with his tie. I walked in and shut the door.

“Ah there you are, Luke.”

I was a bit cold, but my heatedness from the day before had ebbed somewhat. He didn’t say anything. I made my way into the room and kicked off my dress shoes. I went around the bed to face him. He had tear trails running down his cheeks. Luke had never been much of a crier. In the years that we had known each other, I had only seen him cry once before this instance. I was surprised. I shouldn’t have been because it was the day of Matt’s funeral, so it makes sense, but nonetheless I was still surprised.

“Luke..”

My tone was much softer and warmer. I sat next to him on the bed. 

“It’s not fucking fair. Matt was such a great person and now he’s dead. He’s the smartest person I’ve ever met. I owe him so much. I don’t know if I would have made it through undergrad without him. He saved my ass so many times when I didn’t know what going on in class or on an assignment. He also set me straight when I was out of line. So kind and caring.”

“He was a great person, Luke. I will miss Matt a lot too.”

I’m not much of a crier, but I’m not afraid to cry when the feeling comes. I put my arm around Luke. I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes.

“Matt’s death has taught me one thing: anyone can die any day. I wish that I had stayed in better contact with him. I was thinking all summer about reaching out to him and seeing if he wanted to come out to San Diego to visit while I was out there. Now I’ll never get that chance.”

He turned into me crying on my chest. We just stayed like that for I don’t know how long – me holding him while slowly rocking and crying. After a while, I felt his head move and look up. He grabbed his tie, which I was still wearing, and pulled me into a deep kiss. I was astounded. He pulled back and looked me in the eyes.

“I think that I am in love you.”

*edit: backwards words.

808rby,53,2018-02-25,I think I understand how dangerous learned helplessness can be for me.,PapaNurgleLovesU,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/808rby/i_think_i_understand_how_dangerous_learned/,"I am writing this from the point of view of my own experience with learned helplessness:

I have been looking through my posts and realize that a lot of my feelings of hopelessness and incompetence are rooted in feelings of childhood abuse and mainly from being told the ways I wasn't good enough by my father (No duh). Simply put, while the abuse ended years ago, the feelings of helplessness still go strong and dominate my feelings toward my work and life.

I read once on another subreddit that ""If you don't think you deserve love or a good life, you don't."" and what it meant to me was that when I feel like I do not deserve a good life, I made unconscious and conscious choices that moved me away from a good life. I didn't challenge myself to do the best in my classes, I didn't risk myself by putting myself out there for internships (save one or two occasions) and I most certainly didn't show vulnerability in expressing interest in people (save one time and it was a nice, but short lived relationship). 

I feel like George Costanza in a way, every time I have done the opposite of what my inner critic insisted was true, I see at least something that proves I am capable. When I believe I can do something, I am almost stupidly stubborn in trying to get it. The moment doubt enters my mind I waver, and find external reasons why I could not have attained my goal. 

What I believed was reasonable doubt that kept me away from delusional narcissism was in fact defeatism and learned helplessness. 

By believing I was incurable, hopeless, and had something 'wrong' with me, they had become true. It led me to give up early, to be uncomfortable in social gatherings (and I am sure it showed to others), and generally buy into the idea that A) If you aren't perfect you are worthless and B) Only narcissists and sociopaths get ahead in life. 

Albert Bandura's concept of self-efficacy was fascinating to me because it mentioned that those with high self-efficacy could fail, time and time again, and keep trying, eventually succeeding, whereas those with low measures of self-efficacy would give in when met with challenges or hurdles too high to overcome. It was almost entirely psychological. I realize that through my own mental blocks, I was low on self-efficacy, barely trying before giving up. I was participating in a ""defeat without struggle"" because it is far easier to believe it is impossible than to try and fail, again and again.

So with learned helplessness, I can see it is a dire threat to my mental health. As a child I felt utterly powerless (and for the most part was utterly powerless) and it made me feel incompetent and at the mercy of things beyond my control. Learning about Sartre's existentialism grounded me in the understanding that while situations often arise beyond my control, I always have the ability to choose my goals and act within the bounds of the situation I find myself in. I am neither all-powerful, nor powerless. I can choose to lock myself into the diving bell of determinism, and believe my genetics are flawed, my childhood too broken, my self as unacceptable, and live at the mercy of chance. 

Or I can choose to break out of the diving bell and embrace the freedom I do have. I can live a more healthy lifestyle, I can assertively seek employment and internship opportunities, I can study for the standardized tests, and I can do research. None of it will be easy, and many times I will feel like I cannot do it, but if I give into the inner critic, I will instead fall into despair and begrudging acceptance. 

It was not my fault what happened to me as a kid. I just wanted my parents to be happy and to have a loving family, and for reasons out of my control it spiraled into dysfunction and abuse. But those days are long behind me. I am in my early 20s, and I succeeded in getting an undergraduate degree and entering a graduate program. My CPTSD is now my responsibility. If I want to experience love and a fulfilling career and life, it must be my own responsibility to seek them out and try for them. I am not owed anything by anyone, but I do feel I deserve good things, and so I must make choices that will bring me to what I deserve.  

Thank you to the kind people on here who put a lot of effort into making this a supportive community. It has helped ground me and teach me lessons about trauma and mental health. I am not cured, not yet. But at least I know how I can start making progress in recovery. I hope I can share results in the future.


tl;dr: Learned helplessness has been crippling my ability to make good choices for myself and treating myself with compassion. I realize I need to believe in myself and have hope for the future to move forward in recovery and life.

809470,17,2018-02-25,He Snapped!! Long story.,Sithcipherdias,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/809470/he_snapped_long_story/,"This happened two days ago so I'm still s little shook about it. A friend of mine, let's call him Joe, was a co-worker of mine at a hospital. I've known him for about 3 years. He was an asshole...but he was redpill as fuck...a fat dude, but this dude had game. TBH i liked him...he was a country boy and he was a hard-working honest dude, he came off as an asshole but TBH he was a good dude.

Joe snapped. He was an ex offender a black guy, about 340 pounds, 6 ft 2 but hard fat. He was bald with a beard, he wore wire rimmed glasses.  I met him when I was intern at a hospital as a greeter. 

He and I were in the same intern program to acclimate people with our hospital. 

Joe had charisma and for some reason or another the black women at the hospital loved him though he was mostly an asshole to them. He would say the most explicit shit you could say about fuckin or about women and he would say it fearflessly in front of women. Also he had sex with  few employees even though he was an intern.

 Shit that would get you fired...Joe didn't give a fuck, he would say that shit anyway and he would get away with it and the hospital hired him on as a permanent employee...by our ugly black female supervisor ...let's call her vernetta. 

I liked Joe because at his core he was just a blunt dude. His bluntness paid off because it garnered attention. To the point that he acquired a girlfriend at the hospital even though it was forbidden for interns and employees to date.

His girlfriend....? Let's call her Sheila, a ugly black girl who was short and overweight but she played the nawalt role. I was impressed, because she played the game right and I almost believed it. I was recently divorced at the time and I was real redpilled at women. From the time that I knew Joe since 2015 till now Sheila and Joe were together (Joe was in love with her).

Sheila would call Joe when we were working as interns and bring him breakfast in the morning. She played the nawalt role to perfection. In my mind I'm saying here it is an ugly black unicorn...there are good women our here. 

Well in the process of time Sheila and Joe get engaged and buy a house. Fast forward to two days ago. Joe is in jail. Apparently Sheila decided she didn't want Joe anymore and monkeybranched somewhere else, he found out and she broke up with him, he snapped and knocked her out. 

She somehow  went to the hospital where we all work and he followed her and struck on her again then proceeded to stomp on her (while in uniform) until the police came. He then turned on the hospital police fighting them and fled where they followed him on foot. they caught him and beat him to a pulp until the local police came and took him to jail...he's facing felony assault and battery, resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer...it's not looking good for Joe because he was on parole. He got hired on a second chance program making about 45k, now it's all over over a ugly woman...smh. 

Anyway AWALT.

809olt,10,2018-02-25,I never thought I'd be this happy.,Ihaveapositiveion,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/809olt/i_never_thought_id_be_this_happy/,"It all started on November 14, 2009. I was 19 and up until that night, I'd been living with my dad. It was 11 pm and I had just returned home from a 12-hour shift at Burger King. A lot had happened before this day. My dad had gone into a downward spiral for the fourth year since he and my mom split up. They were married for 16 years. He had been drinking a lot. Usually 9 shots every night. Then he was prescribed Xanax and was taking that as well. Scary stuff. Anyways, I had returned home and he was in my room supposedly fixing something with my computer. I was getting ready to take a shower when he started an argument with me and7forced me to give up my key and leave the home. I never returned. 

He never tried to check up on me after that. I later learned that he had s8/tuffed all of my belongings into trash bags that I could pick -*9+

up or he'd throw out. He really didn't waste any time. It was emotionally degrading. It was the zenith of many awful things he'd pulled off in the 4 years prior to that. I was grateful that I at least had my job to get me by with money.

I hastily moved in with the guy I was seeing. He lived in a bad neighborhood and my job at Burger King didn't work out. My GM was trying the best that she could as she was illiterate, herself, but I was working 50 hours or more and could not get the help on shifts that I so desperately needed. I had to leave after a manager took it upon herself to ""help"" me with my shift and ended up getting into a fight with my only cook. I made her leave after that, assuring her that I would handle everything just fine. What I didn't expect was my cook leaving after that. He basically decided that even though I tried to remedy the situation, he needed to prove a point and so he went home. I was terrified as I was by myself in the store. Per the previous meetings I had with my GM, she insisted that I needed to call her if ANYTHING went awry at night in the restaurant. I called her numbers. No answer. Called them again. Straight to voicemail. Called other employees. One showed up about 2 hours later. We did the best we could until the morning shift showed up. I never looked back after that. I thought that there had to be something better. 

I'll save you the time and just say that the next 3 years were very rocky. I often wondered if I would be like this forever. That my destiny was the scrape by on the bottom. With no support system other than my boyfriend. It was a horribly depressing existence. I was near suicide about 2 years after having been kicked out. Things ended up not working out with my boyfriend. I felt so isolated.

The turning point in my life was Spring 2013. I was watching the free basic cable in my apartment. I had an 8-month-old at the time. I was working for a staffing agency and working no shortage of temp jobs. When one job ended, another began. So I was home with my baby and watching basic cable when one of those commercials came on about technical colleges and vocational programs. I knew I had to do something different to elevate myself into the life I wanted. I knew that those were for-profit schools and I was scared of it all being a scam but I think I was even more scared that I would continue on the same path that I had been on. So, I trepidatiously sent in a request for information to the closest technical college to me. And it all happened so fast after that. 

I wanted to take it all slow, but they made me accelerate. They got me in. They got me financial aid. I started class in 3 weeks. Then I started my internship as a medical assistant 9 months later. Then I got hired out of that internship to a medical facility for approximately 3 years. I got me and my family more money per paycheck than I had ever earned in my life at that point. We had medical insurance. I started antidepressants. I met a guy that I am crazy for and had a new addition to my family. I moved into a better neighborhood. 

The unfortunate thing about this job is that things eventually went sour because of toxic work environment things and rampant bullying. BUT, even more crazy is that I found my dream job out of all this. 

2 weeks before I had any inkling that I would leave my job, on a random Sunday I put out my resume for a job that was extremely similar to mine. With no expectation of getting a call. Then the situation at my clinic reached a fever pitch and I ended up leaving which all took place on a Friday. On Monday, I received a call. 

I never thought that I would be here. I passed the interviews and I'm working towards passing my 6-month probationary period. I work for the state, have excellent benefits and I couldn't ask for anything better. The team I work for actually likes me. It's just, magical. 

And people say magic doesn't exist. I just have no words.

For the first time in a very long time, I feel as though I'm in an emotionally healthy place. I feel like I'm becoming healthy. And I'm insanely happy. "

I'm going to be moving into a 2br/2ba condo on April 1st. The place is a block and a half away from the lake in Oakland on the Lakeshore side, and has a deck with a partial lake view It's five minutes from the Lucky on foot and fifteen minutes away from the Lake Merritt BART station.

Utilities will be PG&amp;E and internet -- water and sewer are included. Utilities will be about $100-110 a month (PG&amp;E is $50-70 a month, depending on usage), and internet will be about $30-40 a month apiece.

You'll have the apartment to yourself a good portion of the time on weekends, as my girlfriend is in law school at Stanford, and I spend many weekends with her on the peninsula. She'll be living in the apartment over the summer for an internship, at which point we'll split the utilities 3 ways.

Let me know if you have questions! I'm going to be setting up appointments to show it this Saturday (3/3) in the afternoon.

80ao86,22,2018-02-26,Alex and Izzie - From the perspective of an Izzie and (A/I) fan.,GreenAwareness,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/80ao86/alex_and_izzie_from_the_perspective_of_an_izzie/,"I can't stand Jolex anymore (they were cute in the beginning) so I rewatched the show and realized that we've all been too hard on Izzie.

I can definitely say that IN MY OPINION, Izzie and Alex were one of the top 3 great love stories of Grey's Anatomy.

People seem to forget that Izzie HAD her reservations about Alex because she met ""Evil Spawn"" Alex, who cheated on her and broke her heart. It's easy to say Jo loves Alex and that's undeniable while Izzie's love for Alex is questioned. Of course, Izzie helped make Alex the man he became when Jo met him. She got the baby loving, mature Alex Karev.

It seems like nobody gives Izzie enough credit for pushing through and making sure Alex became the best version of himself. Nobody gives credit for Izzie actually showing the other interns that there WAS a good side to Alex. Remember the first time Mer tells Izzie: ""I believe you, I believe Alex is a good person"". Izzie really believed in him when literally nobody did.

As for the Denny storyline, well, I never saw that as a great love story at all. Denny was the only male that saw Izzie as a great doctor and a good looking women. He treated her as Dr. Stevens and never discriminated her the way so many (including Alex) had done in the past. He loved her for her and she wanted to save him but for me it speaks VOLUMES that when Denny dies, the most touching and impactful scene is when Alex picks her up in that dress. 

George/Izzie is not even worth mentioning because I think that was just sloppy writting but Izzie's care and love for Alex is shown AGAIN when they come full circle and we see Izzie conforting Alex after Ava just how he had done to her when Denny died.

IMO, Season 5 was epic. I loved how the cancer storyline made the cringey ghost Denny makes sense. I love how Izzie makes it clear more than once that Alex Karev is the man she loves. When Bailey tells her that it's normal that she only sees Denny because he's the man she loves. Her response is immediate: no, I see Denny because he represents death. I loved Denny but when I see my story now, my present, my future, Alex Karev is the man I love. My future is with Alex, so get Denny out of my mind (as in the tumor). She wanted Denny to go so she could be with Alex. For me that was not choosing Alex as second, but choosing Alex as first. Izzie could have chosen to stay with the tumor and die and see Denny and be with Denny but she chose to fight - and she chose to fight for Karev. 

Their wedding episode, Izzie makes it clear again that that was the happiest day of her life. Marrying Alex was the happiest day of her life. 

As for her departure, I honestly think Shonda blew it but I can even understand her side of the story. She had a horrible cancer, her best friend died, she was fired from the hospital. It's was a bad decision but she came back a few episodes later. She came back with plans about moving to a hospital near Alex and building their life together. She was so sure of that. She wanted that life with Alex and she was going to make it work.

I understand how some of you think it was amazing when Alex stood up and told Izzie to leave because he deserved better - yeah in some ways he did. BUT, Izzie was willing to put the work into making their marriage work and ultimately it was Alex who begged her to leave. Izzie said that losing the love of her life was worse than losing her career. 

Izzie's ending scene actually also shows that she's not the manipulative/selfish person some fans make her out to be. Meredith got her back at Seattle Grace - probably the best hospital she could work for after her history and she turned it down. She selflessly turned it down because she knew that's what Alex wanted. She went away for a few episodes, but she came back. She didn't really leave Alex, Alex basically forced her to leave. I believe she thought letting him go was the best way she could show how much she loved him. 

Of course the whole backstage drama on the show didn't help but I think so many are in love with Karev (so am I) that's it's hard to see Izzie's side of the story. I will remain hopeful there might be a reunion. Heigl is a LOT more mature now, has apologized to Shonda 100x. BUT, she did not have a job so Shonda may have no fully believed she wanted to truly come back. But now that she is going to have a big part on ""Suits"" and be back on a primetime show... maybe Shonda will believe her is she's still open to returning.

I mean, we lost MerDer, Slexie... at least Izzie is still alive. Can they give us that closure? Because Jo just isn't cutting it. I'm open to shipping MerAlex at this point. 

Would love to hear thoughts and opinions. "
80aoll,12,2018-02-26,My nails become super flaky after any time I wear polish. What could be causing it?,kinezumi89,RedditLaqueristas,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/80aoll/my_nails_become_super_flaky_after_any_time_i_wear/,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this sub, and definitely not a nail polish aficionado. I searched the sub for tips about flaky nails, but my problem isn't that my nails are *always* flaky, which is what the majority of the posts were about. After I remove nail polish, the edges of my nails split, and I have to wait several weeks to months for the split area to grow out enough so I can trim the whole thing off (otherwise it just keeps splitting upwards). I'm tired of having to keep my nails so short, and having to wait so long in between polishes!

These are a few ideas I have about what could be the culprit. Please let me know if you agree with any, or if you have any other ideas.

1) I usually don't use a base coat. I bought one (Sally Hansen Big Peel-Off Base Coat), but only used it once. I don't know if it's because of the base coat, or because I tried using a really old polish, but it never got hard, and was squishy all the next day (the first day of my internship; great, lol), so by the end of the day my nails were covered in dents and smudges and looked atrocious. Is this known to be a bad product, or was it my old polish? Also, does not using a base coat cause flaky nails? I would have thought at worse it would harm the longevity of the polish.

2) I use normal nail polish remover to take it off. Maybe it's really drying, and there's something better I should be using?

3) Could cheap nail polish cause flaky nails? I'll admit I just use ""Sinful Colors"" because it's cheapish at the grocery store (I have no idea how garbagey it is, but it seems to work well enough and lasts at least a week without chipping).

I do put lotion on my hands every night (though I don't make a point to target my fingernails), I try to drink plenty of water, take a multivitamin every day, and my job doesn't involve me getting my hands dirty/wet/chemical-y (I'm a grad student lol, I'm at a computer all day). 

Any ideas would be great! I saw in some old posts that people recommended OPI Nail Envy, but then I saw it has formaldehyde in it, so I'm no 100% it's something I want to go for. Any product suggestions would also be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your help :)"
80as2n,1,2018-02-26,Does the frequent bragging mean anything?,Help_Me_Reddit01,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/80as2n/does_the_frequent_bragging_mean_anything/,"I’ve been texting a classmate for a few days and it’s  kind of turned into talking. 

He showed interest in me probably 2-3 years ago he always made sex jokes..But I just blew it all off. He graduated in December. We were both on Tinder and he messaged me and said wow you’re the last person I’d expect to see on here! (I question it myself why I’m on there). 

We’ve been talking pretty consistently. We had plans to hang out last night and watch movies but I backed out. There’s a piece of me skeptical about his intentions meanwhile he tried to lay them out. He really just wants to see how things end up. His answer to it all was, let’s just hang out, eat food and do fun stuff. If feelings arise, they arise. 

I talked to people who know him better than I do and they all said he’s really an all around good dude. 

Anyways we would both have very very very dominant personalities. It’s funny because I always thought he was the biggest dick meanwhile we’re probably the exact same. 

- He’s brought up 900 times now that he’s a business analyst intern they pay him 45k per year doing that. But he’s moving to full time in a few months then he’ll make 60-70k. 
- He told me that he absolutely loves kids and used to work with them as a summer job and was really good with them. 
- he told me right now his parents allow him to occupy an entire floor of his house. But he’s moving out soon and buying a brand new car 
- he bragged about the things he’s good at in bed
- he texted me out of the blue today and said I just ripped my pants at the gym. Followed by a video of him squatting. He mentioned that his ass is already huge and I said I never noticed tbh. He was taken back and said wow you haven’t? 


Does the bragging mean he’s *probably* genuinely interested? "

80axuz,2,2018-02-26,Advice for Internship Hiring?,ichibanson,tmobile,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/80axuz/advice_for_internship_hiring/,"I am an electrical engineering student going to a hiring event in the near future, and I'm doing research into TMobile and its current technologies, but I really want to intern here, any advice for getting hired or making an impression?"
80b264,1,2018-02-26,"Future career, goals, and life seem pointless. (m, 23)",SmolestBenis,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/80b264/future_career_goals_and_life_seem_pointless_m_23/,"Hi.
So, for the last few years, I have felt like I'm slipping farther and farther down a slope that I cant find a handhold to grab on to. I'll try not to take too long with my story and explanations because I know people have it worse/heard it all before. But I have had a dream job career goal since my mid-teens. It seemed out of reach and I told myself it would probably never happen. But as I hit my late teens and early twenties, Working in a warehouse for 60 hours a week was making me miserable and I decided to take the leap and begin an internship (Unpaid). I moved out of state and unfortunately, back in with my parents seeing as it lined up that way. The internship was ok. Not as much as I had hoped but I met some interesting people and learned some valuable lessons. My plan was to have my portfolio and resume done and ready to send off to potential employers shortly after its conclusion. It is, however, 6 months to a year since its end, I can not make myself get ANYTHING towards it. A large part of it may have been a large family conflict that happened. I was still not doing much towards it but since then it feels like I have just internally given up and my rational side is an onlooker, watching me waste my time and life. I am passionate about the work I would be doing if I got the job I want someday, but I'm starting to think and or fall into the mindset that I should just give up and that its not for me and never was and me being able to explain it in this way but do nothing about it is infuriating... I have an amazing girlfriend who moved with me to go through this ordeal so I could pursue my dreams. We are both stuck living with my parents with multiple other issues such as our dog being confined to one room in the house which I have to stay in with her at all/most times. I'm currently back working a warehouse job here in the new state, just to try and save enough to move out of here somehow. The plan was to do so when I got my job. But I have nothing to show for anything. I feel like in the game of life I just skipped everything and ended up as a loser.

80b9ib,0,2018-02-26,Should I retake,A_FAPPING_PANDA,Mcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/80b9ib/should_i_retake/,"Hello r/MCAT I have been a lurker here for a while and given that my score was released 2/23/18 I figured now was the time to make the post I didn't hope I would have to make! 

Male, White/Hispanic, Colorado, GPA 3.71 (with 4.0's the last 7 semesters) science GPA 3.85 

511 (127/127/129/128) 

EC's 2 semesters College senator, 3 semesters physiology TA, 3 years biochemistry research, one second author publication, 1 summer undergraduate research at NYU school of medicine including a poster presentation where I won best presentation, 2 summers volunteering with global medical brigades in Nicaragua (~30 days abroad volunteering/ shadowing), shadowed a surgeon and ER doctor, certified EMT including one semester internship in the ER, one semester secretary for Neuroscience student organization, letters of recommendation from professor I TA'd for, professor I do research with and the head of cardiology at NYU who's lab I worked in over the summer. I probably forgot some EC's but I got the big ones. 

I would appreciate any advice on retakes/ schools I should be applying for/competitive at. Very disappointed with this MCAT score as my AAMC FL's were 514/516/515 respectively, but retaking the MCAT sounds absolutely dreadful. 

Sorry if this isn't following all of the posting guidelines/rules as I have never posted here and I am posting from my phone. Thanks r/MCAT. "
80bhar,0,2018-02-26,Shortlisting the right B schools. Things to remember,Akash_Mahurkar,businessschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/businessschool/comments/80bhar/shortlisting_the_right_b_schools_things_to/,"Have taken your GMAT? Are you happy with the score? Then, it is the time to shortlist the colleges you want to apply for. There are many aspects that you need to consider before shortlisting or applying for any B-school. 
So, where do you start? What are the things you need to consider? Are you aiming too high or too low? What are best colleges for you? Can you afford an MBA at a particular college? We know you would have more questions than answers at this stage. 
You might get lured into applying for colleges which your friends or peers are applying for or the colleges your MBA Consultant is insisting you to apply. This is definitely not a “one size fits all” situation. A college that is right for your peer, who scored the same at GMAT as you, may not be right for you. This could be because of various reasons such as different interests, financing options, strengths and weaknesses, travelling situation etc.
We have made a checklist for you that will help you remember important parameters while shortlisting any B-school.
Your GMAT Score:
The most popular and conventional method of shortlisting colleges according to your GMAT score is categorizing colleges into three different pools i.e. safe, reach and stretch. 
Every B School has an average acceptance GMAT score. You need to make a decision by comparing your GMAT score against these average acceptance scores. The following should be the variations of your score for the colleges of the three categories. 
Safe: Higher than the acceptance score.
Reach: Within 20 points of the Acceptance score range.
Stretch: less than 30 points of the Acceptance score.
Try to keep a right balance of colleges from all the categories. You would not want to be too ambitious and unrealistic. At the same time, you wouldn’t want to be too calculative and lose out on better opportunities.
Your Interests:  
Ultimately, your career interests and aspirations should drive you to choose the right college. Every college has its strengths and flagship programs. For example: If you are interested in pursuing a career in finance, shortlist colleges which have a solid curriculum and placement opportunities in finance.


Location:
Especially for international students, location of the B-school plays a major role in their journey. While zeroing in on a location there are many things you need to consider. The following are things to consider while choosing a location:
•	Climate and living conditions
•	Cost of living
•	Industries that are concentrated in and around the area
•	Time of your stay.
•	Future career prospects in the location
•	Availability of essential amenities
Placements: 
The primary reason for anyone to do an MBA is to give a boost to one’s career. Do extensive research about the placements that a B-school offers, the kind of placements did the previous batch students got etc.
You also need to look at the return on investment these jobs would give you. If you are paying way too much as tuition fees to the B-school when compared to the pay packages that the placements are giving, then applying for that B-school might not be worth it.
Finance and Travel: 
Cost of your MBA is a vital aspect you need to consider while shortlisting B-schools. Do thorough research on the kind of financing options the school provides, the type of scholarships offered and the paid assistance and internship opportunities you would have access to.
For International students it is very important to consider your travel arrangements to a particular country. You may want to reconsider applying to B-schools/ Universities in countries that have major restrictions on immigration. "
80bpgi,6,2018-02-26,#GEIX [Glamorgan and Gwent] - /u/Cenarchos launches his campaign in Caerffili,Cenarchos,MHoCCampaigning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MHoCCampaigning/comments/80bpgi/geix_glamorgan_and_gwent_ucenarchos_launches_his/,"*Earlier today, /u/Cenarchos of the Liberal Democrats launched his campaign in **Caerffili** to a crowd of Liberal Democrat supporters, and those who wished to stay in the Single Market. A well known name in Wales due to his extensive campaigning to remain in the Single Market, /u/Cenarchos drew in local Welsh media outlets to cover his launch.*

*Being hosted at Virginia Park, /u/Cenarchos spoke to a sizable crowd.*

&gt;”Friends, today I announce my intention on running in Glamorgan and Gwent, on the Liberal Democrat ticket. I could not be here without the love and support my family, and friends have given me. I would like to offer my sincere love, and thanks, to my biggest supporters.”

&gt;”Many of you will know me as an ardent supporter of the Single Market. Wales voted overwhelming to remain in the Single Market. I campaigned hard for Wales, and poured my love for our country into that campaign. While England voted to leave, Wales did not. **WE** voted to stay, and overwhelmingly. We in the Liberal Democrats will continue this fight: and we will FIGHT for Wales!”

*The crowd applauds this*

&gt;”The Tories have failed Wales. Their failed budget, and failed leadership have caused Wales to be hit hard. I am no friend of the Tories, as I have helped other parties develop bases to challenge the Tories this General Election. For as long as the Tories control house, Wales will see it suffer with job loss and economic instability.”

&gt;”We, the people in Wales who don’t live in the **big cities** are often forgotten about by the Tories. Their tax plans, which included raising tax, would have impacted Wales in such a negative way. Many in Wales already struggle to get by. We in the Liberal Democrats have a balanced approach to the economy, as well as a balanced approach to the government. With sensible economic ideas (such as lowering tax - not raising it), we will put more money into the pockets of the Welsh.”

*The crowd cheers at this.*

&gt;”This is why we needed to remain in the Single Market. For the good of Wales, we must continue to struggle against the single minded forces in Westminster who ***REFUSE*** to acknowledge the economic dependability some areas in the United Kingdom have on the Single Market: The great nation of Wales being one!”

*The crowd applauds this, many begin to chant, “WE WANT OUR JOBS!”*

&gt;”Wales needs a liberal voice to represent it in the House. I know many of you are, or were, Green Party supporters. I have respect for the Green Party, and the causes they fight for. However, they simply have been unable to continue this fight in house. Losing some MPs almost allowed that disastrous budget to pass: only with LibDem and Labour fighting for us did the budget fail. We will provide you a voice you can trust in Westminster, and one that arrives.”

&gt;”To my old Plaid Cymru friends, we fought to remain in the Single Market. However, attempting to leave the Union will only cause more economic hardships on Wales. Does Wales deserve more autonomy? You’re damn right we do, but we also need the Kingdom to provide us with economic opportunity.”

&gt;”I urge my old supporters to reconsider this stance. We need to distance ourselves from notions of independence, in exchange for mutual cooperation. The Tories will ignore you, but we will not. Together we can march towards a brighter future, one full of economic promise and liberalism. Where people of all creeds can hold hands, and work together.”

*The crowd claps at this.*

&gt;”I believe we should lower sin tax. This negatively impacts those who are most vulnerable in society. The tax does not stop alcoholics from drinking: it simply prevents them from eating. This is totally unacceptable. In order to combat alcoholism, we need to develop better social care programs. The Liberal Democrats stand for aiding those in society who most need it, and so do I.”

&gt;”We in the Liberal Democrats cannot do this alone. We need the assistance of people like you. People who want to go out there and assist us in giving Wales a Liberal Voice. It will be a hard campaign, but with your support we can make Wales a better place for all! Join my campaign, and the Liberal Democrat movement. We can secure a bright future.”

*/u/Cenarchos left the stage, with two of his personal aides. Speaking to the people who came out to hear his launch, /u/Cenarchos and his aides attempted to convince people to join as volunteers to the Liberal Democrats.*

*Speaking to a small group of around thirty people, /u/Cenarchos made his case to them:*

&gt;”I ran two campaigns in my political career: one in Scotland, and one in Wales for the Single Market. We approached both campaign from a grassroots perspective. Volunteers will join me on the campaign trail, where will we actually work together. All volunteers can interact with me, and join in political discussion.”

*One of the students spoke to /u/Cenarchos*

&gt;”Will you provide references for us? Like, if I wanted to join the Party as an intern at a later date, do you provide letters of reference?”

*/u/Cenarchos responded,*

&gt;”Of course. All volunteers will get a personalized letter of reference from me. While I cannot take everyone on as an intern, I will most certainly help anyone who volunteers continue their political activism: be it with the Liberal Democrats or another party. Though, I may be disappointed if you join the Tories.”

*/u/Cenarchos and the group had a light laugh,*

80e5n5,1,2018-02-26,Lewinsky is right.,TheQuietMan,bestofthefray,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofthefray/comments/80e5n5/lewinsky_is_right/,"her affair with Clinton is [problematic](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/26/politics/monica-lewinsky-me-too/index.html).  I'll go further, and say now, it is more than problematic.

Let me be the first to say that back then, given both sides said it was consensual, I really didn't have that much problem with it.  Apparently, I've devolved from that position.

Here I am now saying their mutual consent isn't good enough.  I'll go further - even if she was the instigator of the relationship, the power he had over her due to his position, should have made him back away.

The consent she gave to him is undermined by the direct power he had over her. Her *consent* wasn't consent.

She did nothing wrong.  Even if she were the aggressor, going after a married man - well she hasn't violated any obligations.  He, on the other hand, had an obligation to his wife; and to his intern.

Please understand I know that office affairs and relationships are commonplace.  That's not the point.  

Also, let's acknowledge the degree of wrongness varies case by case.  Clinton hitting on a reluctant Lewinsky is different than them mutually hooking up (as appears to have happened).

Let's also acknowledge in any pairing one will earn more than the other, or reach greater heights, or achieve more.  We are roughly, not exactly, equal.

Still, like deceit, power can undermine consent.

80fozi,1,2018-02-26,How do I get my life together?,SlowDirection,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/80fozi/how_do_i_get_my_life_together/,"So, I am currently a junior, a third year computer science major. I'm 21. I never had a boyfriend , have low grades, no internship experience, and have few friends. Most of my friends graduated or transferred. 


I rushed in fall 2016 and fall 2017. I rushed 3 sororities and everyone liked me. Even nowadays, whenever they see me, they say hi to me or hang out with me if they have the time. 

I was cut both times since I have a low gpa. They told me that I was welcome to return once I got my grades up. I currently have a GPA of 2.4 and I need a 2.5-2.6 to rush. 

I have not been doing well in my classes due to depression and deciding if my major (computer science) is right for me. Not only I hate math, but I faced passive aggressive comments for being a woman in computer science. 

I most likely won't graduate next year, and may spend an extra 1-2 years, especially if I change my major. My parents pay for my dorm fees, but they are annoyed with my grades and may make me commute for the remaining of college. 

I also feel down about never having a boyfriend, or having sex/never dating while a lot of my friends have / had relationships. 

What should I do, if I rush, especially if I rush in my last year/semester of college? How do i get my grades up? I just envy my friends in sororities and how they have blooming social lives, great careers, and even amazing boyfriends/husbands. My guy friend (23M) says his fraternity and new girlfriend HELPED him get his grades up and regrets joining at 22 and not sooner. 

TL;DR: Never had a boyfriend at 21, have bad grades and got cut from sororities due to bad grades (but encouraged to return). What should I do?"

I quit my job about a week ago becuase I had applied to get an internship (with lower pay) in digital marketing. I am studying to be a web developer and I thought it would go well.

About a week ago I applied to a job at my school with much higher pay. I went into work in the morning to the digital marketing job (my third day working there) and was miserable the whole time. I had been contemplating leaving even on the first day but stuck it out until the third. Then I sent in an email and just quit because I couldn't handle it any more. 

That morning, I had gone into the interview at my school and felt really good about it. They called back on Friday that I was in for the second round of interviews that are on Wednesday. I was feeling okay this whole weekend, even though I was jobless. I live with my parents so thankfully this isn't life ending.

But I come to class today and someone in my group is saying that he wont be here at class on Wednesday because he is interviewing on the second round of interviews for a position. What really makes this terrible is that he applied for an internship in a nearby city as well as I did and I asked my teacher who had a better chance of getting it and my teacher said I was basically bottom of the barrel and this other guy was much better.

So now I am going to get beaten for this job, be unemployed, and still work with the guy who beat me. I am just feeling really anxious and I needed to type something out I guess. I dont know what I am going to do about this at all. I hope I can find another job, I am concerned that my dad is going to be really disappointed in me. And it seems like I am going into an episode of depression because I dont have a job and that really scares me. My mom says she has a good feeling about this but that doesn't mean anything.

She acutally gave me some type of cannabis extract that I can drink that is supposed to help calm me down and I almost took it, it is sitting in my backpack and I am in class right now. But I am scared that is admitting defeat. And my sister with Bipolar told me yesterday that she thinks I have bipolar as well and I dont want to have that, I want to be good and not broken. I just want to succeed and not be on medication and worry about side effects and judgement. Like what if I gain weight? What happens if I break out? What happens if it becomes a thing that I never can get rid of?

This is all just so overwhelming, I have so much to learn in school and people are always talking about such high level concepts that I have no clue about. Time is moving so quickly but I cant muster the energy to do what I need to do. I had the whole weekend to work on a website but instead I just played Skyrim with the lights off because it was nice. I love the music, I love running around, I just like not thinking about how my life is crushing me and I have too much to do.

I am sorry for the word throw-up, I am in class trying to breathe and not panic because I dont want to cry in front of my class and have to leave early since I wasnt even in class last week and probably missed a ton of important information. Thank you for reading even if you dont respond. And I didnt spell check or reread any of this so sorry if I mispelled or wrote incomplete sentences or didnt make any sense.

Thank you"

---

##Overview
###Role: Defense
""Imiter excels at controlling flanking routes and eliminating flanking enemies. The combination of speed and high damage melees allows Imiter to dominate close-quarter engagements, while its smoke-screen ability and unconventional mobility make extremely difficult for enemies to predict its movement. The signature mimic ability allows Imiter to get close to enemies and cause major havoc.""

##Abilities

###Gauss Rifle
Imiter's gauss rifle is a short-range stun dealer, making it more difficult for damaged enemies to escape.

###Smoke-Screen
Imiter releases a smoke cloud that blocks line of sight and all targeting abilities for allies who remain within it.

###Mimic
Imiter activates its hard-light technologies and forms a lifelike projection of an enemy hero around itself, assuming their appearance. Mimic is indistinguishable from the enemy hero until he attacks or takes damage.

###Ultimate: Clonestorm
Imiter unleashes its full hard-light capabilities and creates two copies of each friendly hero within its line of sight. Each clone acts independently until it takes damage, but they deal no damage.

###Passive: Creeper
When crouched Imiter begins crawling on all four appendages. While crawling Imiter creates less noise, moves more quickly, deals more damage with melees, and can traverse walls and ceilings for a limited time

##Story

**Real Name:**
OTL Infiltrator Automaton, Unknown Design Model, ""Imiter""

**Age**:
27

**Occupation**:
Infiltrator Automaton

**Base of Operations**:
Unknown

**Affiliation**:
Unknown

---

The presence of this infiltrator Omnic unit in current times is known with certainty only to a handful of the world's top investigators, in order to quell the public's fears of Omnics. Those who know of it, fear its capabilities.

The infiltrator unit was built during the Omnic Crisis as a spy and insurgency drone that was incapable of independent thought, so to prevent information of its intention being revealed if captured. The unit was believed either to be one of many or to be highly active across the globe. Sightings confirmed that the design was capable of manipulating hard-light technology from its chassis and project the image of any normal sized humanoid figure around its body, effectively being able to impersonate any human being of similar stature. This allowed it to creep into cities and populations that were thought to have been secure from Omnic attack. It has been seen to escape from scenes of its inflicted devastation within clouds of smoke, often crawling along surfaces in a spider-like fashion.

Today, with the memories of the Omnic Crisis in the past, the world thinks that it safe from the terror that was the Infiltrator unit. But some know better. Sightings of the dreaded Omnic have been rumoured, although it has never attacked a public place since the Crisis. How it functions despite the Omniums being inactive is unknown. Some theories say that it is under a new command, while others suspect that it has become sentient. It is also theorised the unit goes by the name ""Imiter"", the name that is now accompanied on walls and surfaces near areas of its sightings. Indifferent to how it operates, there is no denying that the Infiltrator known as Imiter can very well be in any crowd, or in any shadow.

Hey yo, I see you made it this far. I'm really glad to have you down here because this is where we can enter the detailed, nitty-gritty part of each aspect of the hero. I'll try to keep each piece in this format when I can:

1. The aspect's in-depth functionality
2. The statistics of the aspect
3. Why I chose this aspect, why I've set certain stats like they are, and how this interacts with the gameplay  

Before we do that though, I'll include some more general statistics about the hero just below this, so you can keep scrolling if you want to find out how much health the hero has, or its movement speed or whatever.

So here we dive into the first part: **What role should this hero fill?**

----

**So KaylasDream, what should I do with this new hero you're giving me?**

Well, I sure am glad you asked me, hypothetical Redditor! You see, when I was watching some of Overwatch's eSport the other day, specifically the Overwatch League, I noticed an obvious trend in tactics: *Flanking*. And boy, was there a lot of it. Tracer flanking the healers, Genji always being on the sides of the enemy, Sombra being all invisible and stuff. It was strange to watch because often we overlook how the Defending side is supposed to be able to, well, defend itself. Yet the defending team doesn't have any capabilities in terms of heroes who can actually defend from the biggest threat: Flanking. And so I thought: ""Whuuuuuut? Why would Blizzard overlook this? How could they overlook this?"". And so here I am, after some brainstorming and caffeine, I bring you this fella: Imiter.

**Well that's great and all Kayla, but what do I do with this Imiter stranger?**

Alright, let's get down to it. Let's say you're playing defence on any map. You want to pick Imiter because you think they're going to play a flanker like Tracer, Genji, or Sombra, or anyone who might be alone or isolated. You know that annoying side passage flanking route that exists on every single map, at every single point? You should position yourself there, or in fact anywhere except choke points and high traffic areas. Ideally, you should be hiding on walls and ceilings and be using the smoke-screen ability to confuse enemies, and then take advantage of the creeper passive ability's damage to potentially 2/3-hit the enemy. 

---

Here are those basic statistics I promised!


|  |  | 
---|---|---|----
^^^^^don't ^^^^^read ^^^^^me ^^^^^pls | **Regular** | **Creeping** | **Mimic**
**Health** | 200 | 200 | 250
**-Of which is armour** | 0 | 0 | 0
**-Of which is shields** | 0 | 0 | 50
**Movement Speed** | 5.5 | 6.5 | 5.5
**Damage (per hit)** | 35 | - | -
**Melee Damage (per hit)** | 30 | 60 | -

Hope these stats give a good general idea to the casual observer.

---

Ability breakdown time!
-
So let's begin!
###Gauss Rifle
The gauss rifle is overall just a really useful primary fire for situations where you just can't close the distance fast enough. The gauss rifle is an arcing projectile launcher, similar to Tobjorn's rivet gun. The size of Imiter's ammunition clip is 18. It's also important to note that while creeping or using mimic, Imiter cannot use the gauss rifle.


 | 
---|---
*Gauss Rifle*  | **Single Shot**
**Ammo** | 18 per clip
**Damage** | 10 - 35
**Firing time**  | 0.4 sec
**Effective DPS** | 25 - 87.5
**Reload time** | 1.8 sec
[Here is a graph that shows the damage drop](https://imgur.com/a/8Rmmr)    

So there it is. The Gauss Rifle. This was pretty hard for me to balance, as I wanted to find a middle ground between Soldier:76 and McCree, but I didn't want Imiter to be centred around its damage output. The primary fire should essentially be a close range engagement tool, with enough damage output to contribute to team engagements while lacking the consistent long-range damage to sustain the engagement.


###Smoke-Screen
Smoke-screen is a really versatile ability, for a couple of reasons. The easiest way to imagine its functionality is to picture it as a construct, similar to Mei's ice wall. You can walk in and out of this construct, but it blocks line-of-sight through it. The shape is a circular area with a radius of six meters, and once you walk inside of it or you are positioned on the other side of it a player won't be able to use a targeted lock-on ability to that respective player. Similarly, you won't be able to use a lock-on or aim-assisted ability. So this means that Tactical Visor, Deadeye, Nano-boost, and other abilities like them are ineffective against and for players blocked by smoke-screen and are unusable inside of it.

 | 
---|---
*Smoke-screen* | 
**Casting time** | 0.5 sec
**Radius** | 6 m
**Duration** | 6 sec
**Cooldown** | 12 sec*

Smoke-screen is pretty interesting as it is a good offensive ult, as it can sustain or turn a team fight by forcing the enemy team to either back-off or dive through it. It works on solo offensives that might come up with its playstyle and is excellent in masking movement to close in on enemies

###Mimic
Mimic is a lock-on ability and requires an enemy to be in range and in line-of-sight. The ability can also be used on enemy corpses. After completing the cast, Imiter's appearance changes to that of the targeted player. The player is indistinguishable from the regular hero and appears to be holding the primary weapon of the selected hero, for example, a mimicked Mercy will appear to be holding the Caduceus Staff. While using mimic, Imiter cannot:

* Fire its weapon
* Use smoke-screen 
* Enter creeper mode or crouch
* Use its Ultimate
* Receive any kind of buff, heal, or modification from the enemy team

Please note, that Imiter cannot use any ability of the mimicked hero. When Imiter fires his weapon, uses smoke-screen, or uses its ultimate, it exits the mimic. This is similar to Sombra's invisibility. While using mimic, Imiter gains 50 health in shields. These shields act as the damage pool Imiter can receive from enemies before being forced out of the mimic ability. While mimicked, Imiter appears to be glowing blue to its teammates. 

 | 
---|---
*Mimic* | 
**Casting time** | 4 sec
**Duration** | 30 sec
**Cooldown** | 18 sec

This is the main event folks! The character-defining ability. Mimic is entirely unique to Overwatch, and I believe that if it is implemented properly can be one of the strongest abilities in the game. I am super excited about this ability, and I really would like feedback on it. Off the bat, I realize that Mimic has a very long duration. The reasoning behind this is so that Imiter has ample time to use the ability, even to use it off an enemy corpse and then infiltrate the enemy as they return from spawn. The 30 seconds allows the player to really move around while being unable to use abilities, and wait for the perfect time to reveal or disengage. When this gets combined with the goal to shut down flankers, the experience should become marvellous as Imiter walks alongside the enemy Tracer while masquerading as their Mercy. This ability does have counter-plays, the most obvious of which is mimicked hero seeing a clone of themselves. The enemy could accidentally damage their 'teammate' and notice that they take damage. They can also notice that they aren't using abilities. But the easiest counter to Imiter's mimic is good comms. If a team can pick up that there's something out of place and communicate it, the 50 shields are not going to help Imiter when the entire enemy turns on it. But when a team is trying to push and they have to focus on their enemy, they aren't going to really notice that their McCree isn't shooting or that their Zenyatta isn't discording. But really, I want to hear your thoughts! 

###Ultimate: Clonestorm
Clonestorm is centred around extreme confusion and counter-intel. Imiter tracks all teammates within line-of-sight and then creates two fake versions of them. These fakes spawn close to Imiter, and they act with basic AI bot movement. They do not have any health to them, and will subsequently disappear if they receive damage. They cannot be affected by movement-altering abilities, like Orisa's Halt, Junkrat's Steel Trap, or Zarya's Graviton Surge. They can be targeted by enemy abilities, such as Orb of Discord, Tactical Visor or Deadeye. The ultimate lasts for 20 seconds, after which any remaining clones disappear.

 | 
---|---
*Clonestorm* | 
**Casting time** | 1 sec
**Duration** | 20 sec
**Range** | LOS

We're nearly done, fellas. Clonestorm is an excellent disruptor tool. If an enemy is not already tracking *every* enemy, they're going to have a hard time selecting targets. There's not much else to add. I'm unsure of how a game server might handle this ability, as suddenly up to 10 new entities have to be added to the game. But it is not my job to code! Its the poor intern at Blizzard, and we thank you duly, sir/madam. Again, feedback is much appreciated. Clonestorm was the last ability to be added, and I am very willing to change it to whatever suggestion would rather suit the hero's kit best.

###Passive: Creeper
Creeper is an ability that takes the place of crouching. Imiter creeps along the floor on all four limbs and is faster, quieter, and more deadly. For a limited time, Imiter can creep along walls and along the ceiling. The primary fire cannot be used while creeping, and the key binding of melee takes the place of primary fire. Smoke-screen can be used while creeping, but mimic cannot be used until Imiter stands again. 

 | 
---|---
*Creeper* | 
**Movement Speed** | 6.5 m/s
**Duration (Wall mantle)** | 24 sec
**Duration (Ceiling mantle)** | 12 sec
**Cooldown** | 0 sec
**Damage (melee)** | 60
**Melee Cooldown** | 0.5 sec

So here is the other defining feature of Imiter: It's super creepy wall-crawl. This is an extremely versatile movement ability and blends nicely into Imiter's character and kit. The ability works extremely well when duelling with isolated flankers, as the increased movement speed and quieter travel, combined with the third-dimension the wall and ceiling mantle provides, all come together for the ultimate ambushing machine. The increased damage and hit rate mean that it can be preferred to use Creeper and go for melee strikes over using the regular Gauss Rifle. This also has synergy with smoke-screen, so it prevents accurate distance shooting when Imiter needs to get up close. It also solidifies the Gauss Rifle's place as a finisher, as the short-range burst damage is useful after landing 2-3 melee strikes.

---

And there you have it! That's Imiter! Thank you for getting this far, this has really been in the works for a while. I'm glad that I'm finally writing this last part, for you guys to read if you've come all the way. As is my tradition for concepts, I'm going to list my humorous rejected ideas, abilities, and additions. And after that my short thanks.

---

##Rejections
* Gauss Rifle was initially a long-range projectile weapon. I had to fix that as I realized that we shouldn't have another damn sniper in the game.
* For a long time, Imiter was referred to as ""he"". I wanted to make the hero less human though, and more creepy-murder-machine, so in the last revision I had to wade through the entire post and find the pronouns.
* One concept of the ultimate that made it into writing was a disappearing act. Imiter would just disappear. That was it. Imiter would come back, but not much else. That made it through a first edit before I came to terms with the stupidity of it.
* Mimic used to be a lot more powerful. *A LOT* more. Imiter used to be able to use all the mimicked heroes abilities, and couldn't be damaged by the enemy. Eventually, the conflicting play style forced the change, and I haven't looked back.
* Smoke-screen used to make you impervious to damage. It was essentially a deployable spawn camp though, and you can imagine how much fun that was.
* I thought that it would be cool to make it so that if you killed an enemy while creeping, you could instantly mimic them. Boy was that creepy and OP.
* Another ultimate draft was for every teammate of Imiter to mimic another enemy, or to mimic each other. That was was terribly confusing.
* Imiter used to self-detonate. Straight up, that was an ability.

I'll add more as I remember them

---
##Thanks

This is my end-of-concept thank you speech. I'll keep it brief. I want to thank caffeine and sleep deprivation. I extend a warm thank you to my bronze rank, and to my friend in plat who teases me about it. I want to express gratitude to every Overwatch League team for the memes as I watched the pro-scene for inspiration for this concept. Thank you, Jeff, I'll accept my internship at Blizzard as soon as you send it. And in all seriousness, I want to extend a thank you to Reddit Enhancement Suite for bringing this whole god damn post together. And finally, I thank whatever poor soul has made it this far.

**The Role**

UPE membrane is made using oils that need to be extracted in the manufacturing process to meet product requirements for organic contamination.  The current process for removing this oil is to spray solvent onto a roll of membrane.  After all the oil has been extracted the membrane is instead now saturated with solvent; this solvent is then removed through a vacuum dry process.  The problem with this approach is that the outside layers of membrane of a given roll are dried more quickly than the inside layers.  The difference in drying rate creates in-to-out variation in membrane properties.  The goal of this project is to reduce the in/out variability by drying all layers at the same rate.  The approach to do this will be to use a heated water spray instead of a vacuum dry process.  The act of spraying will allow the heat source (water) to be present at each layer simultaneously, rather than from the outside-in as the vacuum process does.    The heated water will provide the necessary energy to vaporize the solvent, but due to the hydrophobic nature of the membrane, it will not be wetted by the water.  This process should result in a membrane roll that is dry and free of oil, solvent and water.

 

**Project Scope:**

The engineering intern responsible for this project will perform experiments to optimize the water-dry process and prove feasibility of the concept.  The intern will work closely with a senior engineer to develop appropriate experiments and analyze the resulting data.  The intern would also be responsible for suggesting and implementing equipment upgrades to the pilot test stand.  The intern will be expected to present the findings and suggested next steps by the end of the term.

**In this role you will**

* Work closely with engineer to understand process
* Conduct experiments
* Analyze results, draw conclusions and recommend next steps for improvement
* Present final report on findings

**Traits we believe make a strong candidate**

* Appropriate applicant should be in the 3rd year of pursuing a B.S. in Chemical Engineer.
* Should have familiarity with distillation and vapor-liquid systems.
* Applicant should be mechanically competent and willing to work extensively with hands.
* Need to work with chemicals.
* Familiarity with engineering drawings, design of experiments and statistics are a plus.

80iccs,10,2018-02-26,Hello! My Living Room Home Theater Journey,mbaturin,hometheater,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/80iccs/hello_my_living_room_home_theater_journey/,"New to this subreddit so I thought I would tell my story from when I knew nothing about Home Theater Audio/Video, to now, when I know slightly more than nothing haha. 

[First, some pictures. ](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0gGrhkPxG9M0on)

Back in 2008, I was fresh out of college. I signed a 1 year lease with a buddy to live in an apartment. We had a 42"" Samsung that we hung on the wall. At that time, I had absolutely zero knowledge of anything having to do with a ""home theater,"" mainly because in my own head and without knowing, I figured a surround sound system costed a fortune. I was lucky to get a job coming off of an internship during college with the Campbell Soup Company. I still work for them and love it. Great company!

Anyways, one night, I ventured into a Best Buy and saw a 5.1 open box Yamaha home theater in a box for something like $249. I bought it. I set it up. I continued setting up through the night, finding around 4am that the A/B switch was set on B. Finally having read the manual for the 37th time, I had it up and running. Instantly hooked.

Fast forward to around 2012 when I moved into my first home with my (then) girlfriend, now wife, and I took another trip to Best Buy. There were 2 B&amp;W 684 S1 open box speakers. The set was around $700 IIRC, and I picked them up for my fronts. At home, I moved my HTIB fronts to rears and was instantly blown away by the music playing out of them in stereo, as well as their performance during movies. I also picked up a 50"" Samsung Plasma (PN50C8000) around 2012 when we moved there. We moved to the home we live in now in 2015 and that's when I really got interested in Home Theater. Though I will I'll admit I have been much more focussed on the Audio side over than Video. Specifically in the lower LFE/subwoofer region.

Over the last 2 years I have gotten rid of all the HTIB slowly and part by part. I also vastly improved my subwoofer situation, after learning of their importance and role in the overall system. I got 2 B&amp;W 685 S1s to use as side surrounds from a friend for $350 total. I started the center upgrade with a B&amp;W CM Center S2 and decided for my larger room to upgrade to the B&amp;W CM 2 S2. I got the subwoofers after doing A LOT of research on AVSForum and even using the Rythmik LV12R first before sending it back to upgrade. I learned a ton about PEQ and how to use REW. I often play and experiment with my system to ensure I'm getting the best sound I can out of it. I got into Tactile Transducers and now have a great tactile experience as well! Most recently, I purchased a 65"" LG OLED (B7A) to replace the Samsung Plasma which spontaneously popped a black line onto the screen a few weeks ago. Let's just say the projector hasn't come down much recently. 

Here is my 7.2.4 ""Living Room"" Home Theater. 

7 = Fronts (2x B&amp;W 684 S1), Center (1x B&amp;W CM Center S2), Surrounds (2x B&amp;W 685 S1), Rear Surrounds (2x Polk T15)
.
2 = Subwoofers (2x Rythmik FV15HP)
.
4 = 2x Front Heights (2x Polk T15), 2 Top Rears (in ceiling 2x Micca M-8C)

Display: LG OLED 4K UHD HDR 65"" B7A 
Projector: Optoma GT1080
Screen: 120” Elite VMAX2
AV Receiver: Marantz SR-6011
Amplifier 1(for Tactiles): iNuke 1000DSP
Amplifier 2(for Top Rears): Audio Source AMP100VS
Mains: B&amp;W 684 S1
Center: B&amp;W CM Center S2
Surrounds: B&amp;W 685 S1
Subwoofer: 2x Rhythmic FV15HP
Tactiles: 4x AuraSound AST-2B-4 (subfloor mounted)
Front Heights: 2x Polk Audio T15 
Rear Heights: 2x Polk Audio T15
Top Rears (In Ceiling): 2x Micca M-8C
Video HDMI Processor: HDFury Vertex

After I purchased my Marantz SR-6011 AVR, I decided to un-stack my Rythmik FV15HPs and they are now in front right and front left of room. Also the projector and projection screen were added about a year ago and I've been loving gaming and movie watching on it at night. It isn't much use during the day due to being in my living room which is not light controlled. It's funny to see people's faces when the screen comes down for the first time when they didn't notice it! Note: The TV vs. projector pictures were taken at two different times with (obviously) two different cameras. "
80jjl7,2,2018-02-26,Hi everybody,AccomplishedDoubt,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/80jjl7/hi_everybody/,"I have been lurking on this sub for at least 6 month and I guess it now finally sank in, that just reading other peoples posts might not be enough. Reading other peoples stories, realizing that I am not alone, that surprisingly many people have a story so similar and yet so different to my own is a comfort and incentive, but it is not enough to get me through the weekends without drinking myself into a blackout every time...

I already went through many different phases in my 15 years of drinking. My family has a history of substance abuse, my grand dad shot himself while under the influence of various subscription drugs, my other grand dad died at the age of 61, after decades of fighting alcoholism (and losing miserably to it), my mother is an on-and-off heroin user and I myself are way beyond the ""I guess I have a problem"" stage of alcoholism.

It started out in high school (or the equivalent in Germany), we were getting together every day after school, throw all our money together and get 10 beers for the 6 of us and get drunk - yeah, back then 2 beers would get 14 year old me drunk. At the age of 16, I had vodka for the first time, got so blackout drunk that I went missing the whole day, showed up at home at 3 AM with no memory of where I've been... The hangover cured me from drinking until I entered university.
I was always a shy guy, I met my first girlfriend at the age of 19 and the only reason I talked to her in the first place, was because I was drunk. Alcohol was my social lubricant back then, when I was drinking, I felt funny, witty, the centre of the party, alcohol gave me the power to overcome my shyness and do all the things I wanted to do!
Or so I thought... One day, my room mate - who was my main drinking buddy back then - was going to a party, I caught him on the way out, all styled up. I asked him where he was going and if I could tag along. He looked at me in a really weird way and then said something I will never forget: ""They don't want you at the party, you always get super drunk and no one likes you when you are like that.""
Just thinking about it brings tears to my eyes again... There I was, thinking I was the man when drinking, when in reality I was the loud, girls groping asshole who everyone tries to avoid.
Needless to say, my reaction to this was getting drunk alone and playing video games. For the next 2 years. I became really anti social, failed classes left and right and had to leave university eventually.

I took a job in a pizza chain, which I hated. But it had free booze - well not really free, but the manager didn't keep track of it, or maybe he was just ignoring the missing bottles - and I got drunk every single day for about 1.5 years. I do not really remember what happened then, I went on a binge and woke up one morning realizing I had quit my job, my room mates were about to kick me out (because I was stealing booze and food and didnt pay rent) and I thought I was at an all time low.

So I went to therapy, got an internship as a programmer with a boss who was really fond of me and, after 3 years, was a booze free, certified programmer.
Then the company I was working for hit a hard time, we all had to work overtime, life became really stressful and I started drinking again. God... I sometimes got so drunk while still in the office, that I slept there, on the ground, no blanket, just me snoring away.

Eventually I got a job offering from a friend in japan. Great, I thought, that's the perfect oportunity to change my life again! So I went to japan, layed off the booze for a week or two and then one night - a tuesday or something - got drunk again, and showed up at work with a raging hangover, still slightly drunk.
My friend, who was also my boss, looked at me and said ""what's wrong with your eyes, they are so red..."" I mumbled something about not being used to the airconditioning and tried to stay as far away from everyone as possible, so they wouldn't smell the alcohol in my breath. That day helped keeping me sober on weekdays until today - 3 years later.

However, I get drunk every weekend, every free day, basically on every opportunity I have. I always go through the week telling myself ""this weekend is gonna be different, I am gonna stay sober and do stuff!"", but in the end the only thing I do is getting drunk and play video games / watch netflix while lying on the couch feeling miserable.

I hope posting here will give me a certain accountability, something to motivate me not picking up that first drink and finally break out of that death-grip alcohol has had on me my whole life.

Non alcoholic cheers to all of you and thanks for reading :)"
80jnwy,1,2018-02-26,How should I proceed?,3Brooke,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/80jnwy/how_should_i_proceed/,"I've [21f] been dating a guy [23m] for over a year now and we are in a very serious relationship. We have slept together and have seriously discussed marriage soon after graduation. Right now we are in a long distance relationship (starting 2 months ago, lasting 6 more months) because I'm on an internship with a company while he's still taking classes back at school. He's a great guy, and we've gone to each other's family holidays  and our families both really like the two of us. There are a few communication issues we stumble upon between the two of us, but we seem to work it out alright. It seems like he's a really quiet guy and just doesn't like to get out of the house ever. When we lived together (with other roommates) before my internship, I often overwhelmed him by wanting to chat in the evenings after classes or by asking to go on a hike or walk. It also seems like all that we are able to do these last few months is have sex, bicker, and overcome various conflicts. I want to be able to have nice conversations with him that aren't focused on sexy stuff all the time. It's either that, or complaining about schoolwork. I understand that school is our entire life right now, but it bothers me. I've brought up the sex and fighting stuff several times, but it always seems to get that way again soon enough.

While on my internship, I've been making friends with several of the other interns. 2 females and 6 males. One of the guys [22m] I've been getting more friendly with because he seems like a great guy and like someone I'd happily become permanent friends with and would consider dating if I weren't already in a relationship. I also get to occasionally work with this guy, and eat lunch with him daily. It is nice to be able to chat with someone my own age for a while since I work with 50-60 year old males all day otherwise. 

This guy hasn't had a girlfriend in 4 years, he's often going on Tinder dates, he's a fraternity boy (and I'm very against joining Greek Life myself),  he's constantly telling me what he's looking for in a girl, and we get along really well. We are able to have nice two sided conversations that are much more interesting than those I have with my boyfriend. I don't have to feel like I'm pulling teeth to get this guy to give inormation or his opinion or for him to continue the conversation. We've been hanging out about twice a week over the last few weeks. 

When we first met, he definitely was flirting with me, butbas soon as I mentioned my boyfriend, he definitely backed off a lot. Today at work, one of my coworkers [55m] I work closely with mentioned that he can tell that his boy likes me a lot, but is too much of a nerd and a dork to tell me so. (I'm a nerd to, and so is my boyfriend. I like and get along with nerds very well.)

My question for you is, should I struggle along with my boyfriend as normal, and continue making nice friends with this new boy? If I end things with my boyfriend and immediately (within the next month or so) start officially dating this other guy, how would that make me look? That's just awful for someone to do to a guy... 

I'm also not one to rush into relationships. I was ""making friends"" with my current boyfriend for about 8 months before we ever considered dating. My current boyfriend is only my second boyfriend ever, and both relationships lasted over a year. But I had a good part of a year separating the two relationships. 

I'm also still uncomfortable with the fact that I've slept with a guy before marriage. My boyfriend says it's okay as long as I only do it with one person ever. Meaning, now I kinda HAVE to marry him. This new guy says that sex isn't something to be taken lightly, and that it should only be done with someone you truly love and would consider marrying. He says that if a kid would result from the act, you'd have to be willing to marry that person no matter what. I don't know what my opinion is, but I'm a Christian and am really struggling to figure out what's right. "

I hope you're still feeling the cold fire I feel burning inside me now. I'm writing this letter from a place of anger, but I'm not mad at anyone; rather, I'm mad at what I could have been. But truthfully, being angry makes me feel so good. I know I can be so much more. I don't want to settle for the life I have now even though people will look at me like I'm insane for wanting more. 

I'm tired of being good, but not great. I don't care that I'm earning more than 99% of the world, I want to earn more than 99.9% of the world. I don't want to just cook good food; I want to cook food that people pay for, food that's better than Michelin starred chefs can make. I'm tired of the superficial circle of friends I have right now; I want to know who my real friends are or if I don't have any at all. I want to create. I want respect. I want admiration, I want wealth, I want power. Let's make sure that we're always striving towards those goals, man. 

How have you been? How was the semester? Did you stay motivated? I hope so, because this one started out so much better than last. Did you do well at the internship? I remember that I was so happy when I got the offer. I hope they liked you enough to give you a return offer. How was hanging out with friends in the city? Did you take a chance and ask anyone out? Did you make new friends? Did you find another hole in the wall that serves the best coffee you've ever had? Did you ever completely get over her? She was awesome, but sometimes things just don't work out the way we want them to.

I won't be mad if all of the answers are negative. Sometimes that's just how life goes, but I certainly do hope that there are going to be quite a few yeses thrown in the mix. I carry so many regrets about the first two decades of my life, but the beauty of still being young is that we have so much time to turn it around. Although I hope everything didn't go to shit, I won't be mad if it did. Life just trucks us sometimes. I hope that you got up after every hit, just like every time life has hit us so far. But I really don't want the cold fire to turn into hate directed inwards; we don't deserve that, and we both know how terrible it feels to be in that place.

80jzub,2,2018-02-27,About Fiance Visa Process,maeca1995,LoveMeDating,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveMeDating/comments/80jzub/about_fiance_visa_process/,"Meeting and marrying someone from a foreign country is definitely different from what most people have or will experience. As our world becomes smaller due to technology advances such as the Internet, as well as political changes, more and more people are finding their special someone abroad. However, if you do decide to marry someone from a foreign country you will find it a bit more involved than the ""usual"" marriage. One major difference is that the government must be petitioned in order for your spouse to be able to live with you in the United States.

It is possible to marry in the country of the foreign national, however there are laws and regulations in the foreign country that will determine how the marriage is to proceed. In many cases, a foreign residency will be required; the length of the residency will vary from country to country. Once the marriage has occurred you must still petition the United States government for your spouse to be granted entrance to the United States. This process can be as involved and take as long or longer than if you would have petitioned for a Fiancee Visa and married your special someone in the United States. Another problem with marrying abroad is that your fiancee does not have the opportunity to visit the United States, and experience how life will be before the marriage.

The Fiancee visa, or K1 visa, is a tool available to citizens of the United States. This is a wonderful tool which allows for the fiancee to enter the United states for a period of 90 days, during which time either the two are married or, in the absence of a marriage to the petitioner, the fiancee is required to depart the United States prior to the expiration of the 90 day visa. Unlike marrying abroad, this allows the couple to live together in the United States and the fiancee to experience what life will really be like before the marriage.

The fiancee visa process is not difficult, yet it is important that all the paperwork and supporting documents are carefully completed and compiled. Any mistakes on your part may result in your case being ""kicked out"" of the process and starting all over again. The time it takes to process a fiancee visa will vary depending on what district you reside in, taking anywhere from a month or two to several months for you to obtain approval. In order to be eligible for the Fiancee Visa process you must be able to prove that you are a US citizen, that the two of you are ready willing and legally able to marry, and that you have met face to face at some point within the last two years. The ""proof"" of the meeting can consist of photos together, passport stamps, hotel vouchers, phone log records from the petitioner's hotel to the fiancee's phone. If the petitioner can prove a severe hardship, such as a severe medical condition preventing travel, it is possible to have the personal meeting condition waived. The petitioner must also meet certain income requirements, normally 125 percent of the current poverty level. The fiancee must also meet certain standards such as no previous immigration law violations and lack of a criminal record.

Once the petitioner has decided that the fiancee process is the desired course, he will file the required forms with the appropriate district office of the USCIS. The forms consist of the I-129F, Petition for Alien Fiancee, and two G-325 biographic data sheets, one for the petitioner and one for the fiancee. The petitioner will also have to submit certain supporting documents (all foreign documents must be translated into English) such as proof of divorce, photographs, and the affidavit of support. The Affidavit of support is a pledge on behalf or the petitioner stating that he will provide support for the fiancee if she is allowed entrance to the United States. The affidavit of support itself requires supporting documentation such as letters from your employer, banks, and a list of certain assets. It also requires the submission of the last 3 years tax returns in order to show that the petitioner meets the financial standards set by the government.

The fiancee visa allows for children of the Fiancee to come along with the fiancee to the United States using a K2 visa. The children must be unmarried and under the age of 18. The child or children can accompany the fiancee or follow within one year of the initial approval. In order for the child to gain residency along with the mother the marriage must occur before the child's 18th birthday.

Once all the paperwork is filled out it is compiled and filed with the appropriate district office. Approval of the petition can take anywhere from several weeks to several months depending on the current caseload of the center. Once the petition has been approved, it is sent to the appropriate US consulate. In Russia all petitions are sent to Moscow, in Ukraine they are all sent to Kiev. Once the consulate has received the approved petition they will notify the fiancee and schedule an appointment. They will also send her a packet of information and the necessary forms she will have to complete for her interview. She will be given directions as to what supporting documents she will need for the interview including a police report stating that she has no criminal history, and a medical examination performed by an approved facility. 
The interview process is normally very short and direct. The consulate will determine at that point whether or not they will grant the visa. Grounds for denial include but are not limited to; prior criminal history, terrorist affiliations, health problems such as tuberculosis or insanity. The consultant will also be looking for signs of a potential ""sham"" marriage, or visa fraud. The consulate takes visa fraud very seriously. Once granted the physical visa will be placed in the fiancees passport and she will have up to six months from the issue date to enter the United States.

Once the fiancee has arrived the 90 day clock starts. During that 90-day period the fiance must either marry the petitioner or leave the United States at the end of the 90 day period, there are no extensions. The fiancee will have the opportunity to work during the visa period and will be given that authorization upon her arrival.

If all goes well the marriage occurs and a petition to adjust status to permanent resident is filed. The spouse may not leave and return to the United States during the adjustment period without first obtaining an advance parole.

This article is intended for general purposed only. It is not intended as legal advice and should not be relied on as such. There are many factors to take into consideration when processing a K1 or fiancee visa, legal assistance from an attorney experienced and competent in immigration law is advised.

The Law Office of Laurie Y. Wu is an excellent choice for your entire visa process. Laurie Wu was born and raised in the USA to immigrant parents from mainland China and is conversant in three Chinese dialects - Cantonese, Hakka and Mandarin.

Laurie graduated with honors (magna cum laude) from Drew University (New Jersey) after completing a standard four-year economics degree within three years. Before law school, she spent three years as a paralegal at Davis Polk (New York).

80k7ac,1,2018-02-27,02-27 06:12 - 'Trying to finish degree while working... How to broach this subject to the boss?' (self.belgium) by /u/throwaway_dadvice removed from /r/belgium within 6302-6312min,removalbot,removalbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/removalbot/comments/80k7ac/0227_0612_trying_to_finish_degree_while_working/,"'''

So because of some personal life things I was unable to finish up my studies a few years ago. I had to quit in the final semester and then I hit a depression. I was in a huge slump until about a year ago. My life is turning around at last.

So I got back in contact with my professors to ask what my possibilities were, and I can still finish my last semester.

Problem is, it's education, and one of my courses involves a long internship (4ish weeks). I have no qualms spending my holidays on this, but even then it'll take some understanding and flexibility on my employer's part... I have only been working here for about a year and while my boss and colleagues are happy with me (and I'm happy with the work also) everyone seems to agree that I'm **already** overqualified. I worry that if I drop this on my boss, he'll be afraid of me leaving the company and will already start looking for replacements...

So I think I have three options. Tell him well in advance so that all parties can come up with some sort of working schedule well ahead of time... Or I can only tell him a few weeks before the internship starts, checkmating him. I like my boss though... Or I can not tell him at all and just request the holidays, but that'd leave me in a pickle if the schedule should change and I have to explain why I need different days off...

Thoughts? Or is there maybe some kind of special holiday for cases like this? I'm already older than 25 so a lot of special rulings no longer apply to me.

80kvhk,15,2018-02-27,Next to leave/join the show,pdohoney,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/80kvhk/next_to_leavejoin_the_show/,"Who do you think will be the next character to leave the show and why? Also who do you think will join the show as a series regular next year (if anyone)?

I think April is most likely to leave next. Sarah Drew is arguably the most talented actress on the show and has been in movies, so I could see her wanting to leave due to other opportunities, and the fact that her character got like no screen time this season. Also, I could see her being written out because she doesn't really serve a purpose anymore - Owen serves as trauma surgeon, Jackson is now with Maggie, and she has no real connection to Meredith. If TPTB wanted to ""trim fat"" on the show, she'd probably be first to go (or Owen).

As far as joining the cast, I predict Carina will be a series regular next year. Not sure if they'll promote any of the interns, I could see them staying as recurring until the cast shrinks more, and then maybe them seeing a promotion season 16. I would be very surprised if all 6 got promoted for season 15, but maybe 3 or 4 will.

I am looking for work, internships, or a similar role in a law firm, in-house or business setting. I would also be very happy to accept offers of unpaid work experience in law firms or in-house departments, which would further my future employment prospects considerably.

I hold a 2:1 law degree from a great university, and have work experience in a city law firm and also a mini pupillage from a tier 1 criminal set. I also have extensive customer service experience gained from a long term position in a outdoors activities company. 

I am able to fit in to a team very quickly and undertake tasks with minimal supervision.

80ly1o,7,2018-02-27,Moving to LA (around Westwood) for a little over a year. A little puzzled,ZeeMan89,AskLosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/80ly1o/moving_to_la_around_westwood_for_a_little_over_a/,"Hi all! I'm looking to move to West LA, next September for around a year (likely a few months more than that). 

A little background in case it helps: my partner is finishing the last year of her PhD over at UCLA and I'd like to be there to support her, both through the move and the last push of her studies. We're both European from a Commonwealth country (in case that matters) and will be moving there from the UK. The intention isn't to remain in the US after that, most likely moving back somewhere in the EU.

My main concern is work. I'm a software developer (web, back-end, some DSP experience through a Masters degree and a neuroscience job a few years back), and I realise tech jobs aren't exactly a scarcity, but I've got a few questions I was hoping someone could answer:

**Work:**

*1. What documents (visas etc.) would I need to live and work in the US for such a limited time-frame?* 

I'm finding Visa information a little confusing at best (never had to deal with it before) but I suspect it gets hairier if it's only for around a year and a half. My partner is getting a J-1 Visa, so would a J-2 visa let me work there or is an H-1B the way to go? Also, how far in advance should I be applying for these documents?

*2. What would a fair/good expected salary for a software developer be in the US/LA area (as close to UCLA as possible)?*

I'm used to salary expectations back home and in London, and wouldn't like to be duped by some recruiter. Looking around the web, it seems that something in the range of $60k a year would be reasonable, but honestly not sure if that's within a reasonable range. (In any case, the aim isn't to make big bucks, it's to make it through the year, but I'd still like the wage to match the work)

*3. Any recommendations on how to make the best of one-year's employment in LA?* 

I realise I could take a job and leave after a year (assuming my contract/visa allows it), but that's kind of a dick move to pull on an employer. As a foreigner working there with a visa, are there any internships, short-term roles or anything of the sort I may not know about and should look into? Also, if all else fails how hard would it be to get a job in a cafe?


**Living:
**
*1. When renting a place are there any requirements/weird documentation (like guarantor forms) we might need?* 

I've grown used to the way the English handle it (with added agent fees, deposit protection schemes...) but I'm clueless as to whether this works any differently state-side.

*2. Is there any specific insurance I should look into before moving?*

(As a foreigner living/working there for a short while) Is it worth getting health or renter's insurance, or even insuring our stuff when shipping it from the UK to the US?

*3. Are there any specific areas to avoid living in? (or alternatively, any areas you'd recommend looking into?)*

I've heard LA is quite a chore to get around by public transport and most people get about by car. A car is likely out of the question for us (unless a company car is commonplace...never been offered one), so I'd be walking or taking public transport to work. We'd like to be based close to UCLA to make PhD-ing easier but I have no idea of the area at this point.

**Moving Over:**

*1. Any suggestions or tips learnt from success/horror stories in shipping personal items over from Europe?*

We're currently renting in the UK too, so anything we have with us will either be shipped along with us or stored in the UK. Are there any services that cater specifically for people moving from the EU to the US?

**Social/Day to day life:**

*1. How friendly are LA folk?*

Having been in London for a few years we sort of got used to people being a little closed off at first but opening up eventually. We're social, sunny island folk moving to a place where we'd barely know anyone. Just wondering if this is a hurdle we should be considering :)

Sorry if this is a lengthy post or if these questions don't belong here, just looking for local advice :) Cheers!"

After much persuasion, he decided to apply. (I applied first.)
Bad news is, we both did not get in. Due to some miscommunication between us and the school, we missed the dateline for appeal. So now, we need to submit the appeal form personally to the school.

We are both on our internship, so it's difficult to go to school personally.

Yesterday night, 10pm to 11pm, we discussed that we need to send the appeal asap, but no conclusion.

This morning, 08.40 am I asked 'So what is your plan? Later when my supervisor come in at 9.30 i will talk to him.'
He replied promptly, saying he may not be able to take leave due to company policy. He asked if I could help him submit. I said ok. But we thought we should email the school first to double confirm, and I did.

At 9.20am, another friend told me that we should submit to another office because they are more efficient. So I messaged my friend about this. No reply. At 9.40am, I told him I'm not going today anymore, to clarify everything first. No reply.

Then, at 9.40pm today, the school told me that I can still submit the appeal. I sent him a screenshot of the email from the school saying we still submit (personally) tomorrow. He did not reply.

At 10.20pm just now, the staff kindly told me that I can submit through email (GOOD NEWS!!!), since I am on my internship.

Now it's 11pm and still no response from him. I have sent in my appeal. Should I tell him about this good news, or just ignore him already? (It seems like he has 0% interest in this exchange, but going alone is kinda sad)."

I'll be moving from Fayetteville, AR to New Brunswick, NJ for a 3 month internship starting in June. I'll likely be sharing a house with 4 other people in the suburbs with a large backyard. I have a 1 year old Bichonpoo who's currently living with me in a small 2bd/1ba apartment in a noisy complex. She has been reactive ever since we moved in almost a year ago to the noises she hears outside in the complex, so I'm guessing that she'd love a quieter neighborhood.

At the same time, my significant other's parents suggested that they could look after her for me. My pup visits them from time to time and she loves it up there! She gets to play with their other dogs in a big house and have access to their big backyard via the doggy door. I'd hate to burden them for that long, but it would definitely be helpful so that I can focus on the internship, not having to find a dog walker while I'm gone or ask my roommates to let her out to potty, and helping her get adjusted to new people/a new place. Of course I'd prepare them with doggy food, treats, her toys, bed, etc and make sure to send them money for other necessities for they duration of her stay.

What do you guys suggest? Take her with me or have her stay back home with my SO's parents?"

One is in Wilmington and one is in Jersey. The one in Wilmington has higher state/local taxes, whereas the one in Jersey has a smaller state tax, and no local tax. However, since I live in Philly, is that as black and white as it seems? Or if my PA tax is supposed to be higher will that mean I actually get taxed more on my Jersey job in order to bring the taxes up to the local ones?

EDIT: Doing some more research and as I understand it, since they have all signed reciprocal tax agreements, I would actually pay less in income tax in DE since I would only pay PA instead of DE, but then I would still have the city tax. However, if I work in NJ, since their income tax is lower, I would be stuck paying the higher PA income tax right?

&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘VN-chef biedt Colombia hulp voor vluchtelingen’? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Onderschrijft u het pleidooi van de secretaris-generaal van de Verenigde Naties &amp;#40;VN&amp;#41; dat Colombia moet worden geholpen bij de opvang van Venezolaanse vluchtelingen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Secretaris-generaal van de VN, Guterres, bracht op 13 en 14 januari jl. een bezoek aan Colombia om te spreken over het Colombiaanse vredesproces. Tijdens zijn bezoek bood hij eveneens hulp aan voor Venezolaanse vluchtelingen in Colombia.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Minister voor Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking sprak op 15 januari jl. met de secretaris-generaal in New York over Colombia en de humanitaire gevolgen van de Venezolaanse crisis die zorgen blijven baren. De minister liet in dit gesprek weten dat het kabinet achter het aanbod staat van de VN om Colombia te helpen met de opvang van Venezolaanse vluchtelingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3    
Kunt u een inschatting geven van het totaal aantal gevluchte Venezolaanse burgers tot heden en hoeveel er daarvan reeds in Colombia zijn opgevangen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het kabinet is uiteraard bezorgd over de verslechterende politieke, economische en sociale situatie in Venezuela, die er volgens UNHCR toe heeft geleid dat meer dan een miljoen Venezolanen hun land hebben verlaten &amp;#40;cijfers UNHCR van november 2017&amp;#41;. De meeste Venezolanen hebben hun toevlucht gezocht tot de buurlanden. Volgens dezelfde cijfers zijn in 2017 ruim 600.000 Venezolanen naar Colombia gevlucht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4    
Wat doet Nederland momenteel om Colombia bij te staan bij de opvang van Venezolaanse vluchtelingen? Kunt u toelichten wat het Nederlandse beleid is? Welke mogelijkheden heeft u, bijvoorbeeld via het Noodfonds, om de hulp aan Colombia te intensiveren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat Nederland ook een verantwoordelijkheid heeft om hulp te bieden bij de opvang van Venezolaanse vluchtelingen, gezien het feit dat Venezuela ons grootste buurland is? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Nederlandse humanitaire middelen worden ingezet daar waar de noden het hoogst zijn. Bij het bepalen van de inzet worden factoren als kwetsbaarheid van de bevolking, capaciteit van een land om de noden te lenigen, het aantal slachtoffers en het tekort in de financiering van de noden meegenomen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nederland geeft jaarlijkse ongeoormerkte bijdragen aan een aantal VN-organisaties en fondsen, zoals UNHCR &amp;#40;33 miljoen in 2018&amp;#41;, het Wereldvoedselprogramma &amp;#40;36 miljoen&amp;#41;, het Internationale Comité van het Rode Kruis &amp;#40;ICRC, 40 miljoen&amp;#41; en het Central Emergency Response Fund &amp;#40;55 miljoen&amp;#41;. Deze bijdragen stellen organisaties in staat om zelf te bepalen waar hulp het hardste nodig is. UNHCR ondersteunt de regering van Colombia met zowel de opvang van vluchtelingen en migranten uit Venezuela als met de opvang van ruim 425.000 Colombiaanse intern ontheemden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid het probleem van de opvang van Venezolaanse vluchtelingen te agenderen in de VN-Veiligheidsraad, en daar net als de secretaris-generaal van de VN te pleiten voor concrete bijstand voor Colombia? Zo ja, bent u bereid de Kamer te informeren over de uitkomsten hiervan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De secretaris-generaal van de VN heeft al hulp voor Venezolaanse vluchtelingen in Colombia aangekondigd. De Minister voor Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking heeft in gesprek met de secretaris-generaal van de VN op 15 januari jl. laten weten dat het kabinet achter dat aanbod staat. Het kabinet ziet op dit moment geen toegevoegde waarde in het agenderen van de opvang van Venezolaanse vluchtelingen in de VN Veiligheidsraad. Ook onder de andere leden van de Veiligheidsraad bestaat hiervoor geen draagvlak. Zie verder het antwoord op vraag 2, 4 en 5.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7    
Kunt u toelichten hoeveel Venezolaanse vluchtelingen in 2017 in Aruba, Bonaire en Curaçao zijn opgevangen, en hoe de opvang voor hen op deze verschillende eilanden is geregeld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
In Aruba, Curaçao en Bonaire zijn in 2017 geen Venezolaanse vluchtelingen opgevangen. Om in aanmerking te komen voor de status erkend vluchteling, moet een persoon in het land waar zij asiel hebben aangevraagd internationale bescherming hebben gekregen. Hiervan was afgelopen jaar geen sprake.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In 2017 heeft op Bonaire één persoon &amp;#40;met de Venezolaanse nationaliteit&amp;#41; een verzoek om bescherming ingediend bij de Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst Caribisch Nederland te Bonaire. Deze aanvraag is niet ingewilligd, omdat betrokkene niet aan de voorwaarden van het gevraagde verblijfsdoel voldeed. Conform het huidige beleid in Caribisch Nederland is een persoon die om bescherming vraagt zelf verantwoordelijk om in zijn of haar opvang te voorzien. Daarbij kan worden gedacht aan een onderkomen bij familie, vrienden/kennis of hotels. Voor schrijnende gevallen kan een uitzondering worden gemaakt. Bij een grote toestroom van om bescherming vragen migranten heeft het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid in samenwerking met het Openbaar Lichaam Bonaire, de uitvoeringsorganisaties &amp;#40;o.a. Koninklijke Marechaussee, Korps Politie Caribisch Nederland en de Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst Caribisch Nederland&amp;#41; en Defensie een noodplan ontwikkeld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Aruba is aangesloten bij het Protocol betreffende de status van vluchtelingen van 1967. Aruba beschikt aldus over een nationale procedure voor de behandeling van asielaanvragen. In de loop van 2017 zijn er 18 asielaanvragen geregistreerd, waarvan 16 personen met de Venezolaanse nationaliteit. De personen die een lopende asielaanvraag hebben, kunnen een beroep doen op een vergunning tot tijdelijk verblijf, welke wordt afgegeven ingevolge artikel 19 van het Toelatingsbesluit, zonder beperking voor wat betreft hun werkgever en/of functie, in afwachting van een definitieve beschikking over hun verzoek. De opvang gebeurt voornamelijk door het Rode Kruis Aruba.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Curaçao is momenteel niet aangesloten bij het Vluchtelingenverdrag of bij het Protocol betreffende de status van vluchtelingen van 1967. Dientengevolge heeft Curaçao geen procedure om de status van vluchteling toe te kennen. Curaçao is wel gebonden aan art. 3 EVRM &amp;#40;verbod van onmenselijke behandeling&amp;#41;. Personen die een beroep doen op artikel 3 EVRM doorlopen een procedure bij het ministerie van Justitie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8    
Klopt het dat 187 Nederlanders vast zitten in Venezuela? 2&amp;#41; Kunt u toelichten wat het kabinet doet om deze mensen vrij te krijgen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Afgelopen weken hebben verschillende vluchten plaatsgevonden waarmee het overgrote deel van de gestrande Nederlanders is vertrokken. Het is niet bekend hoeveel gestrande Nederlanders zich exact in Venezuela bevonden, omdat er geen registratieplicht geldt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op dinsdag 9 januari is het reisadvies aangepast en zijn Nederlanders geïnformeerd over de grenssluiting. Nederlanders die contact hebben opgenomen, is geadviseerd met hun reisorganisatie of luchtvaartmaatschappij contact te hebben over de mogelijkheden voor een al dan niet rechtstreeks vertrek naar het Caribisch deel van het Koninkrijk.

I'm already too far in to quit now, I can't waste my parents money and be one of ""those"" people who dropped out as an upper division student - and then live with the stigma of being uneducated. I remember how I was before I went to college, when I had such naive and optimistic (but unrealistic) views on how the world works and how you don't even ""need"" to go to college if you want to pursue a more creative job. Being in college for the past few years has changed my perspective completely though, turning me into a cautious, fearful, and pessimistic person. I'm not getting a degree in engineering, computer science, finance, accounting, or some other field where prospects are good with only a bachelor's, so I'm probably going to have to go to graduate school. I'm already being groomed for it and have been told by numerous professors now that it'd be a great fit for me. I don't disagree with them - I am a good student. But if I'm so miserable in undergrad, how would graduate school be any different? The number of absolute horror stories I hear about academia and what a toxic environment it is don't help. But if you want a ""thinking"" job where you're allowed to think about the big picture (in a way that doesn't directly benefit some company...), you don't have many options besides going to graduate school. Unless you're alright dealing with low salaries and high job insecurity, that is. 

I'm so depressed in college I can hardly function. I'll admit that college isn't the sole factor in my depression, but I feel like it contributes greatly. I can't pull myself away from it; even when I don't have a pressing assignment due, my mind is still trapped by this fucking school, thinking about the next assignment I have due, the readings I should catch up on, when to look for internships, what research I should get involved in. I hate being on campus, it feels like a vampire that's sucking me dry. I hate the bureaucracy and what modern higher education in the U.S. has become. I wake up at night from the stress and anxiety. I feel like my life is put on pause as soon as the quarter begins, and I only get it back and feel like ""me"" again when it's over. I have a family history of ADD and think I might have it too, plus I have a chronic physical illness, so that makes it difficult to keep up with my workload and maintain high grades. I find that the stress can get so bad at times, I can't even focus enough to sit down and get myself organized to order a bottle of vitamins on Amazon - it feels like I'm wasting precious time. So how can I focus on writing? The short answer is that I can't. Most of the time I feel so hopeless and anxious, I don't even want to allow my mind to wander in that direction, because it's too painful. 

I can't help but deeply resent college - for killing my creativity, my passion, my ability to dream big (even if it's not realistic), my ability to relax and daydream and think about non-school related projects. Did any of you have a similar experience in university? If so, how did you get over it? Or did you get over it? 

**EDIT**: after making my original post I responded to some of the replies and then went off to my classes for the day. When I checked back, I was absolutely floored. And over 130 comments now! I can't believe it, I had no idea this post would gain traction like it did. I don't even know how to respond to so much kindness - I feel like I should write each of you a thank you letter. I read through every single one of these comments in detail and took note of every reference. You guys are a very wise, encouraging, inspiring bunch. Hopefully this thread will be useful to anyone in college, now and in the future, who's struggling with these issues. There were some amazing discussions here. Again, I can't thank you guys enough!

80oe14,3,2018-02-27,Some advice?,thedaveuk,journalismjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/journalismjobs/comments/80oe14/some_advice/,"Hey all,

I wanted to ask working journalists, especially those who might be involved in hiring new journalists for their outlets, for some advice.

I'm British and I am just about to finish an undergraduate degree in Journalism &amp; Media and have already been accepted to a well regarded Digital Journalism masters programme starting in September. I'm older than your standard student (turn 31 this year). 

Where I'm having an issue is finding any degree related work. I did a two week internship at a well known stable of local papers, which went well. I learned a lot. And, with regards to my degree, I'm on course for a 2:1 or a First.

I have written a few things for a few online outlets but that wasn't paid and I'm at the point where, although I obviously want to get as much experience as possible, I also don't just want to continue to write for free. When I've looked at press office type roles, I've also come up with issues. For example, I saw a decent Press Assistant role on LinkedIn today. Entry level, yet they want you to have a years experience already. 

So, I was wondering if anybody has any advice that could help me find paid work, keeping in mind I'm a little older than the standard person entering the industry and that I will continue to study through to next spring.

Thanks in advance."
80on6t,1,2018-02-27,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Becker over het bericht ‘Oxfam Novib: seksrapport ook in Nederland bekend’,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/80on6t/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_becker_over_het/,"^(Antwoorden van de Minister voor Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking op vragen van het lid Becker &amp;#40;VVD&amp;#41; over het bericht: ‘Oxfam Novib: seksrapport ook in Nederland bekend.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht ‘Oxfam Novib: seksrapport ook in Nederland bekend’? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2    
Deelt u de mening dat het onacceptabel is dat een organisatie die zegt op te komen voor mensenrechten ze vervolgens zelf schendt en dit in de doofpot stopt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer bewezen is dat een dergelijke organisatie mensenrechten schendt, acht ik dit uiteraard onacceptabel. Tevens roep ik organisaties op om transparant te zijn, zowel over hun integriteitsbeleid en –procedures als in het geval van grensoverschrijdend gedrag of strafbare feiten door medewerkers.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3    
Is er direct of indirect &amp;#40;eventueel via de Verenigde Naties of de Europese Unie&amp;#41; Nederlands belastinggeld in het betreffende project van Oxfam in Haïti besteed? Zo ja, hoeveel en op welke wijze heeft Oxfam hierover aan het ministerie gerapporteerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, er is Nederlands belastinggeld besteed bij de activiteiten van Oxfam Great Britain &amp;#40;GB&amp;#41; in Haïti. Oxfam Novib heeft EUR 15 miljoen ontvangen van de Samenwerkende Hulp Organisaties-actie 'Help slachtoffers aardbeving Haïti'. De totale opbrengst van deze actie was EUR 111 miljoen, waarvan EUR 41,7 miljoen door de Nederlandse overheid werd bijgedragen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Van de EUR 15 miljoen is EUR 8,3 miljoen besteed via Oxfam GB, waarvan EUR 5,2 miljoen aan noodhulp in 2010 en EUR 1,6 miljoen in 2011 en EUR 1,4 miljoen aan wederopbouw. Deze bijdragen zijn door een externe audit gecontroleerd. Op verzoek van Oxfam Novib heeft de accountant de werkzaamheden over 2011 uitgebreid naar de uitgaven die zijn gedaan door het personeel van Oxfam GB dat beschuldigd werd van schendingen van de eigen gedragscode. De accountant heeft naast het rapporteren over de bevindingen van de reguliere controle, specifiek gerapporteerd over deze aanvullende werkzaamheden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De audit toonde aan dat er geen fraude met programmamiddelen is gepleegd met hulpgelden. Het auditrapport van Oxfam GB is op 8 mei 2012 gedeeld met de Algemene Rekenkamer en het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 21 mei 2012 heeft de Algemene Rekenkamer in een brief aan Oxfam Novib laten weten dat 'bij zowel het onderzoek van Oxfam Groot-Brittannië als de accountantscontrole geen aanwijzingen van fraude zijn vastgesteld' en dat de Algemene Rekenkamer daarmee ‘de zaak’ als afgehandeld beschouwde.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Oxfam GB heeft tussen 1 januari 2010 en 31 december 2012 verschillende EU bijdragen gekregen van in totaal EUR 5 miljoen. Deze middelen werden vooral via EU noodhulporganisatie ECHO beschikbaar gesteld. Vanuit verschillende VN organisaties, waaronder UNICEF, WFP, WHO en IOM is in totaal EUR 1,9 miljoen bijgedragen aan de Oxfam GB activiteiten in Haïti.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4    
Klopt het dat het rapport over misstanden met seksueel misbruik door hulpverleners op Haïti al langer bekend was bij de top van Oxfam Nederland en dat zij hierover in 2012 aan uw ministerie hebben gerapporteerd? 2&amp;#41; Zo ja, welke mate van detail had de informatie die toen op het ministerie bekend was, met wie is deze informatie gedeeld en welke vervolgstappen zijn op basis van deze informatie ondernomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals ook beschreven in de brief aan uw Kamer van 23 februari 2018 heeft Oxfam Novib op mijn verzoek een brief gestuurd, waarin een feitenrelaas is opgenomen, hieruit blijkt het volgende:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 5 augustus 2011 is Oxfam Novib ingelicht over de start van het onderzoek naar een aantal medewerkers van Oxfam GB in Haïti. Het onderzoek is publiekelijk medegedeeld op 5 september 2011.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 18 april 2012 heeft Oxfam Novib een geanonimiseerd intern onderzoeksrapport over de integriteitschendingen door medewerkers van Oxfam GB gedeeld met het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken en de Algemene Rekenkamer.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit rapport bevat een beschrijving van de geconstateerde misstanden. Omwille van de privacy zijn de namen van de betrokken medewerkers in dit rapport onleesbaar gemaakt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Tevens wordt in het rapport aangegeven dat het geldende sanctiebeleid is toegepast &amp;#40;ontslag van verschillende medewerkers&amp;#41; en dat er geen fraude met programmamiddelen is geconstateerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dat er geen programmamiddelen voor oneigenlijk gebruik zijn aangewend wordt bevestigd in een auditrapport dat Oxfam Novib op 8 mei 2012 over de activiteiten van Oxfam GB heeft gedeeld met de Algemene Rekenkamer en het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit wordt op 21 mei 2012 schriftelijk bevestigd door de Algemene Rekenkamer die de zaak daarmee als afgedaan beschouwde.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals ik heb aangegeven in uw Kamer, heb ik zelf binnen het ministerie opdracht gegeven om de beschikbare documenten en informatie over deze zaak te verzamelen. Daartoe worden onder meer archieven geraadpleegd en personen benaderd die destijds bij de financiering betrokken waren. Doel is om na te gaan welke informatie het ministerie destijds heeft ontvangen van Oxfam Novib en wat het ministerie heeft gedaan met de ontvangen informatie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik zal een externe partij bij dit onderzoek betrekken. Ik verwacht dat ik het eindrapport in de tweede helft van maart met uw Kamer kan delen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe verklaart u dat de verschrikkelijke situatie op Haïti heeft kunnen voortduren zonder te worden opgemerkt door de donoren van Oxfam, waaronder verschillende overheden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Donoren, waaronder Nederland, zijn conform bovenstaande tijdlijn geïnformeerd over de misstanden op Haïti en over de stappen die Oxfam vervolgens heeft ondernomen jegens betrokken medewerkers. Of donoren eerder op de hoogte waren van de misstanden c.q. deze eerder hadden moeten opmerken, heb ik vooralsnog niet kunnen vaststellen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze ziet u erop toe dat NGO's die Nederlands belastinggeld ontvangen integer met middelen omgaan? Op welke wijze grijpt u in als zij dat niet doen? Worden zij door het ministerie verplicht interne misstanden te rapporteren? Zo nee, bent u bereid hen hiertoe te verplichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat ontwikkelingsgeld zou moeten worden teruggevorderd en/of worden gestopt als ontoelaatbaar gedrag of niet integer handelen van hulpverleners aan het licht komen? Zo ja, waarom zijn niet eerder voorstellen gedaan om dit daadwerkelijk effectief te kunnen doen en welke stappen onderneemt u om dit in de toekomst wel op effectieve wijze te kunnen doen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden  
&amp;nbsp;    
Integere omgang met ontwikkelingsgelden staat al geruime tijd op de agenda en is gereguleerd in contracten, subsidiebeschikkingen en auditprotocollen. Financiële malversaties, of verdenkingen daarvan, worden direct gemeld aan het ministerie. Ook bestaan er heldere procedures voor terugvordering van onrechtmatige uitgaven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ook ten aanzien van overig, niet-financieel integriteitsbeleid kent het ministerie bepalingen in subsidiekaders. Deze zijn doorgaans echter generiek geformuleerd, zonder specificering van bijvoorbeeld seksueel grensoverschrijdend gedrag of machtsmisbruik. Dit maakt het complexer om in het geval van vermeende of bewezen misstanden op dit terrein over te gaan tot terugvordering of het opleggen van andere, juridisch onderbouwde sancties.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Naar aanleiding van de in Haïti en andere crisisgebieden geconstateerde misstanden, heb ik binnen mijn departement opdracht gegeven om bestaande subsidiekaders, overeenkomsten en beschikkingen tegen het licht te houden en deze verder aan te scherpen voor wat betreft integriteitseisen. Uitgangspunt is een zero tolerance beleid voor seksueel grensoverschrijdend gedrag. Het gaat dan onder meer om strikte gedragscodes met adequate consequenties. Ook verwacht ik dat elke organisatie mijn ministerie direct informeert over mogelijke misstanden begaan door eigen medewerkers of die van uitvoerende partners, bij de uitvoering van door mij gefinancierde activiteiten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bovenstaande zal onderwerp van het gesprek met de Nederlandse hulp- en ontwikkelingsorganisaties zijn dat ik op 6 maart a.s. op mijn ministerie heb belegd. Ik zal uw Kamer informeren over de uitkomst van dit overleg en over concrete maatregelen om subsidiekaders aan te scherpen.

I was 22, 355 lbs. Depressed college student who never learned to cope with the challenges of college, working and life balance. So I dug a deep dark hole of social isolation, binge eating, and academic procrastination.

Then, one day the lights came on. I wanted to eat better. I could control that if not all my self-inflicted problems. I started. Between now and then I've been as low as 240 and up and down more than is like to reflect on. I was able to build good habits in my last year of school and I kept most of them into my internship and first years of working life.

Then I moved farther from home, my work responsibilities became more intense, and I lived in the sticks. A couple of slip ups and backsteps, but I mostly tangled with the depression and isolation. I thought moving to a city would offer more outlets and engagement, so I bought a house in Milwaukee.

I let that become my world for a bit, finding a house, researching, seeing, saving etc. I am very good at hyperfocusing on things to block out troubles. I gained a lot of weight. I moved into the house, but I didn't know anybody there, and rather than reach out, I dug a very deep hole just like the one in college, a trench with very little in it but the internet, video games and media, girded with pizza boxes and focused on social media as a time sucking lifeline to old friends. I lost interest in my hobbies, in any kind of making friends or relationships. I knew my weight was approaching my max ever. It felt like this crushing debt. That removing it is this prerequisite to doing any of the things I care about in life, and there's some truth to that, but I turned it into a feedback loop of despondent, isolating behavior. A moving goalpost, with the deadline already passing, so why bother.

So I made a resolution, I dug up my old meal plans, I got into my work weight off program, and I started doing it again. I am 28, and I'm not going to curl up and disappear. I'm going to do things, see things, meet people. Proverbial mountains for me, and you don't climb mountains first thing, you start hiking.

So that's what I'm doing. Training. Right now it's diet and sleep. Limiting screen time to help with both. Turns out when you remove that time-suck, you start doing a lot of the household things you're supposed to do.

I'm a week in and (lots of water weight) 12 lbs down, and I can stop scrolling past here trying not to think about how much I hate myself. I'm doing it."

She was a diligent intern when she started with us at age 20, and usually dressed conservatively, though her figure was never hard to make out beneath the fitted professional dress. I never made any direct passes at her, but she sensed my interest and often came by my office *just to talk*. The talks were never overtly sexual, but she slowly became more familiar, *closer* each week, til she felt at ease closing the door to come sit on my desk and discuss how our weeks were going, hopes, dreams, and the like.

The way she straightened her back and dangled her feet off the edge of the desk was adorable. She acted as if she were posing for a calendar as she discussed where her degree might take her, how much she would miss how *nice* everyone was around the office... I started to think how much I'd miss these talks and we began to talk more *outside* of work. Text messages exchanged at first were mostly professional, revolving around what she needed to do in the morning, which clients I would need to contact when I got a chance. But the ""good morning"" texts, and ""I'm bringing you a latte"" texts soon became random photos with captions such as ""Do you like my nails?"" or ""How does this lipstick look?"" as if I were her fashion consultant.

Graduation day came, and her time with us ended. The day I gave her a letter of recommendation and everyone wished her good luck in her future was the day that she came to me, with a piece of sheetcake in hand, and asked if I had plans later. I invited her to dinner and picked her up from her apartment almost immediately. 

Over a nice Italian dinner, we laughed and flirted, her foot grazing my leg beneath the table accidentally at first, then persistently, gently, from my ankle to my knee up and down. We elected to skip dessert, as there was ice cream at home, if I was not mistaken. The car ride to my house felt warm, though the evening was cool. Her hand found my thigh rather quickly and her cheek my shoulder. My breathing was heavier, and the little *mm* noises she made were burrowing deeper into my mind during the entire twenty minute ride as the sun went down.

We never quite made it to the ice cream, as our lips met just past the entryway and the tension of the past year began to overflow. We tripped and staggered our way into the bedroom, leaving clothing at the bedroom door and ultimately in a heap by the bed. I mounted her at first, sliding easily inside as though the entire time I'd known her had been sufficient foreplay. I told her there were condoms in the nightstand, that we could put one on at the end. She agreed through muffled kisses and moans.

As I rolled to the side and she mounted me, she began a steady rocking rhythm, her hips rolling back and forth over me. I told her I was getting close, and she obediently slowed, smiling knowingly. As the pressure subsided, I nodded and she began riding me quickly again, her hands resting on my chest. We repeated this five times until I was clawing at her thigh each time we slowed to a stop. ""Let me know when you get close next time,"" she purred.

I pressed my hand to her chest, trailing down stomach and coming to rest on her thigh and let out a long puff of air. It was *so close.* ""Soon,"" I said. ""The condoms are right here..."" And I sat up slightly to reach for the nightstand.

She leaned her weight into her hands, and slid her arm behind my neck with her lips by my ear. *No daddy - cum for me right now. Cum inside me.* And she held me there and licked the side of my neck as her hips bucked up and down...

80pon8,1,2018-02-27,Career Expectations,snowboardinf2334,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/80pon8/career_expectations/,"At the risk of sounding arrogant, I feel anxious about my next life decisions.  I am just turned 32, and am graduating in spring from a state school in the PNW.  I have a 4.0 GPA in Electrical Engineering, and have been working for the Federal Govt for the pathways internship program.

The program states that upon graduation, I will become be converted to a full time federal employee, and be paid 44k.  After 6 months, I will be paid 53k, another 6 months I will be paid 76k. 
 I this point I will have reached the promotion potential(GS12) and receive 3% increases every year.

When I think of my ideal budget per month, I would like to spend around:

750 for rent/utilities

125 for insurance

125 for gas

500 for roth IRA

500 for student loans(35k)

200 for food

300 for fun

1000 for parents

1000 for house

In total I believe that is around 4500 per month.  I take home about 65% after healthcare, taxes, fees, and 401k.  That means that I would need to be making 6885/month(83k/year) to be doing this plan.  This plan allows me to be close to buying a house after 5 years.  But obviously I cannot do this while staying with the govt.  I would need to push back this plan another 5 years to be making this work and not be able to help my parents or save towards a house.  My parents could really use money now, but I am out of state so I cannot live with them to help.  

I believe that the money is good when I reach GS12, but I feel that I may be short changing myself.  I am not a genius by any means, and my GPA strictly reflects the amount of effort, time, and sacrifices I have made during my college career.  

What are my chances at getting paid higher at a private industry job and being able to keep that job without being laid off?  Any other advice would be great too.  Maybe I am overlooking some numbers or opportunities.  If I stick with the govt, I would plan on working a part time as well (bartending maybe or tutoring).

Thanks all!"

Looking at Glassdoor it seems they haven't taken interns for a sales engineering position before so I’m striking out on what to expect. It’s a 30 minute interview with a manager followed by a 30 minute interview with a team lead and associate. Should I be expecting technical questions related to programming/engineering or more behavioral sales based questions? I have a general understanding of what a sales engineer does but am unsure of the exact details. Thanks in advanced 

If it matters, the titles of the people interviewing me is Solutions Architect which I believe to be different than sales engineering if that makes a difference. "

- Jo and Alex will get married. 
- Jo will (finally) conclude her residency declare ortho (or maybe ganeral) as her speciality.
- Amelia and Alex will take out the tumour of the little singer girl after a lot of failed attempts and after she almost dies because of it. 
- Jaggie are going to happen, for our discontent. 
- Teddy and Owen will reunite, get together and he will move to Germany with her. 
- April will go down for real on her depression. She will reunite with Matthew and the two of them will broke up when they realize that they are both punishing themselves or wanting to escape the pain. At some point, everyone will notice and take care of her, specially Amelia and Meredith. She will ultimately recover her faith on God and be happy again. 
- With Owen departing, April will be appointed Head of Trauma.
- Sam Bello will die, someway, somehow, because the actress is going to be the lead on a CW show and at least one intern of all classes had died. Vik will depart from the hospital because fans don't care about him enough and the other 4 interns stay because they're lovely and/or steamy and people like them then. 
- We will discover that Isaac Cross and Leah Murphy were eaten by the parking lot goblin™.

BONUS:

predictions on season 15:
- The writers will realize nobody likes Jaggie and they'll split up and be best friends/sis and bro in a Izzie-George-like way. 
- Thatcher Grey will come back and he will have emotional conversations with Mer about Lexie, something that will make all of us weep the hell out. Scandal is ending this season, thus Jeff Perry is finally free to reappear on Grey's. 

So guys, what are your predictions?

80q96q,8,2018-02-27,"My (24f) coworker (23f) was gossiping about someone else at the company so I stopped being friends with her, but I'm not sure I did the right thing.",InternationalCitron,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/80q96q/my_24f_coworker_23f_was_gossiping_about_someone/,"Throwaway because I don't want this on my main account.

I switched companies last year and went from a prestigious company with toxic work culture (I was the only woman in a division of 50 men) to a slightly less prestigious company with a friendly environment. Immediately on my first day (the company had a happy hour that day), I met ""Katie"" who was really nice and talkative. I'm pretty quiet and don't really make friends too easily, so I appreciated that she showed interest in me. As time went on, it was pretty clear she was kind of a social butterfly at the company and had a good number of friends. I think she's genuinely well-liked at the company, and people accept that she can be outspoken at times.

To give some background, I know she was working with an intern at the company. I was working with him, too, but not as closely. He seemed fine to work with for me. One day, Katie came to my desk to talk about something and I could tell she was agitated or annoyed. She can get annoyed easily for what I consider to be minor reasons so I just ignored it and didn't really ask. She saw that I was working with the intern and started ranting about how horrible he was to work with. I didn't really know what to say and didn't like that she was talking about someone else at the company, so I just laughed nervously (it's a nervous habit). She got a look on her face and loudly said, ""Why are you laughing? This isn't funny to me.""

I thought her gossiping was highly inappropriate, and I saw an ugly side of her, and decided to distance myself. She went back to acting nice to me but I didn't reciprocate and I haven't had a conversation with her since that day. She got the hint and doesn't talk to me anymore either.

Well, since the intern has finished, I've heard from several other people at the company, including some more senior employees, about how horrible he was to work with. Other coworkers were saying he never came into work, was really rude to Katie because she was younger than him, frequently off-task, etc etc. These were people who had sat in their vicinity so I knew their opinions weren't necessarily influenced by Katie, if that makes sense.

Now I feel bad that I basically kind of laughed at her (even though I didn't mean to) a while ago. I haven't t really made other friends at this company and don't know what to do. Should I talk to her? I can tell she doesn't want to be friends anymore and don't want it to blow up in my face.

Tl;dr: I thought my coworker was gossiping (she was) and I stopped being friends with her over it to be professional. I'm learning that her complaining may have been valid and I'm wondering if I should try to be friends with her again."

Here's some info on what I'm looking for. If you or anyone you know might be interested, I would love to hear from you! Also, this listing is a work in progress, let me know if I'm missing anything obvious that a candidate might like to know. 

-----

This is a PAID internship type position. It will be part time and is in no way meant to provide a sole/primary income. I am busiest from May to October, although some hours and shooting opportunities may be available during the off-season. This position will work best for someone who is only in need of part-time income and who has a relatively flexible schedule.

**About me:** I'm a photographer and photo editor in Loring Park, Minneapolis. My main focus is my wedding photography business and my secondary focus is an editing business where other photographers are my clients. I come from a background of managing a larger wedding photography studio (about 200 weddings/year), but now work for myself and shoot about 20 personally! I have an equal love for photography, (efficient) editing and business, and at times provide coaching sessions to other professional photographers. I enjoy teaching and have tons of knowledge to share. 

You can see my work at www.heartwildphoto.com

**About the position:** I'm looking for someone to both work with me part time during the week and to be my primary second shooter for weekend weddings. All work will be paid, but my ideal candidate will place value in the experience itself as well. I love to teach and am looking for someone who I can mold and teach to assist me in the ways that I need most. Essentially, I expect this to be part internship, part side gig, part mentorship. Life happens, but I'm looking for someone who can reasonably expect to be working with me for the next 2+ seasons. 

**What you can expect from me/the position:**

- $20+/hour during paid shoots, based on experience and equipment
- $12+/hour during ""office"" time (flexible weekday schedule, some work from home hours possible, based on experience and availability)
- Mentorship, training and hands-on experience with everything that I do: wedding and portrait photography, photo editing for myself and others, business tasks, client relations, sales meetings, taxes, write-offs, etc. 

**Types of Office Tasks:**

- Social media development
- Vendor relations
- Client relations
- Photo selection
- Limited editing tasks
- Album design
- Blogging
- Hard drive and memory card management
- Magazine and blog submissions
- Business development and brainstorming sessions

**Wedding Day Tasks:**

- Help with organization, carrying gear, gear setup, etc. 
- Photograph the men getting ready
- Photograph alternative angles and moments throughout the day
- Shoot images as unique as possible compared to my own! 

**Must haves/Requirements:**

- 10-15 specific weekend dates free for weddings
- Wedding portfolio, or work relevant to weddings (ex: portraits, candids, ""detail"" work, etc.)
- Camera body 3 years or newer
- Portable flash unit i.e. speedlight 
- Familiar with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom
- Strong interest, love and passion for photography
- Self starter, eager to learn
- Social person who enjoys interacting with others
- Great communication skills, both in person and via phone/email

**Strong Preferences:**

- Canon shooter, so that lenses can be shared
- Strong social media sense
- Personal transportation 
- Customer service experience of any kind

**What I'd like from you:** 

Email me at allie@heartwildphoto.com

I'd like a ""cover letter"" style email giving me a little info about your photography, telling me about yourself and letting me know why you feel you'd be a good candidate for this position. Please include a resume if you have one, and a link to an online portfolio. No Facebook pages or general Flickr accounts please. Please put together a thoughtful showcase of you, your personality and your work. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider this position! "
80rnfw,3,2018-02-27,"Working with tabs for the first time. Two tabs work perfectly, two display no content.",indiefatiguable,CodingHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CodingHelp/comments/80rnfw/working_with_tabs_for_the_first_time_two_tabs/,"I'm working on a portfolio website to show at an upcoming internship interview. I'm trying to make the resume page tabbed: one tab for highlights, one for work experience, one for education, and one for references. I've been using tutorials from w3schools to create the tabs (not sure if I'm allowed to link the exact ones, but they appear to be the only tab tutorials on the w3 website, so should be easy to find). Despite following the tutorials there and double (and triple and quadruple) checking my code, two of my tabs aren't displaying properly. 


The ""Highlights"" and ""Work History"" tabs work properly: they display the correct tab content, and the current tab button/link is properly highlighted. The ""Highlights"" tab also displays when the page is first loaded, as intended. However, the ""Education"" and ""References"" tabs display no content whatsoever. The current tab button/link is still highlighted properly, so that is no issue. 


My guess is that there is some problem in the for loop I'm using to toggle ""display: none"" and ""display: block"", but I can't quite put my finger on the exact issue. The for loop that assigns a tab button to ""active"" in order to change the color of the current tab seems to be working just fine. This is my first time working with tabs, so I'm not as familiar with them as I'd like.


A side problem I'm having, which I'm not nearly as concerned with, is that the ""Highlights"" tab button isn't highlighted when the page initially loads, even though that tab's content displays.

2 fouls in the first 10 minutes of a game.

3 fouls in the 2nd quarter.

4 or more fouls by midway through the 3rd.


Without looking it up...I guarantee lebron has the fewest minutes in foul trouble (MIFT) of all time compared to My top 10 players of all time.

I bet even Bird has spent more minutes in foul trouble.  Can reddit do some calculations to compare brons MIFT to Jordan, wilt, Shaq, bird, Kobe, Duncan, Hakeem, Russell?

I bet even steph and kd got more MIFT.

MIFT is the way the nba helps teams advance...for example...in the 2000 lakers vs Kings series...in the first quarter Webber was unstoppable in game 1...dunks..passes...rebounds...no one could stop him...but he picked up 2 fouls in the first quarter and the lakers cruised to victory.  In the end..the foul calls were probably even...but MIFT changed the whole game.  Webber couldn’t play as aggressive on offense or defense.  

Bron never has to worry about foul trouble compared to other top stars.

With all this talk about protecting players, he should be the last to chime in.   He is historically protected for an aggressive defender and person that commits offensive and defensive fouls that aren’t called a lot.


Adding stats:  lebron averages 1.9 fouls called against him in his career

I need to add:  how many games did he have 2 fouls called on him in the 1st quarter.
How many 3 by the half

And compare that to Jordan...Kobe...magic...bird and the rest.

I’m lazy...can one of y’all ESPN interns do the work for me?

When I discovered the CBRE National Sales Internship Program on LinkedIn, I was immediately drawn to the opportunity to join the market leader in commercial real estate. I am excited by the chance to learn from industry leaders, challenge myself, and develop as a future commercial real estate professional. My analytical mindset and natural communication savvy make me an ideal candidate for the position.
In my most recent role as a Financial Analyst at xxxxxxxxx I had a desire to do more than what was asked of me. I saw that the Financial Planning and Analysis team had plenty of models for short term financial reporting, but lacked any detailed forecasting models. I discussed this with my supervisor and asked if I could develop one. By the end of the summer internship I presented a brand new detailed forecasting model and the forecasts derived form it to the Group CFO and COO. In this role I will be able to use my demonstrated analytical ability to identify trends and opportunities within the commercial real estate industry and bring in new business for the company. 
My ability to communicate with anybody has always been one of my best strengths. I was able to develop this ability during my campaign and throughout my term as Vice President. The outcome of my election reflected this ability to connect and speak with people coming from very different backgrounds than myself. Through hard work, persistence, and not taking no for an answer I reached groups of students that had never voted before because I was motivated, creative, and able to connect with students of all backgrounds. In sales it is all about the relationships you are able to develop, whether with clients or colleagues and I believe my experience shows I am more than capable of success in this endeavor. 
After reviewing my application, I hope that you will find that I am the type of skilled resourceful and driven candidate that would be a positive addition to the company. I look forward to elaborating on how my personal skills and abilities will benefit CBRE. 

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

80sxmu,26,2018-02-27,The SIP Program is Unneccessary,pissed_at_SIP,uAlberta,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/80sxmu/the_sip_program_is_unneccessary/,"I have been unable to find any information on this anywhere online, so I have decided to share my experience in the hopes that someone else finds this before they fall into the trap.

I enrolled in the SIP program under the guise that they would help me find placement. However, through my own endeavours, I found placement without their help. I notified the coordinators of this, and was put through. Up to this point, SIP had done nothing to help me find an internship. I had done all the work myself - I handed in my own resume before they went through it, went to the career fair and got an interview, and then accepted the position from the company that interviewed me.

Then, I find out that they charge over $700 for this ""service"" and that I am required to do several meaningless assignments as part of the placement. After contacting them and asking for clarification on my requirements, they refused to give a clear answer. So, I will try my best to provide you all with a clear one:

* If you are a general science student, you do not need SIP. Avoid it, it isn't necessary. Take an evening class so you stay in school, and you are good to go. You do not have a minimum course load requirement. 

* If you are a Spec student, you may need SIP. Spec students need to maintain a minimum course load requirement. However, ff you can get a professional leave of absence, you can write off as much time as you need and complete your placement.

* If you are a Software Spec student, SIP is a requirement of your program and you must complete it.

* If you take SIP by accident, and realize you don't need it, you are under no obligation to remain in the program (except if you fall under one of the above issues).

SIP is made out to be a great way to get an internship, and to an extent, it is. However, if you are able to get a job by yourself (and believe me, you *probably are*) then SIP is an expensive way of getting ""Completed an internship"" on your degree.

TL;DR: don't take SIP unless you are a software spec student. You don't need it. **I promise.**"

Hello vPopulus, since we last addressed you admittedly there has been a slow down in news to announce. We have been focused on what the future of vPopulus could look like and we have some teasers to announce, however we want to talk about a few things that have happened recently and a staff vacancy for a front end developer.


War, huh, good god, What is it good for?

Records were broken recently in the resistance battle for Gaziantep, Turkey. With over 200k done and individual players almost hitting 20k themselves, it was certainly one the players and the staff will not forget soon! 

With war going on we feel confident that the game again is on the rise and we hope that we can help in improving that with game changes and keeping confidence in you, the player, that we want to help you and this game grow.

Game Changes

Over the last couple of weeks the vPopulus Staff have been discussing what we want to do as a team, what we can achieve and what goals we have set for the long term. As such we have decided to institute a number of changes at a specific date which will soon be announced. While the new graphics have been helpful for the appeal of the game, a refresh of the game itself has been in desperate need to help bring back some old friends and make some new ones.

We have created a list of things that are reasonably achievable within the timeframe we have set and much is already being worked on. However there is one major obstacle stopping us from doing it all as much depends on a particular position being filled.

Position Vacant

For our specific changes and for any future endeavour vPopulus Studios is in need of a front end developer. vPopulus is a small game that has not quite reached the status of an indie game, more of a passion project of people with a similar vision. We want to expand, but doing so will always be hampered without a front end developer that can improve the quality of the game in every visual aspect.

While we cannot provide a salary, you will have the unique opportunity of working for a game with massive potential and access to unique programs created by the talented developers behind the project as well as a reference from vPopulus Studio, a particularly helpful thing for any student looking to cut their teeth with practical experience.

We are looking for anyone proficient in front end development in html, experienced or inexperienced and provide a couple of hours every week for the development of the game. If you are interested in this unique opportunity, please get in contact with Klavh or Callumh123.

Game Night Update

Game night was a failure. This was for the main reason that the game chosen was a paid game that Callumh123 naively believed with his limited experience in gaming to be a game most owned. While Game Night will be attempted again it will be a free game, available for every citizen to try.

Wiki Project Update

The list is slowly being collated and will soon be published in collaboration with the citizens and staff to get it done. Assisting us in improving the coverage of our ‘Encyclopedia’ will help make the game easier to learn and understand. This very writer remains confused and slow on many of the mechanics of the game and it is why the expertise of both the staff and you to help us improve.

Meet the Staff

We have decided to start a new Insider series about learning more about each member of the staff so you can understand our backgrounds, ambitions and who we are. I’ll start with myself, Callumh123, Community Manager.

My name is Callum and I'm from Melbourne, Australia. I work at a supermarket part time and I'm about to finish my last semester in a Bachelor of Politics and International Relations, I have a degree and an advance diploma in Journalism. My hobbies are mostly reading and writing,I enjoy a drink with friends as well. My favourite band at the moment would have to be The Whitlams. My favourite thing about the game is the community but my least favourite thing about the game is definitely Viado Celtru. I've completed a number of internships with news outlets, one of which I did in Jakarta for 3 months.

Next up will be our newest member of the staff, Lordsbrin. 

Insider Explainers

While we here at vPopulus Studio like to believe we are always providing the most relevant information needed, we don't and won't always get it right. If there is something you think we have missed out on explaining or would like to see addressed in the next Insider, pop a comment below and we will do our best to address it either through the comments or through the Insider."
80u3wi,1,2018-02-28,Describe the weirdest person you have ever met on a tinder date?,themongoose47,u_themongoose47,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_themongoose47/comments/80u3wi/describe_the_weirdest_person_you_have_ever_met_on/,"Ok, I met a woman on tinder a while back in who by far is like the most interesting/weirdest/most intriguing tinder connection I have ever met.  This happened over 4 years ago but I'm new to reddit and I have to tell this. 

My friends at the time were all either engaged, married, working too much, or in a different city so I couldn't do the usual ""hey, let me meet your friends"" thing.  Anyways, I had been on probably 7-10 either awkward or boring tinder dates by that time, so I knew my chances were going to be low that she was going to be interesting, as cute as her photos, normal, ect.  

This girl looked amazing in her photos.  The photos looked professional, all filtered and shit, and she was really, really dolled up with makeup.  She definitely had some work done and was probably an MUA or maybe even a low paid model.  Automatically, I thought, ok this girl is either a Laker girl (different city we were were in though) or a stripper.  I was hoping that she was just your typical NBA dancer but no, no she was not.

We met at a normal, nice restaurant which she had recommended and I was relieved that this was the place she had chosen because I had been there before.  Of course, she doesn't look nearly as good as I was hoping for, but I also was glad that she was an actual female.  Seriously, this was one of those fake eye lashes, fake nose, fake lips, fake breasts, and way too much make up girls where you question if they are a woman like some of the Youtubers out there.  Damn, she's not really a 9...I thought.  

Automatically, she says she doesn't drink and I go, ""cool, I'm not having anything either.""...Great, nothing like meeting a complete stranger without any liquid courage to get through a potentially awkward meet up.  Anyways, right away, we start asking each other questions.  Well, I ask her questions.  Remember, this date was definitely ALL about her.

She tells me a lot...like wayyy too much.  This is when it gets good.  Apparently, she owned her own corporation.  How many people worked at her corporation?  Well, just one of course.  She called it ""(insert her full name Corporation"".  It sounded very legitimate.  She said she invested in real estate, mostly commercial real estate deals, and was invested in several ""Wall Street investments"" with ""finance guys who were high up in NYC"".  That's how she phrased it.  ""Wall Street investments"" with ""finance guys"".  Omg, I said to myself silently, as I sipped on my ice water.  This girl is clearly a well educated, genius.  The funny thing happened to be that I used to work as an analyst in NY so I happened to know a thing or two about finance, REITs, ect.  A lot of the time, my job was to basically call bullshit on deals with my coworkers and boss.  This entire Tinder girl's life story and background was bullshit.  I wanted to call her out right then and there, but somehow, her stupidity, ignorance, and lying intrigued me so I let her continue talking about herself which she thought so highly of.  I didn't dislike her in anyway, I just thought it was slightly odd that she needed to lie to me this much.  I wasn't going to care if she said she was cashier or unemployed, I just wanted to meet a nice, normal woman and hopefully, have a good time. 

She then tells me, she's also in the middle of an oil and gas deal, and so I politely ask her questions about her interest in oil and gas and where the market was headed in the US (obviously down if she had read any news in the past 5 years)...but she could not answer my simple questions.  She really had no clue what was going on, but she also said, she didn't know how to handle an investment deal that she was in.  I gave her some good advice and said she could also talk to my best friend from college who was at Goldman in energy. 

(Later on, she actually did get to talk to my friend at Goldman because I wanted her to know that I was telling the truth compared to you know, her entire life story. She asked my friend for an internship at Goldman right there on the phone lol) Anyways, back to my story, she thought I was really nice and thought I was different from the rest of the guys she had met...Yeah...ok, this is definitely something a stripper says. She said she was aiming to make at least a billion dollars and she said it was very doable if you have the right mindset.  mmmm, ok.... :/

So then of course, I asked if she did anything else for money.  ""No, not really"".  Hmmm.  Sounds fishy.  We had discussed her love of traveling, her high end fashion (apparently she also owned part of a Canadian fashion company in Toronto and wanted to take it public, ok...), cars, mansions that she was in the middle of buying, blah blah blah. Of course, she said she was ""a model"" but never gave me an exact description of her work and felt finance was much more her strong suit.  

After talking about her million dollar investments in apartment complexes and her oil deals, she said at this point that she was in medical school at a so called university close by.  Fortunately, I had friends in the medical program going there at the time and asked her if she knew such and such, and she just said...""well, I'm taking time off right now""...This was probably 2 minutes after she just told me she was going to medical school.  I asked her where she went for undergrad and she couldn't even answer the question again.  (Now, I know you're all thinking, she's lying to me to protect her identity, but no, later on, she actually invited me up to her small 1 bedroom apartment for tea after that dinner...But where was the mansion??? I wanted to see the mansion, not some shitty apartment!   I did go up that night but only for a minute to see it.  She was a borderline hoarder as well but this story is long enough as is.  It was fascinating seeing her natural cluttered habitat) . Now, I'm no doctor but I'm pretty sure you need to go college before claiming you're in a very prestigious medical program.  It was getting really fucking weird.  But somehow, surrounded by all this bullshit, I wanted to know how much more she would say.

Out of the blue, I then ask her if she likes dancing. (lol).  She says she likes it.  She has been a ballerina dancer, does salsa, and oh she strips from time to time... lol.  Finally, she admits she is a dancer but she says it so casually that it's pretty funny.  Like someone who's like, I like to drink from time to time, and sure, in my off time, I do crack cocaine, no big deal.

That's her full time job but somehow with all the other things she does, she forgot to mention her real job.  She told me the two locations she dances at and in reality, I was so over her disgusting fake claims, that the stripper thing didn't even interest me at this point.  This girl was really, really dumb and I'm pretty sure, actually crazy because it was like she believed all the stuff she was telling me was true.  She didn't even recognize that she was a stripper and had no education, but thought she could get an internship at GS.  I've never met someone so disconnected before from their actual self.  I really felt bad for her so at that point.  I became incredibly nice to her and said, ""wow, you seem to be doing a lot of really cool things.  I'd love to hear more about it next time if you want."" (Aka. *I need to bail on this crazy ass).  She said, absolutely.  She said, ""All my life, I've known I have a special gift and I know I'm very intelligent.  I was offered a scholarship to Yale when I was 14.""...I go, ""really, did you go?!"".  She explained all this nonsense about not having the money.  ""But they gave you a scholarship meaning you won't have to pay for it.  What happened?"".  I'm pretty sure she didn't even know what a scholarship was.  She said, ""I was just too young.""  Now that I believe! Holy shit was this girl messed up.  

""Tell me about this gift that you have,"" I said.   The good news was that she liked that I was asking her about her interests versus trying to get into her pants and talk about bullshit like being a formula one driver or something stupid.  She goes, ""I can control fire."".

""What?,"" I ask.  

""When I was a kid, I would just stare at a candle and when I wanted the fire to get bigger, I would use my mind and the flame would get bigger. I knew I had the power.""

(Just as a side note, if anyone ever says they have super powers, just ask them to show you them.  It's a pretty easy way to determine if they are a mutant.  Unfortunately on this glorious night, there was no candle at our table.  Damn.

Ok, what am I dealing with here exactly on this exquisite Tinder date...A multibillion dollar, one woman corporation owner, half doctor/half fire flame controlling savant who occasionally strips from time to time on a 3 to 4 nights a week basis.  I really wish I was making this story up, but she said all of this in one quick dinner and she kept in contact with me for quite awhile asking questions about business.  I started to lose touch after the first year as I met a lovely woman who I am still with but for awhile, she messaged me on Facebook and Instagram.  One time, she asked for money, but what was weird about it was, it wasn't some small amount.  No she asked for $2000 randomly after not talking in probably 10 months.  Of course, she got mad at me when I said, ""No, sorry, I'm really not in the market right now (lol)"" 

Like a stage 5 clinger, she went straight to a factor of 10 in the crazy department, and sent a 4 page rant facebook message to me on how she imagined us being together but she hated me now and didn't understand why I didn't give her the money.  I didn't even read the whole thing, I just deleted it because it was too long and I knew she just needed mental help.  I wasn't scared, just felt bad for her. 

But to this day, I've never met anyone that weird before.  What do you call people who do this?  What mental illness does she have? Her Instagram was also probably the strangest thing that a lot of dumb people do.  She would use fake images and put up a picture of a Ferrari and an Aston Martin, and say, ""Test driving today.  I can't decide which car I'm going to buy now"" or ""Wish me luck on trying to close on this multimillion property"".  Keep in mind, this is the same girl who needed $2000 from me quickly for whatever, lived in a 1 br apartment, and drove...a KIA, yep, when we left dinner that night, she drove in her KIA and said she liked it because it was economical. (For once, I was actually impressed by her logical choice a car)

But her fake story.  Her fake story on Instagram...ughhh...It's just so repulsive knowing that so many people lie their asses off on social media.  She probably had 5000 pictures of her self with the same sucked in cheeks Zoolander pose...Maybe it was just in case she forgets what she looks like?  I know she's still doing the same stuff as before and no, I don't go to strip clubs, not since I was 21 on vacation in LV at least. The experience really opened my eyes up to desperation and pretending to be someone, especially on the internet.  Like she was catfishing her own self or some weird shit where she could go online and go, ""see that's me!  Look at all my stuff!"" 

I still remember the tinder experience very well and feel incredibly lucky that I met someone normal right after but pretty much everyone else who I met after, seemed normal.  Holy shit.  Sorry, A LOT said in this post but I tend to write a lot when I write and I apologize for the bore.  Anyone met a similar person remotely close to a person like this?"
80u4wn,1,2018-02-28,Negotiating Software Developer Intern Wages,Doug_Billings,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/80u4wn/negotiating_software_developer_intern_wages/,"Hi reddit! I am currently a second year student studying Computer Science in Northeast Ohio (Mahoning County), and I’ve been presented with a software engineering internship opportunity for a small company here. I am not locally from here, so I would have to rent an apartment to stay in for the duration of the summer. I plan on working full time with the company during the summer.

 I have yet to discuss wages with the employer, so my question to reddit is, how much should I ask for? How do I go about negotiating the wages? 

I’ve done some  budgeting for the summer and I can possibly live comfortably in an apartment for around $1,000/month (this only includes rent which comes with utilities, my phone bill, and my insurance). Should I account for more things? 

Assuming I work 40 hours a week during the summer, how much should I aim to earn hourly? I’m not entirely sure what the average wages are for second year software interns at a small company. My goal is to ask as high as I can without being too unreasonable. I’d like to save a sizable amount of cash this summer to help pay off my student debt (plus the extra money is always very nice).  

Thanks in advance!"
80ua5t,2,2018-02-28,How's Cmpt at SFU? Urgent replies plz (Application deadline Feb 28),apartgill,simonfraser,https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/80ua5t/hows_cmpt_at_sfu_urgent_replies_plz_application/,"Hey I am a second year student at the University of Alberta who was interested in transfer to SFU for computer science. I am honestly fed up with the UofA's CS program so I was looking to see what your input was on the CS program at SFU. I am a relatively inexperienced programmer, having only picked it up after starting university for context, and am looking to work as a software engineer/developer upon graduation. I will list Some issues I have with the U of A and then hopefully you can provide feedback on these areas at SFU. 

1) U of A lacks a co-op program, only having a internship program (glorified job portal in which pretty much have to find jobs independently). So how is SFU's co-op program in terms of landing an internship, and the quality of internship. Do Silicon Valley companies, or other tech companies recruit from SFU or is just primarily Vancouver/smaller companies? How common is it for students to land internships with ""Big 4"" companies?

2) Poor quality of teaching at the U of A, with many profs seeming disinterested and just poor instructors, and essentially leaving students to figure it out for themselves. Additionally, the classes are very theory intensive, with minimal applications covered and very difficult. How is the quality of teaching at SFU, and is the course material more practical, in addition to theory? I understand theory is important, however esp for courses like algorithms I feel at least some applications would be useful. Also, are there software engineering project courses?

3)Is the Burnaby campus the primary SFU campus for CS? How is the student life? U of A is a commuter school, so was looking to see how SFU is for school spirit and campus life.

4)At least from my understanding, SFU seems to be a smaller university (esp compared to the U of A/UBC). Do you feel this hinders the availability/diversity of courses offered, and/or job offerings? Especially in more research/theory based fields like machine learning?

5) What is the approximate size of classes at SFU for cmpt 2nd year and on?

6) U of A classes seemed to be geared for those looking to pursue grad school, research(i.e very theory heavy as mentioned before, etc). Is this the same type of feel at SFU, or does it seem to prepare you for industry?

7)Would you recommend SFU overall, and do you think it has prepared you well for after graduation (job prospects/satisfaction, knowledge,etc)?

Thanks for taking the time to help me out. "

80v0ix,1,2018-02-28,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/80v0ix/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"I hope you can tell from my sparkling prose that I'm an adult. I'm also only looking for adult partners for roleplay - its like let's pretend only stickier

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

80vnpn,20,2018-02-28,My [19M] girlfriend [18F] of 1.5 years expressed desire to be with and have sex with someone else,ittathrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/80vnpn/my_19m_girlfriend_18f_of_15_years_expressed/,"Throwaway as she visits Reddit sometimes.
Sorry if this post is a bit incomprehensible, English isn't my main language and this is the first time either posting here or even writing this down.

We've been in this relationship for a year and five months. We've had some very tough times (I texted a girl some very stupid shit, she has a very complicated past). We've always come back on top.
Lately (the past few months), she sometimes was very snippy. If I made a small mistake like stand in the way in the kitchen, she could lash out at me (not in a particular mean way, but just slightly raising her voice or whatever without any personal insults). She also jokingly insulted me throughout the day. I knew this was jokingly, because she did it in a cute voice and if I got a bit visibly offended she would quickly reassure me that whatever she said wasn't the truth. This was probably a side-effect of her trying anti-depressants, as sometimes after she did something like this she would hug me and tell me she's sorry.
However, like a dick, I did the same thing back. Partly consciously as ''payback'' or some other stupid justification, partly because she made me feel like shit at those times and then i'd be in a bad mood too.

Lately, she started hanging out with someone from our class. She also has her internship with him, so she's basically with him monday through friday, only monday i'm also with her.
She texted and snapped him a lot, and I showed frustration at this. I recognize it's jealousy on my part. She said there was nothing to worry about, and later asked if it was ''okay'' if she hung out with him. I said sure.
Since then, she told me she felt a bit uncomfortable about the situation because 'it kinda felt wrong even though there was nothing weird going on'. She also had a dream where she cheated on me... with me. 
Later on I text her something, and when she doesn't reply (she normally replies very quickly) I ask if she's playing a game or something. She replies she's hanging out with the guy. It was ~23PM.

Here I made the mistake of getting mad at her and ignoring her. She did this to me too the times she was mad, so I thought it was justifiable. I ignored her 'goodnight' text, and read her 'goodmorning' text and only responded some hours later. She asked me if something was wrong and I told her what I thought. She said there was nothing to worry about 'and even hung out with the guy before yesterday'. To me, this felt like she kept it a secret (she later said she wasn't). I, like an asshole, ignored her for the rest of the day again.

A few days later we see eachother in person. After some general talking, I notice she's a bit off. I ask if there's something wrong, and after a bit of pushing she admits something. See, my GF posts on GoneWild sometimes. And she accidentely let that slip in a conversation to him that was related to the topic. The guy proceeded to look her up, and found her. 
So we talked, I ended up crying, talked more.
And then she told me she wasn't happy with 'us'.

In my 'being a dick' to her, she felt worthless and got 'pushed' towards him. And no she likes him, he likes her, and she wants to do sexual things with him. She wants to 'have sex with other people before she dies'.
(I should also explain I have a big problem with premature ejaculation and didn't think to get help about it, but after this talk I did order some delay gel and if that doesn't work i'll go to a doctor)

I said she shouldn't see him anymore but she said she still will, because he makes her happy. I said i'm gonna try my best to make her happy (I know what I did wrong and I can fix it), but in the meantime she will still keep seeing him and even said that, even though she won't try to *start* something, if something sexual happens 'she won't stop it'.
We've talked a lot, we cried a lot, I had a minor panic attack. Since then they hung out twice. I drank a bit during those times, since I was very anxious the entire time because I couldn't stop thinking about them possibly having sex. I never drink and I can stop myself so it won't turn into a drinking problem or whatever, it's just a tiny bit of alcohol to make me less anxious. 
I paranoidly asked afterwards if there was anything she wanted to confess. She said no both times and I believe her.

We've talked about everything, like open relations and whatnot, and at that point I said I was slightly open to the idea, the more I think about it now the less i'm okay with it. I don't want to share her.

When we talk and whatever everything still seems normal. She still loves me a lot, I still love her a lot. I really don't want to lose her, I was very depressed for years before I met her and she basically singlehandedly pulled me out of it. She made me finally have emotions again, and she's my first girlfriend. We are a perfect match on almost every part. And I really don't want to lose her, but I've already been mentally preparing myself for a breakup.
 
I just want to know what I should do, and, as weird as it sounds, how I ''should'' feel. I know i'll probably get some advice I really won't like, but it feels good to vent this in the first place and hopefully the advice will help too.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I pushed my girlfriend to another guy by being a dick, now she likes him and wants to have sex with him but we still love eachother."

We have these digital screens around the SU that play our internal adverts, and external paid adverts. Right now they run off this ancient splitter system that doesn't work 80% of the time, and no-one really gets it.

I was thinking there must be a simpler way to do this via Amazon Fire sticks. The idea would be to plug the sticks into the TVs around the SU, and run an app on them which would have all the adverts loaded as a slide show, and screen it through the day. 

I had the idea of using Kodi, with a phone app as the remote. From what I understand, you can control multiple fire sticks at once with the app. I'm not sure if I'd be able to send the pictures wirelessly to screens.

Ideally, there would be an app on all of them that we can install on our computer. We upload the adverts to this app on the computer, and the slideshow is shown on all the screens. 

If anyone has any idea on how to achieve this, please let me know!

I am a graphic design student and need a laptop I can take to school as well as work when I get an internship. It needs to be fast enough to quickly run multiple adobe apps (photoshop, illustrator, etc) with no noticeable slowdowns. I am also a PC gamer, and would like a laptop with a graphics card that will run games on high-ultra and last me a long time until I need a new one.

Originally I was planning on getting a dedicated gaming PC, as well as a macbook for work, but ever since I saw the specs on the surface book 2, it seemed perfect for what I need. The pen is also a huge plus, as I would like to do more art and illustration.

But before I drop over $2k on a laptop, which is a lot for me, I need to know if it is truly worth it for my needs, and would last me at least 3-4 years. 

Also a few additional questions, how well does the surface book 2 compete with macbooks on speed and performance? and does the 16gb vs 8gb ram make a huge difference in running programs and gaming?

Edit: forgot to ask, do these ever go on sale, aside from the 10% student discount? Is it worth waiting for one, I won't be able to afford it for another 2 or 3 months anyway so I don't mind waiting a little bit, unless it's never gonna happen."

After talking to people from a little over a dozen companies, this was the common theme:


A) Person was either an intern or a fresh hire, and had no clout in the hiring process.

B) Company was technically collecting resumes but the vibe was that the whole pile would probably end in a recycle bin, because...

C) They just directed you to their online application process.


I'm a computer science major. I don't need a career fair to tell me a company is hiring or what a company is about, and if I do, that should be an immediate disqualification for employment in a computer science position. Overall, I felt the fair was just an event for companies to sell their own brand rather than for me to sell mine.

80yvf1,50,2018-02-28,"I worked for a Social Media Admin for a""independent distributor"" of an MLM for three weeks.",JonathanRL,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/80yvf1/i_worked_for_a_social_media_admin_for/,"I had been unemployed for pretty much all my life at that point. A diagnosis coupled with a rough school time pretty much guaranteed that alongside a burnout from my first job. So when I saw an ad about a Social Media administrator, I jumped on it. 

The state unemployment agency encouraged me and even told the company they could have my work for free - as an intern while I still was on government support. They did that without asking btw. But the mlm got interested as you may imagine. The MLM wanted me to work for free (states dime) for 12 months. We talked it down to three months. I lasted three weeks. 

Here are some of the wierd shit during those weeks:

*  The interview was wierd as fuck. It was less about my skills managing social media and more about their company. They actually served us the product to eat during the interview. They pretty much glanced over - then ignored - the work samples I brought. They hired me on the spot still. Of course, he also expressed a desire for me to ""start in sales"". 

* The Operation was a classic setup I learned later on. Have people come in for either free health scans or a free gym session - then highly encourage them to purchase product. Getting the people was my job. I was never given any equipment. I had to use my own laptop for the work. 

* The boss made a point that everyone should start at Lunch. His big sell was that everybody got a sleep-in. This annoyed me to no ends. I rather get my work done as soon as possible in the morning. Considering we often worked late into the night, I cannot help to think it was a plan to isolate us from other people because after some work days, there was a pub night. I never went to those. The Division had just been released, dammit.  

* My days was never spent doing any actual social media stuff. Aside from being used as IT Support whenever something went wrong,  my boss did not want me to use Facebook or Twitter or Instagram to promote. No. He wanted me to create about a 100 sites that either promised people to get rich quick or told people they where going to die. Oh, and our list of customers was on the same server as these sites. Our security was non-existent. For this reason, I was gained FTP access to one site at a time and had to manually install Wordpress each time instead of using the web interface. 

* Aside from that, I kept getting documents sent to me from my boss about people who invested in the Product and got money from it. I was highly encouraged to read it ""at once"". Of course it was another attempt to get me into sales. All it did was make me ask my boss how a Dishwasher got 10 000 bucks to invest from. 

* The most hearbreaking stuff was however our clients. Most of them figured out the scam once they saw the ""health scan"". It was pretty much a scale on a wire but they said it ""used magnetic fields to find diseases"". Most bought something because ""the scan had been free"". The smart ones ran - some actually literally. I cheer internally every time that happened. 

* The walls was full of diplomas of different levels the people had reached, almost all of them about the ""rich rewards"" possible at the next level. All of them had ridiculous titles. My boss had the most ridiculous of them all and he would use that title in conversation. 

* Our most successful event was the gym evenings, this after I used our social media accounts to spread the word of our more loyal fans. How they could even be called gym evenings is beyond me; there was a few run of the mill exercises, then endless talk about the product. 

* What made me snap was what I saw around me. The complete blind obedience to the system by the four or five people who ran the operation. They relied on the boss for their paycheck; a paycheck that was delivered the usual mlm way. They had to sell or starve. A new seller was recruited. He was brought past me and told ""I had already made large gains in my position."" An hour later he sat down and tried to talk an old lady into buying more than she actually wanted or could afford while I worked on another site like the one that may have brought the lady there. 

* I took the boss aside and told him I thought the entire thing was a scam and walked out the same day. He tried to make me leave my computer as it contained ""business secrets""; I told him that if he tried that I would call the cops and he relented.  I called my Government contact and told him about it. He wanted me to go back. The next day, my boss called the Gov Contact to tell him that his company was not a fraud like I had claimed. This in a 30 minute monologue. I was allowed to quit. 

* Nowadays I work as an office manager at a environment organisation. Could not be happier. Learned a bit from working with the mlm and it has helped me in my current profession. 

Remember kids, do not do mlms ^^

My problem is that the summer is coming and I don't have any plans for it. I don't like to waste my time when I can learn something new or work on a project.  I am thinking for some weeks to find an internship for this summer. To work during summer on a project alone from scratch is a good idea, but an internship would be a challenge for my career. As I mentioned I am in the first year of college and my knowledge is limited for now.  I think the first step would be to write a  CV, but my achievements aren't too great at this point. I worked on some projects by myself during the last semester, I even made a simple game in Python( https://github.com/nchj/FoodCapture ), but I don't think it's enough for applying on an internship. Another problem is that I don't know when is the best time for applying on an internship.

I have an internship in May, went there for an interview a while ago, I soon as I start my internship there, I'll start to take my driving license.
I'm too stressed everyday with thoughts that keep beating me up, I'm too worried about if I'm going to sustain myself or not, worried about all world crisis, but the most important thing is.. I'm so worried with things like water, etc.. I'm too afraid of we reaching a point where the water isn't enough to people, some areas in this world are already experiencing this, I know I'm too young but I just cant help it, worried about all the technology that is changing us, yesterday I went to a bar with my math teacher drinking a beer, chilling, and we talked about technology about like almost 2 hours, no joke, nowadays, people are so afraid to have a personal conversation face-to-face, it's almost all done by pc, or a smartphone whatever, the face that people don't care anymore about feelings, etc, It fucking messes with me
I'm taking computer science, and I know guys that spend almost entire day just playing computer, dont leave their room etc, I barely bring my smartphone to school anymore, just use my pc for educational purposes, and I got to think how people are so disconnected from everything.."

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

I just finished my first semester and I recently started the new one. In the first semester I studied Python and Assembly x86, which I liked both, and in the new semester I will study C, C++ and Unix. I am looking forward to studying them. My problem is that the summer is coming and I don't have any plans for it. I don't like to waste my time when I can learn something new or work on a project.  I am thinking for some weeks to find an internship for this summer. To work during summer on a project alone from scratch is a good idea, but an internship would be a challenge for my career. As I mentioned I am in the first year of college and my knowledge is limited for now.  I think the first step would be to write a  CV, but my achievements aren't too great at this point. I worked on some projects by myself during the last semester, I even made a simple game in Python( https://github.com/nchj/FoodCapture ), but I don't think it's enough for applying on an internship. Another problem is that I don't know when is the best time for applying on an internship.

But there is the risk that I can lose some opportunities for internships.  I am asking which would the best start for a fresh CS student  be?"
8106gx,429,2018-02-28,The mental health system in New Zealand is a fucking joke [tw: suicide],HipsterElk,newzealand,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/8106gx/the_mental_health_system_in_new_zealand_is_a/,"Two weeks ago I got a call at work from my partner who has long suffered mental health issue and was currently seeking help for it through an out patient group. She told me she wanted to commit suicide and the only thing that had stopped her was in a moment of clarity she flushed the pills she had planned on overdosing on then called me. I managed to keep calm and talk her into going back to her group and seeking further help through that and hospitalisation (Which was her idea as she felt unsafe), which she agreed to in her desolate state. Here's where the absolute fuckery begins. She returns to her group, gets told she'll get sent straight to the hospitalisation unit for evaluation, she travels straight there after her group, only to be told there's nothing she can do and she'll have to return to the hospital for evaluation by the Emergency Psychiatric Service (here by noted as EPS) so she once again has to get into a cramped shuttle surrounded by people while experiencing the lowest of the lows a human mind can. 

She gets put into the ER, surrounded by people, has a complete panic attack and is moved into a fucking staff room where she tells them at this point she just wants to run away and kill herself (She tells me this as well as I return from work but I work over an hour away, I tell her to stay there) they have two security guards watching her after this. Eventually EPS is able to see her. She has to go through two evaluations, one by a nurse (After this is done I'm there and able to support her) we then wait an hour for the doctor to give a more in depth one to judge whether or not she can be hospitalised. We're told they're absolutely slammed, I'm not that surprised. Eventually the doctor can see her, the evaluation takes a little over an hour. An hour of traumatising questions that she answers knowing that this is what she needs to do after an already exhausting and draining day.

We're told after this there are no beds and nothing they can do. Absolutely nothing. She has to come home with me. We're told at this point they'll call us and do daily check ins, this never happens. I call in to work the next day and tell them I can't come in tomorrow and luckily have the Monday/Tuesday off. I spend the weekend caring for her, give all our knives to a friend and any medication is stored away in my work bag that I then take to work with me when I go. A few days go past and she's stopped eating entirely. I manage to get her onto up n go but no actual food. up n go and coffee is it. A few days go past, i return to work and she goes back to group, but is feeling no better and still at risk, though she's able to suppress her urges. The next weekend rolls around and her mood dive bombs. I have to call off work Monday to make sure she's safe because we both felt she was at risk of an attempt or serious self harm.

It's at this point I make a call to EPS, they of course want us to come back in but my partner wants to know if beds are actually available before re-traumatising herself again and wasting hours of her life going through an incredible stressful procedure just to find out whether or not they can do ANYTHING.

They're not allowed to tell us until an evaluation is done. My partner refuses to go. They tell us our two options are: Come in for an evaluation or wait till OPG the next day as they'll be able to hospitalise her if need be.(My partner tells me this is incorrect as she was told that her OPG doesn't have the power to do this) We decide to not go in, my partner goes to group like normal. The nurse on the phone gives us some tips, aka the same bullshit we've all been told a million times, take a walk, watch some tv, have a shower, simple distraction methods that don't work with severe mental health issues. (This is what we feel, its a personal opinion that relates to us)

Then we come to yesterday. I finish early. I get a text on my way home, she's feeling suicidal and wants to deeply self-harm, at this point she's completely shut down and having a breakdown, I contemplate calling the police but opt for our close friend, but she doesn't want to see him. I get her to call the crisis line: straight to voicemail. I assure her I'll call EPS when i'm home and see if we can arrange a time to come down so we don't have to wait in there for hours just to be seen which will lower her anxiety, she agrees. Crisis team ring her back within this time frame of me coming home and she's told EPS is expecting her and we have our friend drive us down as soon as I'm home. 

We go through another short evaluation (Where I express my extreme displeasure at this entire fucking debacle) and get told there's no beds, we can wait around two+hours to see a doctor (At the end of which there could still be no beds or anything they can do) or return home and have an appointment booked for us in the morning to see the doctor directly. We go with option B, I take another day off work. 

She feels a little better this morning, both feel like we might actually get something done today. She goes to group, I come down when her appointment is ready, we go in and there's a facilitator and social worker waiting for us.

They tell us the appointment should never have been made and she'll have to see her psyche in group (Who is an intern and has so far been completely disconnected from her) back up at the hospitalisation unit later in the day. At this point she just completely shuts down crying. Doesn't say anything, I once again express my displeasure and how we have been getting absolutely no help from anyone, we are desperate, I'm feeling unsafe and so is she. They apologise but can't comment they leave us to try get a plan in place.

as soon as they leave my partner lets out a heartbreaking wail. Have you ever seen the person you love most in this entire word in so much anguish? to see them break like that? I could do nothing but hold her and cry myself. The frustration, the anxiety, the stress and exhaustion. I work long gruelling hours in a back breaking job then come home and care for my partner who I love and cherish in this harsh world. I have to face the fear of coming back home to see her strung up from a low hanging beam in our bathroom by an extension cord which seems to be coming closer and closer to reality by the day. Fuck if I hadn't finished yesterday she fucking well could have killed herself before I was home. She needs help, I need help, we're getting nothing, absolutely nothing but fucked around.

We have an appointment with this doctor later in the day, but if he's unable to see us for any reason we have to go back to EPS, to do an evaluation, to get told there's no bed and I'll have to take another day off work.

the cherry on top of this shit sundae? My referral for mental health help got declined. "
8107mn,1,2018-02-28,Investment and job opportunity questions? 10k to invest and I'm currently making 22kyr at 19. I've read the sidebar.,jq1998,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8107mn/investment_and_job_opportunity_questions_10k_to/,"I'm currently attending community college for my AA in Computer Technology.. I'm not sure how to obtain internships or promote myself, but I will set this challenge aside for a better time.

In my job I handle accounts (call center) but I would like to translate this experience into something more impressive. Though, I understand I would need additional expertise if I want to get into the corporate/business field.

I understand it isn't possible for me to make 50-60k within the next few years if I'm not already on that path, but the year is fresh and I'm optimistic for the future. What careers or opportunities are out there for young adults with an AA? Ideally something more than 30k so I can get on track to purchasing a few properties leading to my retirement.

I recently transferred a portion of my savings into one of the Money Market savings account and now its accruing 1.45% per year... that isn't nearly enough for the goals and objectives I need to meet. I want to retire before 30 or I quite literally cannot continue to run in this hamster wheel. I've heard of the magic of turning a small amount and snowballing it into an early retirement. Is it still feasible?

What should I invest in to create a ""portfolio""?

Which website would you personally recommend that are beginner friendly?

Thank you."

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
