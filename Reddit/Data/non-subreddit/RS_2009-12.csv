Last year I spent a few hours with a customer buying a few mac pros for his studio. After the sale he gave me his information and told me to give him a call if i ever need anything. Six months later I was on an internship with Capitol Records and traveled across Asia on their expense :D

Anyone else had some similar experiences, or met any other amazing customers?"
abjpo,0,2009-12-05,Dear Reddit: I'm a sophmore CE major in Minnesota and I'm looking for internships and advice,lordloss,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/abjpo/dear_reddit_im_a_sophmore_ce_major_in_minnesota/,"Like the title says, I'm going to school for computer engineering and I'm starting to look for internships for next summer after my junior year. I'm interested to hear from others on how they went about finding an internship or how they were able to stand out and get noticed. 

I'm not sure how to market myself against all of my classmates, all of us have taken the same classes and those classes are pretty much the same as all the classes the other schools offer too. At this point almost all my math and physics is done and i'm almost done with circuits. As far es extra curricular activities go, i'm participating in a robotics competition where we are designing something to navigate through a maze.

If anyone has gotten an engineering internship or gives out internships, what do they/you look for?"
acojx,0,2009-12-09,"Reddit, I need to come up with $6K by the end of December or I don't get to go to college.",Imagist,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/acojx/reddit_i_need_to_come_up_with_6k_by_the_end_of/,"I don't have high hopes of getting anywhere with this, but I'm running out of options and I don't want to give up hope until I've tried every single thing I can possibly think of to get myself out of this mess.  Asking Reddit for help is one of those things.  So here goes.

I'm a 22-year-old college student studying computer science at Drexel University in Philadelphia.  I am trying to transfer to a less-expensive school, but I can't do that until Drexel sends my transcripts to the schools I've applied to.  And Drexel won't do that until I've paid them the money I owe them: $5914.70.

I'm not looking for a free ride.  I am looking for one of two things:

1. A cosigner for a loan.
2. Work that will pay up-front.

I have internship experience in web development and also in Java development.  Off the job I have done extensive work in Python and C.  I am also a somewhat-skilled tenor and I have been teaching karate to children for a few years.  I have been a Redditor for a while.

I am offering the following:

1. 400 hours of work using any skills I have, to be completed ASAP and no later than 2010 AND my sincerest promises not to default on the loan, in exchange for cosigning my loan.  The 400 hours figure is intended to represent working off the full $6000 of the loan at $15/hour.  In comparison, my last job paid $18.75/hour.

2. 400 hours of work using any skills I have, to be completed ASAP and no later than 2010, AND the full loan paid back by 2015, if you would be willing to pay up front ASAP.  If multiple people want to give money, I am willing to split up my hours between people.

I will sign whatever contracts are necessary to make you feel safe that you won't be ripped off.  I would be willing to travel wherever public transit will take me in the Philadelphia area.

[Here](http://imgur.com/7AKbt) is a picture of my bill in the Drexel financial system.  If you can think of any other ways I can verify that my situation is as I say it is without getting my identity stolen, I'll happily provide the information.  I'll also send you my resume if you PM me.

Feel free to ask me any relevant questions.  Please help a fellow Redditor out."

It's a surreal comedy about a computer hacker and his team of interns as they stuggle to complete a big project on time. 

I feel like I'm really behind the game in terms of marketing and promotion of the film (getting the film into the public's consciousness) because it's just the two of us and we spend so much time working on the actual film. I'd really like to take the film as far as it can go after its done, in terms of festivals, distributors, and press. 

Anyone here have any experience with all that, either as a filmmaker working with publicists, festival strategists, etc., or as someone in one of these fields? I would really love to talk to some people about this stuff.

adqq9,62,2009-12-11,How Not To Conduct a Relationship: A cautionary tale,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adqq9/how_not_to_conduct_a_relationship_a_cautionary/,"First, although I'm not sure it's actually relevant, I'm a 32-year-old female.

Secondly, I am currently ""on a break"" from an off-and-on six-year relationship. He's 30, and almost completely blameless. 

Briefly, when we began dating, I was a 26-year-old with a fantastic job that brought me both a sense of fulfillment and a nice salary. In addition, I was about to embark on a solo trip to Germany to spend a month with friends I made through my university's exchange program (including a German man I was in a relationship with until I met my current boyfriend; the German confessed to me that he met a girl closer to home, too, so we ended our involvement mutually and amicably). I had so much going on in my life at that time that I felt good about, that I didn't feel I needed a partner. The physical contact and companionship were great, but not something I was focused on. I left for Germany after this guy and I -- we'll call him D -- had been seeing each other for a month. I came back a month later, and he was so enamored with me that he formally asked me to be his girlfriend. As in, he took me to dinner, took my hand in his, and said, ""Would you be my girl?"" I had never had that happen before, and the gesture was off the charts in terms of its romanticism. Finally, I was experiencing the kind of love I no longer believed existed.

About three months later, the unexpected happened: I lost my job. I had been in my position for seven years by that point, which started out as an unpaid internship and progressed rather quickly to my running the department after I had seriously impressed the owners of the company. Because I had focused so much on my career, the job loss was devastating to me. For as long as I live, I will never forget how hollow I felt as my boss told me he was going to have to let me go. He sent me on my merry way with a mere two weeks' salary and a letter of reference. I lost it. D was right there, and he did everything a fantastic boyfriend would do to cheer me up. I gave myself a day to grieve and then hit the pavement. Everything I applied to, I was turned down for. The first week, I had four interviews. Then two the following week. Then one. Then none. Fast forward another three months and I lost everything I owned. Apartment, car, furniture... all of it. In four months' time, my world was turned upside down. I moved back in with my mother and had to face the tumultuous relationship with her I had avoided for many years by that point. 

I'm giving a lot of information here, and I should probably zoom out a bit. In the interest of brevity (too late), I'll say that it took me eight months from the time I was let go to find a crappy stop-gap job that paid me less than half of what I was making before. My debts accumulated, my credit score plunged, and I was utterly and completely without a way out of the hole I found myself in. I moved in with D at that point, but by then, I had become an entirely different person than the dynamic girl he had fallen in love with: I was fixated, utterly and completely, on him and our relationship. Where I had once simply enjoyed his presence in my life, I now *needed* him, and when he wasn't right there, I freaked the fuck out. Almost immediately, the pressure became too much for him, and I ended up back at my mother's (after a brief stint in a mental institution following a total breakdown). We didn't speak for a few months, and I eventually began dating other people. D was there to listen to me as I told him about the guy who showed up to our date and proceeded to tell me all the ways he'd like to defile Britney Spears, and the other guy who strung me along for several weeks before admitting that I was his ""side project."" Many months later, D and I were back together, but the damage had been done: I had a crappy, low-paying job, no ability to return to or pay for school, nothing else in my life from which I could derive even the most remote sense of satisfaction, and the moment we were together again, he became my world. 

This cycle would repeat itself a few times. I eventually got back into my own place, but it was too expensive for me. There were entire weeks I wouldn't have eaten if not for D. My father died recently and it affected me deeply; of my two parents, even though my father was two states away, I had the vastly less dysfunctional relationship with him. I repaid D for his kindness by fixating on the mistakes he made, no matter how big or small, rather than by appreciating him for all the wonderful things he did for me. And most recently, I had become consumed by the kind of jealousy I had only heard about from my guy friends whose girlfriends were utter psychos. Any female he talked to heralded the imminent end of our relationship; they were young, fun, attractive, and going places... all things I could no longer claim for myself. In my struggle to be his number one, I lost sight of myself, and became someone with whom he always felt on edge. His every move was under constant scrutiny as I looked for signs that he was about to leave me. On some level, I knew I brought nothing to the table, yet that wasn't enough to knock some sense into myself. And although he may not yet have left for good, I have to face the possibility that maybe he has. It destroys me, because we had some amazing times together, and I have dated enough to know that he's rare... but I know I have only myself to blame if this is truly the end.

Even as I sit and think of the things he did that weren't exactly helpful, I have to believe that if I had brushed myself off and continued being the focused, personally satisfied individual he met, I wouldn't be writing this. I've been so content to believe all this time that he caused these reactions in me, when it was really the other way around. 

Today, I registered for classes. It's the first time I've been back in school since before we met, and the act of paying off my old debt to the university and signing off on the classes I needed brought about a feeling I haven't felt in years: pride. I was proud of myself for taking this step, and it suddenly doesn't matter if he's surrounded by adorable college-aged girls anymore. I had an idea that it would do this for me, but I really didn't know for sure until I actually made the move. But as I picked up my cell phone to call him and share the good news, I stopped myself: we're not speaking at the moment. At least for a few weeks, maybe for good. I did send him a short email, but I immediately regretted it. I deserve what I'm getting right now and I know it. Still, knowing he's proud of me is important, and I'm having trouble deciding whether that's a good thing. I think it is; who among us doesn't like knowing we're special to someone? 

**Here's the tl;dr**: If you have love, honor it. Honor it by loving yourself. It's bandied about quite a bit, the old saying that you can't love anyone until you love yourself, but it's absolutely true. So for those of you who are smothering your significant other because of an underlying lack of personal satisfaction (and you know who you are), take a step back. Take stock of what is important to *you*, create fulfillment for yourself, and then enjoy your relationship for the ways it enhances your life. And for those of you who are being smothered, show your significant other this post. There's not much I wouldn't do right now to tell my boyfriend how sorry I am, but I have to sit quietly with this for a while and let my actions sink in. I had love, and I killed it. 

Thanks for being my catharsis, Reddit, and I'm sorry for the wall of text.

aemks,0,2009-12-14,CS internship opportunities (preferably) in Europe,biosHazard,programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/aemks/cs_internship_opportunities_preferably_in_europe/,"Hi all, I am currently researching some software engineering internship opportunities for this summer. (never did an internship before). I am a CS student and fairly knowledgeable in all aspects and technologies and had done project-based commercial work for some local software contractors (mostly done .NET and had my fair share of C++, but I am no stranger of Java, Python and Linux environments and algorithms). 

There are a lot of local internship opportunities here (Cluj, Romania), but I want to go abroad and experience living on my own somewhere.
I don't want to make a heap of money, just to support myself once I get there, and to work on something cool and meet some interesting professionals.

So, Reddit, my question is, have any ides of such internships here in Europe?, besides the obvious Google and Microsoft (for which I will try my luck and apply). Where have you completed your internship, how was it? Any tips? 

If you have any suggestions for the US, they are great too, please don't  hesitate to mention them, but my initial thought was for something closer to home."
