dmlpf,8,2010-10-04,I've been underemployed for a year now. Am I dead?,superunderemployed,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/dmlpf/ive_been_underemployed_for_a_year_now_am_i_dead/,"I know that I and thousands of others have similar stories and questions, but I was hoping this subreddit could offer some (actuarial) specific advice to me and those like me.

Last December (Dec. '09), I graduated with a degree in Mathematics, but I was basically an actuarial science major. I would have been an actuarial science major, but I had a poor GPA throughout college, and those three numbers still haunt me today.

Besides my poor GPA, I have no internships under my belt nor do I have any programming skills. If you were to look at my resume, all you would see is a poor GPA at a great university, a layman work history, and minimum computer skills (relative to the actuarial profession).

Since graduation, I've worked hard to pass actuarial exams. I had passed P while in college. Last May I passed FM, and this November I will be taking MFE.

I, myself, know that I am hard-working and that I would succeed given the chance, but that's the catch: given my resume, how do I get my foot in the door?

Who has been in a similar situation and what was the outcome? What advice can you offer to people in my situation?

Thanks reddit!"

Spoken by the late Roger Nickles (my grandfather), this idea has been engrained in my mind for the past 21 years of my life. Just think about it for a second… if we are all thinking the same way (doing the same things, following the same trends, committing the same actions, etc.) then no one is really thinking at all. How can people go their whole lives living exactly like everyone else? Wearing the same trends, shopping at the most popular stores, buying what everyone else has, striving to be like “the Jones’”, speaking the way everyone else speaks, traveling to places because they are the “it” spots, teasing people and making fun of them because everyone else does it, etc. How will our country succeed if no one thinks for themselves? Will we always just follow whatever our friends, family members, teachers, co-workers, politicians, etc. tell us to do?

I currently attend Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa majoring in History and minoring in Sociology. When I was younger my family moved around a lot which meant that we became each other’s friends. My brother and I are still close today, even though he is 25 and lives three hours away with his wife, while I also talk to my parents all the time. Through the years of us moving it was always interesting for me to experience all different kinds of people and a new way of life. I always made good friends wherever I moved and I still keep in touch with some of them today. It has also made me a stronger and more independent young woman and helped me cope with the numerous types of people I met while in college. I spent the first three years of college living in the dorms, and that opened my eyes to the lives of young people my age. I grew up in a very family oriented atmosphere where respect was the key to our everyday lives, and I was absolutely appalled by the amount of disrespect from the people around me. This ranged from swearing to drinking to drugs to vandalism to just plain outright disrespect and lack of common courtesy. Now, trust me, I am not naïve to the world around me. Just because I grew up in a well-mannered, respectful, and family oriented atmosphere does not mean that my family did not make sure I knew what the world was like around me. I knew what I was getting into when I came to college, but it still bothered me a lot when I went to school and saw so much disrespect.

I am now in my 4th and final year at school. I have a great group of friends, a demanding yet rewarding internship, and a new outlook on life and my future. I feel like it is finally time to take a stand on what is going on in this country. Our young people are out of control with their amount of disrespect and I want to show them that just because you are young does not make it right. I am 21 and have never used a swear word or an illegal drug and never even tasted a drop of alcohol until weeks after my 21st birthday. Most people are probably reading this and thinking “this girl is crazy”, but I want to show young people that you do not have to drink, do drugs, use profanity, or be disrespectful to go places in this world. I hope that all of you can read this and find encouragement that a young person is standing up and saying something. I am taking a stand and fighting back against the disrespect and lack of manners in this country, and I hope that all of you out there that agree with me will also stand up and not accept what has happened to the world around us.

TL DR: Trying to get the youth of our country to think more about the way they treat others. Please let me know your opinions.

dntnv,11,2010-10-06,I'm a CS Alumni looking for CS/SE/Math interns for Summer 2011 at Boeing in Seattle,BoeKnows,rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/dntnv/im_a_cs_alumni_looking_for_cssemath_interns_for/,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a 2009 CS grad and I've been working at The Boeing Company since graduation.  My boss has asked me to find us an intern for next summer (I did 2 co-op blocks here before joining full time).


I figured I'd come to Reddit first before Job Zone or whatever weird thing they're using now, because I'm more likely to find the kind of people we're looking for here.

So, we're looking for someone studying computer science or software engineering, but math works too if you have good programming skills.  We develop primarily in C++, but I personally do a lot of Python as well (though it's unlikely you'll get to see a lot of Python. Maybe some?).


We do R&amp;D in artificial intelligence/optimization - mostly route planning and decision making tools - a lot of traveling-salesman type problems. You should know some AI, definitely some graph theory, have a good working knowledge of ""big o"" notation, those sorts of things.

You should also have really strong communication skills. Our interns have had a good share of independence (that is: I won't be micromanaging you, though I'm always super happy to help tackle a hard problem), so it'll be crucial that you can explain to me what you've done with the problem we've given you.  I really look for this and I know my manager does too.


A few examples of the kinds of things we do:

* We're going out to Oregon to fly a [ScanEagle UAV](http://i.imgur.com/cs9hs.jpg) with some of the routing software we've written for it
* We're developing some ship routing software for large cargo ships, and we've had to ride the ships with our software while we tested it
* I worked on a smartphone app to help emergency responders deal with large scale disaster scenarios ([I got to ride around on a police boat](http://i.imgur.com/MX2pD.jpg) while we tested it in a mock scenario)


Boeing is an extremely cool company - we do so many more things than just commercial airplanes (in fact, I've never had anything to do with our commercial airplanes... go figure). 
Our internships are excellent - they pay competitively, and they typically pay to help you relocate.

My group is great and I really love what I do - I'm legitimately excited to go to work on most days.

Also, summer in Seattle is the best. It's sunny and 75 degrees every day. I love it here.

So, if you're interested (or know someone who is)... here's the **[job requisition](https://jobs.boeing.com/JobSeeker/JobView?reqcode=10-1016435)**. Ignore the position description because it's just a generic one they make for us. 

**If you're going to apply**, you should PM me your name first so that I can watch for your resume when it comes. If you're uncomfortable giving out your name over Reddit, just create an alt or ask me for my Boeing email address and you can send it there.

If anyone has any questions (about me, the job, Seattle, anything at all), just leave them in the comments or PM me and we can talk more.

Thanks Reddit!


**Edit:** I forgot, one of the cool things I should mention is that I'm actually starting work on my first patent application this month. Boeing definitely encourages that kind of thing (and pays a bonus for it, too :-D )"

dpggy,2,2010-10-10,Did I make the right choice? I'm having second thoughts...,needadvice88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dpggy/did_i_make_the_right_choice_im_having_second/,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice here, not sure if I made a mistake with my girlfriend... Basically, I am 21, and we have been dating for 6 months, about 3 weeks ago we had a talk on if we should end it or not, we gave it a go for another 3 weeks, and a few days ago we ended it...

Here is the back story: I met this girl through a friend who I thought was cute, although very shy, and I decided to ask my friend her story, and she decided to go out with me. Thing about her is that she's never had a boyfriend before, and I was her first everything (except for sex, that was one of the issues..). We dated for 4 months, and the lack of us doing sexual stuff was a problem, but I was on an internship during this time, so focused on that, that the lack of sex didn't bother me, I was willing to wait at that time. I went off for 2 months and we decided to stay together despite me not being happy about the lack of sex.. We talked a decent amount, but while away for 2 months I really started having doubts, about whether or not we were right for each other... See, the thing is she was raised in a very strict home with religious parents, and while she is religious, she doesn't care that I don't believe in God, she is actually a very smart girl who likes to debate about it with me. She also doesn't drink, which I didn't like at all because I like to go out and have fun once and a while, but I learned to accept it over time... What I did really enjoy about her is that she is a genuinely good person, shy but when it was just me and her we could talk for hours, about random stuff, but still be silly as well. I saw a lot of potential in her, but I felt like I just wasn't 100%. The main thing I think was that I wasn't always crazy about her... There were times when I couldn't wait to see her, and there were times where I wasn't very excited at all, and wondered if I would be better with someone else. When I came back from my two month away time, we got back together, and because she saw that I was willing to wait 2 months for her, she opened up a lot sexually, but without actually having sex (oral and anything else was fine).

At one point, I realized that there were some other girls that I met that I was more into, and that raised alarms for me... enough that it freaked me out enough that I wanted talk to her about whether or not we were right for each other. I just felt like I wasn't having enough fun in the relationship, and being only 21, I wasn't sure if I was ready for such a serious commitment when I felt like in my heart, I wasn't sure... See, she is very serious, and if we were going to have sex, she wanted to be sure that the person she is with is as crazy about her as she is about the person (she told me she loved me, and I'm sure if I said it genuinly back, the sex would not be a problem because we would be having it) But she is such a great girl, she is smart, logical, and we have had some great times in the past. I really truly care about her so much, I was willing to wait this long, but now I was just not sure if I was ready for such a commitment, to make her lost her virginity to me when I wasn't 100% about it... For me, this relationship has just grew progressively, and it came down to a point where sex was going to happen or not happen, and I would have liked it to happen, but knowing that sex would have meant a serious long term commitment really just freaked me out.

See, the thing is that its been bothering me a lot - enough that I feel like it has been effecting school and work. But this breakup hasn't made me better at all, if anything I feel a lot worse... Because I do care about her SO much. 

Reddit, do you think I made a mistake? I feel like there might be a lot I'm missing out here because I feel its pretty complicated, but go ahead and ask any questions you feel you need to ask."
dr7m2,18,2010-10-14,IAmA Person Who Has Been Forced Out of a Church (Twice),wstewart32,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/dr7m2/iama_person_who_has_been_forced_out_of_a_church/,"**What Happened**

First Time:

Started out my church life as a pretty active member in the youth group, at my peak, I was planning a lot of the youth summer trips and preaching on a very regular basis. When my senior year of high school came around I started having an interest in writing satire, I would post them as Facebook notes and tag some friends, it was all in good fun. 

One particular note upset a couple of people, it was dealing with just life and relationships. I shrugged off a lot of the comments seeing as it was a pretty small minority. However, the wife of the youth minister decided to chime in, unfortunately due my laptop breaking, I do not have the note or the comments at my disposal, I might have them in some e-mail correspondance though. She basically insulted my writing ability, my religious views, and just many personal attacks. We never saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things so, like the other comments, I shrugged it off. However, through a weird chain of events, my parents got word of the particular comment (now they have Facebooks, oh well). After chatting up the Minister of Education, it was found out that every primary staff member had a copy of the note on their desk and was planning to hold a staff meeting over it. Needless to say, my parents weren't happy. The main staff had already decided that it wasn't as bad as the youth minister had made it out to be but the damage was already done.

After a couple of meetings, it was clear that the youth minister did not want anything to do with me, he basically said ""In my mind, you've already left us, I don't even see why we are having this conversation."" They actually thought I was trying to overthrow the youth ministry, I don't know how they came to that conclusion though. By this time, word had spread throughout the entire youth group, of course, a lot of it was just conjecture, people's assumptions ranged from drugs to trying to stir a revolution, either way, they made it clear the last time I went for a service that I should pack my bags and move away.

**tl;dr:** Facebook and subsequent rumors got me forced out of a ministry.

Second Time:

Same church, different story (not as much drama).

Up to this point, the old youth minister had tried to reconcile with me (it was obvious that it was a forced attempt). I accepted his apology and even continued to do some behind the scenes work with the ministry, although I never went there again for my time as an actual youth member. However, once I was ineligible to be in the youth, all contact ceased on his part. Shortly after that he was moved to a different ministry of the church and they promoted one of the associate pastors to be the head of the youth ministry.

After my first year in college, I was given the opportunity to become an unpaid intern (which is an important distinction). My job was to mainly form relationships with middle school boys and possibly form a discipleship group, bible studies, etc. I was also going to help with behind the scenes and sharing the preaching duties. 

For the first two weeks, everything was going great, I was forming some relationships, I had already preached on a Wednesday, in my mind, I had gotten out to a pretty good start. Then the first trip of the summer arrived, basic job was to make sure the kids wake up and go to sleep, other than that, myself and the other adults sat around the housing complex and ate food. This is where I really found my stride with some of the less active kids and being the unattainable twenty year old, I was the crush of many middle school girls. Either way, the trip, in my mind was a success. 

When I arrived back home, I had a plethora of plans to help get this ministry moving. The youth minister arranged a meeting with me, this was normal as we had creative meetings every week. However, it was just me and him this time which was strange, to say the least. He sat me down and basically said that my views do not line up with the views of the children's parents, they assumed Libertarian meant Liberal and that Calvinism was of the devil (even though the preacher was a pretty stout five-point Calvinist). A lot of parents thought that I was instilling my beliefs on to their children, I don't know why I would talk about politics and systematic theology with a 13 year old but whatever. 

I was told that I could no longer help with the ministry, I could continue to come but I was to not lead bible studies, discipleship groups, or anything of that nature. It was implied that I shouldn't really even talk to the children. The main thing that got me was the first incident, even when it's almost two years after the fact, there were still rumors and speculations on what happened. 

**tl;dr:** A false perception of my beliefs combined with my previous incident got my forced out of an internship with the same church.

**Why I'm Doing This**

First off, I'm not looking for any sort of pity or sympathy. I appreciate the sentiment though. It is mainly because I'm bored, honestly. However, most of the people who hear the story (it's become kind of a thing when my friends introduce me to someone ""Hey, meet my friend, he got kicked out of a church!!"") are very interested in it and a lot of them sympathize with me. Needless to say, this has altered my faith dramatically, I'm definitely not the same person I was three years ago.

Questions I won't answer would include the name of the church or the name of the people involved.

EDIT: This was meant to be an AMA, I forgot to put it in the title. I guess it's too late for that.

EDIT 2: Albeit, it was meant to be an AMA, I appreciate all the comments, I honestly didn't think it would get this many. I appreciate everyone's encouragement and advice."

However, my life in US has been more fulfilling than I could ever imagine. I have good friends here and the future to look forward to.


Only 2 years ago, I moved to US with one suitcase and almost no money on my bank account. All I had was an acceptance and a partial scholarship for one of the most prestigious art colleges in US.


When I think about it now, the decision to come here was foolish. I knew very well that I couldn't afford to pay for the entire studies and I had no idea how to deal with it. Unlike US citizens, I was not eligible for financial aid and I had no one to help me get a loan. So I just decided to make the first step and hope for the best.


In only few months, I got into financial trouble but fortunately, my mother was able to borrow some money and send it to me. All this time I was looking for job opportunities and I worked on my academic goals very hard. I was motivated like never before, but at the same time I was afraid that I might not make it.


After the first quater, I got a part-time job at the college as a web developer. The job paid enough for housing and food. Then, something amazing happened... I got a paid internship with one of the biggest game development companies in the world! Holy shit... that was more than I believed was possible. My motivation exploded and the shit started to develop exponentially! My student work got published in the geekiest magazine! My scholarship was increased! I got another internship at the biggest computer animation studio in the world and several job offers pending for me after I graduate.


As I said... Im not rich and I probably never will be. I have one suitcase more than I had 2 years ago but my head is filled with amazing experiences that exceeded my dreams. I dont know what my future will be, but I feel it can be anything I imagine and more.

ds3vy,8,2010-10-16,Entry Level IT Jobs in Pittsburgh?,harryarei,pittsburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/ds3vy/entry_level_it_jobs_in_pittsburgh/,"Hello Pittsburgh!


I'm going to be graduating from Penn State in the spring, and I've been looking for jobs after graduation. Pittsburgh is the city I have always wanted to live in (grew up in Central PA, Altoona area). However, there doesn't seem to be many postings on my schools job board for Pittsburgh area.


At a career fair I talked to UPMC, but they won't be looking to hire until 2 months before I graduate which seems a little late to me considering I have gotten a few interviews from other companies. I may just be being impatient because a few of my other friends have already gotten offers.


Anyway, I was just wondering how people see the IT job market in Pittsburgh. To do a quick summary of my skills, I mostly concentrated in development so most of the classes I took were on Software Engineering, mostly in Java. We went through usability, testing, UML, requirements, and of course coding. However, I have also taken classes in Networking and Network Security, and Databases (MySQL). I also have an internship at Penn State providing technical support for the College of Health and Human Development which covers several networks in several buildings across the campus. I have also developed a few web forms and am competent at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Ok, enough with me pitching myself. If anyone has any hints at companies to apply for that would be wonderful. Also, any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for the advice and leads. I got a lot of stuff to look into. If anything comes up I'll be sure to post an update. Thanks again!"

Apparently sysadmins are busy guys and all he offered me at first was a death glare, but Nate’s a Redditor and I could tell he was amused by the idea. He told me that six people around the office had visited Reddit in the past half-hour, but it was up to me to find them.

Technically, I'm an intern, but it's really just a title they give to me because they can't afford to pay me a full salary. Anyway, sometimes when the
photographers are tied up they'll send me out on photo assignments.
Today, it happened that they needed me to meet up with one of our
senior reporters who was at a public school waiting for the kids to be
let out. Yesterday, a food fight erupted that turned into a full scale
riot. It appears to have been racially motivated--every cop in Jersey
City responded and several people were taken to the hospital.

Anyhow, I got to the school and met up with my reporter, who was
shooting the shit with one of the city detectives (a really nice guy
who is sympathetic to the press).Cops had the entire school surrounded and were all over the premises in case violence was to erupt again.

Everything was going fine, until the bell rang. Kids started pouring
out of the school, and I stepped up on the sidewalk by the fence to
snap a few pictures. Suddenly, a female security guard starts power
walking towards me shouting that I was breaking the law on school
property.

Obviously, I knew I wasn't, so I tried to explain to her that the
sidewalk is public property that I was well within my rights, but a
statement like that just goes nowhere. She was getting in my face,
trying to force me off the sidewalk, and telling me to give her my
camera (which belongs to me, not the paper). I refused, and she didn't
try anything as I'm a big guy compared to her. I started to think that
maybe I could be wrong, and that I couldn't take pictures on the
sidewalk after all.

At this point I was pretty mad, so I took a step off the curb onto the street and took a picture of her. I don't have to tell you that this angered her. I know I shouldn't have provoked her. But I inherited my dad's temper, and I have this unnaturally strong need to smack the beehive sometimes (I guess I'm a troll).

So she's shrieking at me at this point and gets on her radio to call
the school's administration. I told her that she could go get the
police if she wanted. She did. While she left I used the opportunity
to get my shots, but then was approached by her, a JC cop, and the
school's principal. The cop asked me to leave, and the reporter I was
with (he's older and more experienced, and I'm 24 and graduated from Rutgers with a degree in journalism in May) told him that we would cross the street to be nice, but that the sidewalk was public property.

They were satisfied enough with that. But then, we got what we needed and left, and I noticed that I was being followed by the school's security truck down Montgomery Ave, and they were on the phone presumably feeding information about my car to the police or
something.

I'm not worried about action being taken against me, but it's very
unnerving to be placed in that position against your will--I really
didn't know what I was getting into.

Anyhow, that's my first experience with something like that and it
definitely wasn't fun. I know I would have been arrested had I pursued
my rights on the spot, with no recourse."

I found this subreddit via r/random one day, and I feel like I could use your suggestions right about now.

Here's some background:

I'm an Asian 20F in a respected, Caucasian male-dominated tech school. I can count the number of people I've dated on one hand, and recount every kiss I've ever had. I've honestly never had a boyfriend. While I enjoy being alone, I still love to go out and party with friends - I'm very much in the partying phase of my life. I do wish I had someone to cuddle and hold hands with sometimes.

Anyways, in my freshman year of college, I got involved in one of the clubs on campus. I happened to notice that the club's president (who is a year ahead) was pretty cute. Fast forward to middle of my sophomore year, I got asked by the president (I'll just refer to him as the boy now) himself to join as a club officer, since one of the officers was away on foreign exchange. I accepted, and joined a whole new social circle of friends, all of whom I love to just chill and party with.

A few weeks later (just before this spring), I just upped and asked him out. I knew he was going across the country for half a year for some pretty important internships, and I figured better late than never. He accepted and we had a date, but it was awkward and stiff. He let me know after that he wasn't looking for a relationship at the moment - I was alright with that, and let it go.

A few weeks after that, I was over at his place for an after-party for a concert that happened that night. I had a few friends from another campus with me, and they needed to make a long drive back, but their stuff was in my room. I gave them my keys and partied on - I had the green light to crash on the sofa at the boy's house. A group of us took a stroll later on, and when him and I got back to the house, we realized that the couches already had people passed out on them. Sucking it up, we decided to share the bed. Emboldened by I-don't-even-know-what (and partially sleeplessness), I asked him if he turned me down because he was not interested, or just because he was busy. He said it was because he was busy, and wasn't willing to start a relationship that was long-distance right off the bat. We got talking, and agreed to try and see how it would go in the remaining time we had left together (2-3 weeks approximately?). We ended up hooking up, but didn't go all the way.

After the weekend passed and hearing no word from him, I texted and called him, and received reluctant responses. What probably hurt the most was the feeling of being ignored and avoided, but I didn't want to bother him since I knew he was busy. The day before he was supposed to leave, he went around and visited everybody, including some friends that lived in the same building as me. He knew I lived there, but he didn't visit me.

I eventually managed to corner him, and got an answer I suspected: no, and that he would be back in the winter.

Fast forward to this past weekend - he came back for a short visit, and of course held a party. He's 21, and like myself, also very much into his partying phase of life. I more or less got over him, and just went up, shook his hand, and was like, ""let's be friends."" We were chill and had a great time at the party. Up until this point, very few people knew that we went out before. Partly out of drunkeness and partly out of residual underlying interest, we somehow ended up kissing in front of everyone. No big, the night went on.

A whole group of us went out for pizza with a sober D. Afterwards, we all got dropped off at our respective places. As the boy was exiting, he gave me this look, but I just stared back and ignored it. When I got dropped off at my place, I received a message from him. We talked back and forth, and eventually he walked over to my place to pick me up. Just walking over to his place and holding his hand, I felt like I was on the top of the world. I was vehement that I wasn't into one night stands, and he said the same. I ended up sleeping with him - it was my first time, and I'm near certain it was his as well. I don't regret it at all; the sex wasn't perfect, but it was fun. Were we drunk? Yes. But not enough that we weren't aware of what we were doing.

The next morning, we just lazed about together and slept together again. I left his place mid-afternoon - we both had work to do. I called him the next day and asked if he wanted to meet up again. He said he was going to show up at an event the club was holding, the night before he was going to leave. He showed up late, and talked to a few people. I didn't get more than a passing glance and a ""hi."" I've invited him to hang out with me a few times, but every time he had other plans. It was understandable, since he was here for a very short time and made plans beforehand. Regardless, I felt that he could've spared half an hour to just relax together, work and other people aside.

I'm confused, RA. I feel like I've gone back to being ignored. I'm not sure what he wants from me, and tbh, I'm not sure what I want from him.

I like him, but I'm very much a realist. I can't make him like me, and I can't make him start a relationship with me. In all reality, he comes back to finish school this winter, before he graduates. Then, he'll most likely be back on the other side of the country working, while I still have another year of school to finish. Should I even bother to pursue him when he comes back?

I'm not sure what to do anymore, I feel as if I'm a fish floundering out of water. Help, RA?"

dvnvc,0,2010-10-24,[request]  Computer/Software Engineering Internship in Europe,Squirrl,Favors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/dvnvc/request_computersoftware_engineering_internship/,"Hey Reddit,

As a long time lurker (on various accounts), I've seen the power of the reddit network and the huge number of obscure connections and coincidences it brings.

I am posting today to try and exercise this network to find a Computer or Software engineering internship / work experience in Europe, from January-May, 2011 - prior to me beginning a Masters degree in August.


-----------------------------


A bit of background on me and my plans:

* I am 23 and an Australian citizen.  I am eligible for any working holiday visas offered to Australians (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden).  Furthermore, I should not have a problem getting visas for other countries if sponsored - I am single, university educated and I have no criminal record, no medical problems and no dependents.  I will be traveling to Europe on a German working holiday visa, so I can also search for jobs while I am there.

* In three weeks, I am traveling to Europe as part of an Australian sporting team, representing Australia in a world championships sporting event.  If at all possible, I do not intend to return to Australia

* I graduated university at the end of 2009 with the double degree:  BEng(Computer Engineering)(Hons 1C) + BSci(Computer Science)

* I am hoping to start a Masters degree in Europe (location based on which degree I am accepted for).  I am hoping for Zurich or Munich.

* I have worked since the beginning of the year in technology consulting, but did not enjoy it as much as the various research projects that I was involved with during my 5 years at uni.  I am looking to move into the R&amp;D field and am hoping that a masters degree will help me with this.

* I am enthusiastic, independent and very capable of learning new technologies and concepts

* I am a native English speaker and have been learning German at night-school for a year, but having never immersed myself, I would not say I am by any means fluent - I can read and write conversational German with much more confidence than I can speak and understand it - but I am keen to learn and plan to make full use of being surrounded by language and culture!



My current plan, assuming everything works out is:


* Nov: Sport

* Dec: Sport

* Jan: Work

* Feb: Work

* Mar: Work

* Apr: Work

* May: Work, then start to travel towards the end of May

* Jun: Travel

* July: Travel

* Aug: Finish up with travel and start to study

* Onwards:  Masters degree until 2013.




If you are interested in reading more about me, I have uploaded a resume (with most identifying information rescinded) **[here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/200153/Squirrl%20-%20Resume%20%28blanked%29.pdf)**


**If you are interested in my full resume - PM me and I will link you to my complete resume, contact details and references if required.**




I'm happy to answer any questions you may have, but would prefer not to publicly announce my identity.

Cheers,
Squirrl


-----------------------------


**TL;DR:** As I am over in Europe at the end of 2010 for sport, but do not begin a Masters degree until August, I am hoping to find some computer/software engineering work experience to help pay cost of living and allow me to stay in Europe during this transition time

*EDIT:  Also, if anyone could suggest some other subreddits where I could cross post this, it would be much appreciated.  I thought about /r/Germany and /r/Europe, but they seem to be more news related.*"
dw7ts,1,2010-10-25,Can't bring myself to hurt her.,sometimesacoward,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dw7ts/cant_bring_myself_to_hurt_her/,"I'm 21, she's 22. We've been together for about a year now, and have been really close, rarely leaving each others side. I stay at her place 6/7 nights a week, we split groceries and all the works. I love being with her, we make each other laugh constantly. I've never had so much fun just hanging out with someone.

On to the bad parts. Sex life sucks. Maybe once a week, and there is no flexibility no blowjobs, no adventures, no regularity. I think it stems from her low self esteem (she is pretty overweight) but it makes things sometimes frustrating for me. We've talked about it and she agrees to work on it, but never with results. Also she is very temperamental and subject to mood swings. I've never been with another girl this seriously so I don't know if it's normal. When I leave she is much less functional and gets depressed. I left for a week to my place to study and she quit attending class. She is very dependant on me. I've been contemplating breaking up with her but have always found the thought of hurting her too revolting. I really do love her.

So I got offered a great internship with a well known company 1000km away. I want to take it, but it'll crush her. She'll fall into a slump if I leave. I have been considering taking a lesser job locally to make her happy. She spent a lot of last night crying, thinking I might be leaving. She can't come because she still attends school for the first 4 months of my job. But it's only an 8 month internship.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can put myself first without feeling shitty for hurting her? I know the right thing to do is break up with her and take the job, but I can't bring myself to put her through that. The thought of making her cry is almost enough for me to lower my career goals and stay here. I just need advice on how to get over it and do the right thing for myself."

dxaju,4,2010-10-27,She says she wishes she'd met me later in life. What now?,throw54321away,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dxaju/she_says_she_wishes_shed_met_me_later_in_life/,"I figure I'll just try and write down all the relevant info I can think of here, and I kind of need to get the whole story out there for my own sake, so I apologize in advance for rambling.

I'm 22 and she's 23, and we've been dating for almost exactly 1 year now. When we first met, things were going really well. She was finishing up college (business communication major) and I was in my 1st (and most grueling) year of grad school. She had originally gone to college as part of a specialized acting program, but had dropped out without finishing after feeling fed-up with the people and being concerned about the pragmatics of being a career actress. Before meeting her, I had never had a serious girlfriend but a few flings here and there. To be honest I was a little inexperienced, having lost my virginity only around a year before we met. Either way, we met at a bar and had a great ""official"" first date a few days later. 

Towards the beginning of the summer, she started getting anxious about what she'd do after graduating. She had had a few PR internships, but when we talked about them she seemed unsatisfied. Around that time, I asked her what she'd really truly want to do with her life (ignoring money) and she said she wanted to act, so I encouraged her to follow her passion. For a little while after, she was considering heading to L.A., where she thought she had to be to pursue acting. This would mean essentially breaking up, as I live and go to school on the east coast. We talked seriously about it for weeks, and in the end she decided to stay where she was, and even moved to an apartment in my neighborhood and got a waitressing job there, too. Throughout all of this our relationship remained strong, and I would say it get even stronger with her deciding to move a little closer by. 

Throughout our relationship I feel like I've gone out of my way to be a source of support and advice for this girl. It seems like the majority of our conversations would inevitably turn towards her: her anxieties about her coworkers, her insecurities about acting, etc. Most of the time I was okay with this, seeing as how I was in a relatively stable position in my life (in school) and she was going through this crazy transition. I wanted to be there for her, I sort of felt that it was my duty.  

Anyway, last weekend I went out of state with my mother and sister to visit my grandmother. My granny doesn't have much time left, and I hadn't seen her for too long so I considered it a family obligation. Suffice it to say that this trip was a little depressing for me. Before leaving and during the trip, I noticed that my GF seemed a lot more distant when I talked to her over the phone. I was often bored during the trip, and would call her and not receive a response, or have a brief, rushed conversation with her. When I got back, I noticed that she was still acting like this, so I asked her about it. At first she told me she was just maybe a little depressed and stressed out (she worked hard over the weekend). 

She was still acting this way last night, and so I asked her about it again. I told her she seemed distant and could tell me if there was anything on her mind. She started to cry and told me that she was feeling weird about being in a relationship at this stage of her life. She told me she thought I was perfect, but she gets the feeling sometimes of missing out on life because she's in a serious relationship. She said she wished she had met me later in life when she wouldn't feel this way. 

As you can imagine, hearing this was hard. I told her I'd be lying if I didn't feel the same way sometimes, but the stability of a serious girlfriend was something I'd grown to appreciate. I suggested we consider taking some time away from one another for a little while. She wanted to know what the terms of some ""time away"" would be, and I told her I wasn't sure. We agreed to keep talking about it. 

I'd like to hear an outside perspective on this, reddit. Being that close to somebody for the first time is an eye-opening experience, and I wonder if my willingness to give advice and put her before myself has made me seem weak or dependent. It might sound awful, but I'm afraid of resenting her for all the effort I put into the relationship. 

Whaddyya think?

**Edit:** TL;DR - She says she feels like she's missing out on life because of our serious relationship, but thinks I'm great. I try to be super supportive, and I suggested some time apart. What are your suggestions?"
dxfyx,6,2010-10-27,My agency charges the client 5x what they pay me for my services...wrong?,kekekhuk,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/dxfyx/my_agency_charges_the_client_5x_what_they_pay_me/,"Hey /r/web_design, this question is for the redditors who work at agencies.

I graduated from college about 2 years ago and I messed around at a couple non-web corporate jobs until I realized that I wanted to focus on web development as a career path.  When applying, I had no agency experience and my portfolio was pretty weak (web development had always been a hobby of mine -- I have only been *paid* by friends/friends-of-friends to make simple static HTML sites...), but I was persistent and somehow convinced the President to bring me on-board.  

I've been here for about 8 months now and things have been going well.  The boss hired me purely because of my interest in the subject and my ability to sell myself -- he didn't really have any idea what he would do with me (My compensation reflects that -- I'm paid like a well-paid intern w/ no benefits).  I've since been involved in almost every aspect of agency life: HTML, CSS, JQuery, Project Management, Production Management, QA, Research/Digital Strategy...I've run client meetings, I've managed a small team of developers, UX designed two small sites...kind of everything.  

I was reviewing a project plan for an upcoming project (I was asked to take a look at the functional requirements) and noticed the rate at which my services were being billed...nearly 5x what I am paid by my agency.  I went back and looked at another project I worked on and my services were billed at the same rate. This stood out as ridiculous to me...they're billing the client the same cost as a person 2-3 levels higher than me in terms of seniority.  Keep in mind, I am still very inexperienced in the agency world and I am the youngest in the office (early twenties), but don't you think an 80% margin on my services is a little bit odd?  I mean, Apple has a 40% margin and that's unheard of.

Is this just one of the ""pay your dues"" things?  Should I say something? Maybe my angst is lingering around from when I was a teenager, but I work a lot longer hours and a lot more projects than most of the people here and seemingly am compensated significantly less.  I don't know what to do.

Maybe I should just relax and enjoy the job that I thought was great until I came across this?

I appreciate the feedback."
dy1ve,1,2010-10-28,"Just starting! Lose a few lbs., get in shape",Drache,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/dy1ve/just_starting_lose_a_few_lbs_get_in_shape/,"First post here on reddit too!

I'm 21, 5'9"" 167 lbs. I'm a college student. In my high school years and the first year of college or so, it seemed I was always moving. I walked almost everywhere I could, I was semi-active, and it never seemed like I needed to worry about my diet at all. Weight was simply a non-issue. 

Flash forward a few years. I did 6 months of internship last year - typical desk job - no movement at all. No exercise, no calorie control, and lots of snacks in my desk, and the 'ol Poptarts for breakfast. I didn't think anything of it. I was back in school this summer and I tried to be more active with my free time...bike riding, hiking...and I think it was enough to maintain my weight and offset my crappy eating.

Skipping to the punchline....
Over the last year, I've gained 12 lbs., from 155 to 167, my blood pressure has gone up, I feel much less in shape. I understand that it's much easier to fix the problem now rather than later.

I'm addicted to food. I loved eating, and unhealthy meals were my way of coping with anxiety. I shoveled in chips and cookies at work when I was bored. Not so good. I've counted my calories, and realized that my diet was *very* high in carbs and sugars, and low in protein. I've been trying to make a few healthy changes....

* If I didn't consciously keep track of my calories, I could shovel in an easy 2300-2400 a day of unhealthy items without thought. Now I've cut back and can do more along the lines of 1800 with some willpower. 

* I've cut out fast food almost completely besides the occasional social outing. I make sure I pack my lunch at work (whole wheat roast beef sandwich with spinach leaves and canola oil mayo) and make sure I have some carrot sticks to nibble on. Oatmeal with dried fruit instead of poptarts. I still have my morning hot chocolate (not so great, but I use lowfat milk and the powder sparingly).

* I've exchanged soda for sparkling fruit juice. Less sugar, real fruit juice. Not ideal, but it's a start.

* I've started doing the P90 (not P90X) workout tapes. I either do that or try to get 30 or 40 minutes of bike riding or walking in each day to at least get started.

* I've tried changing my desserts to better options. A granola bar instead of cookies. Greek yogurt instead of icecream. Simple things like that to move in the right direction. 

Over the last few weeks I've probably dropped a pound or so. My principal complaint so far is I feel hungry without ""unlimited"" food. I assume it's the high carb/high sugar combo. Does anyone have any tips for lowering carbs and sugar and increasing protein to feel fuller?

I realize that 10-12 pounds shouldn't be a daunting task. I'm really hoping I can change my diet to get back into shape as well as drop some weight (it's no fun when your clothes from last year don't fit!). Hopefully soon I won't feel like I need a cardiologist on speed dial during exercise, and I'll start going down in weight instead of creeping up. Your advice, motivation, and tips are appreciated :)
