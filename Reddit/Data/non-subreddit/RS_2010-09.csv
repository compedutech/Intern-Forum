Basically I have a very severe case of emotional abuse going on at home that I can't even remember a day without it happening in at least 10 years.  I'm 21 years old living at home (not by choice) and just trying to make it from day to day.  This is not your average kid complaining about stupid rules.  This is real emotional abuse.  Every single day of my life I have tried to simply avoid contact with my parents but I can't escape them.  My mother being the real issue, where my father is simply not willing to argue with her.  Life is easier for him to just accept what she says.  That's just how she is.  It's really hard to describe but more or less it is actually killing me.  I've developed severe anxiety and I'm certain that they are the cause.  I wake up every single morning dreading my life.  I'm scared that if it wasn't for my girlfriend I would have killed myself already.  It's that bad.  I feel like I can't live here any more but due to financial issues I will be stuck here for at least a year most likely, but then again I have been saying that year after year.  I am working as much as I can but my boss can't hire me full time due to budget cuts.  I am per diem with no benefits at all. 

I have no friends so I can't move in with anyone to just get away until I can afford to save up to get the first apartment I can afford.  My parents also make me pay rent which is making things harder since it's just more time trapped at home.  I do think paying rent would be fair normally, but I can't get out since they are making it impossible for me to leave while at the same time giving me a daily reminder that ""They hate me and can't wait until I leave.""

I'm trying not to turn this into a sob story but I'm pretty depressed and after at least 7 years of therapy and trying various anti-anxiety and anti-depressant meds I am literally out of options.  I feel like my life has been wasted so far and I really want to just be okay for once.  

Does anyone have any advice based on similar life experience?  Does anyone living in the Middlesex/North Shore area of MASS need a roomate who is willing to pay rent and take up as little space as you want and is willing to share everything I own?  I need to keep my current job because it pays far more than any other options I will get without a degree.  I work in PC support and hope to use the skills I have gained on my own to make it a career.  Luckily I got the internship in high school which is the only reason I have a job.  It was impossible for me to have paid for college without anyone to co-sign a loan so I accepted that I will have to work my way up the ladder of the IT world.  Just anything at all.  I'm out of places to turn so I sucked it up ignored my shame and posted this online.  Hopefully you don't all think I'm just exaggerating or taking things out of proportion.  I just really need some help and no one has been able to provide any at all.  Please help me.  "

dagkd,5,2010-09-07,Straight guys and Craigslist Sex,I_See_Nah_Nah,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dagkd/straight_guys_and_craigslist_sex/,"A quick note:  this has nothing to do with ""Adult Services"" being removed from Craigslist.  This relates to personals ads such as Casual Encounters and w4m

After moving to a certain major city and finishing an internship I found myself with quite a bit of downtime.  There was no longterm relationship looming over my head and all I had to worry about was paying the bills on my swanky new room.  The room itself had come from Craigslist fully furnished and left me wondering what else Craigslist was good for.  I’d already used CL to rideshare, sell textbooks, buy a computer and just make quick cash.

Honestly, who hasn’t noticed the personal ads and laughed about it?  We all know someone who has “checked the missed connections.”  What about actually getting dates or hooking up... this is the part where the conversations change direction.  Coincidentally, there was no one around for me to joke with as everyone I knew was almost 24 hours away by car.  I figure why not live dangerously.

Too timid the make my own posting at first, I began an CL RSS subscription that I would check before and after work.  It didn’t take long for me to realize that most of the female postings for the entire city were fake unless they’d been posted by overweight women, disgruntled wives or single mothers.  Also, the majority of fake posting are put up later in the evening.  One will find it a little easier to narrow down selection by grammar and a basic comprehension of the English language.  Desperate ads are commonly written by bots waiting to verify your identity through a credit card.

After about ten days of this I decided to create a fake e-mail to send some replies and post an ad.  Note:  Always use a fake e-mail address from a legit site.  Know that nothing gives away a BS ad like lghji53k4@g-mail.com so the sender should be the first thing you check.  If there is any interest in this post I can create a handy little cheat sheet or flow chart for identifying real Craigslist sex opportunities.  

On to pictures:  On the subject of pictures I have a few thoughts.  In my opinion one should never use a picture in their Craigslist ad that reveals their true identity.  This is a horrible idea that could easily backfire on you as anyone can see it.  The correct response is always to meet in a public space and verify who you are hooking up with.  imho Anyone who refuses to do this is not worth my time.  Also, general dating listings on Craigslist is just as, probably more, effective at hooking you up.  If you play things cool (with the few legit people who respond) you might end up getting them interested enough to make your dreams come true.  It paid off for me twice over a two week span and both women were quite fun.

CE works like an ongoing game of Yahoo Chess.  The difference is eventually the only way to truly meet others becomes posting an ad and filtering through the endless spam that will follow.  Maybe only 1 real woman will respond out of 50, but that is the whole point.  This is especially true for men.  One of the women I ended up with said she’d had over 57 men contact her in less than a couple hours a few weeks earlier after she stupidly included a phone number.  Most of the responses will not take the time to actually read your ad, which is your key to filtering responses.

In the end CL works far better for the queer community, which has tons of better online options, and a few brave, selective women who aren’t yet familiar with where they are.  This leaves us straight dudes with little to go on besides a general sense of disbelief.  Even after posting you should expect to wait days before getting anything resembling a real person, but it does happen.  Just remember to double bag it and get tested afterwards.

Best of luck!"

I'm nearing the end of third year Software Systems &amp; Aerospace engineering @ UQ and I think it might be about time to start looking for an internship. Having never applied for something like that before, can someone give me a quick list of good software houses or aerospace companies in Brisbane? At a recent conference someone urged me to leave Brisbane to find a job (esp in Aerospace), but I think that's a tad defeatist.

I can program in Python, C, C++, Java (though a refresher is necessary - I'm not a fan) and AVR C (though that isn't necessarily a language unto itself). I'm also learning Brisbane-designed Qt through PyQt for a uni project.

I guess what I'm really looking for is a vacation internship this Christmas holidays, so if anyone has any tips, please let me know."
dave6,11,2010-09-07,"Reddit, I'm becoming cynical, misanthropic, and alienated. I feel like I'm drifting away from everything and everyone else, and I don't know what to do.",Blankoogron,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dave6/reddit_im_becoming_cynical_misanthropic_and/,"I recently graduated university, and have, since that date, found work as a cook, on the opposite side of the country. While I have no expectation of finding a job I love right out of university, the job I work is a unique kind of hell from which there seems to be no escape. My coworkers do drugs and drink every fucking night, more or less. This is something I (no longer) do with any sort of frequency. I feel completely disconnected from these people, and from people in general. I'm no longer personable, I don't feel like I can laugh or joke with other people, and I'm increasingly nervous in social situations. All of these things never used to apply to me.

On the upside of things I've been working out religiously, and am in the best shape of my life. This doesn't change the fact that I see no way out of the hell that my life increasingly is becoming. I have no idea how to find work that doesn't involve the 12 hour clusterfuck that comprises a job working with food, and while I'm applying for teaching positions overseas, it does nothing to help the fact that it's near impossible to have something even approaching a social life when you work 30 hours every weekend, and upwards of 55 hours a week. 

I'm finding it increasingly difficult to see the bright side of things in life, and spend most of my time looking at others with scorn and derision. I don't know when I became such a spiteful, hateful person, but other people see it in me and they want nothing to do with me. I don't know if it's a result of the pressures I face at work, or something else entirely, but I feel like something has to change, because I'm becoming increasingly anhedonic and angry.

I spend most of my spare time playing video games, or working out, and the few times I have gone out drinking with people from work I've woken up with powerful feelings of guilt and shame, as I feel that I should be finding better ways to spend my money, and time on. 

I've quit my current job, as months of working 55 hour work weeks, even at a shitty rate of pay, has allowed me to accumulate a fair amount of money. I've applied for an internship in south-east asia, and am going to start applying for teaching positions in Korea, (which would make good use of my degree in english), but months of rejections from every job I've applied to have left me disheartened at my ability to anything even remotely meaningful with my life. While intellectually I see that there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel, I feel as if I am getting dumber, angrier, and more and more hopeless that life will ever again be something I experience any joy in.

I feel lost, so hopelessly lost, and don't know how to do anything worthwhile with my life. I hate myself for my failures, others for their successes, and have, bit by bit, driven away everyone who has ever cared me, save for my parents, with my cynicism and my anger. I have no idea what to do. I feel like I've been twisted into some horrible mirror image of what I used to be, and there doesn't seem to be any escape, and it's fucked, reddit. It's fucked.

I don't know what I'm expecting, exactly, but I just needed to get this out in the open. I spend more time alone than is healthy, and just want to know, reddit, what do I do? Maybe you have similar stories, where you've overcome these sorts of feelings? I don't know.

This is a throwaway account, too.

I remember how it felt to go to sleep as a child, feeling warm, with everything around you seeming in perfect order, and you fell into sleep with a perfect trajectory, bypassing the nightmares and dreams and waking up in the morning right where it should be, and everything as it should be, and now there's only the mess of my sheets and the emptiness of my white room to greet me, and Jesus I just don't know.

TL;DR I bitch about my life. I'm angry.

We have been exclusive since April or so and have definitely grown closer. I fell in love with her and she fell in love with me. 

There were tough times as well. We broke up for 5 days a few weeks ago over arguments we were having over petty things (IMO) but she convinced me that breaking up was irrational and that we could work through this hurtle so we got back together and it's been, honest to say, like those days when we first got together; quite amazing actually. 

At the same time, I knew she had an internship in a city a couple hours away. She knew it, I knew it that it was beginning to be the make or break of our relationship if we made it that far. She moved away on Sunday for the next 8 months and it's been shitty to say the least. I've done LDR's before (she hasn't) and I know how they work or actually, how they don't work. Despite all that, I love so many things about her and I feel special because I helped her through her recent diagnosis of Celiac. She has expressed to me how I mean so much to her and the thought of ending things pains me to think about...

I don't want to be single which is quite the opposite of how I would have felt a year ago. I thoroughly enjoy the companionship but now that she is gone and I can only expect to see her, at most, once a week (which is still unlikely) I feel like I am worse off than being single. I don't have a g/f i can see whenever I want to hug and hold her and there is absolutely no prospect of me doing that with someone else who lives where I am as long as my g/f and I are still together. 

Here's the worst part. I am having thoughts of throwing away what we have together because I have met a possible replacement. It was the day after my g/f left that this girl walked into my life. I actually think of it as a stupid thing to say because I hardly know this girl. I just met her on Monday night. It sounds even more fucked up as I reread what I just typed. Any yet, here I am. Still having these same thoughts. This isn't even the first time I've had girls throw themselves at me. WTF is it with girls being able to sniff out the non-single guys? This wouldn't happen if I didn't have a g/f! So far I've been able to brush off temptations like these before with little effort but this one...not so easy. 

Damn....what the hell should I do?

(true story)",aspiering,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/dbtht/mf_i_was_18_and_there_was_an_intern_at_the/,"*First, let me emphasise that this story is completely true. I *have* Asperger's syndrome, and while I don't have many of the negative traits often associated with the disorder, I keep in touch with this commune, mostly to have a social network in case shit one day goes bad, and to harvest the (mostly economic) benefits.

Additionally, this is a longer story, so if you're looking for a nice buildup, this is for you. If not, you may as well go on your merry way and find a shorter piece. Or a porn flick.*

------------

I was told an intern had started her six-month internship. She wanted to be a caretaker, and naturally, an asperger commune seems like a logical place to be in that situation.

Let's just say her name was Anna. She was about 28, and absolutely gorgeous. Freckly skin, long dark hair, and deep, brown eyes. Not usually my type, but eh.

Naturally, I thought, this wouldn't ever work out. She was an *intern* at the place I went for ""help"", and she was 10 years older than me (by only a few days, I would later learn).

She took a couple of my appointments from the usual crew (some of the others in the commune need a *lot* of planning and organising), but I would never really take up the full time of the appointments. So, instead we'd talk about clubbing, drinking, smoking. I'm a smoker, and I casually offered her a cigarette, even though I had no idea if she did, or ever had, smoked. She took it, and with a wink asked me not to tell anyone. As it turns out, she had quit smoking a couple of months prior, and none of her current co-workers knew she had smoked.

We laughed, we talked, and time flew past quickly. My appointment was well overdrawn, and she quickly thanked me for the cigarette, hugged me, and ran out to her next appointment.

I promptly logged onto my PC and added her as a friend on Facebook.

------------

That same night, I noticed her online. I felt somewhat awkward, but I figured I'd message her and challenge her to have a drink with me at some point, knowing fully-well she'd be out of her mind if she accepted. She laughed, and then a one-line reply:

""sure ;)""

I was excited. In the conversation that followed, we agreed (half-heartedly on my behalf, though) not to do so until she'd finished her internship, making it at least somewhat more acceptable. It was about a month later, and I figured I could wait.

------------

Approximately one week later, I was bored out of my mind. School was out. All my friends were on holiday, and I was just craving going out drinking with some friends and have fun (this wasn't in the US, so drinking laws are much more lax here). I get on Facebook and immediately notice her online. *click*. ""An"". *click*. ""Hey, you want to go grab a drink or something? I'm bored out of my mind.""

Her reply was something along the lines of ""I really shouldn't,"" or ""Nah, not tonight"". I wasn't really paying attention. I was determined, and after a bit of heckling, I managed to convince her to go to a nearby gas station with me to pick up some wine. I met her in front of her dorm; she smiled nervously, and we went on my merry way. I broke the silence by taking out my whiskey-filled 20 oz hip flask, taking a swig and offering her a swig. The gas station was about half a mile away, and we picked up cigarettes and alcohol. On the way back, I noticed how buzzed I already was, checking my hip flask. Half-way back, it was already empty. 20 oz of whiskey in about 15 minutes, shared between two people. This was going to be a good night, I felt.

------------

After we got back, we hit the wine. It hit hard, and heavy. We were both pretty drunk after a short while, and ended up on drinking games. At some point during the night, we ended up talking about relationships. I was still in one at this point, but I knew it wasn't going to work out, and I stressed it heavily. She had come out of a pretty long relationship about six months prior, and was slowly picking up dating again.

Drinking games turned into more kinky ones, and we finally ended up playing strip poker. We started talking about sex, and I revealed to her that in all my years, I had not found anyone able to give me a good blowjob. She looked me straight in the eyes and said ""go sit on my bed.""

What happened next almost escapes me entirely. She comes over to the bed, sits on her knees, removes my pants and just starts sucking. We're talking vaccuum here, and I just lay back and enjoy the whole sensation; this truly was unlike anything I'd felt before that.

Blowjobs turned into pretty wild sex. For hours we just lay there, making out, trying out every position in the book.

I stayed the night at her place, and got up the next morning, still feeling dazed and confused. Did this just happen? Is this illegal? Oh well, fuck it. At the very, I now had a very good story to tell.

And you, /r/gonewildstories, are the first people I've told. This is 100% true, happening only a few months ago. I hope this lived up to your expectations."

* He believes that all of illegal immigration can be solved by building a wall and placing soldiers on it with the order to kill on sight.

The place I'm currently working at doesn't seem to particularly like me.  When I first started, I fixed something in a legacy system that seemed like a bug, because the testing procedures they gave me would just not work with this one flag turned on.  Of course, it turned out this flag was very necessary, and that the testing procedures they gave me did not match what happens in production at all.  So, they go through a big talk about not doing anything unless I'm instructed.

Several months ago, about two years after I started, I didn't do something that I thought would be good, because they didn't tell me to do it.  Then, they didn't like I wasn't ""communicating"" well, and have labeled me in many ways that simply aren't true.  One issue was from a different manager changing his mind several times in the course of a conversation, and I couldn't remember which option he finally decided on, so crap hit the fan when he said that he said one thing, and I said I remembered him saying something else.  The hypocrisy of the higher ups does not occur to them -- they recognize that anything they do without the approval of the big cheese could be wrong just because they didn't get approval first, but at the same time blame the peons for making any sort of decision without getting approval from them first.  This isn't just me, it's happened to several other people here.

If I were to tell my supervisor that I was looking for a new job, they may just fire me as soon as I'm done on my current project, even though I have a lot of knowledge of a legacy system that other people only know half as well.  On the other hand, I know that as I'm going to have a second interview with a new company soon, that they will be contacting my current employer to see what they think of me.  Additionally, I have to schedule flex time at my current employer to be able to leave early now and then for interviews, and they really want a reason; it sounds like, if you don't give a reason enough times, they pull you in to a meeting to talk about it.  I really don't want to lie, but at the same time don't want to lose my job before I have something else lined up.

TL:DR: Should I tell my employer I'm looking elsewhere or not?  This is my first ""real job"" out of college; before this I had internships or fast food jobs, so the management expected me to be looking elsewhere for work."

Here’s a little background: I met my ex during senior year of high school and we decided to stay together even though I was leaving for college at the end of summer. We went through the typical ups and downs of a college LDR and seemed to make it through just fine.



We broke up at the beginning of the summer because she was graduating (from college) and had decided to travel for about 6 weeks. I understand I’ll probably get a decent amount of criticism for this next part. I told her that I found it unfair that I would come home every chance I could to spend time with her and during the only 3 months of the year that we could be together, she decides to take that time to travel and get her life in order. So I told her to choose between traveling or being with me. She obviously picked the former.



At that point, I took 2/3’s of RA’s advice: I cut contact and hit the gym (didn’t bother deleting from Facebook because neither of us really use it at all). She tried to contact me once during the summer about how much she missed me but I had self-control and was able to answer her back in somewhat of a cold fashion.



Fast forward to the end of summer, we start talking again (mainly a few short texts to see how each of us are doing). We decide to see each other and end up hooking up (as we both honestly expected). We had previously agreed to do this with no strings attached so it was somewhat alright.



Once again, at the end of summer I left for college (actually an internship near my school but I’m still a student). She has mentioned that she still has strong feelings for me and wants to get back together. I’ve told her that I don’t want that and that I think we should talk less.



Here’s the main issue: I find myself texting her and talking to her even though I know I shouldn’t. It’s not that I can’t help doing it, I honestly just have nothing to do and no one else to really talk to. My school has a very low population of girls and since I am working full-time, I have virtually zero opportunity to talk and connect with any of them. The ones I already know that I am interested in either already graduated/moved or are in relationships. There’s no one at my job I am interested in (especially since most of my workers are older and/or male).



I am seeking advice on whether I should totally cut contact with my ex and how I should do it, as well as how I can go out and meet girls my age (for dating). I know the bar/club scene exists but if anyone else has any ideas, I would appreciate them. Thanks in advance for your help and sorry for the long post.



TL;DR: ex wants to get back together after a post break-up hookup (with me). I went back to school for an internship and am trying to cut contact. I’m finding it hard to stop talking to her because I am not taking classes this semester and have no way of meeting girls my age. So I end up talking to her because I have no one else to talk to and nothing else to interest me. 



EDIT: I know I need to cut contact but I'm having a hard time doing it because there aren't many other girls that I talk to that aren't just friends. Also, I don't want to get back together with this girl. I think the right thing to do is to stay broken up, I'm just having a hard time cutting off communication and finding new people. That's why I'm asking for advice on HOW to cut contact and/or meet people."

This is going to sound like self loathing but I am sorry, I need to get this off my chest and I don't have many people to talk to. 

I was fairly successful in academics on high school which secured me a scholarship to a well known engineering school. I graduated and was offered a well funded position in graduate school studying fluid mechanics. I met my wife during the end of my undergraduate education and I have never been so close to someone in my life. I've never met someone who understood me so deeply and cared so much. 

After completing a masters, I secured a good job as an engineer with a large environmental consulting firm in Texas. I married my fiancee just before moving in a very large ceremony which she desired. My wife went to graduate school, I worked, we made a good living and everything was great. Unfortunately, in 2008 I was laid off and there weren't many prospects in Texas (and we did not particularly care for Texas, sorry Texas people). The fortunate thing is that I was laid off 3 weeks before my wife defended her masters and we did not own a house. We had mobility and we decided to get out.

I wanted to pursue a PhD and my wife wanted to work and we figured we would reverse our texas arrangement of me working and her going to school. I actively searched for PhD programs near her hometown on the west coast and my wife did the same with her job search.

She was abler to acquire a fantastic job in her field making great money and I was able to be accepted to a great engineering university in the same town. Last year we bought a house and a new car and were very much financially rooted in the area. everything was great until march of 2010.

Last March my wife tells me very casually she wanted to chat on the couch. I sit down, she tells me she is miserable, has been miserable for years, is leaving and there is nothing I can do to improve the situation or to get her back. This was the worst day of my life. 
Walked out of the house, left me with a mortgage, cats, and our whole life. I was shellshocked. There was no indication she was ever unhappy, no mention of seeing a counselor, no mention of anything to help the situation, just silence and many I don't care at all anymore. 

I went back to school instead of seeking a job with the plan that my wife and I are a team and she would support me while I was pursuing a PhD. 

I feel like I have lost my mind and failed as a person now. I don't have much family and friends live very far away. I feel trapped and I don't sleep at all at night. When I do sleep, I have nightmares like a kid. It's always some monster trying to eat me or something terrible. 

I have always been emotionally very stable and I can't even go through the day without an incredible rollercoaster of emotions. Let's say I'm on reddit, I see a kitten and get ultra warm fuzzies and see a post about an Iraq qar vet and I cry. I'm losing my mind in some fucked happy/miserable dichotomy world. I'm always one or the other. 


I'm scared to go about normal tasks for fear of failure and my education, though not suffering, isn;t really progressing the past few months. I have an internship in my field and a second job at a coffeeshop to pay the bills, school, etc. I work about 65 hours a week not including schoolwork I must complete at home and I can't do this anymore. I barely pay the bills and I'm almost going hungry as I don't have much left over for groceries and there are only so many campus events you can go to with free food before someone starts to notice. I've never struggled just to put food on my table and I can't believe that is the situation I'm in. I feel alien at school and work because how do I tell fellow students/friends/coworkers making money and living well that I didn't go get a beer with them or hang out not only because I couldn't afford it, I fucking barely ate at all that night.

I don't want to live this life but I can't commit suicide. I lost a friend to suicide and it is selfish and never a good answer. Honestly, before I fall asleep, my wish is to just not wake up.

I'm exhausted. I feel like a shell of a man. I feel worthless. I need someone or something at the end of the day to just share with and the silence at home fucking kills me. I live in 1700 square feet of a life that no longer has any chance at survival.  Call me crazy but sometimes at night I talk to my cat about my day. 

I'm beyond my breaking point and I don't know what to do.

Please, if you have been through anything like this, I need advice. What do I do?What did you do? I need help, support, guidance, etc. I don't want to feel like I don't want to live anymore. I don't know how to be proactive anymore.  






tl;dr   Wife left, cannot pay bills, going hungry, too much between school and work for any free time. I feel like a ghost and I need help because I don't think I can do this much longer."
dhrl1,169,2010-09-23,"There seem to be ALOT of misconceptions about CPR and the new Compression Only CPR, lets get some things straight.",SDAdam,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dhrl1/there_seem_to_be_alot_of_misconceptions_about_cpr/,"This post is in response to the recent [front page post addressing compression-only CPR](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dhecy/out_with_the_old_and_in_with_the_new_8_more/).

There are A LOT of misconceptions about CPR going around and I think it's important that we address them as it could make a big difference in someones life.

First off to qualify myself; I am a paramedic (NREMTP, and state licensed in my state), a paramedic instructor, a CPR instructor (AHA-BLSHCP), an Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support(ACLS) instructor, and a bunch of other things with acronyms of varying difficulty to remember.

So, CPR.

lets start with a note on the ethical and legal aspects.

**Ethics of CPR** - This one is easy, you don't have to do anything at all. Now, you should probably at LEAST call 911 (or whatever the emergency number in your area is) if you want people to think you are a decent human being, but you don't even HAVE to do that. So the first thing to do is think about things now, before you find yourself in an emergency and decide just what you want to do if you end up in one.

I have seen irate and irrational family members attack rescuers, I have seen people injured by entering emergency scenes with unforeseen dangers and I have known people who caught diseases from sick patients while trying to help them, these are all reasons why ethically you don't have to do anything (again maybe call 911 just for the heck of it though).

you have a family, friends, life, people who count on you, and in no way do you need to be exposed to the above dangers unless you are absolutely SURE you want to be. So decide now.

**Legal aspects of CPR** - The only answer I can give here is that the liability involved in providing CPR varies. It varies from country to country, state to state, and in some cases county to county. It is possible you could get sued, although unlikely to be successfully sued, it doesn't mean someone can't try. 

A good rule of thumb is this; if you would feel uncomfortable explaining what / why you were doing something in court you probably shouldn't be doing it (i.e.""well you see Mr. Judge, I once saw an episode of CHIPS and they brought the guy back to life by punching him in the chest, but I'm not very strong so I decided to jump on his chest"" - this example would seem a poor choice when held to the comfortable explaining yourself standard.)

A better rule of thumb is (and the one you would most likely be held to in court) what would another reasonable person in a similar situation who has the same amount or lack of training as I have do? (i.e. ""Ummm, you're telling me everybody in this courtroom wouldn't have used a swiss army knife to preform an emergent thoracotomy in order provide direct cardiac massage for that guys asthma attack?! pfffttt... whatever"" - this example would seem a poor choice when held to the reasonable person standard.)

**On To The Medicine**

I'm now going to address what seem to be the biggest misconceptions about CPR and Compression Only CPR;

**1. Compression only CPR is better than classic CPR.**
Compression Only CPR was never meant to replace CPR. It was meant to remove decision making from lay peoples hands.

You see medical decision making is difficult, and emergency medical decision making is even more difficult, and it's all compounded by the fact that nearly everything in medicine is a grey area. Let's look at an example;

When a person suffers sudden cardiac arrest (their heart stops beating) often for the first several minutes, and possibly for quite some time they may have something called agonal respirations, they are dead (clinically) but randomly every once and a while they take a gasping breath. Once you have seen this it is obvious. However to a lay person this could be considered breathing, so now the lay person has to make a decision; is the patient breathing or not? I mean they just gasped, but now they aren't, should I breath for them? Should I start CPR, shit, I don't know.

See how, to an untrained person there is a lot of grey area and decisions to make?

Well, research showed that when presented with grey area and decisions, bystanders decided that for fear of making the wrong decision they would make none at all and do nothing.

Thus Compression Only CPR was born, the idea being if we remove the grey area and decision making more people will do the one MOST important thing; chest compressions.

Another place Compression Only CPR is useful is if you don't want to do anything else. Let's take me for instance, I have a ton of medical experience and training, years and years. If I were walking down the street tomorrow and someone collapsed in front of me who needed CPR I would do Compression Only CPR. Why? Because I don't carry anything to protect myself if I were to try to breath for them. So I would do compressions until other paramedics arrived and that's it.

**2. Doing Compressions On Someone With A Pulse Is Bad.**
Now let's take you for example. Let's say that you are at the grocery store and you see someone collapse, so after watching that other threads video you run over and start pounding away on their chest. Then I come along, with my lights and sirens and bags of medical junk and I notice that the person you are doing CPR on is actually alive and asking you to stop.

Will I:

a) Yell at you for your ignorance and endangering of another person and mock you infront of all within earshot?

b)Thank you for your effort, quick thinking, and willingness to act calling you a hero in front of any cute girls/guys who happen to be within earshot.

c) Make fun of you when I get back to station.

The correct answer is b and c. (Hey if I tried to do whatever the hell it is you do for a living you would be the one laughing at me.)

There are really two points to make here.

First there are VERY few medical emergencies wich render a person so dead-like that they would actually be mistaken for being dead. Things which will NOT do this but have been mentioned in the thread I linked to at the top are: Fainting, low or high blood sugar, seizures, or strokes.

Second it is ALWAYS better to do CPR on someone who doesn't need it, than to fail to do CPR on someone who does. Lets look at a quick cost benefit model to illustrait my point:

&gt;You do CPR inappropriately:
*cost* - Sore chest, possibly minor rib fractures (actually relatively unlikely), embarrassment.
*benefit* - none.

&gt;You do CPR appropriately:
*cost* - none (possibly sore arms and back the next day for you).
*benefit* - you GREATLY increase a persons chance of surviving sudden cardiac arrest and returning to their loved ones.

The choice seems clear.

**3. What do you mean I don't check for a pules?!**
Let's get something straight, checking for a pulse is great. I always check for a pulse.

YOU have no idea how to check for a pulse in an emergency. I know you think you do, and the boy scouts taught you to 20 years ago, but you don't.

Here is what DOES happen. Bystanders (that's y'all) try to feel for a pulse, if one's there they mistake it for their own racing heart and start CPR anyway, if there is no pulse they mistake their own for the patients and don't start CPR. (It's that whole grey area / decision making thing again)

Even new Paramedic interns have trouble telling weather there is a pulse on cardiac arrests sometimes and these are people who have been Emergent Medical Technicians for quite a while prior to getting in to Paramedic school!

I hope this has cleared some things up about CPR and made some people more comfortable just jumping in and pumping on a persons chest as long as they are unresponsive and you think they are dead. 

Feel free to ask any other questions!"
dikni,52,2010-09-24,This is the story about the time I met Al Gore in a men's restroom.,kurtrussellisawesome,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dikni/this_is_the_story_about_the_time_i_met_al_gore_in/,"I already wrote this as a comment on some Al Gore-related post a few days ago, but I thought I'd share it again. 

I have a story for you:

Last year, I got an internship at CurrentTV, Al Gore's indie cable network. My first day there, I was terrifically nervous, and had gotten about an hour of sleep the night before. I was running on Red Bull and first-day jitters, trying to remember everyone's names and not fuck up. About halfway through the day, my friend (who'd gotten me the gig) popped his head over my cubicle and said, ""Hey, Al Gore's in the hallway if you wanna see him.""

Apparently he's only at the office once in a while, so this was very exciting. My friend led me down the hallway and we walked past Al Gore, who's much taller than I expected him to be. I whispered ""HOLY SHIT, IT'S AL FUCKING GORE!"" and we kept walking. We got to the end of the hallway, which we'd walked down for the sole purpose of seeing Al Gore, and I went ""Is there a bathroom down here? I really need to pee, and I don't want Al Gore thinking I only walked by so I could gawk at him.""

I went into the bathroom, which was empty, and took one of the two urinals. About ten seconds later, Al Gore walked in and took the urinal on my left, and started going pee.

I'm standing there, running on way too little sleep and way too much Red Bull, trying to take a leak, and the former Vice-President of the USA is standing right next to me doing his business. I don't normally have a shy bladder, but under the circumstances, it was a bit of a challenge to do my thing.

Then Al Gore farted.

At this, I broke out into a cold sweat and probably burst a blood vessel in my eye trying not to laugh. If I had balls of steel, I would've turned to him and coolly said, ""You know, I hear that's bad for the ozone layer."" But instead I just finished peeing, went to wash my hands at the sink, and tried to retain motor skills because my brain had just exploded from the utter weirdness of the situation.

Al Gore followed suit. I got out of his way as quickly as possible. Aside from being a Nobel Prize winner, he was also my boss and it was my first day as an intern. While I was getting a paper towel, he casually asked me how I was doing, and I stammered something along the lines of ""Fine thank you, sir, and yourself?"" but while I was doing this, I wound up yanking out three paper towels instead of one. There was a moment of sheer panic, thinking I'd get yelled at for killing trees. I don't think he noticed, though I'm sure he's used to interns freaking the fuck out after he farts next to them and then accidentally wasting paper.

I went back to my desk and just sat there shaking, trying to comprehend what had just happened, because let's face it: that doesn't happen every day. My friend walked up, slapped me on the back, and said ""SO! How's your first day going?"" 

And that, my friends, is the inconvenient truth.

**TL;DR: I once took a piss next to Al Gore in a public bathroom. He farted and I took too many paper towels by accident. It was surreal.**"
dl3am,13,2010-09-30,Active Top Secret clearance required for an entry level software engineer position. WTF?,[deleted],computing,https://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/dl3am/active_top_secret_clearance_required_for_an_entry/,"I am looking for an entry level software engineering job and have found many from companies that require some type of clearance.

Why do companies require an active top secret clearance for entry level positions?  To even get one, you must have worked for a company in the past who has given you one (can't apply for one obviously).  I understand it saves money, but to expect newly graduated computer scientists to hold an active one seems a little absurd.

Can anyone explain this?  Does it significantly decrease the pool of applicants?  Do most who have one obtain it during internships?"
