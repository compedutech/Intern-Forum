The cert is not a Associate degree which I can get if i finish a few more classes, about another year and a half. but this cert is Mechanical I.E the classes i took to get it were/are brakes, manual trans, and upper engine   completed are lower engine, auto trans and suspension and chassis.

What my question is would i be better off trying to get an internship at a mazda dealership or getting a job at a small shop? I still have a LOT to learn and would love be in a dealership just for the sustainability of a dealership job, but i would be doing free work.

If insight would be lovely and if anyone in Southern Cali that might know of any internships or shop openings would be awesome.  thank you"

I will graduate from a UC next December, and will not be able to go on to grad school/PhD program due to low GPA. 

I am a Pharmaceutical Chemistry major, psychology minor. I love and have an extreme passion for lab and structure. I was told by my advisor that there aren't job opportunities in the chemistry industry for people who only have a BS, that I need at least a Masters to do anything.

 Please let me know if you know this to be wrong! I am very stressed out as I love to have a plan for everything. I'm quite worried that I will end up having a job that does not require my degree at all. 

I'm not sure if there are GPA requirements for all tech schools and would love any advice. I work, have an internship, and suffered a crazy medical issue last year that aided in the drop of my grades. I study like a crazy person every day, but struggle when it comes time to take exams. 

I know I'm not stupid (for awhile there I thought I might be), but my GPA is definitely too low to move on to grad school (lower than a 2.5). I'm just not as intelligent as everyone else, and it has definitely been a struggle accepting that. 

I appreciate any responses and advice you can give me. Thank you for reading my lengthy stressed out post. "

I don't know why I'm posting this. Honestly, I think I need the catharsis of just pouring it out in a list. I have a wonderful, supportive boyfriend, but talking to just him isn't enough.

So, this week was fucking hell. It seemed like every misogynist in the world had a meeting where they agreed to convene on my life and fuck with me.

A few things happened from Monday through Thursday that weren't a huge deal, but bugged the shit out of me.Most notably, one of my professors won't call on me anymore because I a.) used the word privilege when talking about Durkheim's fucking INTEGRATION THEORY and b.) deigned to agree with Marx about female oppression.

Everything else happened on Friday. It was the last day of my internship with Planned Parenthood, and it was supposed to be such a great day. It wasn't. I'm going to try to list why succinctly.

Here goes:* There's a great smoking spot outside of my work where people from PP, a few restaurants, and an architectural firm congregate. Sometimes, deliveries will be dropped off there (it's basically an alley). Most of the time, that's okay -- I've been hit on by a few of the men who are dropping off or unloading the truck from the restaurant, but yesterday, some asshole thought it'd be a great pick-up line to start singing Blurred Lines to me. I couldn't even muster a response, I just had to create a huge gap between us as I walked past.* My boss took me out to lunch and we sat and talked. Somehow, we got to talking about men who take the door from us when we're holding it open for us. What happens when we're leaving and she holds the door for me and a man behind us? HE LITERALLY WRENCHES IT OUT OF HER HAND. Of course, I couldn't say anything.* On my way home, some shitlord in his car blared whatever misogynistic shit he was listening to and shouted ""I fucked two hoes!"" (one of the lines from the psuedo-rap he was listening to) at me when I pulled up next to him. I didn't say anything.* I took my boyfriend out to dinner to celebrate the end of my internship and being back in school. The waiters were nice, but deferred to him when seating us and when asking us for our order. I could understand that at least a little, because he's more outgoing than me and had engaged them. However, I had my wallet out the whole time, they watched me fish for the tip when we'd finished eating and were waiting on our check, and still put the receipt in front of his seat. He wasn't even there! It was just me at the table, and they slammed it in front of his chair on the table! And, again... I didn't say anything.

I don't know what was up with this week, but it made me feel powerless. I couldn't say or do anything to make myself feel better, I just let people walk all over me for being a woman.

My boyfriend bought me a dress and a new pair of shoes and wrote me a letter saying he had been wanting to get me a gift to celebrate my femininity and womanhood (my cycle synced up with the moon this month and it made me feel ultra-feminine and I made a Pokemon joke about how it felt like I evolved into a woman). It nearly made me cry, it was so great. He picked out the perfect dress, the perfect shoes, literally got what I would have if I'd had a store for my perusal. So that's good.

My last day at PP was fantastic. My boss has a crown with birth control pills glued to it and a wand with an unwrapped condom because her coworkers call her the Contraceptive Queen and one gave them to her as a Christmas present. She made me a wand with a (wrapped) condom taped to it, so I'm the Contraceptive Princess. She also went to Seattle last week for a conference and brought me a copy of The Stranger. She gave me a beautiful card, telling me how proud she is of me and how she'd give me the most glowing reference possible. So that's good.

My sister both listened to a mini-explanation of privilege (a huge fucking step forward!) and asked if I was losing weight, then said, ""I didn't mean you look prettier or anything. I'm not that much of a b**ch, you had an eating disorder -- I don't gauge your beauty through your weight."" That was yesterday night, and that was good.

Still. I feel helpless. I've never felt silenced before.

EDIT: I somehow slipped back into using bitch in my recent SRSDiscussion post, and now I feel even more awful, and I wanted to make it clear that I was directly quoting my sister there, not paraphrasing. Also, I substituted asterisks for a few letters, if that helps.

I've posted here before, and found it really helpful to just let people know how I feel. Thanks for listening. Sorry for the wall of text.

I've had an up and down adventure with mental illness - a general physician diagnosed me with depression, put me on Zoloft, and within a month I was in a full-blown manic episode. I started seeing a psychiatrist, who took me off the anti-depressant, and decided I have generalized anxiety disorder and sent me off with some Xanax. Things were fine for a couple of months, but not great. In February of this year, my boyfriend went back to school, which is 10+ hours from where I go to school. We started fighting, sleeping around, etc. I felt horrible and miserable. Couldn't sleep, didn't want to eat, made a lot of stupid, irrational choices. I went back to my psych, who diagnosed me with Bipolar disorder and put me on Depakote, a mood stabilizer. Again, everything seemed to go back to normal, I made up with my boyfriend, visited him, did well in classes. For another 3 months or so, I was doing great. However, the mood stabilizer had the (un)fortunate effect of stabilizing my mood - I wasn't sad anymore, but I couldn't be happy either. I discussed this with my psychiatrist, and he said we could consider taking me off of it, as he decided I was ""the 1 in 100 bi-polar people who might not need a mood stabilizer."" Unfortunately, due to an exam, I missed my next appointment. Because of this, he refused to see me until September (as in now.) I found a new psychiatrist, explained everything, and he decided to take me off Depakote. 

By now it is summer of 2013, I'm living with boyfriend, working at an internship I love, very low stress life, etc. I slowly taper off the Depakote and I feel better than I ever have in my life. My anxiety was under control, I'm not sad, I felt, for three months at least, like a little kid again. 

But in the past few days that's all gone away. My boyfriend is studying abroad in Europe, so he's not around the time anymore, and I don't get to talk to him as much as I used to. My internship is finished up, so I have no major responsibilities to commit myself to. I'm living in a city that isn't where I grew up or where I went to school, so I know relatively few people. I feel like I'm doing everything I can (trying to eat well, exercise, get enough sleep, work on my thoughts and do meditation) and yet everything is spiraling out of control. Over the summer I took xanax once - at the airport when my flight was delayed and I got very anxious. I've taken it every day for the past three days. 

I've been working with my therapist and my psychiatrist on cognitive behavioral therapy to figure out what exactly is wrong. Growing up, I had a very poor relationship with my Dad and his family. I was frequently neglected by them (I haven't received so much as a birthday card in 10 years, I'm 21.) Since elementary school, no achievement, project, or venture was enough to satisfy them or gain their approval and affection. My dad stopped coming to band concerts, plays, and science fairs. On my 16th birthday, which is very close to my cousin's birthday, my Grandparents threw a party, primarily for my cousin, where they gave him a new car. I got a gift card to Barnes and Noble. I think, because of this, I've become very insecure and am constantly hounded by feelings of inadequacy. 

Now I've whipped myself up into a lather over my boyfriend. Again I feel like I'm hounded persistently by thoughts that he's going to leave me, that I'm not good/cool/attractive enough, etc. I'm excited for him and his time studying abroad, but when he tells me about going clubbing and taking hard drugs I end up worried - worried for his safety, but mostly worried that because I'm in some faceless Midwestern City sitting on my ass eating bonbons and not rolling on e in a cosmopolitan European powerhouse that he'll get tired of me and leave me. I've had some shitty boyfriends in the past, who have cheated on me, broken up via phonecall, and I'm just afraid it's going to happen again. I have really no reason to - my Boyfriend is always excited to talk and makes a huge effort to make time to communicate. 

We've also discussed experimenting with openness, and when we decided on it back in August, I felt really comfortable with it. We set clear boundaries and rules, and it seemed like something I could be comfortable. Now I see that as another locus of inadequacy - what happens if we decide to do that and he's out fucking hot eurodudes and I'm stuck in my small college town staring out the window, drinking wine, and feeling sorry for myself?

I want to tell him all of this, but I'm afraid he'll think I'm nuts. He struggles with mental health issues as well, and has been dealing with those in adjusting to life in a foreign country, and I don't want to give him more to deal with. 

At this point, everything seems wrong. Part of me wants to go out and party and do drugs, and another part of me wants to crawl in bed and cry. Everything feels lose-lose-lose for me and win-win-win-win for everyone else. 

I don't know what I expect out of this post, except to get my thoughts down in the universe and maybe a kind word. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: Shitty dad treated me like crap, feelings of inadequacy, jealousy, and insecurity crippling my relationship and personal life. "

Sorry if this if this post gets depressing. 

I am pretty new to the area, and I'm looking for help making friends and not feel lonely in this big town. A little background: I moved here in early May after finishing my last semester at Iowa State. I moved here to be with my then-girlfriend. Things were going great and I was able to get a job/internship in Iowa, which I need to finish my degree. 

Well since my girlfriend was the only link I had to Omaha, and we were serious I didn't really get out to explore much on my own. (I was at the CWS and did other events, but it was with her obviously.) However, the great times, unfortunately came to an end and she broke up with me. 

Now I feel really lonely and a little stuck, I don't have any family in the area, and I'm not making a fortune either (internship salaries) so I won't be able to move anytime soon. I don't really know anyone and am just trying to reach out, and stop feeling lonely.

Any and all advice is welcomed. Feel free to comment here or PM me. "
1limsy,6,2013-09-01,Training in a foreign environment,daltontogreen,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1limsy/training_in_a_foreign_environment/,"Hi /r/running,

I was wondering if you all could help me out with an issue I'm struggling with. I'm a student studying computer engineering and I managed to get an internship in Switzerland this semester working on medical devices. I've been in Lausanne for about 1.5 months and it's been an interesting experience so far. 

However, it's been a struggle to get adapted to my new environment. The Swiss have rules/fines/fees for everything. As a student, it feels like I'm being thrust into the real world where I have to worry about housing, health, transportation, food, funds, etc on a daily basis. The hardest part I believe is doing it all alone without any friends or family helping me out.

I'm posting on /r/running because I'm also training for the Lausanne Marathon and after that, the Boston Marathon. The Lausanne marathon is rather flat and is usually something I can handle and run decently well. However, I've been having a hard time training because of the stress of living alone in a strange new place. So I have two questions:

1) Is running after college going to be like this? Or is Switzerland just making my life difficult? There's a language barrier at times and everything is so expensive here. I sometimes feel overwhelmed by all the responsibilities I have. I'm wondering if this is what it is going to be like after I graduate. When I'm at school, I manage to eat well, sleep well, run 50-60 miles a week, and take a full engineering courseload. But, if I'm not able to train well here, will I be able to continue training when I have a 9-5 job?

2) Should I accept that the Lausanne marathon might not be my fastest race and take it easy? This would be my 4th marathon and I always try to PR with each new race. I ran a 2:51 in Philly which qualified me for Boston, so I thought I would run Lausanne to keep me in shape for the biggie in April. Do you think I should focus on getting used to my environment and cut back on the mileage? The marathon is less than 2 months away and my longest run has been a 17.5 miler. My pace is not great and that just makes me want to train harder.

Thanks for reading. I also love everything else about Switzerland, so hope this post doesn't dissuade you from visiting. Running in the Swiss wilderness is actually amazing.

1lih7b,2,2013-09-01,Any advice for someone whose brother has depression.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lih7b/any_advice_for_someone_whose_brother_has/,"Hi,  




Mine little brother (24) has recently been diagnosed with depression. 

He always was a introvert type. But he really shut down when he failed his school 8 months ago. 

He started sleep in the mornings and wake up the the evenings. Stopped going outside and gained a lot of weight. 

In the beginning i did not really notice the change (busy with mine own 6 month internship so i was never home and i was busy with mine own problems). I though that he was going though a rough patch and that he would get his act together. 

This did not happen and it only got worse. I tried to talk to him but he did not want to talk to me. Sometimes after a lot of talking i would get fractions of what was troubling him ( him thinking that he is stupid for not getting his degree, thinking he is a bad person).

I understood that simply telling him that he is smart and that he is a good person would not really work. So i had to show him.....

Before this we never really did anything together. We never really bonded as childeren and i am always busy (run/fitness 3 times a week, go to collage, hang out with friends, hobbies). 

I started with trying to get him in a normal sleep and eating pattern, taking him out with mine friends, started doing activities together and trying to have a good time. 

This was very difficult for me. 

An example:

In the beginning i had to litterly wake him up and drag him out of his bed, convince him that he had to have breakfast, cut his nails, shave etc.

It was also a struggle to get hem to do any activities. But after he did those, he seemed happier and openend up a little.

But the next day i had to do it all over again. 

After two months he did show more initiative (proposed going to the cinema's, festivals) but he still needed a lot of coaching. 

But i noticed that this was taking its toll an me. Sporting perfomance and graded got worse and i never did anyting i liked. I understood that i was not the best person to help him and that i had to take a step back, not just for him but also for me.

I suggested that he needed to go to an psychiatrist. He went and was diagnosed with depression. He now has a weekly appointment and gets some antideppression meds. 

His condition improved but then mine parents heared about it.

In mine family it is the misconception that only extreem crazy people go to an psychiatrist, need medication and and up being drug addicted hobo's.  Tried to convince them that this is not the case but this did not work.

They urged mine brother to stop taking his meds. He went for me for advice and i suggested that since his condition was improving that he would continue taking his meds (if necessary in secret) and that maybe the psychiatrist had any advice.

Mine parents were invited to a session to discus the misconceptions. After a long session discussing the importance of the treatment and agreeing that it was importend, they reacted by going home and hiding the meds from mine brother. 

In a week time his condition got back to pre medication level. After talking to him about it he told me that mam and dad are hiding his meds and that is how i learned about it. 

I adviced him to discus this with the psychiatrist and told him that our parents are morons. 

Right now i am very pissed at mine parents and i dont know what more i can do to help mine brother.

I see that i have typed way more that i intended so here is an TLDR.

TLDR:

Little brother has depression--&gt;I tried to help, noticed i was not the guy--&gt;went to the psychiatrist, he got weekly appointments and antidepression medications--&gt;he improved--&gt;parents found out and are a negative factor to his treatment--&gt;he got worse--&gt; i dont know how i can help....

I apologise for the bad spelling/grammatical errors and if this in the wrong subreddid.

Thanks in advance.

Want to get back into culinary after long break.

I remember things like how to cut an onion and what mis en place means, but not a whole lot  more I think. Friend said I need to work if I want to be prepared for culinary school and not waste any time.

What kind of restaurants are willing to stage almost beginners?

What should I say to the chef?

What should I bring/ wear when I talk to the chef?

I don't have a coat or a knife set anymore. What should I do about that? 

I don't want to ask this, but I know I should: I'm a vegetarian who is completely willing to cut, prepare, and taste meat. Will that affect anything?

Tell me anything else I need to know! Please and thank you thank you thank you.

[20M],LDAway,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1li5mc/i_feel_completely_lost_20m/,"Hey guys, I recently moved to Taiwan at the beginning of August leaving my boyfriend behind in England. I'm here for an internship which was originally supposed to be 12 months but I've recently decided to cut it to 6 months because I feel like I just can't cope with the severe emotional swings I've been having.

We talk to each other over Skype 1-2 times a week and send little messages to each other every day. The main problem is that I feel like I'm beginning to get paranoid - I keep feeling that he is going to lose interest in me and leave me for someone else. He's reassured me that he loves me very much and is coming to visit me in November, which I realise is a massive commitment and shows just how much he loves me.

Despite this I still continue to suffer from occasional paranoia and homesickness. I woke up this morning feeling like I wanted to throw up. I'm trying really hard to keep positive but every day just seems to be harder than the previous, I'm head over heels for him and I just feel like going home to be with him. I really want to stay here to complete my internship as I realise what a fantastic opportunity it is for me, but I feel like I'm going crazy and I just don't know what to do.

I regularly tell him how much I miss him and how I can't wait to see him again, but I feel as if I'm just annoying him and making him lose interest (paranoia again... he insists he likes getting the messages from me). I would really appreciate any advice you guys have for me; at the moment I don't think I'll last much longer."
1lhxz3,4,2013-08-31,Long-lasting repercussions...,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lhxz3/longlasting_repercussions/,"I guess I'm dealing with some residual anger over the whole Nmom center of the universe childhood-o-rama.

I have always figured I would get out of it and over it by putting my life together and moving on on my own. But it seems like I ruined my own life so early on that there isn't any fixing it.

I know that probably sounds stupid and melodramatic, so here's the rundown. I left home early, when my parents were splitting up- mom had moved to a foreign country while dad was supporting her financially and otherwise to follow her dreams, she repayed him by cheating on him, and basically considering their marriage ""over"", but of course not actually getting divorced bc her boyfriends arent going to support her, so staying half in. Dad had moved in w us in foreign country, mom was sleeping w her (otherwise engaged) boyfriend while dad slept on the couch. It was time for me to go, went back to home country, finished a high school as a salutatorian, got into college, went when i was 16.

Unfortunately, that is where things got bad for me- with no financial suport or basically even contact w my parents (dad called, but i didnt know how to tell him i was not ok. he wanted me to be ok, and i wanted to be ok for him, he was pretty destroyed from the whole cheating dumping using thing my mom did). Really, support from anyone- I was barely keeping it together. 

Shitty grades my first year, almost flunked out. Was so depressed i didnt even know i was depressed. The next 3 years, got mostly A's and B's, but not solid enough to really pull up my GPA.  Was determined to finish, mostly just because I had no idea what else to do- no money (all on scholarships and loans), no car or license, just had to get that degree, and I did, in Biochemistry (which to this day my mom cant remember). The last year I was there my mom moved back to the country, and nearby-ish enough to take a 6 hr train ride. After 3 years of being homeless between semesters, staying with my friends and giving them whatever work-study money i had saved up, or going to see my dad where he was staying w his relatives, having to ""come home"" from college to sleeping on some distant uncles floor who hated me, staying with my brother and his wife who bullied me constantly for being in college instead of in the real world, never having a home to go to, I was honestly happy my mom lived nearby. 

Then I remember how it is. When she tells me how ungrateful I am for being allowed to sleep in her bosses living room, when she cant fathom how hard it is to not have a home to go to, when no one is on your emergency contact list when you're 17 bc no one in your family has a phone number, when your friends parents give you the ""you're like a daughter to us!"" and it hurts because it is a nice thing to say but it isnt true, really. And you feel like a fucking orphan with 2 living parents. Living for 2 years with a broken infected tooth bc I couldnt afford it taken out until after I worked the next summer, ""why don't you just call your parents?"" 


Ok now I'm just rambling. The point was, college was really isolating time, and my mom showed up the last six months to get in all the graduation pictures and be like so totally excited! Which is fine. THE REAL POINT (its hard to summarize without getting sucked down memory lane) is that I was like this super ""gifted"" kid, who had always known the only way i was going to get somewhere was on my own, and then I fucked up college and I keep trying and trying again, post bac studies, internships, etc. But none of them really seem to build on each other and I end up being still 6 years out of college, no prospects. And the worst part is that I've left one progrm and one job because my boss was someone just like my mom, or at least super manipulative, and I feel like I dont have any tools for dealing with that. 


I don't even know why I wrote this, I guess it just hurts a lot that this could have ended so differently with something as simple as a support system. And believe me when I say that I am taking responsibility for my life, I keep picking myself up by the bootstraps and I just dont seem to be able to get a hold of anything. 


Example: I had a job interview at Columbia after leaving my unfinished masters degree. I thought I had left on good terms, I had worked (and been paid) by my supervisor for a year, when I left he was all oh good luck! and then i got a one line email from him after my interview that just said ""please remove me from your list of professional references"". How the hell do you apply to jobs without a reference for the place you just worked for a year?


Anyway, what cued this all off was my mom screaming the house down and breaking dishes  and trying to break down my bedroom door that ""what the fuck was I talking about, she was there for me every step of the way through college, what,  I get to  hate her because she doesnt own a big house"" and giving examples of things she knew about happening in college- all of which happened in the last 6 months when she moved back. And when I was 20 and when I had friends and a job, not when i was totally isolated and completely broke and 16.



I know it sounds stupid to resent this, but I just feel like I've missed all my chances and everything is over. And Ive been feeling like a loser for the last 10 years, and I thought that was supposed to stop when i got out of her house.


TLDR: Went to college early to escape nmom's abuse/neglect cycle, was a total fucking mess in college, pulled it together the last few years but not enough to get good refs or a good enough GPA. Keep trying to put things together, keep watching them crumble. Personal problems at work- might be too ingratiating?

Sorry for being a big old bummer- you guys are usually pretty good  to talk to when i feel like what i feel is so crazy that no one will understand. Thanks :)"

However, I had my wallet out the whole time, they watched me fish for the tip when we'd finished eating and were waiting on our check, and still put the receipt in front of his seat. He wasn't even there! It was just me at the table, and they slammed it in front of his chair on the table! And, again... I didn't say anything.

I don't know what was up with this week, but it made me feel powerless. I couldn't say or do anything to make myself feel better, I just let people walk all over me for being a woman.

My boyfriend bought me a dress and a new pair of shoes and wrote me a letter saying he had been wanting to get me a gift to celebrate my femininity and womanhood (my cycle synced up with the moon this month and it made me feel ultra-feminine and I made a Pokemon joke about how it felt like I evolved into a woman). It nearly made me cry, it was so great. He picked out the perfect dress, the perfect shoes, literally got what I would have if I'd had a store for my perusal. So that's good.

My last day at PP was fantastic. My boss has a crown with birth control pills glued to it and a wand with an unwrapped condom because her coworkers call her the Contraceptive Queen and one gave them to her as a Christmas present. She made me a wand with a (wrapped) condom taped to it, so I'm the Contraceptive Princess. She also went to Seattle last week for a conference and brought me a copy of The Stranger. She gave me a beautiful card, telling me how proud she is of me and how she'd give me the most glowing reference possible. So that's good.

My sister both listened to a mini-explanation of privilege (a huge fucking step forward!) and asked if I was losing weight, then said, ""I didn't mean you look prettier or anything. I'm not that much of a b**ch, you had an eating disorder -- I don't gauge your beauty through your weight."" That was yesterday night, and that was good.

Still. I feel helpless. I've never felt silenced before.

EDIT: I somehow slipped back into using bitch in my recent SRSDiscussion post, and now I feel even more awful, and I wanted to make it clear that I was directly quoting my sister there, not paraphrasing. Also, I substituted asterisks for a few letters, if that helps.

1lhw4g,17,2013-08-31,[long rant] This has been a horrible week for me just because I'm a woman.,[deleted],SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1lhw4g/long_rant_this_has_been_a_horrible_week_for_me/,"I don't know why I'm posting this. Honestly, I think I need the catharsis of just pouring it out in a list. I have a wonderful, supportive boyfriend, but talking to just him isn't enough.

So, this week was fucking hell. It seemed like every misogynist in the world had a meeting where they agreed to convene on my life and fuck with me.

A few things happened from Monday through Thursday that weren't a *huge* deal, but bugged the shit out of me.
Most notably, one of my professors won't call on me anymore because I a.) used the word privilege when talking about Durkheim's fucking INTEGRATION THEORY and b.) deigned to agree with Marx about female oppression.

Everything else happened on Friday. It was the last day of my internship with Planned Parenthood, and it was supposed to be *such* a great day. It wasn't. I'm going to try to list why succinctly.

Here goes:

* There's a great smoking spot outside of my work where people from PP, a few restaurants, and an architectural firm congregate. Sometimes, deliveries will be dropped off there (it's basically an alley). Most of the time, that's okay -- I've been hit on by a few of the men who are dropping off or unloading the truck from the restaurant, but yesterday, some asshole thought it'd be a great pick-up line to start singing *Blurred Lines* to me. I couldn't even muster a response, I just had to create a huge gap between us as I walked past.

* My boss took me out to lunch and we sat and talked. Somehow, we got to talking about men who take the door from us when we're holding it open for us. What happens when we're leaving and she holds the door for me and a man behind us? HE LITERALLY WRENCHES IT OUT OF HER HAND. Of course, I couldn't say anything.

* On my way home, some shitlord in his car blared whatever misogynistic shit he was listening to and shouted ""I fucked two hoes!"" (one of the lines from the psuedo-rap he was listening to) at me when I pulled up next to him. I didn't say anything.

* I took my boyfriend out to dinner to celebrate the end of my internship and being back in school. The waiters were nice, but deferred to him when seating us and when asking us for our order. I could understand that at least a little, because he's more outgoing than me and had engaged them.

He wasn't even there! It was just me at the table, and they slammed it in front of his chair on the table! And, again... I didn't say anything.

I don't know what was up with this week, but it made me feel *powerless.* I couldn't say or do anything to make myself feel better, I just let people walk all over me *for being a woman.*

I've always had some success with going up to a girl (whose eye I've caught or something similar) and saying something like ""Hi, my name is Cardgiver, and I think you're gorgeous..."" and then some variation of asking for her number/giving her mine. The asking/giving is the part I need to work on.

I've just started an internship, and received really nice business cards, which occured to me might help a lot in this case. Something along the lines of ""Here's my card if you're interested in going out"". Makes the whole exchange much smoother.

First, two small questions:

1) What's the general opinion on giving a card? Douchey, elegant...?

2) Should I just give my card as in ""Here's my card..."" or ask if she wants it before extending it?

And for the big question:

My internship is at a very large investment bank (think Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse...). I'm sure there are a lot of women who might be turned off by the banker stereotype (even though I'm far from it). What worries me more is, could this come across as me trying to tell you ""I make a lot of money""? I really wouldn't like to give this impression.

TL;DR: Could giving a girl my card, which is from a very large investment bank, make it seem as though I'm trying to impress her with money? Also, general opinion on going up to a girl and offering a card?

Thanks!"

This no success thing has been a perpetual problem all my life.  Mutual (physical) attraction has been elusive for me.  To give you an idea of my dating frequency I've been on one date so far this year and it had nothing to do with okc.

I have been working on improving myself.  I started weightlifting earlier this year and revamped my entire wardrobe.  Online, the girls just don't respond.  IRL I'm shy (shitty excuse but it's me) so I find it difficult to initiate conversations.  I have some friends who don't mind initiating when drunk, so I tagalong with them.  Once the conversation gets going the girls I talk to seem interested and engaged.  They face me, seem relaxed, play with their hair hardcore, contribute to the conversation, and laugh when I say funny things.  More often than not I get their number before I leave(number's real because I call their phone to give them my number).  But they usually don't respond to my text the next day.  DC has a large amount of interns and some of these girls were interns that were leaving at the end of the summer.  This could play into their decision not to respond but since I'm not privy to the reason I default to lack of physical attraction.

I guess a bit of background here would be appropriate. The wall of backstory really ties into the reason she decided to quit, I think.  She and I had been dating for three years this November. We'd been seeing each other on and off up through my junior year of college, at which point we decided to get together (she was in the class below me). The first few months were pretty bumpy (I was massively immature and generally inconsiderate), but things weren't bad. After the summer break, fall semester of senior represented a very strong time in the relationship. I don't know why things went so well that semester, it was like we perfectly understood each other and matched up so well. In the background of all this, she'd been applying to study abroad next semester in South America, which I had reservations about, but I wanted to let her do her thing.


And so I did. That next spring is when things first got dicey.  I guess I was overly attached to her or dependent, maybe, but she really wanted to get away from me there, in my opinion. I think she would agree she was looking to get a bit detached from me. That just led to strings and strings of arguments and fights because I didn't feel like any of my needs were being taken care of. At one point, she asked for a break, but I refused, painting it as tantamount to a breakup, which is something she didn't want. Additionally, at this time, I was trying to decide where to go to grad school - we had discussed a few destinations and schools, but never said I ""had"" to go to a particular location. In the end, I decided to go to the one school, unbeknownst to me, that she was against, mainly because of its location. It made the most sense to me - a combination of where I actually got in, prestinge, and value - but she started dropping hints that she wouldn't be in my future if I chose to go. I don't remember if this was the same time she requested a break, but I decided to enroll at that school in the city she claimed she saw ""no opportunity' in (population of 300k, some very good schools).


Generally, I refer to her time abroad as ""bad."" Perhaps my biggest problem was that I wasn't direct or firm about my positions as much as I needed to be - I generally sought to appease and come down for positions, even if it kind of meant feeling like I'd been left alone.  Anyway, she had been casting an eye towards teaching after graduation and going out for Teach for America. I was cool with this; she could get fairly close and do something she wanted. At the same time, she also floated ideas about moving to my city using another program, but never did more than float the idea.

She got into TFA. That's great and all, and she lands in a city about 2.5 hours away. No big deal, right? We'd both be busy but maybe we could carve out time to see one another after a busy summer (we were both more or less working full-time). Another unfortunate thing happened, but she doesn't refer to it in saying why she broke up with me.


Fast forward to the end of the summer. We talked about me coming down to see her and her new place. I even volunteered to get out of my internship a week early to be able to spend the most time down there right after driving up and down my state to help my siblings move to their place and move into my new place as well. That was hell on earth, haha. But, I get down there, and things just felt weird. I pull up after scrambling to get down there, she's trying to hustle me into bed so she can sleep. That's fine, it was kind of late and she gets tired easily. Over the next 10 days or so, I generally spend time by myself - she's doing training all week, all day. That's fine, but after she comes back, she never took any real interest in me but made of point of asking me to always ask how her day was. Okay, maybe that's stress. We also had a huge fight during the week...I was not dealing with my friend's attitude very well and I was standoffish to her. 
&gt;That standoffishness came from another issue - in a previous discussion, she admitted she'd grown to like her new city and asked me if I would come down. This took me by supreme surprise - we'd talked about a few cities we could move to next year, but hers was never on the list; my job search was not looking in that direction at all, and it was getting too late in the season to do anything about it. When she dropped it on me, I more or less answered with ""I don't know if I even can."" Later, I came back and admitted the question pissed me off - way to let me know so late. I also raged because I didn't feel I was being given much leeway - I felt it was ""I will more or less have a job here if I want it, so I have the power here."" Not cool. Nevertheless, I put in applications with a few corporations down there, trying to reorient myself after spending so much capital moving another way.

After I book out back to my city to finally unpack and organize my apartment, she becomes distant. Part of this is certainly due to working around the clock, but another part of it is that she made little effort to contact me unless I contacted her first. Weekend before last, she lets me know she gets wasted, then flat out stops talking to me before I message her. She lets me know she's watching a movie and cuts out again, not to be heard from again. We catch up the next day.


Things seemed off, but a few days later, I'm asking her what we are going to do for Labor Day weekend - maybe I could come down to see her, but I am travel weary (I had yet to spend a weekend at my place). She suspects she's going to be busy with work through the weekend, and doesn't want to come up to see me (nor had really ever suggested she would because of work, while ""hoping I would be able to visit once a month."").

Right after that, she says she needs to talk (note, this is all text. Couldn't even earn a call). She tells me she wants to take a break, and I ask why and for details of such a break (freedom, duration, etc). I end up calling it an amicable breakup, language that would haunt me. 


I was torn up about the break, but I was putting distance on it. I wheeled around on Saturday (I think, it might have been yesterday), though, and asked what was really going on. And it turns out she really decided to quit because:

* I apparently changed her - she's always been huge on travel, and I had been ho-hum about it; I'd worry about it when I had the resources, so I wouldn't commit to doing anything. However, talk of that never really came up after a year or so ago.
* Less passion (fading spark) - This one, I don't get.
* Less communication - this one, I told her I blamed her because she had been making far less effort to communicate with me.
* I take my anger out on her (not physically, but by expressing it to her). I don't get this one...where else am I supposed to put it? If I'm mad, she is going to be the one person that really sees it because she was the closest.
* My parents? Technically, she'd never met them because of me. I'm foreign and my parents are very narrow-minded. I'd been trying to introduce her to them but it blew up so hard in my face, mainly because I was also taking a trip to see her (her idea) at the same time. Anyway, she'd become committed to the idea my parents already loathed her without knowing her; they might have had apprehensions, sure, but they're not *that* bad (at least my mom, my dad is a whole different story). It was something that didn't bother her at first but had ground on her more and more.
* I never proposed? At one point, I made a lot of talk of proposing to her, but she managed to inject just enough doubt into my head that made me want to hold off (I think she interprets that as in I wasn't really ready to do it). Later on, she didn't quite insist but insisted that I do it, and I held off, wanting things to settle down and more importantly, wanting the right opportunity. I think she regards it as some sort of joke ultimately, or that I was just joking about it all along. I really wasn't - I have a ring (WTF am I going to do with it?!) and had been thinking about how to pull it off in an LDR.
* We weren't serious about being in the same place, according to her.


Needless to say, I don't get why she broke up with me.  Ultimately, I feel like she didn't give me a real chance to address her issues or open a dialogue. Instead, she got the idea things needed to change and contacted me once she felt like it. I was expected to take my lumps and get out.


It's been an insanely rough time for me. I've been pouring my feelings into alcohol and having fairly rage-y conversations with her, where she tells me I'm just talking and circles and that she's too busy to talk.  In those, ultimately, I want her to actually seem like she's sorry or cares (despite claiming to). Really, I feel like she handled it wrong (and wronged me, but I haven't gotten her to admit it - am I just being an asshole? I am also trying to let her figure out that she's actually hurt me really badly - I always seem like someone not affected by emotional turmoil, but I am just beside myself here. I just feel *unstable*.



Half the time I want to cry, the other half I'm punching my bed and pillows because I just have an urge to destroy something (but also don't want to break actual stuff). Most of the time I want to drink. I don't want it to be like this, and I feel helpless. I'm scared of what will happen to me. I have let a few friends know, but their support has been limited. I don't know who I can talk to - I don't want to talk to my family about it, after putting up such a fight for her, I don't want to hamper my friends with my shit, and I don't have anyone else.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend decides she needs to break up with me, I feel left out of the process of coming to that conclusion. Blindsided, even. I don't know how to handle myself, and I fear I'm going to destroy myself or destroy something."

been together for 2.5 years but had quite a few taxing legs of distance. Im working in our home town, while she has been away for studies and internships often. We have probably spent about 1 year physically in the same place. She just started a new internship 4 hrs away but will return home for at least 4 months afterwards.


Her new internship is going horrible! She´s very ambitious and works in a tough field. However this time around she´s having a really hard time. Nobody talks to her and people belittle her in meetings. She even goes to lunch on her own.


I want to be there for her and help her get through this! However our phone conversations are going really bad lately. I try pretty hard to be understanding and listen to her and let her tell her story with me asking the details. 

But then she gets embarrassed and angry at me asking for details, since she´s not used to performing bad.


I then try to give her suggestions whioch she doesn´t like either and gets angry at me for not really understanding her problem. She says she doesn´t want solutions but wants me to guide her to a solution.


Makes sense, but I suck at this sort of thing. Every conversation about work feels liek a minefield right now. And it just makes me sad. I wish I had something funnny or witty to tell her and cheer her up but nothing just seems to work at the moment. 

She also hates it when I try to relate problems to me, as in ""I had a similar situation lately, i solved it this way and it went well""..
She further says she doesn´t want to be teaching me how to give proper advice. I already have a lot more relationship experience than her but she is more demanding intellectually than anyone I have ever been with. It has really helped me becoming better person. But right now I feel like I try to be very sensible and am annoyed for her being disappointed in me as a partner.

So how do I talk to her about her workproblems in an understanding way that doesn´t let her feel bad?! 



I am currently dreading the phone conversations but want to do better!

Any ideas or input would be greatly appreciated

tl;dr: GF and I are in a long distance leg and she´s having a really tough time at work. I try to talk to her about it but conversations go badly and feel like a minefield :("
1lljl6,2,2013-09-02,Thinking about mentioning symptoms to my psychologist. Thoughts?,[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1lljl6/thinking_about_mentioning_symptoms_to_my/,"From the beginning....


As a kid (around 3 or 4) I was sent to a school psychologist because of problems at school (tantrums, not sharing with kids, not getting along with others, at one point completely stopped speaking) but this was before Asperger's was really considered a diagnosis, and I ended up just being moved schools and remaining undiagnosed. At my new school, I got along much better because there were two friends who I had grown up with (literally from birth, basically) who I stuck around, and while I didn't really make new friends or anything, I was much easier to get along with and caused fewer problems. I did get made fun of (A LOT) for different things, but my parents basically thought I brought it upon myself by being ""weird."" (I still remember covering my ears when there were pinatas at birthday parties and just sobbing because of the noise.) 



Fast forward 20 years, and I am noticing my ""differences"" more and more. My social anxiety is through the roof, but what bothers me more is the fact that no matter how hard I try to act ""normal"" I cannot seem to hold a conversation with people I've just met, or keep eye contact, etc. My mom likes to remind me that I took drama as a kid and I should be able to ""act"" like I'm social, because I ""make people really uncomfortable."" ""It's not normal for a 20-something year old"" to not be able to carry a conversation, etc etc. She doesn't seem to understand that I am just as (if not more than) uncomfortable as the people I'm meeting. 



What really sparked my brain was when I began looking more into signs and noticed things about being touched/hugged. I do not like hugs. I don't care who they're from, they make me want to crawl into a hole and die. The friends that I've managed to make think it's hilarious to ""fake"" hug me, but it causes extreme panic and in some cases I have actually cried from being so uncomfortable. I do have trouble keeping friends, because even if a few manage to ""break"" me and get to know me, once they see the bad side of me (meltdowns, being unintentionally rude/honest, etc) they go running. Luckily, as of now, I seem to have a few friends who understand that there's ""something"" different about me and just deal with it. 




**tl;dr**

**My main issue now** I have finished college and am starting to pursue a career in the music industry. I have been lucky enough to secure an internship where I primarily work from home, alone (answering email requests, dealing with merch orders, helping with online grant information, etc) but last week I had to be at a music video shoot for a whole day (12 hours) with people I had NEVER actually met before (the one person I had met was only there for about an hour later in the day,) and it was absolute torture. I'm really worried that I ended up making a bad impression (as the day went on I became more withdrawn, etc) but with no real diagnosis, it's hard to explain to them what it's like for me to be in those situations. 


**I don't want to be excluded in the future, I'd just like there to be a way to easily explain to them that this is something I deal with but if they kind of ""bear with me"" I'm pretty easy to get along with. Should I bring up the signs/symptoms I've noticed to the psychologist I've been seeing?** (I've been seeing him at the request of my mother who ""can't deal with"" how ""difficult"" I am making her life, she's retired and never imagined having to still take care of a 23 year old child, she wants to be able to travel and live ""peacefully"" in her own house, etc etc)


I always worry that I will basically be laughed at or told some variation of ""you're not a professional, why would you self-diagnose"" if I bring up things that I believe are symptoms, and then have the idea dismissed. I also have a very good sense of humour (which I think would be unusual for someone on the spectrum, no?) and once I get to know people good luck getting me to shut up, but the other ""symptoms"" I notice are really affecting my life. I'm not even looking for a full diagnosis, even just a professional to say ""You meet the requirements, here's how we can work on handling this"" without a concrete diagnosis would be helpful in my eyes. 



What has your experience been with bringing up what you believe are signs of an ASD to a professional? Any tips, etc?

1ll9gc,1,2013-09-02,Well Reasoned Rage: A brief examination of a particular problem within TNA,davoinshower-handel,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1ll9gc/well_reasoned_rage_a_brief_examination_of_a/,"This was originally a part of a comment I wanted to post in another thread. However, I decided it was different from the first part of the comment, so I've decided to post about it and start a new discussion. The comment is still there though.(http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1lcsfx/bischoff_and_hogan_bury_tna_and_anonymous_tna/) 

Anyway, let me know what you all think. I'm thinking of making this a regular thing, since it felt really good to get it all out on paper... er, screen.

While TNA had the right idea in trying to bring in younger talent over the past year or so, they've still failed to give the genuinely talented workers the opportunities they deserve. They started with Joey Ryan, and he was pretty damn golden at first, but then they completely, inexplicably dropped the ball with him. The same goes for every Gutcheck contestant that actually seemed to catch on quickly with the fans. So while the dirtsheets and news sites mention that they're interested in new blood, but they repeatedly give up on the new guys who show the most potential. 

It's also worth noting that their scouting process itself is sub-par at best; they often brought up decent guys who just happened to already be well into their 30s (eg Christian York), or they tried to promote guys who just plain don't deserve the roster spot (Bischoff- but we all know why for him, Brisco, Gunner, Robbie E, etc.) Hell, even Magnus comes to mind, seeing as how they've pushed him to the moon even though he has yet to prove himself as an excellent in-ring performer. Keep in mind, this is all despite the company having shown fairly recently that they have at least some capability of finding and hiring great workers from the Indy circuit--- take one look at Austin Aries, for Christy's sake! (see what I did there?) And yet, here are the ""fresh young wrestlers"" that TNA has brought in recently in some capacity: Jessie Godderz and Rockstar Spud. 

This is where I get extremely confused. Despite WWE's now-regular practice of snatching up big names within ROH and other promotions, there is still an abundance of talent out there. Since you guys like evidence, here's a few dudes that come to mind: Davey Richards, Michael Elgin, Colt Cabana (I don't even care that he's old, make him a goddamn announcer to put Mike Tenay out of his misery), Roderick Strong, John Morrison (remember him?), The Briscoe Brothers, Prince Devitt, and last but not least, Kevin Steen. Screw it, pick up one of the youngsters WWE has wasted when he gets released. You could even go with the common practice of the mid-90s and pick up the stars of Japan and Mexico; I don't even keep track of NJPW, but it doesn't take much web surfing to have heard the name Kazuchika Okada It would take a single intern with nothing other than a single computer to figure out who's worth checking out. So, please, Bischoff and Co: go back to basics and remember that there's voices out there besides those of your friends. I'm not even talking about the Internet; read a PWI issue or look at Dave Meltzer's match rankings once in a while and you'll have a direction to go in. That is all. Thank you for your time.

**TL;DR: TNA has started to take baby steps in incorporating younger talent into their product in the past year or so, despite claims to the contrary, but they're either pushing the wrong guys as if they don't know where to look, or they're throwing away potential stars for no clear reason.**"

1ljxxm,11,2013-09-01,My 7 year old is missing his dad super hard and I'm worried and overwhelmed.,[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ljxxm/my_7_year_old_is_missing_his_dad_super_hard_and/,"My kiddo turned 7 last month.  When he was 3.5, we left his father and went to a domestic violence shelter.  I was granted a one year protection order, and his dad left us 100% alone for almost three years.

Earlier this year, I randomly got a text saying he wanted to be a part of our son's life.  We talked on the phone that night, and later Skyped.  This was February 2013.  In late March, a very close, very loved family member on that side of the family unexpectedly passed away.  My son's father came up for the funeral and we saw him for the first time in years.  It went fine.

Fast forward a few months, we're having weekly phone calls (which I supervised) and Skypes.  He asks if this summer the kiddo can come visit him for awhile.  I said maybe, I had conditions, I had to be convinced.  I was/am an exhausted and young single mom, who was bogged down with full-time school, a job and an internship.  I eventually agreed to a 5.5 week visit - we live in Washington state, he and his new wife live in Colorado.

Overall, everything went really well.  I had near-daily phone calls, kid had a blast.  I missed him like hell, but I also really appreciated the free time.  I've had him since I was 18, and I hadn't ever been alone for more than two days at time in my entire life.  It was rough in some ways, but I think it was super valuable for us both.

So, he's home now.  The first couple of days were great.  He was excited to be home.  He's always been a very sweet, loving and well-behaved kiddo.  High energy, for sure, but well-behaved.  Things aren't great today.  This morning I took him for a special treat breakfast (we don't go out a lot, what with being broke).  He was being subtly annoying - not obnoxious enough for others to be bothered by it, I don't think.  But he was mouthing everything I said, lying down on the booth, complaining the food was taking too long, saying we should get it ""to go"", etc.  Annoying.

I got mad.  I texted his dad (knowing that they took him out to eat just about every day while he was there), asking if the kid misbehaved like that with him.  He said no, that he was great.  That they usually brought coloring for him (which I'd done) and played tic-tac-toe, etc.

I'm not proud of this part.  I looked the kiddo in the eye and asked him why he was being a little monster for me, and never for his dad.  Told him I'd texted his dad and told him he was being annoying in a resturaunt.  Asked what's up with that.  His face fell.  I asked him if he'd like to play tic-tac-toe, since he enjoyed that with his dad.

At that point, he held his coloring up to his face and I saw these tears streaming off his chin.  No audible sounds, just silent tears.  His pancakes came, and the tears kept coming.  He started eating, still crying.

I felt awful.  Totally awful.  I pride myself on being a gentle but firm parent, and I lost that for a minute.  I gave him a hug, told him to eat his food.

He started complaining that he wanted to go home and lie down after eating some of his food.  So I got the check, boxed the food, we went home.  He laid in my  bed and stared at the ceiling for a solid 4 hours.

We/he have family support here kind of, but they're in another city (fairly accesible, but not very much so).  I feel pretty alone and exhausted and stressed, and terrified of bills, etc, most of the time.  My kid is typically wonderful, but he's also kind of high needs.  He still has accidents (pees himself) most days of the week.  Occasionally #2 accidents, too.  He's behind in reading.  I worry so much.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this stuff, how to help foster a good parent/child relationship when his dad is in another state and is actually quite the douche who still hasn't apologized for anything that happened?  Yeah, I'm a little bitter.  He also hasn't paid a penny of child support, ever.  So there's that.

TL;DR:  7 year old spent 5.5 weeks with his long-lost dad out of state, came home, and is misbehaving and doesn't want to do anything but lie around and watch TV.  Young, single mom is overwhelmed and worried.

EDIT:  We've been going to therapy together for almost 3 years, which has been immensely helpful in a lot of ways, and I'm grateful it.  However, it's not everything.  We do play-therapy, which he leads and it's parenting support for me.  It hasn't been helpful with the accidents at all, and the therapist and I kind of clash in how to handle it (for instance, he'll pretend to use the bathroom and lie about it.  I say that's lying and he should be in trouble, she analyzed me for calling it lying and says it comes from shame, and we should figure out why he does it.)  Etc."

I'm trying very hard to move from the Santa Barbara area to Los Angeles.  I've got an internship lined up in Santa Monica, and my pick of transfer locations for my (semi-low paying) job.  The problem is I can't find an apartment.

I'm attempting to move with my 5 yr roommate but our range is small.  Like 1000-1300 for a 2 bedroom small.  We've found places in Alhambra &amp; Pasadena, which is excellent, but the property owners are really dragging their feet.

My roommate and I have talked and we may just decide to split up.  So, help!  What should we do about the property owners?  Would I be better off seeking a $500-750 studio apartment?  Where should I look for studio apartments?  I'd prefer a low crime area, but I know my choices are limited.

I appreciate any and all advice.  I'm also determined to live in LA, whether or not I have to do it alone, so I won't be deterred.  Thanks again."

First of all, my [overall progress picture.](http://i.imgur.com/7CmxvPy.jpg)


**I'm a 6’0, 75kg/165lbs 19 year old guy** (If that wasn't obvious) from England. In the before half of my progress photo I was 16 years old, 5'9 and roughly 65kg/145lbs. I bulked up to 83kg/183lbs at 6'0 and spent 10 weeks cutting down to 74.8kg/165lbs. This after photo was taken after a week of carbohydrate depletion and 24 hour reload, with a back and bicep pump, in order to look my best for a casting.  


I've been reading /r/fitness for the last 3 years, I don't comment much because I feel I don't have much to add. I wanted to share my progress with you guys and say thanks so much for all the help and motivation along the way.
___________________________________________________________________

**MY STORY**

I originally got into lifting 3 years ago because I was tired of being one of the weediest and weakest kids in my year group at school. I didn’t know what I was doing and tried to work my own way around the gym with a little help from YouTube. A good year, if not more, of my original training was wasted to fuckarounditis; I would train 3x a week with no real idea of what I was doing, which resulted in a heavy emphasis on core and arms, with almost no chest whatsoever. After browsing /r/fitness more and more I started doing a typical split routine in my second year and bulked over the winter on a 3/4x weekly split. I then cut down for last summer to [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/qNDIo1o.jpg?1). This was the first time I ever felt I had a good body and felt confident to take my shirt off at a beach, and is also when people started to notice I had got into shape, which was an incredible feeling.


From last summer I dirty bulked once again on a 4x week split, often having to miss legs due to a serious knee problem which came back to haunt me from when I used to swim competitively when I was 10 and 11.  My workouts would usually be 2 hours each in length and covered two body parts with four exercises of 4x12 each: Back &amp; Biceps, Chest &amp; Triceps, Shoulders &amp; Abs, Legs. 


During this process I massively emphasised good form and a mind-muscle connection over weight. My lifts improved slightly over this period, but nowhere near the standard that other people seem to see strength gains. Due to my knee injury I can’t squat or deadlift anymore, but I did do a 1RM bench max of 85kg/185lbs. I know this is average at best, but is what I am going to be focusing on improving over the next year.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**DIET**

For roughly the first 5 months of my bulk I ate absolutely anything and everything, I would eat a whole pack of sausages, half a kilo of chips and half a jar of mayo for tea after munching nuts through my day at work. After 5 months of this I had made muscle gains but also significant fat gains which I was starting to notice, particularly around my face. The second five months of my bulk I ate cleaner, still very much a dirty bulk but probably down from ~5000 calories a day to ~4000. 

After 10 months of bulking on this routine I dieted for 10 weeks from 83kg down to 75kg, although a significant portion of that weight will be water due to my keto diet for my last week. I initially followed a leangains diet with an 8 hour feeding window, something I found very successful in 2012, but I was no longer in school and working full time meant I couldn’t make the 8 hour window work with very long days at my Management Consultancy intership. 

I ended up cutting with 2000 calories on workout days and 1500 on rest days, with 150g+ of protein a day. I estimated my TDEE at 3500 calories, and find losing weight a lot easier than putting it on, because of this I was not 100% strict on those diet figures, although that is approximately what they averaged at. 

I had very regular cheat days, at least once a week, and went away for a weekend where I ate 7 whole packets of cookies and little else. I made a .gif of my 10 weeks progress on that diet, which I think is quite interesting. Apologies for the douchey pose in the photos but they’re all I could take consistently. The [10 week diet progress gif here]( http://i.imgur.com/zIccVFo.gif)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**THE FUTURE**

From here I intend to bulk more cleanly over the winter in an aim to minimise fat gains so I stay a little leaner than I was during my last bulk. I will be following a 4x weekly split routine once again, with an emphasis particularly on my chest and also traps, the two body parts I feel are lagging behind and so I will be training twice a week. I’m also going to try and bring my strength up to standard and hopefully train my legs around the knee injury I talked about above.

I am going to university to study Computer Science at UCL in London in three weeks time, something I’m massively looking forward to. My one concern with this is the alcohol intake and the impact that will have on my progress, I feel that drinking very rarely (Once every two weeks at most) because of my internship enormously helped me over the last year. Does anyone have any insight on this? I think I will just have to watch the bulk more carefully due to the calories from alcohol.

I feel like I am now the person I wanted to be 3 years ago, having completed the goals I set for myself when I first started to lift and go to the gym. I now have a new hobby that I am passionate about and look forward to continuing with. In addition to the obvious changes in my body, I have also noticed how the change in physique has changed my face. This is something I remember seeing threads about previously, but didn’t think I would experience.

I’ve found the whole process incredibly rewarding, getting into shape has changed me into a completely different, happier, proud and far more confident, person. As a result of this transformation I have been able to sign to a modelling agency and work at the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch flagship in London (Although I know this is unpopular on reddit, I still feel it’s relevant and served as a sign of progress for me where I wouldn’t have been able to hold eye contact with a customer 3 years ago when I worked at Burger King)

If anyone has read this far then thanks very much, and thank you for all the incredible helpful threads on here and /r/bodybuilding that have helped on this journey.

Feel free to ask me any questions and sorry for the wall of text!

1lo1ea,4,2013-09-03,"I am one of those people who loves listening to other peoples stories and problems, but I never find the courage to share my own.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lo1ea/i_am_one_of_those_people_who_loves_listening_to/,"I may not want to admit this EVER, OPENLY, TO ANYONE, but I have issues. Some of them a bit serious. And I have absolutely no idea why, and this is what bothers me most. I am the shoulder friends can cry on, I love hearing stories and it makes me really happy when people trust me up to the point where they share some of their darkest secrets with me. Paradoxically I have serious issues in trusting other people and I NEVER openly share ANYTHING about myself.

I have heard stories of people being raped, abused, treated quite roughly by their parents, gone through a fucked up childhood etc, well... I didn't have to go through any of these, yet somehow, I begin to realize that my mind is badly messed up. Overly screwed, virused, like a barely functioning computer. I feel as if I'm equipped with an incredible amount of RAM, a fairly decent processor and some other pretty cool, proficient parts. I feel as if I have the power to do anything in the whole wide world and I'd really like to do everything, but the truth is , life is pretty damn short and one lifetime is barely enough to choose just 1-2 big goals. I have absolutely no idea what to choose and what not to. I am lost. 

Almost everyone I meet inspires me to follow a different career path, to me every job is so damn interesting: doctors, nurses, teachers, tourist guides, photographers, writers, cooks, psychologists, researchers, librarians, pilots, train drivers, taxi drivers, programmers etc. etc... and even janitors. Yes, I would like to find the time to do become all of the above (and more) and simultaneously find time for friends, concerts and dozens of leisure activities, such as playing sports, playing guitar, reading and rereading science fiction, going hiking, swimming, exploring places etc. etc. etc.

Ever since I finished high school, I've been in this fucked up existential crisis. At first it all led me to believe philosophy could provide answers. I began reading more and more philosophy books and later on studying philosophy at a local university. But not even 6 months passed and I got lost in the wildness. I could no longer grasp the purpose of philosophy, as it proved to be useless in finding any concrete answers. I dropped out of university. I took a gap year, then I discovered this sort of new and totally revolutionary college of liberal arts, which sounded like the perfect thing for the - the place I had always imagined as ""heaven on earth"" for a person like me (whose mind is filled with uncommon peculiarities). I wrote the best application letter I possibly could, I got invited to the application interview and, due too my overly uncontrollable enthusiasm, I scared the shit out of the commission and got rejected. What followed were 6 months of what I would call severe depression. I have never seen a shrink or a psychotherapist -&gt; therefore I am not 100% certain whether ""depression"" is the correct label for what I went through or not. Frankly, I always tried to keep away from anything that forced me to become psychological vulnerable to other people. After receiving that rejection letter I could barely leave the bed, I spent 10-15 hours per day reading books or articles on the internet or just looking at the ceiling, and I would only leave the house once a week, in order to buy toilet paper, cheap wine and some stuff to eat.

As time passed, I slowly climbed out of the black hole and tried to put my life back together. I was still in the same existential crisis as always, I wished to go to so many places at the same time, but I had no idea what to choose. So I began following a lifestyle based on the famous ""carpe diem"" principle -&gt; do whatever you feel like doing.

Since I wasn't able to chose a career path with rational arguments, I tried to make a decision by flipping a coin. I flipped coins for all my 30 study options and eventually ""psychology"" won. I applied for psychology and, based on my graduation marks I got rejected. The last admitted application was 1.22 and I was at 1.23. More  ""depression"" followed, nevertheless not as severe as the last time. I spent a whole new year doing meaningless jobs, lived life as if it's only purpose was to pay the monthly rent, buy&amp;eat pre-cooked meals and wait for time to pass, inside a small apartment with my boyfriend (whom I had been dating since I was 16 - now I am 23 and we're still living happily together and, in spite of this unbelievably rare blessing, my mind still feels like an old, rusty, broken computer. but why?!). So, after the second rejection letter, thanks to my boyfriend's support I gradually climbed out of the black hole again and, since psychology didn't work out for me, I decided this time to go for photography. I applied for some of the most famous photography colleges in Europe and got accepted by many of these, but due to the high tuition fees (about 600 Euros / month) I was forced to turn all the acceptances down. Instead I did some internships at some pretty kick ass press agencies and began working on a few photo documentaries. 

Everything went great, I was once again settling for an amazing career path, more and more people began to appreciate my photos (I even had an exhibition). But then another 6-8 months went by and I have no idea what happened then. Somehow this whole passion for photo documentaries shifted in the background and one day I woke up in the same old existential shit hole: ""Life is so short, how can I make sure I am making the right choices? Yes, in 2-3 I might be able to get really good at photography. But will my future me be happy with the choices I am making today or will I bitterly regret everything? Should I consider pursuing this photography bullshit forever or should I aim for some of the other cool careers out there? What would everything look like if I had been accepted for a B.A. in psychology? etc. etc.""

And so, during the summer of 2011 I flipped another coin for some 20-30 times and eventually, based on the fact that I visited an Indian restaurant and really enjoyed their Pakooras and their deliciously milky Ras Malai, I decided to enroll for a B.A. in South Asian studies. I spent the past two years passionately learning Hindi and Urdu, I felt quite happy and content with what I was doing. I enjoyed the courses, the languages, all the Bollywood movies and the fact that the guys at our local Pakistani restaurant would talk to me in Urdu (they still do). Once again everything was great, but then a new wave of craziness emerged - as you probably already noticed, every 1-2 years I wake up with a powerful drive to run away from everything I have, tear it all apart and start from scratch. This is exactly what I am doing now: even though I didn't drop out of college (yet - I am struggling not to), in 2012 I began taking less and less courses and... opened a startup company: a tea store. Yes, I am 100% crazy, you probably figured it out by now.

I started working on a business plan, did some research and figured it would be a great moment to open a tea store (tea is getting more and more popular) + owning a business is one of the things I always wanted to do in my life.

So, today I'm here: the tea business is going on a good path, it has taught me so many things during the past year and I don't regret getting into it, but so far I haven't managed to make it profitable, and I believe this is ONLY due to my chaotic commitments to far to many things. It is difficult to study, have a job (my parents don't support me financially and they disapprove of every crazy thing I do) and run a successful business at the same time. I am stuck at a sort of crossroad, I am doing far to many times at the same time, it is impossible for all of them to work out, so I need to cut things out, decide what to focus on and, for heaven's sake, stick with my decision for a longer period of time!!

But how? How the hell can I break this devilish pattern and why have I fallen into it in the first place? Why do I want so many things, why can't I be like most folks: commit to one single thing, get really good at it and continue doing it for the rest of my life? 

Inevitably, I begin to ask myself: where does this existential crisis arise from? This need, this obsession for doing EVERYTHING? Am I trying to prove something to someone? If yes, to whom and why? Are other people driven by the same inexplicable urge? If yes, what is it? Is it a disease? 

Expect this pile of text to be full of spelling mistakes, as I haven't studied English in school. As a Balkans kid, I only had the chance to learn English through cartoons and movies... nevertheless, I did run it through spell checkers and I hope it's decent enough for you to read it. :)

TL DR: 22 year old stuck in a seemingly endless existential crisis. 

There's a lot more to this whole story, many thanks to those of you who took the time to read it and if anyone feels like reading a bit more, let me know and I'll post a part2 and part3 as comments. They are all in a .txt file, but I am still not sure whether sharing all of this is good or bad. "
1lnzvr,6,2013-09-03,That summertime sadness.,onetwothreeforfive,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lnzvr/that_summertime_sadness/,"I started the first day of my last year of high school today.

It's been been a hard transition, for the end of my summer felt quite unsatisfying. I spent my summer in an internship, then lived in Paris with my family for a month. Now, this was a summer of incredible experiences, but it's timing was very strange. 

The internship began practically at the beginning of summer, stopped working a week before Paris, and I started school a week after I got back (last weekend). The transition back my life at home was very limited. I felt so much like I 'missed out' on a part of summer, which I've narrowed down to a lack of interaction with friends, etc due to me being busy at my internship during the week, and gone from mid-July to the end of August. 
I've been struggling with the notion of going back to school etc, because I long for the freedom and leisure with friends (I.E. beach days etc) I feel like I missed out on during the last month. 

Another major cause for this depressive period is that my girlfriend (whom I cared for very deeply and with whom I had an incredible relationship) worked at a camp all summer, which really lead to feelings of missing out on time with her. In the beginning it was still hard, but we tried to keep in contact as much as possible...I visited her and that was nice, although when I left it made us both realize how much we missed each other, and how hard the distance was. She decided that the best strategy for her was to just focus on work (and fun, she partied with her friends all the time). We gradually lost contact, going a day, two days, three days without texting, then in France it all went downhill. 

The entirety of my trip we did not talk save for two or three meaningless conversations. That was hard. Not talking to her was a major source of anxiety and depression for me. I got back from the trip only and we started talking again (which was nice) and we hung out a few times which made me feel like things were almost back to normal. But I still feel disconnected from her, for we haven't had any time alone just the two of us since I've been back. It's going be hard going into this year, for we go to one of the best private schools in the country, and naturally there is little time/balance for relationships with classes and college prep work, but after writing this text I'm feeling more hopeful about the future.

I also know some VB.NET, COBOL and PL/I, although I would prefer not to use these. I've also dabbled lightly in SAP. 

Any suggestions, anyone?

Edit: I'm open to any type of IT position. Not just data analysis. If a company is willing to train, I'm willing to learn!!!

the pet rules at my complex are absurd, mostly the cost, its a $500 pet deposit that you don't get back AND $30 a month, so we need to decide if we can really want an animal
But my question to you guys is a dog or a cat?
I'm afraid we won't have enough time for a dog, however we leave 2.5 hours away from home and both our houses have animals, I'm afraid when we go home from breaks, the cat won't want to go for a drive for 2.5 hours and obviously we can't leave it alone.
With his major he has to do a program and an internship, so he won't be here for about a semester, and I really think I would want an animal if I was going to be alone. so there's another reason for an animal
we can definitely afford to feed it, and we would get help from our parents if god forbid anything went wrong and we needed to go to the vet.
So do you guys have any advice for us?

I'm disappointed. I'm sad.

If you said I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can still have a fun senior year with you, I realize you don't care if I go out to bars, fuck. I'd still take you back. I'm sorry for breaking your heart. I'm sorry for trying to break up with you over voicemail. I'm sorry I was a coward.

I'd take you back. I would take you back for less. I hate myself for it.

I've forgotten how to be single. In 2 years I forgot how to make friends without you by my side. I'm so terrified that everyone I know really doesn't like me and then I'm going to be so fucking lonely. I hate myself for how lonely and unloved I feel. I want to go back home. I want to be embraced by my mother and go back to highschool. You represent college in its entirety, alluring, always partying, fun, carefree, no responsibilities until suddenly the deadline is smack there. Christ. 

I'm going to write a list about all of the bad things about you, so I stop thinking about the good.

You're a dick for not breaking up with me over the summer, when I could have had time. You're a dick for breaking up with me 10 days before my birthday and a month away from our anniversary.

Why didn't I make you happy?

I do, though, still want you to be happy. I really do. I just wish it was with me. I think you're still a great guy. You're just a fucking dumb ass for throwing away this so you can ~go party~ all the fucking time. I wouldn't even care if you went out a bunch! God. I just wanted like, one fucking day of the weekend. You're so stupid. The school year hasn't even started, you'll see how it's going to be. You're going to come back.

I wish you come back.

Good luck trying to get an internship without a car, butthole.

And I wish I would stop feeling so sad so I can go eat something.

At least, I know I want to be friends with you. I look forward to little things. I look forward to my stomach not hurting. Tears not welling up in my eyes when I think of you or talk about you. I look forward to saying hi, eventually, and I look forward to texting you that I'm pooping. Hopefully after sending that text I walk out of the bathroom and my new boyfriend is sitting there teasing me about the smell.

(Or you. I still want it open. To let you know. I would take you back. But I'm going to be pessimistic, like you always said I was, and say it's not going to happen.)"

Short summary of the situation:


*been with my boyfriend 1.5 years

*parents strongly dislike my boyfriend because 1) he's older than me (8.5 years) and 2) he does not share my religious beliefs.  

*parents refuse to further meet with him to get to know him or work things out (they've only talked to him twice)

*after 2 rounds of counseling, several emotional meltdowns, watching my academic performance decline, and overall turmoil I moved out of my parents house and moved in with my boyfriend
 
---

It's been three weeks since I moved out.  Given our past history, I moved most of my things out before telling my parents I was leaving (even though they both knew something was up since I was cleaning my room for the first time in months).  I would have told them beforehand, but they've made it clear that they were only ok with me moving out if I was moving in with female friends or on my own.  Also, my boyfriend wasn't allowed in their house, so I was solely relying on myself for the entire move.  I was afraid if I told them beforehand, they wouldn't let me leave.

As was to be expected, they didn't take it well.  Upon leaving, my mother was talking as though I was essentially not part of the family anymore and we wouldn't speak any longer.  My father said I could call him if I ever wanted to talk.  My brother wouldn't speak to me at all.  I gave them about a week and a half of no communication, trying to give them space, before I contacted my mother to see if we could have dinner.  She agreed and we had dinner Monday evening.  Afterward, we discussed where we go from here.

My parents are still very upset, which I expected they would be.  Throughout this whole ordeal, they have taken little to no responsibility for the problems between us.  They claim that our family was torn apart because I decided to date this guy.  Mind you, if you didn't glance at the older posts, my boyfriend treats me like a queen.  He has never done drugs, never even considered hurting me, supported me through the extreme lows all this conflict with my parents has brought on, and when he realized the long term effects my parents reactions were going to have on me, he offered to let me live with him until I graduate college and can get a full time job to fully support myself.  The only thing they have against him are the things mentioned above, which are basically that he doesn't live by their rules.  My parents basically told me they don't have anything to talk to me about because they don't want to hear about my life with him.  They assume my entire life revolves around him, despite the fact that I am seeking 3 degrees, an honors student, participate in 2 clubs, hold a part time job, and an internship.

It's important to understand that my parents are very religious.  I was raised to only consider Christian men as marriage material.  My mother is also very manipulative.  My father is extremely introverted and laid back, so it's easy for her to control him.  She has lost many friends over the years because of her controlling nature.  She has called me names and told me my choice to date my boyfriend has poisoned every aspect of my life and that I've completely changed because of him.  In the past, she's used fear and guilt tripping to get me to do what she wants.  

When I left, I fully intended to move heaven and earth to repair this relationship so I wouldn't lose my family completely.  Dinner this week was the first step.  However, after our conversation and the things my mother has posted on facebook (yes, I know, but there is a point to this), I'm not really sure anymore.  My parents never got over me breaking up with my ex boyfriend.  He WAS a Christian and plays football for a school several states away.  They still keep in touch, watch all his games, and are actually road tripping to see one this fall.  
Several years ago, his older sister got pregnant by her non-Christian boyfriend, who she then married.  She then divorced him after cheating on him with her coworker after their separation and did everything in her power to keep him from their daughter.  She just married the guy she cheated with.  All of this wouldn't matter at all if my mom hadn't gone through and liked/made nice, supportive comments on several of her pictures.  It really gets to me that after this woman has broken just as many and more of my mom's rules as I have, mom gives her approval.  This person my mom has no more reasons to be connected to and not her own daughter.  It makes me wonder if I should even bother trying.

What do you guys think?  At what point should I stop trying?  Or should I ever stop?  What should I do to try and fix this?  I don't want to be without a family, but if my family hates me, what does it even mean to have one?

I'm 24 years old and have slept with 3 girls my entire life. First one I dated for 2 years, second one I dated for a year and a half, and the second I dated only for a month because of the school program we're in. It was one of those great months of amazing sex and it turned into a relationship and I actually fell in love with her. Fast forward three months later and I'm here. I moved to Paris for an internship for three months. First, I was so excited to get here because not only will I be able to explore Paris all I wanted, I would now be able to fap whenever and however I wanted to. The internet speeds over here destroy those in the states!

Anyways, I've really been feeling self conscious over here because of A. not speaking french B. being single in a city of romance C. I've eaten a LOT here, it's hard not to (i'm not fat but i've noticed my stomach getting flabbier) and D. I haven't had a proper hair cut in 4 or 5 months and I look a mess and cover my head with a snapback (in my profession, jeans and t shirt is dress code (ps. see advertising creative). So with all of that, the guilty pleasures I can find here are photography and reading but I can only read for so long and I can only walk before the soles of my shoes begin to be ineffective so, I return home to unwind. 

I don't smoke cigarettes, I smoke weed only once in a blue moon with friends, and when I drink it's usually only a couple beers or glasses of wine. My addiction is what we're all chatting about.

I've done this before, over the last holiday I decided that when I went home I would spend my free time with my family and not deal with all of the late nights edging or constantly browsing pics on tumblr. It felt amazing! I was plenty more energetic, positive, would sleep a lot better, and I was motivated to spend time with my little brother just going on hikes or grabbing some pizza.

It's time to do it again, here's day 1. Paris was amazing for a lot of reasons and the fact that I'm finding this now before I leave is a sign or something. 

Wish me luck everybody September 5th marks Day 1!"

&gt;Lesbians and transsexual women have overrun the world

&gt;Hillary Clinton has been appointed supreme leader of the world

&gt;Be me

&gt;Be GLBT

&gt;Be oppressed by the new matriarchy for putting the G before the L

&gt;Hardly remember the old days of the patriarchy

&gt;In fact, patriarchy is just a string of symbols and sounds, devoid of any meaning.

&gt;Have to wear a Gold Vagina pinned to my chest and be assigned a designation

&gt;We don't even get numbers because those are inventions of men

&gt;Be yoked together with other ""undesirables"" such as thought rapists, wet dreamers, and door holders

&gt;Have to pull a train full of Feminazis to a concentration camp

&gt;Upon arrival be forced to take a shower

&gt;When the showers are turned on, a clear liquid comes out, washing away my manly scents and emasculating me

&gt;Soon the liquid is replaced by a lavender and honey-scented gas

&gt;The oppression I face is palpable as I leave the showers smelling like a ""woman,"" another group persecuted by the womyn.

&gt;Notice another smell in the air.

&gt;Be disgusted as I realize the smell is coming from the crematorium on my right.

&gt;It is the smell of tons upon tons of incense being burned.

&gt;Be herded into a small room where we will be assigned our new roles in the concentration camp.

&gt;Heart can sink no lower as I hear my designation called out and learn that I will be cleaning out the crematorium.

&gt;Immediately be taken to the crematorium

&gt;Overseer is a dominatrix in a leather suit.

&gt;Just like all of the other unique womyn who will not be forced into an identity by men.

&gt;Ironic.mp3

&gt;Be forced to eat bananas while my overseer watches.

&gt;(Bananas look like phalli in case you didn't get that)

&gt;(Phalli means dicks in case you didn't get that either)

&gt;Overseer takes the banana peel from my hands and throws it over her back, refusing to acknowledge that womyn are not as athletically able as men.

&gt;She doesn't notice that she missed the ""man can,"" formerly referred to as a trash can or many other dialectical terms.

&gt;She turns on the fire to burn the incense.

&gt;She starts to walk down to the corridor, presumably to idly calibrate something that men cannot be trusted with.

&gt;She slips on the banana peel

&gt;Her back ends up touching the ovens.

&gt;Even through her leather suit she suffers first-degree burns

&gt;I take a step towards her

&gt;""Stay back,"" she exclaims. ""You 'GLBT'-types put it in the wrong order so that men are first!""

&gt;A spark ignites within me, soon to swell into raging fire reminiscent of the all-consuming flames within the ovens.

&gt;I feel something I haven't felt since the womyn uprising began

&gt;A realization hits me.

&gt;""If you think about it, lesbians are similar to men.  By forcing use of the term 'LGBT' you are only furthering the...the...""

&gt;I remember the concept of etymology

&gt;Matriarchy and patriarchy look similar, they must come from the same root.

&gt;I suddenly notice the song playing over the loud speakers.

&gt;California_Dreamin.mp3

&gt;Realize the band is not The Mama &amp; the  Mama as the matriarchical propaganda brainwashed me to believe

&gt;The Mamas &amp; the *Papas*

&gt;Patriarchy must mean a matriarchy ruled by men instead of womyn

&gt;""You are only furthering the patriarchy!""

&gt;A new era of oppression has begun; the tides have turned.

&gt;Something else has overpowered the smell of the incense.

&gt;Men around the world smell the scent of oppression.

&gt;Luckily, scent is the sense most closely tied to memory so they remember what that smell actually is.

&gt;The dominatrix trembles as the scent washes over her.

&gt;I approach her and offer my hand to her.

&gt;Her eyes say no but she takes it nonetheless

&gt;She opens her mouth but the words won't come out

&gt;Lose_Yourself.mp3

&gt;""Shh,"" I say tenderly to her as shockwaves of oppression cause tsunamis on the other side of the world.

&gt;Millions of womyn who finally felt comfortably in their favorite white t-shirts are embarrassed to see that the tidal waves have rendered their shirts transparent

&gt;Nearby men, hungry for oppression offer them dry shirts and towels for them to dry off.

&gt;Within the crematorium I guide the overseer to a chair where she can rest after her recent brush with pain.

&gt;""Here,"" I say, giving her a blanket, ""cover yourself with this so I can take a look at that burn on your back.""

&gt;She's quivering under the oppression but all that she can do is acquiesce.

&gt;""Oh, it's quite red,"" I tell her. ""Wait here for a moment.""

&gt;I go over to the first aid cabinet and get a bottle of aloe vera.

&gt;Her voice finally returns.

&gt;""There's no need; I can do it.""

&gt;""No,"" I respond, ""I don't think you can quite reach this burn; it's quite high on your back.""

&gt;She can't believe what's happening as I open the bottle and pour a little bit of aloe into my hands.

&gt;As I rub the aloe onto her burn I can see the cold, cold oppression overcoming the heat of her burn

&gt;To a mind as primitive as the woman's this feels good.

&gt;I step back and the oppression is complete.

&gt;Bill Clinton has taken Hillary's place as the supreme leader of the world with a bevy of young interns ready to be oppressed at any time.

&gt;The patriarchy has returned.

&gt;As I leave to retake my rightful place as a man I can barely hear a sound from behind me

&gt;I turn to see what is making such a pitiful noise.

&gt;It's the woman stuttering and stammering, barely able to speak.

&gt;""Th-th-th-thank...thank you..."" she finally spits out.

&gt;I will allow her to not swallow her words this time.

&gt;I briskly turn away from her, my newfound cape, a clear indication of my authority as a member of the patriarchy, flutters as it swoops through the air

&gt;As I fly off to join the ranks of the patriarchy the woman can hear me utter one last expression of my oppression.

&gt;""It was my privilege."""

I am playing on a laptop since forever and I'm tired of 10-15 FPS on minimal settings.

&gt;&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

&gt;Mainly gaming, like GTA5, Metro, Far Cry, SC2, etc. Preparing for next-gen games. (Division looks awesome)

&gt;&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

&gt;I was aiming for 2000€, but I can go up to 2500€ if it offers a significant performance improvement.
 
&gt;&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

&gt;ASAP.

&gt;&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant

&gt;I have a mouse, a headset, and my secondary screen, so i need a main screen and a full tower.

&gt;&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

&gt;France

&gt;&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

&gt;Dell monitor (old), 1280x960 (Or is it 1024x768?)

&gt;&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

&gt;I might. Not right now. 

&gt;&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

&gt;- Front USB panel/Jack
&gt;- 128GB SSD
&gt;- 2T HDD

&gt;&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

&gt;Honestly, i don't care about leds, window or anything like that. I would like an efficient setup, and good airflow.

&gt;&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

&gt;Yeah. I've got a legit windows key. ^^^^*cough*

&gt;&gt;Extra info or specifics:

&gt;I'm a little bit afraid of water cooling, so I'd like to avoid it if possible.

Thanks in advance!

I'm a recent accounting grad (B.Comm, June 2013) and I'm now living in Ottawa (did B.Comm in Montreal). I'm starting the CMA Designation program this fall with CMA Ontario and have been having a tough time finding an entry level accounting job to get the ball rolling on my career so I can move up the ladder.

Unfortunately a combination of health problems (now better) and poor french skills (pretty functional now though) ended up hindering my ability to compete for internships during my studies in Montreal. I do have 3+ years experience in technical software quality assurance work, as well as 4+ years of private tutoring work (mostly management/cost accounting, some finance).

I know this is a bit of a longshot, but I'm hoping maybe someone here on /r/Ottawa can point me in the right direction. I've contacted some staffing agencies (i.e. Accountemps, Lannick) but have been told to contact them again once I've gained more work experience. It's been suggested that I do volunteer work or find an internship, but I have monthly expenses (rent, food, utilities, etc) and cannot afford to go several months working without an income. 

As I'm going to be doing the CMA accounting designation, I'd be looking mostly for work at companies instead of public accounting firms (as I don't think work there fulfills the CMA work experience requirements....different type of accounting)...obviously willing to start at the very bottom and work up (but can't be unpaid for the reasons mentioned above).

So yeah, any helpful protips would be highly appreciated!

I have a one year old Chinese Crested neutered male.
He's a super sweet dog and super silly and playful with us and people he knows.

He really really does not like strangers or kids (not from lack of socialization on my part, that I can say.) He is very very people shy ever since I got him (should have been a warning when getting him but it's too late now) He recognizes people when he sees them 2-3 more times and is happy to see them. 

Ever since he was young he has always been stressed on a leash (he grew up in the city and then we moved to a countryside (but still next to a busy road) when he was 7 months old and now we live in the suburbs next to neighbors and it's quiet etc. but he still manages to be stressed and 'needing to get away from here' sort of reaction where ever we are. He has two switches. Super stressed and pulling and panting and freaking out and can't sit still and looking everywhere to bouncing around in excitement to be outside going for a walk and he gets so pumped up and barks at all the noises and dogs and people and just...everything. 

And these days...

He.

barks. 

so.

much.

at.

everything.

This started back when I did an internship at a doggy daycare and he started barking along with the other dogs when someone came in. Sometimes he even started it (he was... 7-9 months when I was working there) and it hasn't gotten any better. Now he barks at any sound outside or anyone walking by. I've tried many ways of correcting him and he just gets more intense if I poke him or try to distract him or turn the other way.

He is not aggressive AT ALL. At all. It's all for show. If someone were to walk up to him, he'd run away. He loves to play with dogs but now he is barking like crazy at them and then when they come near he'll crouch and run away and be super shy. I really can't understand his train of thought and how to curb both of these problems... We have been using a head collar to get him to calm down on walks and it helps a LOT but I don't want it forever.  When he is super stressed he doesn't take to treats or toys or anything. He just shuts down and finds the nearest corner to hide in."

Where/what kind of research should I do? A lot of people I know are doing paid internships, that's fine but I'm looking for something that's better for grad school, not work experience/getting cash.

Also, I'm going to be living in Boston whether or not I get accepted for personal reasons. I'd be willing to do volunteer/researching/interning at MIT for free if I don't get accepted. Could I apply the next year and expect greater chances?"
1lpmjl,3,2013-09-04,I (20F) can't be supportive of my (25M) SO.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1lpmjl/i_20f_cant_be_supportive_of_my_25m_so/,"Hi everyone! I would really love some feedback, maybe from people who have gone through similar situations? Or just someone who can see the problem from a different point of view! Please bear with me, it's kind of long! 

My boyfriend is in Germany and I am in the US and he is planning on visiting me for a month in November (!!!).  He is also going to be working abroad for a few months in a Scandinavian country either before or after he visits me.  Possibly before AND after. I want to be happy for him but I feel as though I am in such a rut. I am dealing with my father quickly dying from a non-curable disease and I am also trying to figure out what to do after I graduate. This brings on more stress because there is a strong possibility I will be headed to Germany for my Masters. 

I want to be with him one day in the future, but we don't have an end date in sight, since I am not sure if I will graduate on time. There is a possibility that I will be there this summer, as I am trying to get an internship anywhere and Germany is my top choice, if I can help it. He said he would try and transfer his job over here after he is finished with his schooling, which is sooner than I will be finished. 

I suppose I just need your advice on how to be supportive even though I am so confused and hurting. I just wish he was here for me and I know it is so so selfish. I could never ask him to uproot his life, I even feel guilty that he is considering coming to the US temporarily for work. I am just at a point in my life (father's fast-approaching death) and it is so hard. 

With him working in another country, he will be having the time of his life and I will be coping and caring for my dad and family. This comes off as me being jealous of his life-style, but it is the exact opposite. I cannot go through this alone and I need to have someone there and I want it to be him so badly. This could not be any worse timing because at this rate my pops probably will not be here within the next 6 months. I'm not a weak person and my love for him is so strong but I'm not sure if I can mentally handle a long distance relationship and the death of my dad. "
1lp9fn,3,2013-09-04,Forever stuck in existential angst,dumpdump543,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lp9fn/forever_stuck_in_existential_angst/,"I may not want to admit this EVER, OPENLY, TO ANYONE, but I have issues. Some of them a bit serious. And I have absolutely no idea why, and this is what bothers me most. I am the shoulder friends can cry on, I love hearing stories and it makes me really happy when people trust me up to the point where they share some of their darkest secrets with me. Paradoxically I have serious issues in trusting other people and I NEVER openly share ANYTHING about myself.

I have heard stories of people being raped, abused, treated quite roughly by their parents, gone through a fucked up childhood etc, well... I didn't have to go through any of these, yet somehow, I begin to realize that my mind is badly messed up. Overly screwed, virused, like a barely functioning computer. I feel as if I'm equipped with an incredible amount of RAM, a fairly decent processor and some other pretty cool, proficient parts. I feel as if I have the power to do anything in the whole wide world and I'd really like to do everything, but the truth is , life is pretty damn short and one lifetime is barely enough to choose just 1-2 big goals. I have absolutely no idea what to choose and what not to. I am lost.

Almost everyone I meet inspires me to follow a different career path, to me every job is so damn interesting: doctors, nurses, teachers, tourist guides, photographers, writers, cooks, psychologists, researchers, librarians, pilots, train drivers, taxi drivers, programmers etc. etc... and even janitors. Yes, I would like to find the time to do become all of the above (and more) and simultaneously find time for friends, concerts and dozens of leisure activities, such as playing sports, playing guitar, reading and rereading science fiction, going hiking, swimming, exploring places etc. etc. etc.

Ever since I finished high school, I've been in this fucked up existential crisis. At first it all led me to believe philosophy could provide answers. I began reading more and more philosophy books and later on studying philosophy at a local university. But not even 6 months passed and I got lost in the wildness. I could no longer grasp the purpose of philosophy, as it proved to be useless in finding any concrete answers. I dropped out of university. I took a gap year, then I discovered this sort of new and totally revolutionary college of liberal arts, which sounded like the perfect thing for the - the place I had always imagined as ""heaven on earth"" for a person like me (whose mind is filled with uncommon peculiarities). I wrote the best application letter I possibly could, I got invited to the application interview and, due too my overly uncontrollable enthusiasm, I scared the shit out of the commission and got rejected. What followed were 6 months of what I would call severe depression. I have never seen a shrink or a psychotherapist -&gt; therefore I am not 100% certain whether ""depression"" is the correct label for what I went through or not. Frankly, I always tried to keep away from anything that forced me to become psychological vulnerable to other people. After receiving that rejection letter I could barely leave the bed, I spent 10-15 hours per day reading books or articles on the internet or just looking at the ceiling, and I would only leave the house once a week, in order to buy toilet paper, cheap wine and some stuff to eat.

As time passed, I slowly climbed out of the black hole and tried to put my life back together. I was still in the same existential crisis as always, I wished to go to so many places at the same time, but I had no idea what to choose. So I began following a lifestyle based on the famous ""carpe diem"" principle -&gt; do whatever you feel like doing.

Since I wasn't able to chose a career path with rational arguments, I tried to make a decision by flipping a coin. I flipped coins for all my 30 study options and eventually ""psychology"" won. I applied for psychology and, based on my graduation marks I got rejected. The last admitted application was 1.22 and I was at 1.23. More ""depression"" followed, nevertheless not as severe as the last time. I spent a whole new year doing meaningless jobs, lived life as if it's only purpose was to pay the monthly rent, buy&amp;eat pre-cooked meals and wait for time to pass, inside a small apartment with my boyfriend (whom I had been dating since I was 16 - now I am 23 and we're still living happily together and, in spite of this unbelievably rare blessing, my mind still feels like an old, rusty, broken computer. but why?!). So, after the second rejection letter, thanks to my boyfriend's support I gradually climbed out of the black hole again and, since psychology didn't work out for me, I decided this time to go for photography. I applied for some of the most famous photography colleges in Europe and got accepted by many of these, but due to the high tuition fees (about 600 Euros / month) I was forced to turn all the acceptances down. Instead I did some internships at some pretty kick ass press agencies and began working on a few photo documentaries.

Everything went great, I was once again settling for an amazing career path, more and more people began to appreciate my photos (I even had an exhibition). But then another 6-8 months went by and I have no idea what happened then. Somehow this whole passion for photo documentaries shifted in the background and one day I woke up in the same old existential shit hole: ""Life is so short, how can I make sure I am making the right choices? Yes, in 2-3 I might be able to get really good at photography. But will my future me be happy with the choices I am making today or will I bitterly regret everything? Should I consider pursuing this photography bullshit forever or should I aim for some of the other cool careers out there? What would everything look like if I had been accepted for a B.A. in psychology? etc. etc.""

And so, during the summer of 2011 I flipped another coin for some 20-30 times and eventually, based on the fact that I visited an Indian restaurant and really enjoyed their Pakooras and their deliciously milky Ras Malai, I decided to enroll for a B.A. in South Asian studies. I spent the past two years passionately learning Hindi and Urdu, I felt quite happy and content with what I was doing. I enjoyed the courses, the languages, all the Bollywood movies and the fact that the guys at our local Pakistani restaurant would talk to me in Urdu (they still do). Once again everything was great, but then a new wave of craziness emerged - as you probably already noticed, every 1-2 years I wake up with a powerful drive to run away from everything I have, tear it all apart and start from scratch. This is exactly what I am doing now: even though I didn't drop out of college (yet - I am struggling not to), in 2012 I began taking less and less courses and... opened a startup company: a tea store. Yes, I am 100% crazy, you probably figured it out by now.

I started working on a business plan, did some research and figured it would be a great moment to open a tea store (tea is getting more and more popular) + owning a business is one of the things I always wanted to do in my life.

So, today I'm here: the tea business is going on a good path, it has taught me so many things during the past year and I don't regret getting into it, but so far I haven't managed to make it profitable, and I believe this is ONLY due to my chaotic commitments to far to many things. It is difficult to study, have a job (my parents don't support me financially and they disapprove of every crazy thing I do) and run a successful business at the same time. I am stuck at a sort of crossroad, I am doing far to many times at the same time, it is impossible for all of them to work out, so I need to cut things out, decide what to focus on and, for heaven's sake, stick with my decision for a longer period of time!!

But how? How the hell can I break this devilish pattern and why have I fallen into it in the first place? Why do I want so many things, why can't I be like most folks: commit to one single thing, get really good at it and continue doing it for the rest of my life?

Inevitably, I begin to ask myself: where does this existential crisis arise from? This need, this obsession for doing EVERYTHING? Am I trying to prove something to someone? If yes, to whom and why? Are other people driven by the same inexplicable urge? If yes, what is it? Is it a disease?

Expect this pile of text to be full of spelling mistakes, as I haven't studied English in school. As a Balkans kid, I only had the chance to learn English through cartoons and movies... nevertheless, I did run it through spell checkers and I hope it's decent enough for you to read it. :)

TL DR: 22 year old stuck in a seemingly endless existential crisis.

Many thanks to those of you who took the time to read it and even reply with a few ideas. "

It's possible that a monday session is not the same as the previous monday. The hard labor of this day contrasts the joyfulness and tranquility of last weekend, and it makes it seen like the villain of the weekdays. The beginning of training was slow and lazy, the return to the mandatory routines, and the focus and concentration in the objectives of the session are just some of the burdens. But this very day is the first of the month of september. Somebody who does not belong to the world of boxing, would ask themselves about the uniqueness of this month.

I will start saying that it is important for Argentinean boxing for many reasons. Almost one year ago, Lucas obtained the interim WBC junior welterweight world title after defeating Ajose Olusegun. Marcos Maidana obtained a significant triumph for his career against Jesus Soto Karass, and Sergio Martinez solidfied himself as the absolute king of the middleweight division after defeating Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. I think I'm starting to make my points a little valid (I think you can see the validity of my points).

With all that history on our backs was how this monday began. On our way to the gym for our regular training and commenting on everything that was awaiting for us this week, we little by little, started to get our focus back. Lucas will also suffer (meaning it will cost him, physically) this week. 

Arriving to our destination, and with high temperatures, we hurried to enter the gym. We started with an aerobic warm up, then speed exercises and leg coordination, and then we combined both to try to finish a session that wasn't too heavy/hard, so that we could sparr 12 rounds after. We finished with 25 minutes of movement exercises and elasticity.  

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC08344.jpg

Thinking about training as time passed by, the first monday seems that it will be harder than anticipated. A temperature that feels about 45 degrees celsius seems to justify my reasoning. 

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC08376.jpg

We arrived at the boxing gym before the rest of the protagonists, who quickly began to enter: Joel and Antonio Diaz, many amateur boxers and some spectators. Minutes after two sparring partners of Latino origin arrived, in addition to the already known Ivey Nixon 

For me to say that Lucas is an amazing boxer may be a bit subjective. But I can assure you that he can accurately time three different fighters stylistically speaking, he can adjust the timing of his punches, and practice defensive movements, and hide like a poker player his momentarily weaknesses. An applause is deserved. And above all, if we add to that the evening exercises, the 45 Celsius degrees that are signaled by the sun outside, the quality of his competition and that this is his ninth week of training...Again, you should stand up and celebrate.  

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC08435.jpg

We finished with a nice stretch. Then the usual and repeated handshakes and pictures. It is over. The first day of a symbolic month for argentinean pugilism.  

The very same 9/14, in Argentina, it is the celebration of ""Fighter's Day"", ""Boxer's day"", Could it be a coincidence? 

The memorable combat of this very same date illustrates our very well remembered Luis Angel Firpo against Jack Dempsey, and it motivates Lucas. Could this be a coincidence? 

In the same way, “The Wild Bull of the Pampas” was born in Junin (Lucas' hometown) Could THIS ONE be a coincidence?


PS: Thank all of you. I'm also very proud to announce that I got an internship. It's unpaid, but better than being unemployed. I also eyed this German chick, so I may need more luck than Danny boy himself. Wish me luck y'all. 

Thanks Brauli0, I will also be betting on the Machine. We will feast on September 14th, my friend."

Even before we started dating we had a great relationship as friends. I met her in an internship I was in during my senior year of college. After graduating we went our separate paths but kept in touch a year back she was moving close to where I lived so we started dating. While we were dating things were great, we moved in together, and really liked each other’s company. After some long thinking I ended up getting my girlfriend an engagement ring it was about $400. I had money but I thought it was unnecessary to shell out all that money for such a cosmetic thing? Right? 

Well this is where the problems began, my wife said she was so excited to get married. She told me she wanted to be in charge of the wedding planning and getting stuff together. This woman from being with her thus far has been frugal, making food as opposed to eating out, only goes to salons for special occasions. However, I take a look at the projected costs over 50,000. I told her that this is too much. I told her I am not taking a loan out on a wedding. Then she starts sneering at me telling me how much of a cheap skate I was for buying a ‘shitty engagement ring.’ That this is the “least I owe her.”

I don’t know what the hell happened, my sweet fiancé turned into a massive out of control bitch. I told her I am done with this shit, and I want her out. It has been a couple days since I kicked her out and she has been calling me back saying that she is sorry. I haven’t responded yet, I just need to cool off a bit.

I want to think that this was just a wedding planning hormone phase but then as a lot of my friends have said that this is the women she is going to become once we get married. 
I am planning on breaking things off with her, what’s your opinion /r/askmen?

1loi4h,1,2013-09-03,I (24 M) suddenly find myself falling for my friend's (22 M) ex (23 F) and I've got no clue what to do.,Legion6jf4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1loi4h/i_24_m_suddenly_find_myself_falling_for_my/,"This isn't a crazy, off the wall situation. However, this is the first time I've ever experienced something like this, and friendly advice is all I'm seeking.

I've known my friend (we'll call him Tom) for a little bit over two years. We're not ""best"" friends, however when we met through others, we became fast friends. Shared many interests. It was an easy friendship. We've been that way ever since. A few months after we meet (and after hanging out quite a lot), he suddenly introduces me to his (then) GF (we'll call her Jill).


Now, according to Jill, at this time, they'd been together for quite some time (almost a year), and personally I found it odd that he never brought her around. I soon find out it's because she was in Texas on an internship. That explained the not every meeting her, but that didn't explain the failure to *ever* mention her, and the many nights I saw Tom with other girls, going home with other girls, and acting single. But nevertheless, I paid no mind due to being in my own (albeit failing at this point) relationship. Not really my business. I saw her periodically throughout the next several months but never long enough to have any real conversations or experiences. Mainly just out with a group of people here and there.


Fast forward to about April of this year. He texts me to inform me that he ended the relationship, but felt bad about how things ended. He had broken it off stating that as much as he cared about her as a person, his heart was simply not in the relationship anymore. To which I advised him the same thing I was told when I did something similar once upon a time, ""Dude, if you weren't in it and you had no desire to be, it's better to let her go find someone who will be."" After all, we live in New York City. There's plenty of ""fish"" in the proverbial sea.


So randomly one day around June, I receive a tweet from Jill, and the ensuing conversation bled into text messaging. We met up for lunch one day later that week (I work downtown, so does she) and chatted for a bit. And since then, we've made some plans, hung out a few times, she came out for my birthday.... Stuff like that. At this point, I had absolutely zero intentions for anything outside of, ""Hey you're fun, come hang out with me let's be pals."" After all, I wasn't actively searching for anything after recently having my soul crushed by an evil woman. But it just clicked one day. I was (and still am) falling for Jill in a big way. 


She's amazing. I started noticing and discovering things about her that I never knew before because I didn't bother to pay attention previously. The small quirky stuff about people that you'll never catch unless you look for it. You know the, ""my clothes never fit right around you"" type feeling. That. Even though I'm awful at the whole courtship thing anymore, the feelings are advanced. And I've got no idea what to do here.


There's recently been a reconnecting between Tom and Jill. But if I'm to believe what Tom has told me, it's just for the sake of friendship. Personally, I see it on his end, but I know how some girls can be with the exes who shattered their hearts. But that's neither here nor there. The most important question is: which route do I take?


On one hand, I feel as though it's not really any of Tom's business now that they're not together. I don't believe in the ""dude bro code"" or anything like that. We're all adults trying to lead adult lives. On the other hand, not everyone is like me, and he might not take it so well. Obviously, the first response would be, ""Talk to her, then talk to him."" And while I agree to an extent, I feel as though I'm seeking a way to do it. I'd like to let things develop naturally between Jill and I (if they even are to develop as I've not expressed my feelings as of yet), but I'm torn on what to do with Tom if they indeed develop. Talk to him now, or talk to him later? If I do it right away I feel as though I'm asking him permission, and some might label it ""stealing her."" Well, you can't really ""steal"" something that doesn't ""belong"" to anyone, and I don't know if I'm on board with the asking permission-type avenue, as again, part of me feels like it's not really his business.

Thoughts? Opinions? Recipes? 

Thanks

1lthxq,1,2013-09-05,Graduating in December from MPH...job advice?,[deleted],epidemiology,https://www.reddit.com/r/epidemiology/comments/1lthxq/graduating_in_december_from_mphjob_advice/,"    Hi all, I'm graduating in December with my MPH in Epi and the job search is starting to loom over me and I was hoping for some advice from anyone currently working in the field. I have a few years work experience prior to starting my MPH, mainly working at a large hospital on primary care research projects as an RA. I'm currently interning at our local health department as well as in an infection control department at a local hospital.
   I guess my first issue is that I'm not 100% sure what sorts of jobs I should be looking for. The job listings I’ve been seeing for Epi are so broad that there doesn’t seem to be a particular path jumping out at me. I'm enjoying the health department internship so far and I like the practical aspect of being able to see results of your efforts, which in my previous research jobs I often felt was lacking. However I see many job postings in research that seem appealing, but I worry that I’ll end up not really feeling like I’m making any sort of impact. Does anyone here work in one of these areas that can offer some advice? Are the job prospects/salaries better for particular positions?
    The other big concern is of course salary. Again the ranges I’m seeing are all over the place and location will obviously play a big role. I’m hoping to move back up to the Northeast eventually, but with the higher cost of living and my student loans, I’m not sure that it will be feasible for me right out of school.

So I guess my questions are:

Any comments on the current trends you see in the job market for Epi? How hard is it to land a job after an MPH and what sorts of entry level salaries are common?

Finally are there any job search tips you wish you had known? I’ve already met with career services to review my resume and I’m planning to start sending out application in the next few weeks so any advice would be appreciated!"
1lt8jq,1,2013-09-05,Help me (22/m) figure out what's going on with my girlfriend (21/f),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lt8jq/help_me_22m_figure_out_whats_going_on_with_my/,"So I've been working in Alaska these last three months. I did this last year as well as an internship for my job. Last year went really well and we handled it very well. Our two year anniversary was last march so we are very comfortable with each other and know each other well. This summer was....different.

It started with her getting distant. Not that anything ever seemed wrong or strange, just the quantity of texts between us started to dwindle about a month into the internship. The quality was still the same, just less. It made sense. I work 84 hour weeks in Alaska so I'm always busy. She got a new job and started working 70 hr weeks. Then the quality of texts started to die.

It became less pictures, less ""Have a great day hun!"", less everything. It became more distant and formal. Texts including plans for afterwards in a business like tone. Texts asking about what to do with some of my stuff she found when we moved out (lived together). Less texts telling me she missed me. I shrugged it off. we were both working, both busy. Two months in she got very very distant. For about two weeks she barely texted me, no pictures, no talking. Barely picked up the phone or was sleeping when I called. After two weeks she said she had let a guy at work flirt with her and she let it go too far. No cheating, just let him get too close. It's hard to explain but I have absolute trust she would not cheat. She's too good of a person. Please don't assume that. She basically called crying she felt really bad that she had let this guy affect her in this way. She told me that she felt that I didn't say she was pretty often enough, and she wanted me to give her more attention. That's why she let it slide with this guy was her explenation. She missed the attention and liked it. We had a good long talk that night and worked through things. Normally we couldn't talk that long because of our hours, we just were both super tired in the morning.

Well things got better after that but it was still a lot more distant than at the beginning of the summer. By august we were comfortable and happy with each other, but there always seemed to be an underlying.... something. We coulnd't get close, I couldn't seem to get her to send as many pictures, (back and forth, I sent a lot too), and so on. She kept saying that she just tried to focus on not missing me and she hoped things would go back to normal when we saw each other again. I felt the same way. If felt like we grew apart from each other. We were both nervous to see each other. We hadn't talked that much, hadnt' seen each other on facetime near as often as the first time. She kept saying she just felt ""weird""

Well I finally get home. She ran crying up to me in the airport and jumepd into my arms. see, we had always loved each other. Both missed each other terribly, it was just a dwindling of conversation. I picked her up and spun her around in the airport and we just got lost in each other. But by the time we got my luggage the weirdness and distance seemed to be coming back. She smiled and turned away, or focused on menial things like getting out of the airport while I coulnd't seem to tear myself from her. Ah fuck, I missed her so badly. It seemed to just get weirder when we got to her place. She gave me a tour (moved when I left, only saw it via facetime) and showed me the bedroom. Now, I don't want to get graphic, but last summer when I got back we dind't sleep for three days. This time was weird. She wasn't feeling any foreplay, nothing. I stopped pretty quick as it was obvious she wasn't feeling it. I was all ""mmmmm, babe"" and she was all ""haha....yeah""

ended up watching a movie and ordering out. I had much bigger plans. I wanted to take her to a dinner, maybe a movie. She wanted to order and watch cable. Well, whatever at least we're back together. She ended up falling asleep around 10, I picked her off the couch and put her to bed. ended up sleeping next to her (not cuddling or touching, more my choice. it seemed weird). Anyway I ended up staring at the ceiling for about 4 hours thinking about the day. The only thing I could come up with was that it was distant. It was like two friends seeing each other after going to seperate summer camps. you know you both missed each other and can't wait to see each other but when you acutally do it's weird.

It never really got better. It's been two weeks and we've had some serious talks. Basically she's told me she's not sure if she wants to be with me or something along those lines. We spend the nights together, and we do have sex a lot. Things seem to be going back to normal but it's still just weird. She keeps saying she loves me but i feel like i could lose her at any second. If I don't give her attention, If if accidentaly bail on a date. I suggested counseling and she was for it, but only for herself. I wanted to go to counseling together, she wanted to go seperate. I don't know what's going on. Help?"
1lrskt,3,2013-09-05,Feeling absolutely hopeless,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lrskt/feeling_absolutely_hopeless/,"I really don't see a way out of this this time.  No light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm 27 and I've been working at a job I don't like for the last 2 years.  Was well paid but faked my way through the whole thing and my boss wasn't impressed with my progression after about a year.  I managed to do enough to get by and last month I got a different job in the same company, hoping that I would like it and feel motivated/less depressed.  NOPE!

I lasted 3 days and have a severe breakdown and have been off on medical leave since (1 week now).  I don't think I can go back, i have so much to learn before I can work on my own, it's high stress and fast pace and I have 0 interest in it. 

I have a degree but its in accounting and I quit that right after school (see a pattern yet?). I did a paid internship and was a huge disappointment.  Was even told once (I really don't know how you made it this far).  I do, I'm very well spoken and I do well in a classroom setting.  That's about it.  I have no work ethic and I'm pretty shy.  The thought of going in somewhere day after day and sitting there makes me immediately depressed and then come the panic attacks and pain issues.  The only reason I got my current job is because my dad worked there for 30 years and got me in.  Now, I've got nowhere to go and I'm too depressed to take some menial job.  I had really high expectations of myself and I already feel like a failure.  If I go become a janitor I might actually become suicidal. 

I've thought about going back to school but what's the point, I'm just going to be right back where I started after a few years.  What happened to me?  I hate myself and I feel worthless. My friends are all super successful and my wife is doing great in her career and I can't even go in to work anymore without going crazy.

I'm on Wellbutrin and cipralex now (just started).  I hope this starts working soon because I'm slinking further and further into the dark cave of depression.  And in case you can't tell, the negative thoughts have taken over and I'm losing the battle. 


I really don't even know what the light of the end of the tunnel looks like right now.  If I take a job ""beneath me"" (what a horribly entitled thing to say) I guarantee I will end up severely depressed.  If I go back to my current job ill be fired quickly for spending most of my time in the bathroom have panic attacks and will not be able to be trained.  If I quit and go back to school, Ill have the impossible task of figuring out what I want to do without doubting every single minute of my new education, feeling like I made a huge mistake and won't be able to perform this new job.

Short of winning the lottery, the only way I see this going is losing my house, wife leaving me (who would want to be with a fucking loser like me who has no dreams, no passions and can't work because he's too fragile), ending up on my parents couch ready to just say fuck it.  I wanted to type ""end it all"" there but I don't mean that...I'd rather become a gypsy traveller and die homeless.

I've failed at every job I've ever had, the only thing I've ever been OK at is school.  I thought about being a teacher but im probably too mentally unstable.  The kids might break me.  Let alone is probably have a panic attack with 30 eyes on me, knowing I can't go to the bathroom or escape. 

I'm seriously fucked.  Thank god for disability right now or id be broke right now too.  I seriously can't understand why my wife hasn't left me yet...all i do is drag her down. 

I already see a psychologist.  I think I'm beyond help."

I have a strong technical background with a thorough understanding of business and marketing as well as a passion for games. I am attempting to build a team to work on translating my game concept into reality. I suppose you could consider me the Game Director in a sense. I will be handling the oversight, management, marketing, story, and general direction of the game (with input from the team of course). I need to fill out the talent pool with exceptional programmers, artists, sound guys, etc. People with skills in multiple areas would be awesome.

Now here is the issue. I need people who are willing to volunteer their work in the beginning. Until we can sell our first game or generate revenue from some other source, the team will be working essentially as unpaid interns, myself included. Any revenue we generate from selling the finished game will be split evenly amongst all team members, yet obviously this could be 2+ years into the project (worst case scenario, you gained some experience). This is all up in the air as of now, but you get the point. Also, their will be contracts drawn up to ensure all of this is in writing for both parties, so never fear.
We are willing to work around your schedule and use you when you are available, however we would prefer people who can dedicate significant hours per week to this project (25+) as well as people who are local for meetings, discussion, and simply to have a place where we can all sit down and work together in the same room. We will be based out of Sacramento, CA. We are open to telecommuting and are flexible on working hours, but as stated above, would prefer someone within driving distance of Sacramento, CA and willing to put in long hours.

If you want to be apart of our team and would like to dedicate your time to building awesome games, shoot us a PM. In your PM, please give us a brief introduction to yourself, your background, the position you think you can fill, why you would be good for this role, and any credentials, experience, or past projects you may have worked on. You do NOT need to have experience, a degree, or anything of the sort to qualify. We just want people who are dedicated, passionate, and knowledgeable. If you can show us you have these qualities, we are interested. Our only restriction is that you must be 18+ years old to apply.

Just to be clear, our goal is to produce amazing games. We want a fun atmosphere where everyone contributes to making the best possible ""gamer's"" game. This philosophy will be at the core of everything we do.

We look forward to hearing from you!"
1lrjs9,9,2013-09-05,The Objective Statement on a Résumé Dilemma,potatoriot,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1lrjs9/the_objective_statement_on_a_résumé_dilemma/,"**The Objective Statement Dilemma** pops up with almost every single résumé critique thread that is posted and it's generally always about 50/50 with people approving or disapproving of the use of an Objective statement. So, I'd like to discuss this and get the real in-depth reasons out there on why a student should or should not use an objective statement.

***Disclaimer***: Cultural differences take place depending on region, please keep in mind that views may differ. Just remember that the opinions you state here should be considering a recruiting perspective on what recruiters and firms are looking for out of a resume and not solely your personal individual preference.

From my standpoint as a firm professional and my active involvement in the recruiting process, I agree that both sides have a valid argument, which is why I think everyone is so divided. From my observance, I think a lot of those who comment on it do not fully grasp the internal recruiting process firms go through year-round. Don't forget that firms are pre-identifying students all year long and recruiting does not take place just between August and October.

I find that there is definitely appropriate times and places to include an Objective Statement and there are times and places when it is not appropriate. People often make the common mistake in thinking that you should have just one specific resume. This could not be further from the truth as you should be developing a resume to the specific objective at hand. A resume you build to obtain scholarships should not look exactly like one that is meant for landing a job in public accounting. Same goes for the situation in how you are submitting your resume to a firm for said job.

***Important Points to Consider***

* If your resume is lacking enough content and you are completely unable to build it up further, adding an objective statement can enhance it without adding too much fluff.

* If you already have an Objective Statement and you are struggling for more room, you should consider removing it from the resume.

* If your resume is full as it is and adding an Objective Statement would cause it to extend to two pages or require you to remove other valuable information, it is probably best to just exclude it.

Now, let's tackle what an appropriate Objective Statement should look like before we determine whether we should use it. The Objective Statement should be concise and to the point with no unnecessary fluff. You are simply stating your objective as to why you are providing your resume.

&gt;***Objective Statement Template:***

&gt;&gt;**To obtain a** ""*position* (internship or full-time) and *field* (tax or audit)"" **with** *""Specific Firm Name""* **in the** *""City/Region""* **area starting** *""Date to start (Winter or Summer)""*

&gt;***Objective Statement Example:***

&gt;&gt;To obtain a tax internship with Potatoriot, LLC in the Greater Potato Area starting January 2014.

This example is to the point, is catered specifically to the firm to show that you are seriously interested in them, and tells them exactly what it is you're looking for. Now that we have an idea of what an appropriate objective statement might look like, let's discuss when it's appropriate or inappropriate to actually use it.

***When to use an Objective Statement:***
&gt;* **Large recruiting events where your resume is being physically handed to professionals.**

&gt;&gt;Big events like Meet the Firms, ""Mock"" Career Fairs, and the big ""Real"" Career Fair where firms are meeting with literally hundreds of students can be beneficial to include an objective statement to ensure that your resume clearly states what you are looking for when it is reviewed at a later time.

&gt;&gt;If you make a good impression, firm reps will remember you, but it gets difficult to distinguish resumes on paper and link faces to them. Generally, firms divide them into separate piles for Audit and Tax, but sometimes these can get mixed up. Also, it's difficult to remember if you're looking for an internship or full-time position, or a start date in the winter or summer. Firms all have different hiring needs based on the field and start date, so it is important that you are put into the correct category.

&gt;* **E-mailing a firm representative and attaching your resume**

&gt;&gt;This I think is more of a gray area and you can argue either way. However, while you think with this, ""Oh, I can just state what I'm looking for in the body of the e-mail"", you need to realize that unless you are directly e-mailing a recruiter in the HR department, this information can easily be lost in transfer. Firm professionals that aren't recruiters that receive follow-up e-mails from you end up forwarding the e-mail on to HR and often the body of the e-mail can be overlooked, especially if it's long. 

&gt;&gt;Attaching your resume to these follow-up e-mails and having an appropriate objective statement mentioning exactly what you're looking for ensures everyone is on the same page. Firm reps receive hundreds of these e-mails and they don't have time to follow-up with each one to make sure they know what your objective is if they are uncertain.

&gt;* **Handing your resume to an acquaintance to pass it along to someone you have not met**

&gt;&gt;If you are physically providing your resume to someone that will be handing it on to another firm rep or recruiter that you have not personally met, it's important to have the Objective Statement to ensure that this new person knows exactly what you are looking for and does not forget it.

***When NOT to use an Objective Statement:***

&gt;* **Applying online to a specific position with a firm**

&gt;&gt;If you are applying directly to a position, then the firm representatives already know everything that you would be including in an Objective Statement. At this point you are just being redundant and distracting from the rest of your resume.

&gt;* **Whenever you are including a Cover Letter**

&gt;&gt; The points in your Objective Statement should all be included in your Cover Letter, so as the point above you would be redundant to include one and distract the reader.

&gt;* **Small or specialized recruiting events**

&gt;&gt; If you are attending a small recruiting event or a specialized one where it will be very easy to remember you or it's clear that you are there for a specific position, then an Objective Statement is not necessary.

To reiterate, opinions may vary depending on region. An Objective Statement generally will not make or break you in the recruiting process, but it can be beneficial depending on the situations stated above in helping ensure recruiters are clear with your intentions. If you decide to include one, just be sure that it does not have fluff and concisely states what you are looking for. You do not want it to distract the reader from the rest of your resume.

I'm now in my third year of Software Engineering and I am one of the better developers in my class.  Around 15% of our class got a summer job.  I was in the 15%.  My job got extended to a part-time during the year because my boss was so happy with my work.

I'm so lucky that I have a brain that works so well with computers.  I'm so lucky that I was exposed to programming at a young age.  I'm so lucky that I love what I want to do for a career.

I was dealt an awesome hand in life, but now, 90% of my free time is used to smoke weed, watch shows, and play video games.  

My fucking goal in life was to never work for a single day.  Now, that I've gotten a job, it's to not work for a single day outside of internships.  That is still my goal.  I want to develop something big, something that will rake in a lot of money over a few years, so I can retire and not have to have any responsibilities for the rest of my life.  

I don't even know if this is normal.  Maybe everyone wants to do that, but they don't have a means.  I genuinely think it is possible for me to work hard for a year or two now, and rake in the big dollars.  Would everyone else strive for the same thing if they thought they had a chance?

I don't know what I'm talking about.  I'm a little high and this kind of became a rant."

My question is this:  How hard will it be to find a job outside of school city?  For example, I live and go to school in Memphis, but am open to relocating to the Carolinas, Colorado, or Texas.  

I know that these are all compact states, which may help, but I'm just feeling some anxiety about the job hunting process in general.  

Some background:  
This is my second bachelors.  I have a degree in psychology already and have a few years of social work experience under my belt.  
I have been tutoring A&amp;P, patho-physiology, and other subjects for the last three years.  I started my internship in the PACU at a local hospital in February and have been diligent about finding learning experiences while in the clinical setting.  

Overall, I feel very competitive.  My anxiety is coming from just not knowing much about how difficult it will be to find a job in a hospital that hasn't heard of the schools where I was educated.  

I know that I have developed a lot of social capital in the Memphis area.  It's just that I haven't looked for work in a place I didn't live.  I am hoping for any helpful pointers!  - Thanks for any input."

________________________________________________________

It was the closing half of the 2000s, and I was in my junior year of college.  A hopeless romantic and nerdy engineering major, I felt that my years of youth were coming to a close.  Things couldn't have been better though.  I was getting excellent grades  and I had an internship lined up for the summer, which meant I could start doing meaningful, interesting work.  I couldn't wait to quit my summer job as a cashier at the local pharmacy.   Making minimum wage after 4 years of service can really take its toll on your ability to care about hanging sale signs and stocking shelves.   Honestly, it was the worst job I've ever had.  So, why did I stay for so long?  
She was 3 years younger than me.   My cousin, a petite girl, with slender legs and a smile that would brighten your worst day.  Eve worked as a technician in the pharmacy and I worked in the front of the store.  Her father, my uncle, landed both of us the job.  
Eve and I have always had a close relationship and I frequently fantasized about her, but never would have had the guts to say anything.  I always had a suspicion that she liked me though.  We would always tease each other.  Play stupid little pranks like placing the card board cutouts of famous movie stars or singers into the bathrooms to scare unsuspecting customers when they walked in and the motion-sensing lights turned on.  High-school stuff really.
Things were pretty great between us, except for one thing.  Eve had a boyfriend.   It seems to always be the case that when you want something there is always an obstacle in place to prevent you from getting what you want.   The mere inability to get what you want makes you want it even more.   Part of me realized that as cousins the likely-hood of anything happing was remote, and in fact trying to do anything about the situation may cause some serious damage to my reputation and hers.  So I felt it best to move on to other opportunities.
Terri, one of my close co-workers, was a few years older than me.   A tall blonde woman with glacial blue eyes, a tight physique, and an ass that redefines the term.  I definitely had a crush on her, but knew she didn't really have much interest in me beyond our good times at the bar.  We went to the bar frequently and as usual one night after work we decided to wash away our troubles.  Terri had made it a habit to invite Eve out with us, but since Eve wasn't able to legally drink yet she almost always declined, however this time we were able to persuade her to come out.  Peer pressure is a bitch.  
The night started out pretty benign. We started kicking back a few beers and talking about  how much we hate our jobs, the typical jibber-jabber you would expect at a bar.   At this stage of life,  newly 21, I wasn't a very experienced drinker so it didn't take a whole lot to get a buzz on.  Terri however,  was an experienced socialite who had a special plan for this evening.  
I remember getting up to go to the bathroom.  When I came back there was a shot of Jack waiting for me.  ""To the shit we have to deal with day in and day out"", she said.  We tipped our shots back and clacked them back down on the table.  This was the first shot I had ever had.  I recall the warmth of liquor as it ran throughout my chest and down into my stomach.  Eve sat there and sipped on her cola and munched on some fries.  She seemed to enjoy how loopy I was starting to get.  ""Do another!"", eve said.  I ordered another round for Terri and I and we quickly drank them.   If you are not an experienced  drinker you should know there comes a point where the blood to alcohol ratio becomes so high as to remove one's inhibition completely.   
I began to notice my Eve again this night.  She was wearing our standard work uniform but even in that she had a radiance that compelled me to stare at her.  She was thoroughly enjoying our slurred words and brazen disregard for etiquette.    ""Lets do something crazy!"", Terri said while looking at Eve.  She asked Eve if she had ever kissed a girl.  Eve, being totally sober, blushed immediately.  I laughed hysterically.  To my surprise, and delight I might add,  Eve answered by saying she had never kissed a girl but was always curious.  My higher centers immediately shifted power to the lower brain.
She switched sides of the booth to be close to Terri.  I watched in anticipation as their lips drew close together.  I could feel a surge of blood rushing to my groin and the faint pulse of my penis beginning to rise.  Their lips locked.  Terri, opened her mouth and pressed her tongue against Eve's lips, begging for entry.  Eve obliged.  The kiss only lasted a few moments but it felt like a blissful lifetime to me.  As they withdrew Terri looked over at me, surely noticing my intense, awkward gaze.  She smiled; a deviant smile with head tilted low and slight curl on left side of her lips.  She eased back into the booth.  As she did so, I could feel something moving up my leg.  It was her foot inching closer and closer until it founds its mark.  This was the first time anyone had ever touched my groin.  It was a good thing I was drunk, otherwise I would have freaked out.  Her toes slowly rubbed along my penis.  Eve watched, fascinated by what was going on.  She bit her lower lip at the site of me giving out an exhale of pleasure.
It was all a tease of course.  Terri withdrew and quickly changed the subject.  Laughing the whole time at how in-experienced and how ""innocent"" I was.  Eve got up to go to the bathroom and Terri and I just chatted.   When Eve got back I tried my best to steer the conversation back to their kiss but to no avail.  ""HEY GUYS!""   Rather startled at the random voice I withdrew and turned to see what was going on.  Terri's boyfriend had arrived and decided to join us.   
The night was approaching a close and the bartenders had been making last calls.  I was too drunk at this point to safely drive home so I asked Eve if she would be able to take me.  She agreed that it would be safer for everyone if I didn't even look at a car.  We had a chance to talk some during the ride home, mostly reminiscing of the nights events.  I couldn't help but bring up their kiss.  I remember Eve turning bright red.  I told her that it turned me on (sort of in a joking way, to ... feel the mood).   She laughed and smiled at me.  She then told me that she was turned on by watching Terri feel me up under the table, but what was interesting was that she was dead serious about it.  I could feel the sexual tension beginning to build.  She glanced over at me with a smirk that might as well have been a neon sign pointing directly at her pussy.  We arrived at my house.  The tension still high I wasn't really sure how to end the evening, so simply stated that I had fun hanging out with her.  She smiled, leaned over, and gave me a kiss on the cheek and wished me a good night.

1lr9fp,2,2013-09-04,Struggling with the real-world (even though I have a well paying job)... post-college struggle,Xx_Squall_xX,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lr9fp/struggling_with_the_realworld_even_though_i_have/,"So this is the first time it's been September and I haven't been in an academic setting for about 17 years.  Needless to say, my mind is pretty confused.  I've got a good job at a large company, I live in a stable community, and I have abundant resources to support myself (some people I realize would be happy to have these things alone. . . but bear with me).   

I'm no stranger to working a job, I've had a job of some sort or another since I was 13.  Shoveling snow, mowing lawns, detassling corn, fast food joints, tutoring, etc.  This job however, my ""real"" job, seems to be the most difficult to cope with.  I started in early June, and have given it what I consider a fair amount of time to make a judgement.  I guess some of my problem lies within the job itself, which isn't very satisfying personally.  Similarly, I feel as though there is a negative mood with most of my fellow workers, which doesn't really help.

In college I wasn't a frat boy by any means.  I did enjoy myself on occasion, but I considered a night at home with friends to be just as fun as a night out partying.  I think a large part of my issue lies within the fact that I MISS MY FRIENDS.  I no longer have access to the abundance of people I know, like, and are my age.  I no longer am in an environment that's tailored to fit a young student adult (walkable convenient locations to everyday needs).  I took summer courses every year so I spent 4 years straight at the last place I lived (most college students go home or get internships during the summer)... so the city really grew on me and I really consider it my home.  Also, the city I'm in now isn't very glamorous.  It happens to often be featured on ""Worst cities in US"".  Not necessarily dangerous, but it's not very pretty by any means here.  Lots of neglect.  

Also I'm struggling to find things that I like to do.  The things I used to like doing are quickly becoming meaningless.  I could really use a hobby, and am currently seeking out new ideas.  I tried hanging out with coworkers, but am struggling to find any common grounds with them.  It seems like a lot of people at this company were farmed from local colleges, and I find it surprising that I was picked from out of state.  To me, it shows that this company is entirely okay with getting 2nd tier talent.... which is a huge concern.  I don't want to be pretentious, but I typically hung out with students in the top 25% of the class.  I'm attracted to and easily make friends with those who take their lives seriously.  My coworkers aren't necessarily that caliber of individuals, and the friend making process is more difficult as a result.  (don't get me wrong, they are wonderful people... just not those I would easily befriend).

I'm in a pretty serious relationship that started in college and is currently in good standing but long distance.  There are plans to have her move to me within the next 6 months.  I really like the city she's currently in, but I don't want to be with my company for less than a year (and ideally, I'd stay with them longer), thus I can't just pack up and head there.  

So, to sum it up:  I'm unhappy with my new job despite making decent money, I'm lonely and miss my friends, I miss the academic environment,  I struggle to find things to do in my freetime, and I'm involved in a long distance relationship.  I guess I'm just really uncomfortable with where I'm at, and there is always an underlying level of restlessness within me that keeps me from being happy or even content with my present status in life. 

I know how important it is to be happy for what you have, but I'm the type of person that is happier when he has more.  I have an ambition to do more with my life than just get by making decent money.  

If you've managed to read this far, I'd like to thank you for listening to my rant, and I welcome any input you have on the situation.  

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest reddit!"

I'm currently a Physics and Information Science major with a bunch of minors at UALR. I was set to graduate a year early this fall with just my InfoSci degree, but I realized I'd rather not just be a desk jockey the rest of my life.

 I'm a huge computer nerd in the process of building my third right now. Yay for scholarship refunds! I'm also a very avid reader, well I was when I have free time. My favorite series is, without a doubt, ASOIAF. I'm a huge fan of the show as well. Other shows I've watched/am keeping up with are Parks and Rec, Doctor Who(Tennant e'eryday), HIMYM, The Walking Dead, The League, Breaking Bad, Archer, South Park, Big Bang Theory, and Scandal. I listen to pretty much any kind of music except screamo, sorry but I like to listen to words, not angrily decipher them. 

I'm not a huge outdoor person, but I grew up in SE Arkansas so I was raised outside. I like the occasional hike and whatnot. I also just ordered a nice telescope for my astronomy class and would like to find a place to go camping and star gaze a couple of times before it gets too cold. And assuming I get this internship I'm interviewing for next Tuesday, I'll be getting a bike so I can ride around more.

I'd like for who ever I take to at least be in college or graduated. I'm definitely not an expert on a whole lot, but I do know a lot of random tidbits of information, so if you bring something up I can probably hold a conversation about it, assuming it's not makeup or fashion related. 

Also, this is [me](http://i.imgur.com/Kxb5vtPh.jpg)."

The first chapter discusses how I met my ex-wife.  All criticism is welcome.


--BEGINNING CHAPTER 1--

Year 1, Month 1:

Approximate Year - 2004

Weight – 195 lbs

I had been working at AtomicEnergyInc as an intern for a few months, in the Major Components Design and Analysis group.  Sounds important huh?  Well it wasn’t.  I honestly found that the work that I was doing was the least gratifying work that I had ever done.  My job as a lowly intern… do simple trigonometry to calculate weld throat sizes, for structural weld overlay applied to nozzles and piping within Nuclear Power Plants.  My purpose, my modus opporandi; to confirm that a stack of drawings about 3-inches thick, printed on 11 x 17 inch paper were technically correct.  After doing this for 3 days, the thought of waking up with a shotgun barrel in my mouth, and my big toe on the trigger seemed less painful.  But I was making good money, damn good money for a little shit still in college.

I don’t know about you but my mind needs to be challenged.  Given that I was between my junior and my first senior year of college (1) pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering, my mind was prepped and overflowing with ideas and academic knowledge ready for an opportunity to implement it.  That summer I didn’t get that challenge.  That summer I got handed a bullshit assignment that a monkey with 2 months of proper training could perform, hell even exceed at.  Well I made it through my 3 inch stack of paper in 1 week, only to find out that the 3 inch stack of paper was the only assignment they had come up with me for the entire summer…  my immediate thought; “fuck.”

It didn’t take me long to find things to do to keep myself busy and occupied.  Thanks to the lax internet security at the time, I could browse YouTube, listen to streaming music, piss around on Facebook, you name it.  Well guess what…  when you have infinite free time, and you can’t look at porn, you can browse through all the internet has to offer VERY quickly.  Well eventually big-brother caught on to what myself, and undoubtedly several others were doing and beefed up the internet security software.  Try going to YouTube; “cannot open application – Streaming/Online content”.  Try going to Pandora or Groove Shark, and the exact same message.  Try going to Facebook, by the grace of God big brother forgot to block Facebook.  Probably because those fuckers were goofing around on that website more than I was.  Needless to say, Facebook quickly became a crutch that I relied heavily on as it connected me from Zombieland (aka work) to the real world.
Let’s just say my “friends” quickly got annoyed with my constant messaging on Facebook, and I found myself to be alone and unable to really talk to anyone who wasn’t, in my head as an immature summer intern, a complete fucking tool.  

So here is my situation, I have 2.5 months of internship left, I have completed my entire summer assignment in 1 week, I have no friends that I can bullshit with throughout the day to help me pass time, I can’t look at porn on a work computer, and I have already explored all that the internet has to offer (that isn’t porn) while being at work…  When coming to this realization, guess what my immediate thought was…  
If you guessed “fuck” you are wrong.  My immediate thought was, “well it’s time to go exploring.” 
That day I found myself in the cafeteria.  I had one of two options.  Option 1 – eat my lunch alone like I typically did (2), because I couldn’t stand a single person who worked in this company.  OR Option 2 – find someone to eat with and strike up a random conversation.  
That day I felt overly-motivated, and for the first time in a long time chose Option 2.  So I walked around, and started scouting.  

At one table I saw several engineers I was currently going to college with at the University of Pittsburgh, practically jerking each other off in public (3).  I mumbled something audible enough for them to hear along the lines of “I can’t fucking stand you nerds,” and kept my search going.  I know they heard me.    
I came by another table of several interns who I vividly remember still to this day proclaiming at the intern orientation “I went to Penn State, I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much smarter than you Pitt Engineers… this is my 4th internship here… I love it here… I am such a fucking douche,  etc. etc. etc.”  I’m pretty sure that is a verbatim quote right there.  There were a few moderately attractive women at this table, which made it enticing.  But these nerdlingers (4) get as possessive of any women that shows them attention as a mother Black Bear does to her newborn baby cubs.  Needless to say I didn’t feel like stomping the dicks in of a few nerds, I mean that figuratively by the way, that day so the search continued.  I did mouth the words “fuck you” to the head nerdlinger at the table and kept on walking.  It’s funny to see how nerds react to confrontation like this, he didn’t know what to do.

I finally came across what ended up being the table that I would sit at.  It was a moderately attractive young female, who either could be a very recent new hire or summer intern.  I sat down at the table and said “Hi, my name is Dave… I can’t fucking stand all these nerds that are around me.” Upon saying this, every elderly woman that was in the vicinity looked at me like I just farted in church.  I continued, “You don’t strike me as being a nerd.  Can I sit with you?”  She laughed and responded, “Sure thing dude.  My name is Sarah, and I can assure you that I am not a nerd.” 

Well Sarah turned out to be an incredible chic.  Somehow, probably by divine intervention, God steered me away from a potentially hilarious situation pounding the snot out of nerds, and saw fit to deliver me to the attractive, hippy (5), pot-smoking (6), great sense of humor, woman named Sarah.
Sarah and I had a great lunch.  Hell I don’t even think I ate my crappy lunch.  We talked and talked and talked and talked.  We got on the topic of how I had just got my heart broken from a girl that I had been dating in college.  

With how good our conversation was going, I felt comfortable enough being around this girl that I told her flat out, “man, I need to get fucking laid.”  At this point empirical evidence would dictate that 99% of women would have thrown a drink in my face, slapped me in the face, or said something like “GASP! I am so utterly offended by that comment.” 

How did Sarah react? “Yeah dude, sounds like you need some pussy.”  I was completely dumbfounded… never-before had I met a chic this cool.  What she lacked in super-model looks, her personality made her absolutely gorgeous in my mind.  I needed to know if she was available, I needed to know if I could have her in a biblical way… IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN… After some more conversation it became immediately clear that she had a boyfriend.  But I wasn’t pressing the issue to get together with her, and hook up or anything along those lines.  Let’s say that though I was young, dumb, and full of cum… I still had a semblance of morals.  
Well I made the mistake of asking her, more so for a shock reaction, “do you have any loose friends that are DTF?” (7), not expecting anything other than a nervous laughter in return.  But the surprises kept on coming…  Sarah said, “yeah actually, I have a friend named Kara.”

And that kids… is how I met your mother.

--END CHAPTER 1--

Chapter 1 Footnotes:

1.	It took me 5.5 years to graduate with a Bachelors of Science.

2.	Probably looking like a total psychopath doing so.

3.	This is my way of saying they were being overly obnoxious nerds that I would love to give the high-school bully treatment to.  And given the recent negative public perception on bullying I want to clarify that when I say that I mean, pick them up by their ankles and flush their heads in the toilet, as this is appropriate treatment for fucking nerds.

4.	Thank you Justin for coining that term back in college.

5.	I fucking hate hippies, but they are less hated than nerds.


6.	I know this comes with the territory of being a hippy.

7.	Note to readers; DTF means down to fuck.

Peter Parker has been living in Japan for twenty years after the deaths of his parents when he was five. While there he attended the finest schools and went to a very prestigious university. He has returned to New York to work at Oscorp, the leading name in high-tech defensive design. When he returns he takes up residence at his Aunt May's house and begins working at Oscorp as an intern. While at Oscorp he meets Mary Jane Watson, a biologist that he had known when he was a child. The two hit it off until she asks some awkward question that makes him lament about his loss. He timidly explains that he hasn't been in New York since his parents were killed by a horrible maniac twenty years prior.

He is also introduced to Dr. Thompson, the youngest department lead at Oscorp. His department has frequently produced some of the most innovative and brilliant ideas in Oscorp. Thompson has a group of assistants that follow him around. He thinks he is a hot shot and has his assistants call him ""Flash"". Dr. Thompson notices Peter and Mary Jane and decides to intervene making Peter do menial tasks while flexing his departments achievements to him.

Peter Parker is saved only when Dr. Norman Osborn intervenes. ""Dr. Thompson, I think we can treat our new interns better than this."" He takes Peter Parker aside and has a discussion with him while Dr. ""Flash"" Thompson has talks with Mary Jane. ""Peter,"" Dr. Osborn says ""You're the son of Richard Parker, am I right?"" while extending his hand for a shake. Peter hesitates for a moment and then shakes his hand. ""You knew my father sir?"" Osborn laughs ""Knew him, we were practically brothers!"" Dr. Osborn puts his hand around Parker's shoulder and leads him to his office. ""I noticed your resume when it came across my desk."" Norman looks down at Peter. Dr. Osborn stands a good foot taller than him. ""Your Aunt June..."" Peter interrupts, ""Sorry doctor, Aunt May."" Norman laughs again. ""Yes, your Aunt May brought this over to us months ago."" Peter just stares forward ""You should thank her, my boy, she wanted to secure your employment."" He smiles. ""...and with the economy the way it is today. Well... bless her."" Peter gulps. He can't help but feel a bit breathless when he is around Dr. Osborn. ""Please Peter, step into my office. Let's talk about your future!"" He holds his office door open while Peter graciously goes inside.

""What were you two talking about anyway?"" Dr. Thompson asks Mary Jane. ""You were laughing, was he funny?"" Mary Jane looks over to Peter going into Dr. Osborn's office. ""He was funny 'Flash'!"" Mary Jane retorts stabbing Dr. Thompsons goofy grin. ""Babe!"" He spits back. ""You know you can call me Gene!"" Mary Jane tries to walk away but he grabs her by the bicep. A few people look at him and then go back to working. ""Dr. Thompson! Please let go of my arm!"" Mary Jane replies yanking her arm. He tightens his grip then leans in close to her and says. ""Your buddy, your little funny buddy, is dangerous. For you... For me and for Oscorp. His working here is a problem for all of us. Don't say anything to anyone. Dr. Osborn told me that in secrecy. I don't know why he's here but believe me don't get attached!"" He let's go of Mary Jane's arm and walks out of the room. Mary Jane stands there stunned looking at Dr. Norman Osborn's door.

I'm bitter because it feels like it's something I've been ""forced"" into because there's really no other options. Society says I have to pay (or admittedly, my parents have to pay) tens of thousands of dollars and work for 4 years to get a degree that may or may not help me get a job. There are so many jobs where I really don't get why *that much* education is necessary. 

I'm probably going to major computer science, and obviously that requires training, but why do I have to take courses with no relevance to fit some degree requirements? 

 More than anything I wish I could just go straight to an unpaid internship and receive on the job education and training from them. 

But I'm in for 4 more years of learning things I don't care about, studying, and exams...

And yeah yeah, university is a good growing experience, you meet lots of people, whatever. I at least appreciated high school because I got to see my friends everyday and actually spend quality time with them. And I'm looking forward to a career and getting to know my coworkers. At university, it feels more about quantity of friends vs. quality...

I'm also scared I'm not going to do well in comp. sci. I'm not great at theoretical math, which I think will end up being very frustrating for me. My other interests would be in the film/tv industry or fashion industry, and I think I would enjoy art school much more, but I don't know if I'd be able to go far. This sounds bad, but it's important to me that I have a good salary, so that I have the means to do the things I actually care about and enjoy.

Okay that sounded really whiny. But I feel like I'm being forced down  this path. I worry this will really take an emotional toll on me."

So, I've just moved over to Switzerland for my Year Abroad - so far pretty good, loving my internship, closer to my BEST FRIEND EVER IN THE WHOLE WORLD (hai if you're reading this!) and in a nice city and comfy flat.

....that said. I'm living with two guys (eek, can't believe I did this as someone who was living with six other girls this last year!), they are nice enough, polite and so far pretty friendly. 

But it is also weird and a little awkward at times as I really don't know them yet at all!  (Boys and girls also definitely have different levels of considerate!) Like tonight, got home from work and they let me know that in half an hour they are having people over for a bbq. Ok, cool, I like being in a busy and social place!

I didn't realise however that there would be loud music, a lot of people I dont know and that when they told me - well, they were just letting me know and not really inviting me :/ and it was horrendously awkward and i'm sitting in my room alone eating dried cereal because it was scary and everyone was outside apart from two random men watching football, *and-i'm-a-massive-wimp*.

**Lets have a discussion:**

* What are your experiences of moving in with strangers?

* What is some advice you wish someone had given you when you were living with these people/this person?!

I am not from a wealthy family, and I've had to put myself through college (and all other expenses) by working while attending classes. This, along with my (now obvious) chronic depression, probably more than likely contributed to my poor academic performance.

It seems pretty clear now that I won't be able to go into surgery, the career I've wanted for my entire life. Between the mcats and the hundreds of hours I've spent at medical/surgical internships, I feel that I've wasted much of my time here, now that my future is set.

My parents cannot know of my inability to pursue medicine, and I would rather just have them remember me as the child they spoke so highly of to their peers, their child with the countless reference letters and near perfect mcat scores. The child that they were (are?) proud of.

Yes, there are always other jobs and fields I could explore or enter. I know this, it's not as if though I'm denying the possibility of my being content in some unrelated career. It's moreso that I will always have to live with the fact that I was too inadequate to reach that which I have always longed for, and in the face of this sobering realization (among many others), it is impossible for me to accept myself.

With that, I have finally decided to end my life.

It's not a new decision to me, as I've attempted it many times previously in my youth. I'm certain though that this time I will be successful, due to my newfound motivation.

What motivation? The motivation that this final year of mine (or 9 months now) will be the sweetest I've ever had. Now that I've accepted my fate, I feel free from the anxiety that's plagued me for so long. Now that I can count down how many days I have left, the remaining ones are that much more enjoyable. For the first time in my life, I can lay in the sun and simply enjoy the warmth.

Nothing has improved the quality of my life like the decision I made to end it.

So I'll live for the next few months, awaiting June 15th, the day I've marked as ideal. I think for the first time in my life I'm actually excited for something.

Feel free to ask me any questions if you'd like. I'm more than happy to answer any you may have."
1luvss,24,2013-09-06,My boyfriend[m26] though that I[f26] triggered his friend P[m26] for reporting our relationship to our boss,defendingthetruth,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1luvss/my_boyfriendm26_though_that_if26_triggered_his/,"The reason I am writing this story is because I want to know how people view this. My boyfriend puts all the blame on me and I feel I should defend myself.
My boyfriend (bf) of 1.5 years, his best friend P and I work at the same place. My bf and I are full time employee and his best friend joined the company as a summer intern. 

June 2013: Everything started when my bf mentioned that he lent P his bike a few years ago and he has not returned it. My bf asked me whether he should ask P to return the bike. I told my bf that I need the bike for school in the fall so he decided to ask P to return it.  But at the time, he was not sure whether P still has the bike. So when I saw him at work, I casually asked P whether he still had the bike, he told me he had it in storage, I relayed the message to my bf.

First week of July 2013: I saw him at work and casually asked whether he is okay returning it. He said “okay” but need some time since he is busy. I told him I understood.

Last week of July 2013: My bf texted P asking him to return the bike. P told my bf that he was currently busy with summer school but agreed to return on the 2nd week of August. P went further by telling my bf that I had been nagging him for the past two months about the bike. My bf told me to stop nagging him. Even though, I felt that “nagging” is a not an appropriate word to use, I agreed to give P time to finish his summer school before looking for the bike.
At that time I was in the middle of negotiation of buying a bike at craigslist, my bf stopped me and asked me to wait. 

On the week P was supposed to return the bike (2nd week of August): P told us that he had to go to cabin with his family. He asked us to wait another week.

On the week after (3rd week of August): My bf totally forgot to follow up. Since I happened to run towards him at office, I asked nicely what happened. He replied, he commemorated the death anniversary of his brother so he was busy preparing the event last weekend. I told him I am sorry about his brother but anyway, when would you be able to return the bike since school is starting? He suddenly raised his voice “Why would you care since it is not your bike?”. Me (raised my voice too): “I need it for school and my bf even asked you to return it because he wants to give it to me. If you want to keep the bike, you should tell me from the very beginning so that I can buy one instead of getting false hope from you”  P:”Just leave me alone”. I left. After I left, P texted my bf that I harassed him at work about the bike. My bf without hearing the story from my side, stopped talking to me because of that.

On the 4th week of August: P went to my boss telling him that I was demanding (my boyfriend’s name)’s bike from him at work and basically let my boss know about our relationship.

On 1st week of September: My bf found out and confronted P about revealing the secret. P apologized to my bf that it was his last resort because he had ben annoyed by me for so long. P told me that he didn’t want to see my face or talk to me anymore. After the call, my bf was mad at me and forced me to apologize to him for triggering him to report our relationship to our boss. My bf also told me that he picked P’s side and the whole problem started because of me.

I don’t have a peni* but I am gentleman enough to admit if I do things wrong. It was probably my fault to bypass my bf in asking P about the bike although I see it as casual conversation between friends.  I am indifference about losing a “friend” like P. I was mostly upset because P chose to harm not only me but also my bf by revealing our secret. And obviously upset because my bf failed to act objectively and maturely. I never asked him to defend anyone. I just need him to be fair and neutral. Please let me know what do you think about this? Thanks!

Tl;dr My boyfirend’s friend P[m26]  who works at the same workplace with us reported our relationship to our boss. Office rules are potentially against dating. My bf put the blame on me for triggering him to do such thing by asking him to return my boyfriend’s bike.

1ltwee,3,2013-09-05,Back to Nothing,JustHere3,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ltwee/back_to_nothing/,"I spent the better part of 4 years after I graduated from high school pushing myself as hard as I could and getting nothing in return. I graduated right on the beginning of the recession and there was nothing for me out there. Even though I had a near perfect academic record and spent almost all my spare time on self-improvement projects, I could barely even get part time retail work. My parents, both out of work before the recession, made my life a living hell at home and blamed me for their own problems. 

I've never been good at making friends and I had no money, so I spent most of those 4 years alone in a library within walking distance, from opening to closing time. I survived on dollar menus fast food and water. My days were filled with an aimless feeling of hatred for everyone I encountered. They all seemed to have something I didn't have- a job, a car, a girlfriend, a family that loved them- anything really.

Starting about 2 years ago, things started to turn around a little bit. I did an internship that involved helping people. After hating other people for so long, I realized I really enjoyed doing something kind. Long story short, it eventually turned into a job. The pay wasn't much (just above minimum wage) and some of my co-workers are real jerks- but I feel proud of what I do. I couldn't live on it though.

Then, this Summer, I thought I had what would be my major breakthrough. I worked hard and sent a bunch of applications for internships out. To my surprise, the only response I received was from the CEO of an organization who wanted to take me on immediately. I was thrilled and jumped into work for them, before it could even count towards my class. I wanted to show them how serious I took it and I'd make those kinds of sacrifices.

Well, they weren't willing to make those kinds of sacrifices for me. I don't know what happened (I assumed they just lost focus) but they stopped giving me stuff to work on. I can never reach any important people because they are all too busy for me. I'm not receiving any hours I can count towards my internship class and I'm probably going to need to find a new, much less prestigious site. My experiences trying to communicate with them in the last 2 weeks pretty much leave me thinking there's no other option.

I'm back to being a nobody again. They took my work during that short time and now there's no way I can use any of it to my advantage- as hours towards my class, as a reference, as anything.

I worked hard as hell but my fate was in somebody else's hands- and like every other time that's happened, they let me down.

I feel as good as dead tonight. I didn't eat dinner. I walked at my local mall, which I haven't been to in years. I just wanted to try to do all the things I did as a kid. Most of my old favorite shops are closed. I went to visit the pet store but I felt none of the joy people usually have even just watching the pets. I sat in the food court for almost an hour and imagined what it would be like to be there with a friend. Then, knowing there wasn't one, I just went to the library. I'll be here until it closes in an hour.

Even if I get over this, I feel like this is going to be my entire life. I don't know if I'm ever going to break into a middle class job even though I did everything right. And even if I did it would just be more solitude and dealing with people who brush you off after you do things for them. And being laid off and back at the library again and again and again..."

1lxq5l,9,2013-09-07,Why is it so difficult to get in touch with a politicians who actually make you feel heard and represented?,NumenSD,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1lxq5l/why_is_it_so_difficult_to_get_in_touch_with_a/,"I'm a consultant who's looking to get into political consulting. One of the ways I thought would jump start my career would be find a major issue that politicians are having trouble agreeing on and solve the problem. I did exactly that with a bill called the Marketplace Fairness Act. 

Forgive this for being a little long but I know there are a lot of people who work on Capitol Hill who may read this and reading it in it's entirety will get the point across better and hopefully inspire change.

Now for those of you who don't know, the MFA is a bill regulating tax on internet and remote sales where the seller does not have a physical nexus in that state. As a small business owner of an online only retail site in California, I'm actually all for an internet sales tax for a majority of reasons, but the way the current bill is written would be burdensome and downright toxic for businesses like mine. 

After doing countless hours of research, writing a proposal, a SWOT analysis, and even rewriting the senate bill in it's entirety to be simplified, streamlined, and actually beneficial to large and small businesses alike as well as creating jobs as a byproduct, I proceeded to contact senator's offices who cosponsored the bill. 

Now I know that it's very difficult if not impossible to get in touch with an actual senator but figured their staff could handle the messages. I also know that the majority of people in politics worked their way from the bottom doing internships and working on campaigns. What I didn't expect was to encounter the disappointing general attitude and atmosphere of the political process.

By the numbers to give you an idea:

--I spoke to 26 senators' offices who had a vested interest in and/or cosponsored the MFA.

--All 25 offices wanted me to send over my proposal via email, mail, or fax.

--All 23 offices put me in touch with their respective LAs (legislative assistants) on the issue either directly or through voicemail. The remaining 3 were actually among the offices of the main proponents of the bail.  

--I corresponded directly with 11 of the LAs on the issue. They all liked the basics of my idea and encouraged me as well to send them the ideas, but 10 stated the party line is that politicians aren't in the position to give credit and/or recognition to constituents who help politicians solve problems. 3 of those corresponded further and actually tried to see if there was something they could do for me but came back empty handed.
All I'm left with is a single LA from a senator's office who I have an upcoming conference call with in the near future who is taking an extra step.

--I have also spoken with numerous senate and house committees as well as organizations corporations who are also proponents of the bill with great success speaking to those in charge. Unfortunately, none of them had enough power to influence the bill despite how much liked like to help me.

The biggest problem with innovation in America has a spillover effect to politics as well. Everybody wants the credit for themselves and see's it as either threatening to their job or their ego's if somebody else comes up with an idea they couldn't. Whatever happened to the times when those in power recognized achievements of those below them to send the message that ""I'm good at my job because I can both recognize and utilize the talent/genius of my employees/constituents."" This recent article exemplifies the issue. http://www.today.com/money/gen-y-bosses-entitled-out-themselves-study-says-8C11066147 

Now I understand some of these politicians may have been working on a project throughout their entire political career and that I may be young and seemingly inexperienced in the political arena. However, my ideas time and time again have proven viable and successful when implemented in a variety of fields and industries regardless of my level of experience in them. I wasn't asking to get paid or hired as a thank you for my idea. I simply wanted recognition and them scratching my back for my scratching theirs. I'd help them get this bill passed and they would help me get my dream job (either directly or through a letter of recognition or public statement).

Why are these actions so unprecedented in the political arena and why are politicians and their LA's so unwilling to be humble when it comes to furthering their political agendas? I'm trying to give these senators a silver bullet for getting the bill passed and only asking for recognition in return. 

I have read countless posts on reddit alone from fellow redditors who wrote their representatives only to receive a standardized response on the topic. They are here to represent us, but we do not feel represented or even heard from.

Luckily some of the LA's gave me some advice and contacts they had and I will be pursuing alternate methods such as getting independent articles published through various publications on the issue to bring awareness.

If there are a few pieces of wisdom I'd like to impart on all of you reading this, it's to never give up pursuing your dream job. As long as you have the know-how, there are many different paths you can take to accomplish your goals. While I haven't finished mine yet, I continue finding new avenues and making contacts in the process. In fact, my journey has just begun. "

Thursday is a very awaited day for our champion. In the morning, he didn't train. He dedicates himself to taking a rest and a good sleep, both things that he very much deserves.  

As for the work for the rest of the team, it is not too different from his. Some spent the time communicating with family and friends, others slept late, and yours truly, this pseudo-journalist , trying to edit some pictures. Yerba Mate (an herb like tea infusion, a very common beverage to pass the time in Argentina) while listening to the great Polaco Goyeneche (a tango singer). They are keeping me both company, which makes me feel closer to Argentina.  

The action begins around noon. Colo (you might have seen a ginger in Matthysse's team, that's him who he referse to) tries to vary lunch for Lucas. Grilled fish with white rice and baby carrots, and a lemonade. It doesn't seem very appetizing, yet with good seasoning - garlic, lemon, ginger and pepper - everything changes.  

In the afternoon, the plan indicates that there will be a hand exercise session with Cuty (trainer). The idea is to work only on combination movements and speed repetition exercises. After, two rounds of strict defense and counter attack with Colo.

To the gentle handshakes and the looks of admiration on the behalf of the little ones at the gym, there's an addition which consists of a video producer and his team. They had the thumbs up to film a small film that they would then gift us. Warm up session and hand wrapping are done in between jokes and laughs, this time, with more cameras around us, eager to shoot.

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/101_0060.jpg

After the first round, the speed and power of the punches stop the other people training around. Everyone's observing Lucas' work, and some cannot seem to hide their astonishment. In each of the breaks, Cuty (trainer) had a comment about the strength of Lucas' punches. The comment is followed by a complaint and a little gesture of pain, but the satisfaction is fully there. We're very happy.   .

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/101_0033.jpg

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/101_0055.jpg

The day of the fight is coming near, and with it, the culmination of a phase of training with specific exercises. We are a bit tired, yet with a great sense of happiness and joy, knowing that we are near the end and that everything has been done correctly. We have prepared an excellent boxer, with outstanding virtues. 

The physical demands diminish in intensity and volume, the technique movements are sharpening little by little, and the strategies began to gain territory in the space of our thinking/brains. We all think and live boxing, every single second.

From the social media, we can read encouraging words, and infinite shout outs. The anxiety and fervor is growing in Argentina. We have and feel a lot of support from all the country. This only pushes us forward. 

We are ready for a war, a war that will originate between 16 ropes. For we have given it our all, including that which we did not imagine we had.

In only one night, and perhaps in a brief moment of it, everything will end.

The last days are passing by, and I remember a reflexion/thoughht of a boxing trainer in Argentina. For this occasion, it comforts me and feeds my soul. And I hope it will also be a message for the Garcias.  

""We have not prepared an athlete that will play, this boxer is a warrior.  

 We do not consider him an athlete, because in boxing, there's no PLAYING AROUND"". "

Me [22F] Ex [22M]


So reddit, I definitely dodged a bullet on this one. So after that last conversation with him a week ago (we broke up a little over a week ago), I went NC and got myself back in order. Finished up some projects at my internship, joined a new club at University, hanging out a lot with friends.


I had plans to go over to my twin brother's house on Friday to drink with a him and his girlfriend and a bunch of other friends (I think I mentioned in the comments that my ex and my brother are roommates in a house of 5 people). My ex had been telling my brother for days now that he would not be there because he was leaving for his home town hrs before that. 20 min before I was supposed to arrive my brother texted me and told me my ex had decided he was going to stay for the festivities.....and bring his new 18 year old girlfriend (they decided to make it official last week)....


This is something I had been looking forward to this week and I was already dressed up and heading out the door, so I decided to go anyway. To my surprise I was actually OK. It did bother me when he started throwing out innuendos and talking about how much he wanted to sleep with her right in front of me....a little...but I wasn't so much hurt as thinking ""wow, he's being a grade A asshole considering he's crashing my plans"". After talking to the girl I came to realize that all that Facebook crap about how happy she is with him (she posted that right after we broke up) was more stupidity/the fact that she's a highschooler with an equal maturity than anything else. I'm not angry at her anymore. 


When they left the room my brother told me that my ex had talked the girl into an open relationship (he wouldn't agree to a closed one, she thinks she loves him and so she agreed) while she lives and goes to school in a different city. He can sleep with whoever he wants and they can be together (and facebook official exc) when in the same city. And apparently in the 1 week they have been together he has used that ""freedom"" privilege with 3 different girls that aren't her....


So basically he is a giant ass hat who is unmotivated to go back to school and is sooner or later going to break this poor girl's heart. I never in a million years imagined he could act like this when we starting dating. I'm sad that it took seeing how her relationship is going to be to make me realize it. Time to move on and find an actual good guy!


(She texted me after that night, must have got my phone number off him and said she really liked me, was sorry how things panned out and never meant to hurt me, and asked if we could be friends. Highschool mentality right there lol. I have nothing against her but I am in no way shape or form mature enough to handle that sure fire bag of drama so I just chose not to reply)


tldr: I am sooooo much better off without him!


*Edit* 

Thanks for the vote of confidence guys. Everyone needs it once and a while and I've had a hard time finding someone to be able to talk my feelings/hurt/surprise/anger (its only been a bit over a week now) out to because we have soooo many mutual friends and I don't want to bad mouth him to them, its not exactly classy. Random internet people rule for frustration venting!

Hater's gonna hate but everyone needs a someone to vent to and I would rather express my frustrations to people who don't know me than involve a bunch of mutual friends in drama that makes life complicated"
1lxira,3,2013-09-07,Not just the same old depression anymore..,fuckthecorporations,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lxira/not_just_the_same_old_depression_anymore/,"I don't really know how to say it elegantly... but I feel like I've lost touch with my true self..
The first half of this you can skip.
Its my childhood issues, nbd.

As a kid, I looked different. Kids are mean, yadda yadda, made fun of my curly hair, my colorful clothing, my lanky-underweight body, my crooked teeth, the way I talked, my bucktoothed smile, and of course my glasses. (I'm female, so this gave me a lot of issues with my looks, that I still somewhat have..)
This followed me into highschool, long after I straightened up and started looking normal. 
Kids are just plain mean. I'll leave it at that.
Obviously I didn't make friends.
Well, I did, but they made fun of me, so I guess they weren't really friends..
I was very depressed most of the time, and spent most of my free days online alone, or creating things by myself.
My parents had very busy lives, but we did have dinner together  most nights, so it wasn't all bad.
This kept me happy. I learned to love my time alone, despite hating who I was. I'm still an introvert, and love it. I wish extroverts (basically everyone) understood why.
I hated school.
I would cry and scream and threaten to do terrible things to myself if my parents made me go.
I was so afraid and tired of being picked on daily, I guess they thought it was a phase, and I was only in middle school.
By high school, I had straight teeth, flat-ironed my hair, and became a goth kid. Oddly enough I was finally accepted as a person, and was pretty happy, until the bullying started again.

I never overcame it, dropped out, and homeschooled myself to get my diploma.

Fast forward though a few (mentally) abusive relationships, and one physically abusive relationship, my parents divorcing, living with a girlfriend that treated me like shit and put me $2500 in debt, and I'm 22 years old, with the man of my dreams.

And I'm seriously depressed.

But this is a different depressed than normal.
I'm used to, 
""My gf/bf/the world hates me, I have no reason to live, everyone hates me, it actually feels good to hurt myself, maybe I should end it.""
I would cry in a closet with a knife in my hand or some stupid shit, then start doing things to distract myself, go through all the motions, and eventually come out feeling on top of the world, because I just don't give a fuck.
I can work through these feelings because I've beaten them so many times before.. I used to feel so strong..

Things are different now.
About 2 months ago, I quit my serving job at a restaurant where I made decent money.
I hated it. The people, the stress, the rudeness, carpal tunnel, the EVERYTHING.
I lost a LOT of weight over the holiday season, and weighed 95lbs when I quit. I'm currently struggling to gain, but I feel like no matter how much I eat, I always come up at 97lbs.
I've been called everything in the book from anorexic to being told I'm not a real woman because I lack my mother's curves. And this coming from people I don't even know.
I feel as though this just feeds my depression.. the urge to fit in and feel normal for once.
But that's not what I want at all.

I also quit my birth control after 4 years, and decided to go organic when I met my current boyfriend. 
A good decision, until my ungodly PMS showed up.
This consists of cramping that causes me to writhe on the floor in pain, unable to move or speak until I can get a few ibuprofen in me, which don't even seem to work anymore.
My period is also never on time, and causes me massive anxiety/violent anger/ and suicidal thoughts that are harder and harder to suppress each month, and seem to be tearing my  boyfriend and I apart slowly every 3 weeks.
He can't handle me anymore after 2 years, and I sure as hell don't blame him. Our 2 year anniversary is in a month, and he has everything he could ever want, I feel like a bum and an idiot for not being able to afford anything, or even know what to get him that he hasn't already bought. I'm so fucking stupid.
He does so many nice things for me and I just leech and self-hate, and do NOTHING all day.

Now add that on top of the fact that I've been to college twice for stupid ideas that I ended up hating or not being able to get a job with, I'm broke, in debt by a lot, no REAL education (degree/diploma), and all I want to do is create.

I'm an artist. I paint, every day of my life. 
I also sculpt, I make jewelry, I illustrate, I fabricate, I love to do it all, and I do it well. Its my everything.
I work with other local artists, and make money every once-in-a-while.. I even have a page on facebook and an etsy store that I'd made a few grand in sales.
For awhile I had so much motivation, and was starting to finally get up..

But suddenly, I feel nothing.
All I can think about is politics, and taking in information, and crying over the dying people of the world, and everything else that seems to be going on that my friends and family don't care too much about.
I feel like a tiny grain of sand in a giant pool of unending consciousness, not even a dot in the timeline of the infinitely changing history of the universe.. I feel like nothing.
I cry, and I don't understand why I'm crying.
All the beautiful scenes of intergalactic heavenly bodies melding into an incomprehensible rainbow quilt of colors melting into the skyline of the nameless planet I saw.. the feelings of love and beauty and hope that came along.. the motivation to keep pushing forward.. its all gone.
All replaced with thoughts of money.
I don't want the measley green scraps of government-issued currency that run my entire world. I can't eat them, I can't plant them, I can't wear, or craft, or use them for really anything.
They just pay my bills, and determine my monetary value (which is about $4.25 an hour).
Yet, that's all I think about because I know that is the only way to keep living, to collect it so I can give it away once more..
Its a stupid problem to have.. it hurts me in a way that nothing else can. I constantly devalue myself and I can't stop.

It has drawn the life out of me.
All I can think about when I create now is,""How much $$$ can this make me?"" ""Will people like this enough to pay for it?"" ""Should I make things I don't like so people who do like it will give me money?"" ""Should I make this cheaper so its more appealing?""


And now when I pick up the pen and paper, I draw only blanks.
I guess that's a fitting punishment for trying to commercialize and cheapen something that should be a passion, not a job.

After losing my imagination.. I feel as though I've lost it all.
I don't dream anymore. I can't dance with my hoop because I end up doing the same few moves over and over as mind mind struggles to find something fresh.
The colors of the earth have lost their luster, and I find myself sinking into the same monotonous thought pattern as the rest of the dreary, gray business world..

I would go back to school, but I'd have to take out crazy loans, and I STILL don't know what I want to do for a career.
I was pressured into making a decision for college, blew my prepaid on Pastry School (Which I LOVED and miss dearly), now I've got a great portfolio, but no experience in the real world.
I haven't been able to find a job that didn't involve long shitty hours+shitty pay/ mass production of whatever (I'm sure my carpal tunnel would LOVE that), without experience.
Tried the college thing again, CNA school. 
Internship at the nursing home made me bawl my eyes out every night when I got home at the way they treat their residents.
Graduated, everyone in the class except one woman failed the licensing test.
Decided not to waste $150+ of my money, and worked waitressing instead for a year or two.
Now I'm here.

I have the most amazing boyfriend in the world, and  my friends and family are great.
But every time I try to talk about my depression it turns into, ""Why can't you just be happy? Just get over it. You have nothing to be sad about.""
But there are SO many reasons to be sad, so many reasons to care... they just have little or nothing to do with me. 
Now I wonder if I just plain CAN'T feel happiness anymore, or if I've forgotten maybe..
I haven't felt excited about anything or happy to do something.. not even a little.. in ages, I hate leaving the house because all I can think is ""I should be at home making money. If I'm not doing that, I'm worthless. I'm useless. I'm leeching from everyone around me and they hate it.""
So I fake another smile, steal someone else's expression so its appropriate to how I'm supposed to feel..

I really don't know where I'm going with this.
I just wanted to write it all out.. I've never taken depression meds, or even been diagnosed or treated, despite the fact that I'm the only one in my family who hasn't. I have nothing else to do but feel bad for myself, which makes me feel like even worse of a person, because my sadness is unjustified and selfish.

I should just get another fucking job so I can make some quick cash, work the 25-hour weeks so they don't have to give me insurance, and pretend I'm going to be able to afford retirement one day when my parents, who are as poor as I am, are long gone.. god I'm scared..

I guess you can say whatever you want at this point. maybe give me some pointers on how to not be such a self-loathing, leechy person.
I don't even know where all this self hate comes from anymore, its like mouth diarrhea. 
I want to be understood.
I wish I could get my boyfriend to read that hyperbole and half comic.(http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html)
 Maybe he would understand a little bit, but he admitted he doesn't really want to understand, he wants me to get better/over it. 
I feel like that's how everyone feels. Even me.
Not that it matters,
I don't feel much anymore. :(

1lxd6y,3,2013-09-07,"[Relationship Rant] Sometimes girls just confuse me, and when they don't, they confuse me even more.",throwitawayman1234,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lxd6y/relationship_rant_sometimes_girls_just_confuse_me/,"Some people I know know my reddit name so I'm going to be using a throwaway here. This may end up being a pretty long post, so if you got the time to read it, I would really, really appreciate it.

Theres this girl I like and possibly more than that, let's call her Sarah for the sake of anonymity and being able to refer to them by a name. Regardless, I met this girl in the beginning of the school year, and I didn't pay much notice to her. However, she became more outgoing around February, and I started to notice her a lot more, and by god was she amazing. This was the first girl I had really liked, so I was nervous and didn't know what to do. About a month later, a friend I have turned out to like Sarah, so I kinda backed off a bit. He never really tried anything, he wimped out quite a bit, but man did I want to ask her out. On the school trip, she asked me and a couple of friends who we liked, but my friend was there, so I couldn't really answer it with ""you"". I just said I didn't and left it at that. About a week later I asked my friend if he was cool with me trying to ask her out, and he said I could go for it. I asked her out with the words ""Do you wanna hang out sometime"" not realizing that this wasn't totally asking her out on a date. She said sure and we planned to go see The Internship. That was great, but I started to realize slowly that she didn't think of this as a date. I then straight up asked her over skype 'Will you be my girlfriend'. Sarah seemed really really flattered, but said no. Her reasoning was that we were going to be going to different high schools this year (We just graduated 8th grade) and she didn't want an internet only relationship since she had some issues with that in the past. I understood, but we still remained great friends. She's an awesome friend let me tell you.

This is where things get more complicated. Hold onto your hats kids. Over summer she said to me something along the lines of 'Do you want to have a kissing only FwB thing'. I turned this down since she really didn't seem to want a relationship, and she seems to have accepted that. I have some friends that I talked to and showed some conversations and they said that she clearly liked me a lot. We decided to hang out on Labor Day. We baked brownies and that was amazing, but when I managed to get her alone in my room, I managed to get my first kiss with her. Oh my god, that feeling will be remembered for a long time. We talked about it later, and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship. Sarah gave me some pretty good reasons here. The main ones being that she feels that with some emotions she's been having that it would just blow up in our faces and she didn't want to lose me as a friend. The other one is that she has feelings for this girl she knows over Skype who lives in the Netherlands. [Worth noting here that she is bisexual, she told me this after we'd been talking for a bit] This confuses me even more since she said she didn't want an internet only relationship. 

For around a week she kept talking about the kiss and how amazing it was and how she still is having a hard time believing it happened. I figured by this that she was fine with me possibly doing it again. Fuck was that a mistake. We were chilling yesterday and we were cuddling on the couch watching Netflix, and I tried but she pulled away. She said she felt that doing that would be making a decision so she didn't want to do it. I told Sarah I understood entirely and didn't mean to make her uncomftorable(spelling).

For about a week now I've been crying myself to sleep. I like this girl so damn much, but I know I can't be with her, but we still talk all the time and have fun together.  I feel like this is almost worse than breaking up. We both acknowledge the feelings are there but she has reasons against it. It just hurts sometimes.

Sorry for the long rant. I just needed to let it out. If anyone has any advice, it's appreciated. It's not necessary though. Thanks for reading. :)"
1lx8zo,2,2013-09-07,Hoping to Move in January - Any advice?,zombiegenocidejr,SouthFlorida,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/1lx8zo/hoping_to_move_in_january_any_advice/,"I'm a 23 year-old with a BFA in Graphic Design and 2 solid internships as well as a year of experience in PR and Marketing at a national brand. I'm looking to move to South Florida with my girlfriend - a Criminal Justice grad with a psych minor and about 6 months experience as an ABA counselor (works in a residential setting with Autistic pre-teens and teens). We both also have several years experience in retail and service industries.

We're looking for:
*Rent for 2 people for under $1000 per month (preferably with utilities)
*2 Parking Spaces
*Up to 2 hrs daily commute (1 hr each way) to work
*Easy beach access (maybe 20-30 minutes by bike)

I've vacationed in Hollywood Beach for all my life and I figured Broward and Dade county were good places to look for a reasonably priced apartment (relative to what I'd pay here in New England) and a pretty good job market. I've given consideration to Hollywood, Pompano Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, and Miami areas. A friend has suggested I check out West Palm Beach and Vero Beach. 

Do any of these places sound like a good fit based on this information? Is there anywhere else I should be looking? Please let me know if I've been unclear about anything.

*tl;dr* - Where in South Florida can my girlfriend and I find an affordable place to live and decent job opportunities? "
1lwt9r,21,2013-09-07,Virginia Tech Takes the MHacks Hackathon by Storm,hokiehackathon,VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1lwt9r/virginia_tech_takes_the_mhacks_hackathon_by_storm/,"I imagine many of you have at least heard of MHacks by now and my push to send a large number of students to this hackathon. We currently have 56 students signed up, which is exactly 1 charter bus of students. Normally a school would start pushing people into a wait list at this point, but considering that we went from 8 total students to filling a bus in 48 hours I have decided to push for a second bus. 

**So, what is MHacks?**

MHacks is a hackathon being held in Ann Arbor, Michigan for 36 hours spanning September 20 - 22. There will be over 1,200 students attending from around the world with a prize pool of more than $30,000. After the hackathon you will then have the opportunity to meet with recruiters from companies like Facebook and Github as well as many venture capitalists and start up incubators. 

**Why should I go to MHacks?**

If the idea of staying up for 36 hours straight (not required) with your friends working towards a common goal sounds exciting to you then you'll enjoy MHacks. If you love coding, developing with Arduino or Raspberry Pi, and the feeling of making something new you should go to MHacks. Finally, if you want to have the opportunity to network with students from around the world, have a chance at getting an internship or a job at one of the sponsoring companies, or you want to create your own business MHacks is for you.

**So, what is provided for attendees?**

Transportation, food, drinks, showers, and shelter (the hackathon location will have a sleeping area) are all provided with absolutely no charge to any attendees.

**I'm not registered for MHacks and they're sold out what do I do?**

Fear not! If you are on a bus heading to MHacks you are 100% guaranteed entry into the hackathon regardless of your current registration status.

**I have a friend at another university that would also like to go, can they travel on our bus?**

Yes! If you or a friend go to another university you can sign up for a spot on one of our buses. Our bus form only requires a .edu email address NOT a vt.edu or a VT student id. I realize that there might be students at other universities that cannot get transportation to MHacks and as such we have opened our buses for them! The only requirement is that the student provides their own transportation to get to Virginia Tech before the bus departs the morning of September 20th.

**Will I have to miss class for this?**

If you have classes on Friday beyond an 8 AM, then yes you probably will. I'd advise that you notify your professor(s) immediately and explain your situation. Most (unfortunately not all) professors should be understanding given nearly 2 weeks of notice.

**Ok, so where do I sign up?**

We have a facebook event page here: https://www.facebook.com/events/534213639984900/
Please sign up for the event to keep up with updates (VERY IMPORTANT!) and reserve your seat through the bus sign up form found on that page! The bus form is first-come, first-serve so there is a wait list and you want to sign up ASAP to guarantee that you will have a seat.

**If you have any questions post them below or on the event page and I will do my best to answer them.**

Thanks,

Ben Johnston

**EDIT:** I will be adding more Q&amp;A's as I think of them. 

**What is the wait list cut off?**

The cut off is about 110 students. We are currently wait listing students, if you have not received a ""Wait List Notification"" or a similar email then you are not on the wait list. If you are on the wait list I will update you as positions change and will send you an email once you are off of the wait list and have a seat. 

**Can graduate students attend?**

Graduate students will only be admitted on a case by case basis. Email either me (benjdj6@vt.edu) or Jouella (jojofabe@vt.edu) if you are a grad student wishing to attend.

**What do I need to bring?**

Laptop, charger, anything to keep you entertained on the bus, at least 1 change of clothing, toiletries, finally food and water for the bus (we may make a food stop yet to be decided).

**What is the purpose of the last box on the form?**

That is for you to list your teammates if one or all of your teammates do not have a ticket for MHacks already.

**How do teams work? Do I need to be in one?**

Teams are groups of 2-4 students that are working on the same project and are completely voluntary. In order to form a team you simply agree to work together, no paperwork involved!

**Where can I find teammates?**

Post on our event page for now if you're looking for a teammate. List what your skills are or if you have a project idea state what skills you require from your teammates. We will be making a more official format for finding teammates soon.

**How will I know if I have a seat?**

By September 14th we will be able to send out confirmation emails to all students that have a seat. Once you receive this email you will have 24 hours to RSVP. If you do not reply you will lose your seat!

**Where do I sleep?**

From what we've been told there should be air mattresses and other sleeping amenities so you should not be forced to sleep on the floor.

**When do we leave VT and when will we get back?**

The current plan is to leave around 11 AM September 20th, and to be back by 8-9 PM September 22nd. This is subject to change based on bus availability and of course traffic."

Most of the panel is not checking this any more, so if you want to talk to someone, shoot them a PM!** 

Hello /r/teenagers! We’re a bunch of people from /r/AskHistorians and we’d be happy to answer any questions you might have about how you can work with history. Want to know what an archaeologist actually does? Wondering what degrees will get you a job touching all the old stuff at the museum? Just looking for some proof for your parents that you can keep yourself fed with history degree before you go to college? It’s all free for the asking! 

You can address questions to one person in particular, to type of job, or to the panel at large, whatever you’d like. As you can see we have a global coalition of history here, so not all the panel will be here all at the same time, please be patient for your answers from particular people! 

**The Professional Historian:**

* **/u/itsallfolklore: Historian, USA:** For thirty years, I administered a state office dealing with historic preservation, advocating the preservation of historic buildings and archaeological sites. I also sat on numerous state and federal boards and committees and published ten books and dozens of articles until recently retiring. I currently serve as the executive director of a non-profit organization that works on historic preservation and archaeological projects. My degrees are in history and anthropology, but I emphasized folklore, studying in Europe and North America.

**The Jr High/High School History Teacher:** 

* **/u/HannibalElephant: Middle School Humanities Teacher, USA:** This will be my third year teaching public school, and my first year teaching 7th-8th graders. For the last two years, I was teaching 9-11th grade History. This year, I teach humanities, which means I teach geography, history, and writing, all in one wonderful class. I have my BA in History from the University of Colorado, Boulder, with plans to get my MA in Educational Management, to move on to an administrative role in a school, such as a principal or a dean. I am in my early-mid twenties, and I am single, and I love every day of my job.

**The History Professors:** 

* **/u/ProfessorRekal: Assistant Professor of American History, USA:** I teach a range of American and some European history courses at a small liberal arts college. My principal duties are teaching, preparing for lectures, advising students, participating in the community life of the college, and research and publishing on the my academic specialties (World War II, the Civil Rights Movement). I'm in my third year as a professor. Before that I taught at a big American public university as a graduate student. Like most full-time professors (and a lot of part-time instructors) I have a PhD., Master's, and Bachelor's degree. Before entering academia, I worked as a Director of Admissions at a boarding school. I'm a single guy in my mid-30's. Life is good. 

* **/u/Raaaghb: Assistant Professor, USA:** I am a history professor at a public research university in a Midwestern city. As a professor I spend about half of my time teaching courses and half of my time doing research and writing articles and books. I have a BA with majors in History and Geography, MA in Middle Eastern Studies, and a PhD in History. I'm in my mid-thirties, married, and we have no children.

* **/u/skedaddle: University Lecturer, UK.** There are two sides to my job: research &amp; teaching. During term time I spend most of the week writing lecturers, teaching classes, marking essays, meeting students, and doing administrative tasks. I spend the rest of my time doing original academic research. I work on the history of nineteenth century Britain and America, with a particular focus on journalism, jokes, and other forms of Victorian pop culture. This usually involves looking through archives (both physical and digital), analyzing evidence, reading the work of other historians, writing books and articles, preparing grant applications, speaking at conferences, and the occasional bit of media work. I've been published in several academic journals, written a piece for [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/08/chillax-emma-thompson-slang-english-language), and been interviewed by [The Times](http://www.digitalvictorianist.com/2011/12/the-jokes-of-christmas-past/). I have a BA in History, an MA in Victorian Studies, and a PhD in History. I'm 27, recently married, and I've been working as a lecturer for 18 months. In my spare time I play video games, walk, watch cricket, and feed my addiction to buying old newspapers on ebay. You can read more about me on [my blog](http://www.digitalvictorianist.com/), follow me on twitter (@DigiVictorian), or check out my profile on [AskHistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/skedaddle)!

**The Archaeologists**

* **/u/polkadot8: Archaeologist, Canada:** I work in the public sector of archaeology, doing cultural resource management. I am working in Alberta right now. At the current site that I am at, we are at a construction site where a new structure is going up. We are there to sort through everything that gets dug up by the construction workers, to see if there are any artifacts in the area. This is important to know, because there are many First Nations groups that have occupied the area. We want to know who has been there, and when. I am currently doing my Bachelor of Arts degree, and will be taking more courses in archaeology. I am 21 years old, and I hope to be doing this as my career for the rest of my life. 

* **/u/OneSourDude : Archaeological Field Technician, Canada:** My job is to survey areas of potential major construction (housing developments, highways, mining, renewable energy sources, etc.) to make sure there is nothing of historical importance that might be destroyed if construction takes place. If we find something of importance (either Native American or European settlers), we excavate it, recording all the information we can, so that construction can commence. I've been doing it for three years now, and I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from European farmsteads to Native American villages and more. I'm 24 and I have a BA in archaeology.

* **/u/shovelingtom: My official title is Historic Preservation Specialist, but my actual job is Archaeology Crew Lead, USA:** There is no truly typical day for an archaeologist.  One day I might be constructing [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) maps for analysis of site location patterns.  Another might involve running a crew that is conducting a [Phase I](http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/review/field_standards_terrestrial_phase_I_surveys.aspx) shovel test survey to locate unknown archaeological sites.  At known sites, I may be conducting [Phase II](http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/review/phase_II_investigation_field_standards.aspx) excavations in order to assess whether a site is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.  A general rule of thumb is that I spend at least three days of office time for every one day on a site.  Much of this time is spent washing, sorting, cataloging and analyzing artifacts.  After all of the lab work is completed I'll take the rest of my office time to write a comprehensive report on the survey or excavation. I have a BA in anthropology and an MA in applied anthropology (and am one of the moderators of the /r/anthropology subreddit!). I am 34, male, and married to another archaeologist.

**The Museum Pros:** 

* **/u/butforevernow: Assistant Curator, Australia:** I work in a small regional art gallery, basically as the gallery curator's right-hand woman. On any given day, my job could involve managing the permanent collection (changing the displays, rotating the works, looking for anything that might need to go to conservation), assessing new or potential acquisitions, giving tours and talks, researching for upcoming exhibits, publications or new works, working with the education and marketing officers on programs (we get a lot of school groups), looking after interns, updating our website... in a bigger gallery, these jobs would be divided into many more separate roles, but because we're small we do it all! I've been in this role for 1.5 years and it's a step up from an entry level position - I worked for two years as a Curatorial Assistant, and before that I did internships at a couple of different galleries + museums. I have a BA in Art History and am working on my Master's, and I'm 27. 

* **/u/hiphiphip0 Contemporary Art History Curator/Researcher US/UK:**  I research and exhibit contemporary art for a living. Contemporary art is a huge field that envelops a lot of different types of art forms. So, like most researchers and curators I had to pick one particular aspect of it.  I chose to specialize in New Media Art.  New Media Art is a genre that encompasses artworks created via new media technologies through practice, process and presentation.  It includes most traditional forms of art (performance, sculpture, painting etc.) and also embraces more contemporary ones such as computer graphics and animation, virtual and augmented reality, internet art, interactive installations, video games, robotics and biotechnology. I am currently a PhD candidate in the UK where I research these artworks full time. My PhD is fully funded. I also student teach and I am still payed to curate shows around new media art, which I do in the UK, the US and the EU.  I teach and curate part-time.  Before I went back to school I worked at a non-profit art gallery (co-director and co-curator) and an arts festival (assistant to the director) in a major US city. I did this for 7 years.  I have a BA in Studio Arts (Sculpture and Photography) and a MA in Art History.

1lwizr,0,2013-09-07,Being a Nice Guy,[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1lwizr/being_a_nice_guy/,"By giving these men the label Nice Guy, I'm not so much referring to their actual behavior, but to their core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to 
believe that if they are ""nice,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.  

The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:  

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest.  

Nice Guys are secretive.Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that 
they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the 
evidence.""  
  

Nice Guys are compartmentalized.Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of 
information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. 
Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had 
an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.  
  

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and 
have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. 
Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.  
  

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates 
a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.  
  

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has 
unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of 
reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc.   
  
Nice Guys often report feeling 
frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.
  
  
Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in 
indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not 
following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same 
annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.
  
  
Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of 
frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage 
tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.
  
  
Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or 
medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. 
One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.
  
  
Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" 
or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the 
problems they are experiencing.
  
  
Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors 
actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.
  
  
Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing.This behavior is often the 
result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. 
Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time 
putting out fires and managing crises.
  
  
Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships.Though Nice Guys often put 
tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of 
struggle and frustration. For example:
l  Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend 
themselves or fix the other person's problem.
l  Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all 
the way through a problem.
l  It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be 
""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice 
Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.
  
  
Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have 
yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or 
maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, 
pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).
  
  
Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been 
talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to 
their full potential.  
  
Unfortunately, every fucking single one of these describes me.

1lwdn7,8,2013-09-07,So tired and stressed.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1lwdn7/so_tired_and_stressed/,"Not expecting anyone to pay attention to this but I just feel like venting. 
It seems like every time I think things are going to turn around and be ok, something else comes up. About a year ago I started getting gall attacks and ended up going to the ER twice in the same week. Since I had no insurance I ended up with a bill that was about $5,000. I recently managed to save enough to pay off a settlement offer that was just under $3000. I still have about $700 to go for a few tests and crap though. I no longer have any money saved and I'm barely making it with what I get paid but to be honest I was relieved that this big bill was taken care of. But recently a school debt caught up to me and it's accumulated interest so it's up to $7000. If you're reading this you're probably thinking I'm very irresponsible, and maybe I am, I don't know. A few years ago I was left with no option but to enroll in a medical course otherwise I would've been kicked from home. I reluctantly signed up and had to get a few loans. I completed the course and took up an internship position at a clinic. I loved working there but once my internship was over, they didn't have the funds to employ me. I went back to school but they refused to help me with work placement even though they had said that was part of their job. I failed to come up with anything else for about a year and finally found work as a caregiver. I don't make much especially now that my work hours have been cut but I'm still stuck with this $7000 bill. Soon my employer will be going to mexico for six months so i wont have any money coming in. I'm just stressing out and havent slept in three days since i cant stop thinking about this. I honestly don't know what to do."

Thought about making a throwaway but for some reason I hate that idea. Eh.

I live with my parents. So does my brother, who is also out of college. I've had jobs and internships and moved away for a few months at a time but never really got my own place. Now I'm back, unemployed (just lost my local part-time job a month ago) and facing the same eternal dilemma: I can't get a job until I feel better, can't move out until I have a job, and won't get better until I move out. My relationship with my parents is pretty toxic (and a major part of why I hate my life right now), and it's not likely to improve until I leave. In fact, neither me nor my life will get better until I leave. Finally decided to just move out and finances be damned -- but now I'm back to an even worse catch-22 that I've been trying to avoid.

None of my friends needs a roommate. I'm stuck figuring out which would be worse: living alone (no no no) or living with stangers (dear jesus no). At times I've had people I know agree to be my roommate but when I actually start talking about looking for apartments they back out, which has of course made me even more paranoid and self-hating. I've put messages out to all my friends, and all their friends. I will move to Singapore, to Moscow, to fucking Antarctica if someone I know needs a roommate down there. I just *need to get out*. I need to get out and I have nowhere to go. (And you know every time I think that my brain loves to respond, ""you know a way you'd never have to worry about having nowhere to go ever again? If you were dead!"")

Last week I had a friend say he wanted to move out ASAP too. I told him, I'm looking for immediately, urgently, like right now, and he agreed. This week he told me he meant as soon as he finds a job in the area he wants to move to. Who knows when that will be.

So yeah I think this might be what despair feels like."

1lvxpu,1,2013-09-06,Unprofessionalism is a bitch.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lvxpu/unprofessionalism_is_a_bitch/,"I'm underemployed right now, trying desperately to find a job so I can finally move out of my parents' house.

After a year of working an internship, I finally had enough office experience to have a pretty attractive resume. So all at once, in a flurry of good fortune, I received two interviews in the same week for office-related work.

The first place told me that I was the top candidate and that they'd let me know when they were done with interviews, by today, but that they were very impressed and wanted to hire me on the spot if they could.

The second place, which happens to be a company I already work for part-time in a non-professional capacity, called me yesterday and said they were willing to offer me a trial/temporary position to test me out.

I was ecstatic about that, but I told them that I was still waiting to hear back from another position, and I'd let them know by today if I could commit 100%.

The first place emails me today saying that something unexpected happened at the last minute and that they offered the position to someone else.

So I emailed the company I'm already working for to let them know what happened, and they don't reply for several hours. So I decide to give them a call, and they tell me, ashamedly, that they needed someone as soon as possible, so they already filled the position today.

Both of you, if you're reading this:

DON'T FUCKING OFFER SOMEONE A POSITION IF YOU CAN'T COMMIT TO IT OR IF THERE IS A CHANCE YOU'LL FLIP ON ME AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE AT THE LAST MINUTE. DO YOU FUCKING KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING THAT IS FOR SOMEONE WHO IS OUT OF WORK OR UNDEREMPLOYED?

AND IF YOU NEED TO FILL A POSITION IMMEDIATELY AND DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT A DAY, FUCKING TELL ME THAT SO I CAN ACT ON IT, ASSHOLES."
1lzq4x,1,2013-09-08,Roommates.,[deleted],Complain,https://www.reddit.com/r/Complain/comments/1lzq4x/roommates/,"I'm going to break this down into a couple of different stories without a lot of back story because if I don't it's going to be ridiculously long and my life isn't THAT interesting.

1. Last summer my roommate (wasn't at the time) was obsessed with this guy. They were banging, but it was clear that he just wanted to bang and she REALLY wanted a relationship. She was obsessed. She is an idiot and doesn't use condoms most of the time. She's on birth control but has serious issues actually taking it everyday at the same time. So, that happens.
2. Now we're roommates. She goes to a Christmas party and get absolutely ridiculous drunk. I end up having to go get her and she's balling her eyes out and I can't really figure out why. I'm with my boyfriend, we get her up to her bed, he goes to the living room and I sit on the bed with her. We'd gotten into a fight earlier that night because she was already plastered when I dropped her off at this party. When she's drunk she likes to text the kid she'd been obsessed with the over the summer. So, I'm kind of trying to figure out what's wrong and she starts telling me I haven't been there for her and all this stuff. Now, I'd been in 18 hours of classes and working basically full time all semester while having a boyfriend and actually hanging out with her a lot so I didn't really know what she was talking about. Finally she says that she was pregnant with obsession kid's baby and had an abortion - via the abortion pill - back in November. Didn't tell me. And now she's sitting her trying to make me feel bad for not being there for her. Bitch.
3. I don't think she had said abortion/was pregnant. I watched her take like 16 negative pregnancy tests. She went to the doctor. That was negative. THE ONLY PERSON WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS PREGNANT WAS A PSYCHIC. She didn't have any of the normal signs of pregnancy. I know people can have false negatives and all that. I know some people don't show signs of pregnancy. But, still. Too many things pointing to she wasn't pregnant. Also the weekend she supposedly took the pill she was drunk allllllllllllllll weekend. Maybe you can drink after taking that pill. I don't know. But somehow I think it's HIGHLY recommended you don't. 

Things like this happen quite often, but on a smaller scale. She gets REALLY angry at any guy she is talking to or dating for THE SMALLEST OF THINGS. He doesn't text her back and she knows he isn't doing anything? ANGRY TWEET SESSION COMMENCE. 

4. So, this summer she starts dating this guy she works with. He is doing his internship here and is gonna move back to Florida in August. She's completely aware of this when they start dating. One week in and they're gonna get married according to her. After like 2/3 weeks they have talked about helping move him back to Florida. He makes sure they ALWAYS use a condom because he's a good kid. One night she basically forces him to not and the next days he's breaks up with her. Because she said she wouldn't have an abortion if she ended up pregnant and he was all NO KIDS FOR ME WHEN I'M 21 THANKS.
5. They get back together a week later.
6. She's still fucking crazy.
7. He dumps her.
8. A week later she tells him she thinks she's pregnant.
9. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT. BUT HE'S A GOOD KID SO HE BELIEVES HER. They go to the doctor. She's isn't. Duh. He's all peace out you crazy bitch and doesn't talk to her again. He moved back the last week of August.
10. Let's recap. This relationship lasted a TOTAL of about five weeks. And my roommate is balling her eyes out all the fucking time because he was the one and he dumped her and oh my god my future husband left me.

In between Christmas and this boyfriend she had two other guys she kinda dated, nothing really came of it and everything was fine. There was one guy who she actually really like and I was a huge fan of him because he made her more sane. But he was picking between my roommate and another girl - he chose the other girl. They broke up. My roommate and her boyfriend broke up. Fast forward to now and she ""still isn't over"" her boyfriend and this other kid is trying really hard to help her and stuff but she refuses to give a crap about him and I feel really bad for him.

So, there's all that.

Also, ""we"" have a dog. It's pretty much her dog, I'm certainly not taking her when I graduate and move away, my roommate knows that. But seriously, she does not take care of this dog. She thinks napping with her is spending time with her. Refuses to take her to the dog park unless someone else is going with her. Decided paying for doggy day care would be better. Even though she has plenty of time to go to the dog park, she sleep instead. I don't know how to be like, HEY TAKE CARE OF YOUR DOG OR I'M SELLING HER.

Also, she leaves the AC on full blast literally all the time. I get it. It's hot. The dog is here during the day so we can't turn it off. But turn it up so it's not so goddamn expensive. I do this. But I'm not around much so it doesn't take a huge dent off our bill. 

Basically, my roommate annoys the crap out of me and I need to bitch.
Thanks for listening."
1lzo7n,7,2013-09-08,"Do I abandon ship, or compromise severely?",HansBricker,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1lzo7n/do_i_abandon_ship_or_compromise_severely/,"*throwaway account for obvious reasons*

The headline is a little bit simplistic, but I suppose that is the core conundrum.

First, let us introduce the the context.

I used to intern for a well known comedy theater company in an European city. With them, I carved out a unique position for myself: I produced, wrote, directed and edited zero-budget videos that would advertise their upcoming shows and more. Through favors, and friends, I created work that looks and sounds professional and I am quite proud of. 

It was a fruitful relationship as they had a hungry filmmaker eager to create, and I had their connections and audience, even allowing me to parlay my work onto as a television ad (for their show) for a month. It was very exciting and though I had some regular intern type duties as well, I ingrained well with them and we left on a very positive note. It was also, I should mention, a paid internship. Not much, a couple hundred a month, but still valuable.  

In fact, my exit interview including an offer for a bunch commissioned work, most of which I have already slogged through. A lot of it editing things here and there but not nothing.

As such I have maintained a decent relationship with them. However, now with my latest and seemingly biggest piece of work to date coming up, I am struggling with the value of what I am putting together.

Simply put I accepted to create video content for a haunted house type show. My original proposed budget of €6,500 got shot down. €2,000 is their limit. 

Their allocated budget of 2K for video is part of a much larger chunk which is going towards the whole Haunted House experience itself. 2K is video, the rest is the rest.

When I negotiated with them the fee for my music and sound guys, I was under the impression that the €800 we agreed upon would be taken from the ""rest"" budget pile since they will also be producing sound for the ""show"" itself.  Now I am told only €200 will be part of the rest, the other €500 is taken from our 2K.

We managed to negotiate an amazing fee of €900 for a RED Epic as well as a lighting kit through friends. €900 + €500 = €1,400

We are now left with €600. 

Though we were told catering would be covered by them, they now consider it still to be taken from the 2K. Catering is about €300 for two days, Transportation €220. That's €520.

I am now left with €80, and nobody gets paid anything, including me. Already I was asking for my cinematographer, producer, and others to do this as a portfolio project, something I didn't want to do in the first place. The only thing that quelled my soul doing so was that I believed we were truly going to make something ""worth"" a portfolio piece and it's guaranteed to get a decent amount of exposure. (e.g. press premiere etc.) 

I know I can't do the shoot we planned on doing for €600 let alone €80. 

I feel I am left with two big tough choices. 

B) Toss the storyboards, script and hours we've already put into it and start over. Kill our darlings. Abandon renting the RED, shoot on DSLRs and completely revamp and rewrite the project as a one day shoot and be ready to go by our original shoot day, which is in about two weeks.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I was originally going to ask for an €800 fee for writing, directing, editing and producing peripheral material for elsewhere in the Haunted House. Now it is clear that whatever fee I request it is coming directly from the 2K budget. 

A) bandon ship and use the energy and people I have on doing something for ourselves directly. It seems like the only way I can create a video I think is worth creating at this stage is if I eat my fee. 

However, I have other projects lined up I have an committed producer for a web-series I am writing and will be directing.  That same producer is also keen on helping me get some short films made, and I have a crew interested in putting their time into that as well.

These will not be paid, but the web-series alone will seemingly have an actual working budget of around 20K, and possibly more as we find more investors. I also have a potentially paid writing gig for a separate web-series as well. My point with all this is that I don't seemingly *need* this project to get my foot in door, nor do I need to initial investment to make something since i can find that elsewhere. 

Since I can't make the project I want to make in any sense of what was developed is it worth it to develop a ""high profile"" piece, locked down to the parameters of a Haunted House video, that provides no pay, on a shoe-string budget and not necessarily what my crew and I want to do?

Or should I suck it up. Take €500 for myself, coerce a crew to do the rest for ""exposure"" and their ""portfolio"" for what is essentially a commercial product, and create a much more simplified ""scary"" short. 

Or, most insidious, keep even more for myself and create a bunch of *creepy* videos using archival footage (as what has been occasionally suggested by the boss man commissioning the whole shebang).

TL;DR:
I am being asked to create a commercial piece of work for €2000 not including my fee, should I do it? "

Any words of advice into landing my first networking position? I'm a full time student at the moment, so unfortunately I cannot handle a full-time job. I would really enjoy working now though and not waiting for the summer.

So, I would LOVE some help figuring out:

1) Where the HELL can I find nice, reasonable, plus-sized professional wear THAT IS NOT MATRONLY (I am only 25, and find that most plus-sized professional clothing is made to suit people 20 years older than me - which would be awesome if I were 20 years older).

2) What KINDS of clothes should I consider for a cold climate?  I heard someone say snowboots, but most of them I find look like I need to go duck huntin'.

The first week is done, or nearly done if you still have to tackle your task. I just finished mine and want to share the toughts that popped up in my mind this week.  
Since it was just one task difficulty was low and I managed to act every day without procrastination on my mission, focusing 90min on my musical projects.  
On Friday i came home very late from university and I was nagged by thoughts like: ""Just do two units tomorrow and skip it"" , ""not this evening your tired and can't cnoncentrate anyway"", etc...    
But knowing about all of you going through the challenge with me there was no way in skipping my job. That was the point I realised how much we can benefit from taking challenges together. It really motivates knowing about others doing the same stuff even if I never met anyone, and probably never will consciously. The internet really peaks in matters of advantage here. Did you have any similar experiences?  
Second thing is: 90mins are a lot of time. It happend that I have an internship at university and need to work from 9am to 6pm. When i created the challenge I wanted  to add another 90mins in the second week but now I think it's too much. So my new challenge is very simple : drinking one big glass of water every morning after waking up. Summed up my challenge for week two is:  
  
    
* 90mins of focused work on music projects
* drink a big glass of water right after waking up   
    
Another thing is that someone asked me what to do when he/she failed on one day and as a result **I will expand the rules, if you fail one or more days you do the following** :  
  
* First: resist to beat yourself down. It's scientific proof that beating oneself down in a willpower or discipline affair you end up continuing to fail, though you are more likely to succeed if you're kind to yourself.  
  
* Second : stay on track. I can't force you, but I assume you want to increase your discipline.  
  
* Third : Don't increase your mission counter. If you failed in week one you keep doing the same thing in week two without adding more missions.  
  

And that's it. If this is encouraging someone to fail, something is gone very wrong but I hope this helps people to stick to our mission.  
That's it from my side and I'm keen what your experiences are, share them in the comments together with your new mission and  I encourage all of you to stay on track and benefit as much as you can from this challenge.    

Furthermore for those who want to join,
[look at this thread for the rules.](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1limyv/challenge_8_weeks_for_more_selfdiscipline/)  
Just one topic if you're joining now: Don't start with 2 tasks, just start by one and increase weekly when you succeded every day. You end up with one less then those started in the first week but, who cares.  
  
So far. Remember to share your views in the comments.  

**tl;dr** : Read the whole text to train your discipline and concentration.  "
1lyrls,3,2013-09-08,[Help] Is this anxiety? What's wrong with me?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lyrls/help_is_this_anxiety_whats_wrong_with_me/,"Hi everyone. I've been having some problems and I know there are many knowledgeable people on this sub, so I hope someone can help to shed some light on my problems for me. I really appreciate any insight anyone has to offer, and I want to thank you upfront for even taking the time to at least read the following.

**1 - Background**

First of all, my background. I believe I've had mental health problems my entire life for various reasons (eg, long history of physical and psychological child abuse unto me), but for the most part, I've been able to cope with them just fine. To an outsider, I probably appear to be a well-adjusted, successful person. I excelled in college and went straight to a top law school, where I did well at least in terms of getting valuable internships. It's easy for me to talk to people and make friends. I have a great girlfriend who's just a terrific person.

But under the surface, I was suffering (the symptoms of which I'll describe later). So I decided to go to my university's (of my law school) counseling office for help. I had a few sessions and was eventually prescribed lexapro and klonopin. 

For various reasons, probably chiefly that I really don't like law (or law school) and because of the state of my mental health, I took a leave-of-absence from law school and returned to my parents' house, where I am right now.

**2 - Why I'm going to reddit instead of to my doctor**

I actually *do* see my doctor for these problems, but I haven't ever been completely forthcoming with him. Why? Because I'm afraid the symptoms I have are those of a crazy person and I don't want the doctor to just dismiss me as a loon who needs to be drugged, or as someone who needs to be institutionalized. So I figured here on reddit, under the veil of anonymity, I can finally be totally forthcoming without fearing repercussions or feeling embarrassed.

I'm an analytical person and I don't want to just be given some drug. I want to have a full understanding of why my brain is operating the way it is (because I know it's not operating appropriately).

**3 - Problems**

So here are the problems I told my doctor about:

- I get really irritated at literally everything. I'm not a violent person by any means, but I feel like I'm seconds away from snapping if something rubs me the wrong way.
- I don't give a shit about anything. I mean I really just don't feel anything. If my father died tomorrow, I probably would just start thinking about the hassle of dealing with the funeral, etc. If I got a $1,000,000 check in the mail, I'd probably just say ""meh,"" and go back to browsing the internet. Doing *stuff* feels like a chore. I just want to lay in bed and sleep all day.
- Speaking of which, the only thing that really brings me any pleasure whatsoever is sleeping. And in addition to that, smoking or drinking.
- I feel like everyone is watching me. And I feel like everyone who knows me is thinking negative things about me or laughing at me. I feel like I can read the thoughts of other people and I get the sense that they're scrutinizing me.

OK, so here are the problems I *didn't* tell my doctor:

- I constantly have fantasies of brutally attacking or killing people. I mean maiming them, like curbstomping them, or torturing them, like tying them down and slowly cutting them to death. No one in specific, and I've never taken any sort of action to bring these to fruition, but still. 
- Sometimes I get so mad it brings me to the brink of violence. For eg, one night my girlfriend said something (completely benign by the way), and I just suddenly got so mad that I felt my arms quivering as if I were about to reach over and start strangling her. The feeling of rage almost overwhelmed me.
- I always feel like I'm on the verge of being attacked. All the time. It's hard to describe, but imagine you're in a dark alley and you are completely sure a mugger is following you. This is the feeling i have, but everywhere I go, and even in the safety of my own home.
- I always feel bad late at night before bed. It's hard to describe, but imagine you're sick with a bad flu and you've just received a cancer diagnosis. There's this sort of 'all-over' feeling of ""bad"" in addition to being mentally defeated/fatigued. Honestly, it kind of makes me think about killing myself just to get rid of the ""bad"" feeling. I'm sorry I'm describing it in such abstract terms but it's a very vague sensation and difficult to put into words. 

**4 - caveat**

I really want to fix my brain. I've tried all sorts of various techniques (eg, meditation, focusing on proper breathing, forcing myself to look at things in a positive light, trying to just chill-out if something gets to me). But nothing's really worked all that much.

I've never hurt anyone, physically (literally, I really haven't). But here's the thing - as I insinuated above - I feel like I'm always on the brink of doing it. Just the other day, someone on the road made me mad and so I followed him for a quarter mile, blaring my car horn the entire time. The rest of the day, all I could do was fantasize about carrying a lead pipe in my car so I could have rammed his car off the road, pulled him out, and bash his face in.

So ... yeah, I realize that these sorts of thoughts are completely abnormal and unhealthy. But the thing is, they intrude into my thought pattern almost no matter what. 

I've never harmed my girlfriend either physically or psychologically. I can say that in complete truth. But as I mentioned above, I at times have had the thought of doing it, and it really troubles me since it's not right to have those thoughts.

**5 - conclusion**

So that's the long and short of it. I'll answer any questions anyone has. And I really will consider any advice you all have, so please, feel free to be candid with me. Thanks again."

I have no idea what this guy is thinking! I met him when I started working 4 years ago (internship of a few months) and he was my coworker, we hung up all the time and I am very grateful to him for helping me a lot during my internship. We lost contact except some emails for new year. At that time I thought he was kind of the ""forever alone"" type but he was very funny and smart.  
  


This year he visited my city for work, so I made him visit the city in the weekend, it was fun to catch up with him after so long!

After that things became weird... he began to send me very long and awkward emails. I answered shortly saying : can't he download a chat application, I don't like writing long emails, but he said no.  

  Selected extracts :    
""I send you several photos of my visit to your country, visiting with you : unforgettable, I have all the memories engraved, we do that again when you want ;)""
""also I send you 3 pictures that represent my hobbies : biking, music etc[...]""

I thought... ooh ok he is very enthousiastic! Then :

""Hmm maybe my last mail was a little inappropriate, maybe it is too hot here, I wanted to say I had a really good time and I would like to see you again. Do you plan to stay here long? I also liked this that ...[...]""

""I am very tired my doctor said I had chronic tireness""

""can we skype soon for [something we talked, he wants to hear about my job because he is unemployed and looking], I set up a date in the calendar""

""are you ok for this date? did you receive my call?""

There are much more!! I stopped answering but it keeps coming ...

:( I feel bad not answering to him because I thought he was a fun guy but these emails are really really weird for me and I don't know what to do!! I really don't want to skype with him for the moment... what should I do??

Also I have a boyfriend, and I leave thousands of kilometers away from this guy.

Thank you!

1ly3ju,4,2013-09-07,"Facing serious anxiety for the first time, I think I need advice",SoManyMilesAway,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ly3ju/facing_serious_anxiety_for_the_first_time_i_think/,"I recently graduated college where I was very comfortable, had many friends, and was very successful. College was easy and very enjoyable for me, I understood college and had little responsibility outside class and a part time job. You could say that I was a very social person who rarely missed out on a weekend of fun. I was always a huge procrastinator but was able to maintain a high GPA and relatively low stress, relying on my intelligence and ability to present myself well. 

I took an internship after graduation this summer with a very successful company and they recently hired me on full time, the catch being I had to relocate to the Twin Cities from another large Midwest city. It is a very good job, earning $70,000 a year, impossible to pass up for someone straight out of college. I do not know anyone in the Twin Cities and my job has be working from home without any direct supervision so I do not have very much communication during the day outside of calling on clients. 

Ive never been completely alone in my entire life, I've always had a least one friend who I've been able to lean on. I don't have that now and I think that may be the catalyst for my anxiety. I've always had friends or been in a situation that has allowed me to make friends. I am not in that kind of situation right now, I don't even have ""coworkers"" that I can go get drinks with after work.

I also am just bombarded with work but I am shutting down. I find myself feeling unprepared to enter this new stage of my life, which has led me to just procrastinating all day. I am definitely under performing in my job and am scared my supervisor will figure me out soon. Everyday I tell myself to suck it up and get work done but I'm just not able to do it and constantly get distracted. I just do everything I can to avoid being productive. I constantly have a sick feeling in my stomach. And my anxiety is getting worse with each day.

I am not sure if my anxiety is coming from my work procrastination (I've always had a degree of ADD and struggle to concentrate on things) and I need to resort to a ADD medication such as Adderall to keep myself on task or if my anxiety is causing my procrastination and I need to seek help professionally. My brother suffers from social anxiety and temporally had to drop out of college because it got so bad for him. I am scared the same thing is happening to me. He has learned to work with his anxiety due to my mother's amazing support and some very high quality therapy work. 

I know the best thing I can do is to tell my Mom I'm struggling because I know she'll support me and help me get through this but every time I come close to telling her I can't. Shes already had to deal with so much with my brother and things are finally getting better with him. How can I dump this on her now. I'm supposed to be the son who has everything going for him, the one she doesn't need to worry about. I cant tell her because I'm embarrassed what she'll think of me, I'm embarrassed what my Dad will think and I'm embarrassed what my brother will think. Everyone has this perception that I have control over my life and I feel pathetic that I don't.

I just want this feeling of anxiety to go away. Being new to this feeling I'm just trying to get advice from people who have experience with anxiety. I'm not even sure if that all made any sense but its all I could get out right now and I cant bring myself to reread it. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me."

1m1ruy,1,2013-09-09,W.D. Question! First post in /r/Opiates!,[deleted],opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1m1ruy/wd_question_first_post_in_ropiates/,"Hello fellow nodders,
This is my first post here, i've been a lurker for a little while now. My question is this: What kind of withdrawal symptoms do you think I am going to experience....

I started using 30 mg oxy (blues) last spring here at college. One would do me over pretty good and it wasnt too bad of a habit. Towards the end of the semester I would be snorting one (sometimes two) a couple days a week. 
When summer rolled around I was lucky to receive an internship in my home city. I didnt have to pay for rent (since I was living at home) and most of my expenses like food were paid for. So my paychecks from this internship went strictly to blues. I would say over the course of the summer I was using about 90mg a day or every other day.
When I came back to school this fall my friend/dealer stopped selling blues and offered up fentanyl powder instead. He said this would help curb and withdrawals I would have from the oxy. 
Now obviously this isnt pure fent, my friend told me it was cut with suger or some other type of filler, but I have been doing about .1 of this a day or every other day.
My last dose of fent powder was Friday and Saturday I was fortunate enough to get an Opana 15 which I snorted. This held me over for about a day. 
When I dont get any fent/opana/oxy after about 48 hours I start to feel really tired, lethargic, anxious, just overall not good.

So finally my question is: after all of this over the past few months, how severe do you think my WDs will be if I stopped cold turkey? Do you think I should try to find a sub strip? Or would that even be necessary?

I look forward to hearing your responses!"
1m1i83,3,2013-09-09,"I [23M] am in a tough spot in my life, and my girlfriend [21F] has doubts about my progress. Need advice on the future of our relationship.",x7381,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m1i83/i_23m_am_in_a_tough_spot_in_my_life_and_my/,"Throwaway account. I have most of my situation figured out, in that it's very clear to me what I need to do, but I want advice from this community anyway. I'll try my best to keep the details short, so please ask plenty of clarifying questions.

*Background*: My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost one year. We met in college when I was senior and she was a junior. She is on a paid internship with a major pharmaceutical company in another part of the state I live in. I currently live at home and work in a part-time retail job as an assistant coach for the high school I went to.

---

Here's the sparknotes of our situation:

I have struggled with an eating disorder, anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts over the past four years that have limited my success. 

I met a girl at the beginning of my senior year, we fall in love.

I failed out of college 9 months later.

Girlfriend is successful.

I need to go back to finish my degree; in a point of transition.

My intent has not been backed by action. Partly circumstance, partly my fault.

Girlfriend sees this, doesn't feel as in love with me as she used to.

She says the distance between us has brought out these issues.

Other minor issues between us like the social faux pas I commit.

She says ""I am all talk,"" that she needs to see the progress, that I have all these great plans, but I don't execute them, et cetera.

In her own words: 

&gt; ""At some point in the last two weeks I feel like I removed myself from you, I don't know why. It might be because I don't like feeling sad when we're apart and I want to protect myself from that feeling, or because I'm at a point where there are so many opportunities ahead of me and I don't know where my life will take me and I'm afraid that I'll end up somewhere where we aren't together and I don't want that to hurt me either. So instead of accepting the fact that the future is uncertain but I can still live my life the way I want now I'm building up my defenses for the future.""

&gt; ""To answer the question you always ask me, there are things I don't like about you. I don't like how extreme you are in certain cases. I don't like when you don't know how to act in a social situation. I don't like when your actions don't match your words. However you are the only man that has ever gotten me to open up as much as I have with you. You are a guy who I feel like I can have a fight with but work it out and be ok. You don't make me feel bad about myself. You value a lot of the same things I do, and I think that the person I want to be is the person you want me to be also. I know that there is no person in the world that is perfect, but I think it's important that you can identify what is important and what isn't. I think that the things I love about you are the important things. I do think about what it would be like to be with someone else, someone who's different, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be with you, and sometimes I have a hard time with that. [My name] I love you and I miss you...""

---

How do I tell her that improving my situation is not entirely under my control, that I can't make companies hire me? 

How can I reassure her that I am now doing everything I can in spite of my struggles and lack of progress? 

How should I explain to her that this is difficult and that none of it is intentional?

She said she doesn't want to set any kind of hard deadline, but she says she can't wait much longer for me to come around. 

What kind of deadline should I set for myself? 

If it means the end of our relationship, how should I handle it?


**tl;dr**: I have some personal issues that have limited my success and are now affecting my relationship. What should I do (or not do) to save my relationship?

1m15xp,219,2013-09-09,Please be careful regarding Lol-Class and other coaching sites.,natelikewhoa,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1m15xp/please_be_careful_regarding_lolclass_and_other/,"Hey all. I've seen a couple threads and heard some feedback from friends about Lol-Class and other coaching sites, so I thought I'd weigh in.

I'm not trying to be super negative, but I just want people who may be a bit more naive when it comes to the internet and businesses in general to understand the reality of coaching sites and lessons.

--&gt; There is no concrete system backing up your transactions.

What I mean by this is that there is no accessible (read: cost-benefit net positive) legal system or regulatory body directly enforcing your transactions. Technically when you engage in e-commerce with a business there are legal actions you can take via your local courts/their courts, but let's just leave it at this: It will never be worth your time.
Unless you recover your funds through community outrage/customer service, it is unlikely you will have a recourse/remedy.

--&gt; These sites are not invested in heavily, nor are they accountable.

Lol-Class and many others like it before have lots of pro names on the site, ""partnerships,"" sponsors, etc.  Think about this: There is no primary company here. This is not ""CLG Lol-Class"" or ""CRS Lol-Class."" The pros are not beholden to this site.

If they fuck up, the worst thing that will happen is that their manager, or the admin for the site might angrily skype or text them. It is not their priority, and it will not ever be so. Don't expect this to be a situation where a business is at the mercy of the consumer, and will operate above board at all times.

If ""major"" online/scene-based organizations/businesses like WCG, ESL, Own3d, and many many others will fail to follow through on payments or services, then there should be no surprise when a fledgling coaching site does so.

--&gt; The Income-Reliability paradigm, and why it matters to you.

An important aspect of e-sports and internet endeavors in general is the idea of an Income-Reliability paradigm.

Think about when you visit a brick and mortar (meaning IRL concrete location for a business) outlet or facility. These places have responsibilities, from local government ordinances to federal tax and employee benefit laws to deal with.

Thus, these businesses have to hire people according to the level of the business's income that they feel will fulfill the Income-Reliability paradigm. Even a McDonald's store will hire decently capable and intelligent managers because of the income potential for the store. These people are reliable, mature, etc.

Now consider an internet coaching site for one of many competitive video games. As this is a fledgling industry, this site will never captivate a qualified business professional's full attention, nor will it have an inherent guaranteed reliability, due to the lack of actualized income.

Even if a lesson fills up every 2 days, and the income gross is $1,000 to the site, the split of this money is still meager. To a recent college grad, young intern, or low-status web developer, this may be an appealing part-time job, but most of the income and interest is derived from the interest in being a part of the ""scene.""

Simply put, there isn't enough money in coaching league of legends through a website to make someone really accountable to the level of reliability and maturity you'd want from someone taking in your money.

--&gt; Full Disclosure:

I've personally experienced problems from both the consumer side of these situations, -and- the coach/instructor/business side.

In the SC:BW/SC2 community I had firsthand knowledge of the utter mess that scheduling these lessons was, the terrible logistics in place for connecting coaches with students, and the lack of any semblance of maturity and accountability of the people running the site.

In the League community, when I first resumed playing actively (been around since beta) about 1-1.5 years ago, I was a Silver scrub trying to get a lesson through a site claiming to employ/represent Aphromoo and many other pros, only to find out the site was complete bullshit and had no authority to represent the people it did.

I was then bombarded by the site's manager and a community figure (to remain nameless) accusing me of libel (written form of slander) and many other things. As a law student I had to explain to this person over skype that I was not going to accept their laughable legal terms, and that their business practices were shoddy at best.

---

Conclusion:

I hope Lol-Class does well. I only even wrote this post because I visited the site to check out their offerings.

I just want people to really understand the risks of paying someone over the internet for a service that outside of community outrage and reputation, is not really accountable to anyone.

I know there are a lot of really young summoners and redditors, so I hope this helped in some small way."

Will pay in 2 installments on Oct/Nov.",[deleted],Loans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1m0sac/req_700_until_november_10th_2013_for_septembers/,"Hello reddit. Well this is it for me. It's the last place to turn to. I need 875 for rent but im gonna go ahead and sell my laptop so that should get me a couple hundred bucks. I could just use the computers at school, I dont really NEED a laptop so no problem. Therefore I need 700 dollars to cover the rest. I will be able to pay this back in 2 installments October 10th will be 400 and Nov 10th will be another 400. Yes I am willing to pay 100 in interest but if you can loan this to me with no interest or little interest I would really be grateful and thankful. If you want to know exactly how it is I got here then please read on. If not, then thank you for stopping by.

My fiancee graduated from college this year. She got her bachelors in accounting. She was offered a good job before she finished school as a paid intern but turned it down because she felt that finishing school was important. We have been making it through me doing computer jobs and her working a normal job(not her career) as a customer service rep. So she finally graduated and everything is great right? Wrong! The best job she can get right now is a 13 dollar an hour job, 45 minutes away. Which means I have to walk the kids to school every morning 35 minutes and pick them up after school another 35 minutes. But she needs the Accounting Experience so she takes it. We don't have money for a babysitter so thats me right now. Im a house dad. I clean and cook and do the laundry. I clean the restroom and keep the kids happy till mom gets home. She just started work and a couple weeks ago she tells me ""hey can you do what you have to do to pay the rent for Sept. I wont get enough on time to do it. You have to do whatever just make sure you get that rent."" So im sitting there like HOW the hell am I supposed to do that? But she's already stressed out and crying because she really thought getting a degree would be the key to a good life. Its the same life with a degree guys. Same life with a framed piece of paper. So I tried doing everything I could. I did a few computer clean ups and used that money for groceries, the light bill and shampoo and a good stock of toilet paper/tooth paste. Here I am September 9th and I got my Notice to pay or quit on Sept 4th. That was a 3 day notice. They are telling me that I will be out of time on Tuesday. Tuesday is my last day. I cant be a baby sitter, go to school and work a job. I cant do it. I keep asking myself what could I have done to prevent this?? 

How I am capable of paying this back:::
My fiancee is gonna continue to work and finally get her first few checks. So that will hold us off for Octobers rent Nov, Dec, etc... The way that I will get you the money back is on October 10th I have a check coming from school. I get it every Feb/March and every Oct/Nov. On the 10th it never fails. In this year ill get it Oct 10th and Nov 8th because the 10th of Nov is on a Sunday. So they give it to me the working day previous. I get 500 on Oct 10th and 500 on Nov 10th. That is how Ill be able to pay you back.

I am willing to scan you my ID, school ID, location, email, we can Skype if you want. Whatever you want but my fiancee cannot know that I took out a loan. She will only hurry to pay not thinking of what we need to do to sustain the household. I cannot have her stress out over this, she's already working a job she hates and is already all messed up because graduating from one of the best Accounting schools California has, was NOT the golden ticket she thought it was. She's gonna gain her experience and try to move up that way. But this is one weight I will carry on my own shoulders. Please help if you can. Please...

Sincerely,
xcureanddisease

P.S. Alternatively if you want computer help, i can sit with you as long as you want and show you how to maintain your own computer. What it is they're really telling you at Best Buy when they mean tune up, which anti virus to get etc. I can tell you anything you want to know about that."
1m0qic,14,2013-09-09,Tired of it...,throwawayforrslashFA,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1m0qic/tired_of_it/,"I'm 21. I've never had sex. I've never been kissed. I've never had a girlfriend. I've never experienced the feeling of mutual attraction. I go to one of the most infamously promiscuous colleges in the United States, and I still have no success (for one thing, I don't *want* just sex without any sort of romantic feeling). My college friends are also FA, pretty much. My high school friends aren't, and I feel like I annoy them when I try to talk about it. I feel like every time I do, I hope for some kind of answer outside of what I usually get, but that never happens, and it's kinda douchey of me to expect it to.

I feel defective.

I'm a senior in college. After this semester, I'm hoping to get an internship out of state. After that, I want to teach English in Japan. So why do I even bother? If anything even happens, it'll be a three-month relationship with some chick I prolly just met, which will inevitably end awkwardly when I'm all like, ""welp, it's time for me to be off to do my thing and then I'm going to Japan. Buh-bye"". So I should just extend my being alone until I'm *at least*, like, 23 (language barrier and not having any friends in the area is certainly going to make things difficult).

I don't even know how to meet people I'd be interested in and who would also be interested in me, man.

I dunno why I'm coming here. Maybe to get it offa my chest. Maybe just to talk. Maybe for whatever answer I'm hoping for. Not like I'll get much help here, though.

Sorry if I come across as an asshole for that last sentence. I type this and feel like a cliche neckbeard loser. I'm not, exactly. I shave on a regular basis, I feel gross if I go a day without showering, I'm a bit overweight, but not nearly as much as I used to be. I don't dress very well and I have stubborn annoying acne that isn't horrible, but is present enough just to be a pain in my ass. I dunno if I'm even typing coherent English, at this point. I feel like venting. I don't really care about the repercussions.

I'm done for now."
1m0my4,1,2013-09-09,I ruined college for myself. [Rant],[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m0my4/i_ruined_college_for_myself_rant/,"I was never a very social person. All through elementary and middle school, I just felt different from other kids. They would all play together and I'd just kinda sit off on the side by myself. But in high school, this all got a lot better. I joined marching band and made several good friends there, as well as a lot of acquaintances that I was friendly with. I also had several friends in many of my classes. I was in AP and honors classes and while I still had depressive episodes every now and then, I was overall a very happy person. That all changed when I went to college. 

I had a full-time job the summer after my senior year of high school at our family's business, so I hardly saw any of my high school friends over the summer. I saw a few of them before I left for college, but that was it. 

I moved to Michigan for college thinking I was going to do what I did in high school when it came to making friends. They would come naturally in my classes and extra-curricular activities if I worked hard and did my best. So I was hopeful moving in. But as soon as my parents helped me move into my dorm and left, all of the feelings I had from middle school came right back up. I quickly became very hardened and grew very cold. I kept my dorm room door closed all the time and barely said a word to my roommate (our rooms were adjoined, where his room was connected to mine, so he would walk in off of the hallway to my room and then through another door to his room). Same thing in my classes: I never talked to a single person in any of my classes either semester. I joined the LGBT student organization that semester and found the people in it to be very pretentious and exclusive; I met no friends there either. 

Instead of trying to transition into my life out of state, I desperately tried to get back the life I was living in high school in Illinois. I clung to my home state like glue. I went home as often as I could and tried to rekindle as many of my high school friendships as I could (which was actually quite successful). I spent the entire year holed up in my dorm room, only leaving to eat and go to class. I did everything completely alone. At the end of the year, I was so happy to be able to say goodbye to college for the summer and move back home. But when I moved back home, I started working full-time again, which meant that I barely got to see any of my high school friends there either. So I spent that summer almost as depressed as I was during the school year. 

That fall I move back to college expecting the same thing as the year before. I won't put the whole thing into great detail, but I joined another activity that I served on the executive board of for the year. While it was somewhat enjoyable and I got a Presidential Volunteer Service Award out of it, I still didn't meet anybody that I ""clicked"" with. I also lived in the aviation dorm, which is my major, so I thought I'd make some friends that shared my major. Nope. Still couldn't leave my door open, too afraid to. Occasionally I would eat dinner and play cards with a couple of people that were in that previously-mentioned activity and also lived in my hall, but that was as far as it went. I had friends that I could rely on for anything back in Illinois, but here, there was nobody I could lean on. I tried to join our aviation social fraternity, but my social anxiety forced me to drop out of the pledge class after the second meeting. 

I had to stay for two months into the summer after school ended that year to take a class that was only offered in the summer. I didn't have any friends to share an apartment lease with, so I had to rent one by myself for around $550 a month. For those two months, I went back to being just like I was during my first year: completely withdrawn and isolated from the outside world. I still knew nobody in any class I'd ever taken at the college, and the people that I sorta knew from my dorm moved back home for the summer. Since I didn't get hired at any of the five jobs I applied for, for the rest of the summer, I moved back home and worked full-time again, but I made a huge effort to spend time with as many of my old high school friends as possible. I felt like I had abandoned them moving away to college, so I wanted them to know I loved them. They were all I had at this point. 

A week ago I moved back here to college. The same thing is happening as the other two years. I'm renting the same apartment so I don't even get to see the few people I knew in the dining halls anymore. I've spent the first week of school shut up in my apartment. The rush week for that social fraternity is this next week, but I just can't make myself pledge, even though I know it'd be a valuable experience. I'm just too anxious, and I feel like it's not worth it since I'll be graduating this spring. I also dropped out of that activity I was on the board for my sophomore year. 

Reddit, I just feel like I've hit a dead end in life. I just want to be as happy as I was in Illinois. I went in to college with 20 credit hours of AP credit, I took 19 hours/semester my first year, and I was scheduled to graduate in 3 years, so I think that fostered a ""get-in, get-out"" attitude about college for me. Also, I stopped seeing my psychologist once I moved out of state, so I turned to alcohol during my second year of college to try to relieve my depression and anxiety. Hell, I'm writing this after polishing off a bottle of wine in the past hour. I'm watching other students make lifelong friends, get jobs and internships, and go to parties, and I'm just sitting on my couch getting drunk and watching TV. All I think about is moving home, but I don't know what I'll do there, either. I hope some terminal illness will put me out of my misery, life just sucks too much for me to go on like this. I just want to pull my comforter over my head and forget about everything outside my apartment. I really want friends, but I'm too depressed to leave my apartment and too anxious to go introduce myself to people. 

So that's how I wrecked college for myself. I fucked it all up. Some of my high school friends say ""just throw yourself into a group and talk to people and meet them"" *but i just can't do that.* I don't know why but I just can't. People told me all through high school how much fun college was going to be, and now all I want to do is get out. I used to be a smart, bright, and motivated student, and I've turned into a lazy, stupid drunk who's too much of a pansy to make any friends. What happened to me?

Sorry for this massive wall of text, and sorry if I rambled through a lot of it (I've had a lot of booze), but it felt really good to get this off my chest. 


**TL;DR Had a great time in high school, went to college and my life fell apart because of my inability to make friends.**"

Then he realized that he wouldn't be able to complete his massive 30-something page paper on time if he came. I was heartbroken, and now neither of us knows when we'll see each other next. 

Today, September 9th, is the day that he was supposed to start his internship. He was supposed to be here, in my bed with me, getting a good night's sleep (or not...) before his big first day at the office. 

I miss him, and just thought some of you could understand the loneliness that comes with being 6000km away from the one you love.

I'm currently a student, junior, majoring in finance at The University of Oklahoma here in the Untied States. I'm in the top 5% of my graduating class and really want to ""internationalize"" my education. I know studying abroad would be a cool option, but without getting an income, its something I simply cannot afford to do. 

I really want to move to Calgary after graduation. I think the best thing I can do at this point is to apply for internships in the area. I've applied to Husky Energy and Suncor in their finance departments and am waiting to hear back. They offer Spring internships, something I'm highly interested in doing,

I'm posting here because I'm having a hard time finding companies in Calgary that offer internships. Good, reputable companies, that are looking for well driven individuals. Can you guys here suggest me some companies that I should took a look into applying for possible spring internships? If so, please let me know. I'm willing to work in any company, any industry, within their finance departments.

I'm also ready to move any time, as I have family in the city.

I would definitely appreciate some help.

Thanks in advance,

This has also been my experience being on set and going to networking mixers. If you're union, you treat those who are non-union as if they're meaningless.

Seriously, today I ask a buyer who needed help if she needed help, and she looked me up and down gave me a nasty look and said ""Not from you."" And I just said All right, and walked away.

Is it an ego thing? Do they think they're better than everyone else? What is it? Am I alone in seeing this?"
1m3l2p,1,2013-09-10,This summer has been brutal (rant inside),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m3l2p/this_summer_has_been_brutal_rant_inside/,"I'm a 20 year old male college student and I want this summer to end. It wasn't been as bad as last summer, when my older brother got into a motorcycle accident that nearly took his life, but still pretty bad. Not as bad as last winter, when me and my family were still learning how to take care of him, now partially paralyzed and in chronic pain, but still bad.

My mom got into a car accident a week ago that could have easily killed or paralyzed her, too. It brought back painful memories of waiting in the emergency room, expecting the doctors to come out and tell me my brother wouldn't wake up. Luckily that didn't happen, she was able to walk out of the hospital and is largely recovered, but that hasn't made me worry any less.

It all would've been fine if I had plans, but I wasn't able to get a job or an internship. My dad has asked me repeatedly why I didn't make any plans this summer, and it doesn't seem like he understands how hard it is to get a job in my hometown. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in the state. I applied to a dozen places and didn't get a single call back. I feel fortunate to have a job waiting for me back at college, because if I didn't I would probably feel even more like a loser.

I wish I had more friends. It feels like my hometown friends have forgotten me, but that's unfair. They're busy with their own lives and it's not like I was asking them to hang out every weekend. We have gotten together a few times, but not nearly as often as I would have liked, and I hate this feeling that we're drifting apart. They're some of my oldest friends, and the only ones I have here, and I love them. I wish I had the courage to tell them that face to face.

I am lonely and I want to get into a relationship again, but it's been nearly four years since my last one. Dating is difficult and hooking up is even worse. I haven't had sex in nine months and every time I get close to it, I clam up and get terrified and back out. Unless I'm drunk or high, but then I can't orgasm, which is a different kind of disappointment.

I've been depressed on and off this whole summer, and have been falling back into bad habits. I'm honestly surprised that I haven't started smoking again, but that would ruin my running, which is the only thing that has been keeping me back from a nervous breakdown. Even with exercise, I still sleep half the day, sometimes more.

The worst part about all this is that I'm scared of going back to school, happier as I am there. I'm starting my third year and I've been on academic probation before. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and it's all I can do to pay attention in class, and many times I don't even show up because I can't gather the motivation. I sometimes fall into the worst downward spirals, especially when none of my roommates are home, and I get suicidal thoughts. I once caught myself searching the apartment for pills, I'm not even sure how it started, and I had to take a long walk to calm back down.

I'm just so tired."

1m2wsc,17,2013-09-09,Recent story regarding my student loan. Curious what Reddit thinks.,tepknish,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m2wsc/recent_story_regarding_my_student_loan_curious/,"I'm a 30 year old on the east coast of the US from poor middle class parents who couldn't afford to send their 2 children to private schools. Naturally, we both went to private schools. For me, 5 years of undergrad resulted in a whopping 127k private loan and 20k fed loan. The second mistake (the 1st is obv), was choosing the fixed interest rate of 10% over the flex rate upon consolidating when I graduated in 2006. That gem of advice came from my ex-gfs' father, who was a hardcore finance guy. Parents paid most of accruing interest while I was in school; that's all. 

Until a few weeks ago, my balance was 118k. Miraculous, I know. I'll explain in a bit. Recently, I was able to moonlight for a lot of extra loot. I decided I was O.K. with my checking account minus 10k. I called my student loan company; discover is the manager, not the original lender. I asked all the right questions. Person on phone estimated my new minimum payment would be $92 less than what it is. She said glad I called, a request to adjust min. payment was necessary when making  a large principle balance payment, but just a formality. I said okay great. At the same time I finally switched over to automatic deduction for the .25 interest rate benefit. Had to wait since I was in deferment for grad school (yes, I have a federal loan for grad school). Checked online a week later, principle balance was 109k, minimum payment was unchanged except for the $23 deduction from the int. rate change. I called, and actually got the same adviser I got from the 1st call. She said she thought it was a mistake, since the entire 10k wasn't processed, some went to current int. balance. She said check back in a week. After the holiday, I called again and got a smart adviser. Basically she admitted that I was told the wrong thing, twice. My request to adj min payment was denied. It was really never an option, as per my loan agreement. Min. payment is only adjusted after deferment or at the loaner's discretion. I asked for documentation of the first convo (she was obv able to view it) and she said she wasn't capable of sending. I wanted all 10k to go towards the principle and pay the interest balance like normal, that also was never an option, despite what I was told. I asked if I could submitt another request to adj. min balance or submit some kind of waiver/request...I was just making shit up. She said no. 
Has this loan company done me wrong? Obv they don't care about how much diff in my month to month finances a payment reduction makes. I  know in the long wrong I will pay less interest, but I really wanted to reduce my min. payment so I can afford things normal people have like a house or an engagement ring. That 10k would of eliminated an entire fed loan I pay ~$75 a month on. Is there a bureau I could report this to? Or, am I at fault for not really knowing the terms of the loan despite what I was told on the phone?
If any of you fine people have any advice on my loan in general I am all ears. I am looking into getting a loan with a lower interest rate from wells fargo to pay off this one, but I was denied before and it seems they r the only ones that offer those type of loans now. I make too much $$ to qualify for income based payments; the upside of my story I alluded to earlier. 
As an undergrad, I had the wherewithal to procure an internship from the father of a fraternity brother. This put me on the path to a rare, lucrative, satisfying, cutting edge and well paying career that somewhat makes up for the price I paid. I'm an embryologist; I make babies in a lab. AMA-lol. Being a scientist and helping couples is great, but I would trade it for little debt and a desk job. 

Thanks!

Someone who worked at Bad Robot while LOST was being made is also a Bills fan, and posted on the same football message board I used to. Every LOST season, we'd end up with a 100+ page thread with all of the LOST fans discussing the show. After the finale, our guy was finally able to contribute, and provide some insight from his perspective. I've had it saved and send it to friends as they finish the series. I've found it helps explain a lot, so I thought I'd post it here since I see a lot of ""Just finished series, have a lot of questions"" posts.

NOTES:
1. He was NOT a writer for LOST
2. This is not official Bad Robot canon or explanations. Just his perspective.

This is a copy and paste from the board, so the ""John"" he refers to was another poster who had a lot of questions, not John Locke. Also, ""Flocke"" was our name for Locke/MIB.

Enjoy!...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good stuff on here! I can finally throw in my two cents! I've had to bite my tongue for far too long. Also, hopefully I can answer some of John's questions about Dharma and the ""pointless breadcrumbs"" that really, weren't so pointless ...
First ...

The Island:

It was real. Everything that happened on the island that we saw throughout the 6 seasons was real. Forget the final image of the plane crash, it was put in purposely to f*&amp;k with people's heads and show how far the show had come. They really crashed. They really survived. They really discovered Dharma and the Others. The Island keeps the balance of good and evil in the world. It always has and always will perform that role. And the Island will always need a ""Protector"". Jacob wasn't the first, Hurley won't be the last. However, Jacob had to deal with a malevolent force (MIB) that his mother, nor Hurley had to deal with. He created the devil and had to find a way to kill him -- even though the rules prevented him from actually doing so.

Thus began Jacob's plan to bring candidates to the Island to do the one thing he couldn't do. Kill the MIB. He had a huge list of candidates that spanned generations. Yet everytime he brought people there, the MIB corrupted them and caused them to kill one another. That was until Richard came along and helped Jacob understand that if he didn't take a more active role, then his plan would never work.

Enter Dharma -- which I'm not sure why John is having such a hard time grasping. Dharma, like the countless scores of people that were brought to the island before, were brought there by Jacob as part of his plan to kill the MIB. However, the MIB was aware of this plan and interferred by ""corrupting"" Ben. Making Ben believe he was doing the work of Jacob when in reality he was doing the work of the MIB. This carried over into all of Ben's ""off-island"" activities. He was the leader. He spoke for Jacob as far as they were concerned. So the ""Others"" killed Dharma and later were actively trying to kill Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley and all the candidates because that's what the MIB wanted. And what he couldn't do for himself.

Dharma was originally brought in to be good. But was turned bad by MIB's corruption and eventually destroyed by his pawn Ben. Now, was Dharma only brought there to help Jack and the other Canditates on their overall quest to kill Smokey? Or did Jacob have another list of Canidates from the Dharma group that we were never aware of? That's a question that is purposley not answered because whatever answer the writers came up with would be worse than the one you come up with for yourself. Still ... Dharma's purpose is not ""pointless"" or even vague. Hell, it's pretty blantent.

Still, despite his grand plan, Jacob wanted to give his ""candidates"" (our Lostaways) the one thing he, nor his brother, were ever afforded: free will. Hence him bringing a host of ""candidates"" through the decades and letting them ""choose"" which one would actually do the job in the end. Maybe he knew Jack would be the one to kill Flocke and that Hurley would be the protector in the end. Maybe he didn't. But that was always the key question of the show: Fate vs Free-will. Science vs Faith. Personally I think Jacob knew from the beginning what was going to happen and that everyone played a part over 6 seasons in helping Jack get to the point where he needed to be to kill Smokey and make Hurley the protector -- I know that's how a lot of the writers viewed it. But again, they won't answer that (nor should they) because that ruins the fun.

In the end, Jack got to do what he always wanted to do from the very first episode of the show: Save his fellow Lostaways. He got Kate and Sawyer off the island and he gave Hurley the purpose in life he'd always been missing. And, in Sideways world (which we'll get to next) he in fact saved everyone by helping them all move on ...

Now...

Sideways World:

Sideways world is where it gets really cool in terms of theology and metaphysical discussion (for me at least -- because I love history/religion theories and loved all the talks in the writer's room about it). Basically what the show is proposing is that we're all linked to certain people during our lives. Call them soulmates (though it's not exactly the best word). But these people we're linked to are with us duing ""the most important moments of our lives"" as Christian said. These are the people we move through the universe with from lifetime to lifetime. It's loosely based in Hinduisim with large doses of western religion thrown into the mix.

The conceit that the writers created, basing it off these religious philosophies, was that as a group, the Lostaways subconsciously created this ""sideways"" world where they exist in purgatory until they are ""awakened"" and find one another. Once they all find one another, they can then move on and move forward. In essence, this is the show's concept of the afterlife. According to the show, everyone creates their own ""Sideways"" purgatory with their ""soulmates"" throughout their lives and exist there until they all move on together. That's a beautiful notion. Even if you aren't religious or even spirtual, the idea that we live AND die together is deeply profound and moving.

It's a really cool and spirtual concept that fits the whole tone and subtext the show has had from the beginning. These people were SUPPOSED to be together on that plane. They were supposed to live through these events -- not JUST because of Jacob. But because that's what the universe or God (depending on how religious you wish to get) wanted to happen. The show was always about science vs faith -- and it ultimately came down on the side of faith. It answered THE core question of the series. The one question that has been at the root of every island mystery, every character backstory, every plot twist. That, by itself, is quite an accomplishment.

How much you want to extrapolate from that is up to you as the viewer. Think about season 1 when we first found the Hatch. Everyone thought that's THE answer! Whatever is down there is the answer! Then, as we discovered it was just one station of many. One link in a very long chain that kept revealing more, and more of a larger mosiac.

But the writer's took it even further this season by contrasting this Sideways ""purgatory"" with the Island itself. Remember when Michael appeared to Hurley, he said he was not allowed to leave the Island. Just like the MIB. He wasn't allowed into this sideways world and thus, was not afforded the opportunity to move on. Why? Because he had proven himself to be unworthy with his actions on the Island. He failed the test. The others, passed. They made it into Sideways world when they died -- some before Jack, some years later. In Hurley's case, maybe centuries later. They exist in this sideways world until they are ""awakened"" and they can only move on TOGETHER because they are linked. They are destined to be together for eternity. That was their destiny.

They were NOT linked to Anna Lucia, Daniel, Roussou, Alex, Miles, Lupidis, (and all the rest who weren't in the chuch -- basically everyone who wasn't in season 1). Yet those people exist in Sideways world. Why? Well again, here's where they leave it up to you to decide. The way I like to think about it, is that those people who were left behind in Sideways world have to find their own soulmates before they can wake up. It's possible that those links aren't people from the island but from their other life (Anna's parnter, the guy she shot --- Roussou's husband, etc etc).

A lot of people have been talking about Ben and why he didn't go into the Church. And if you think of Sideways world in this way, then it gives you the answer to that very question. Ben can't move on yet because he hasn't connected with the people he needs to. It's going to be his job to awaken Roussou, Alex, Anna Lucia (maybe), Ethan, Goodspeed, his father and the rest. He has to attone for his sins more than he did by being Hurley's number two. He has to do what Hurley and Desmond did for our Lostaways with his own people. He has to help them connect. And he can only move on when all the links in his chain are ready to. Same can be said for Faraday, Charlotte, Whidmore, Hawkins etc. It's really a neat, and cool concept. At least to me.

But, from a more ""behind the scenes"" note: the reason Ben's not in the church, and the reason no one is in the church but for Season 1 people is because they wrote the ending to the show after writing the pilot. And never changed it. The writers always said (and many didn't believe them) that they knew their ending from the very first episode. I applaud them for that. It's pretty fantastic. Originally Ben was supposed to have a 3 episode arc and be done. But he became a big part of the show. They could have easily changed their ending and put him in the church -- but instead they problem solved it. Gave him a BRILLIANT moment with Locke outside the church ... and then that was it. I loved that. For those that wonder -- the original ending started the moment Jack walked into the church and touches the casket to Jack closing his eyes as the other plane flies away. That was always JJ's ending. And they kept it.

For me the ending of this show means a lot. Not only because I worked on it, but because as a writer it inspired me in a way the medium had never done before. I've been inspired to write by great films. Maybe too many to count. And there have been amazing TV shows that I've loved (X-Files, 24, Sopranos, countless 1/2 hour shows). But none did what LOST did for me. None showed me that you could take huge risks (writing a show about faith for network TV) and stick to your creative guns and STILL please the audience. I learned a lot from the show as a writer. I learned even more from being around the incredible writers, producers, PAs, interns and everyone else who slaved on the show for 6 years.

In the end, for me, LOST was a touchstone show that dealt with faith, the afterlife, and all these big, spirtual questions that most shows don't touch. And to me, they never once waivered from their core story -- even with all the sci-fi elements they mixed in. To walk that long and daunting of a creative tightrope and survive is simply astounding.

And awesome stuff, as always, from everyone on here over the past few years! You guys rock!

1m2rpf,1,2013-09-09,I (26M) am having trouble reconciling what happened and how to move forward with my ex (25F),giants87,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m2rpf/i_26m_am_having_trouble_reconciling_what_happened/,"Fellow redditors - I need some help. I wan to know if I am the douchebag, if I was unreasonable, if it was both, or if it was my ex… or both of us… really anything. I want some clarity outside my own mind. This is a long story - so if you are wiling to read it through, I appreciate all comments.

I (26m) recently broke up with my ex (25f), and we dated for four years. In the beginning I found out some things about her that led me, a rather insecure and at times extremely anxious person, to have a lot of trouble as our relationship grew throughout the years. She cheated on all her exes, she visited her exes while with me, and it never sat well with me. But she was great, so I tried to look past it.

Year one: generally it was amazing, we were both on cloud 9 together from what I remember. Aside from a hiccup with her ex within the first couple of months, I eventually came to completely trust her.  She had the most beautiful smile, would greet me with eyes that just felt like home, and made me feel truly special, wanted. I would drive in just to take her to college classes, even on days I had none, and wait around on campus. As I said - the smile she would greet me with was heavenly. I miss it to this day. I moved in with her eventually, and we were inseparable.

Year two: I graduated, and I found she was spending a lot of time with a guy I was not comfortable with. It got the the point that I put a key logger on my computer and saw how she was CONSTANTLY flirting with him (hey hottie, cutie, etc) - it bothered me. I asked her to stop, she said she would - but didn't. Even took him to the mall when she was only going shopping at VS, but ""he never came in with her"" so it was OK in her mind - it never was in mind.  I was starting to work 230+ hours a month and felt she was unhappy, and i started to get a burning to go after that long lost high school girl - so I broke up with her, I paid her back for the trip she took us to in Hawaii 9 months earlier, and I gave it a shot - it went nowhere. Eventually, me and my ex grew back together. I am not proud of what I did, but I felt she was unhappy with me - I didn't know the pain that i would cause her, but from what she told me it was overwhelming. I never found the right way to apologize, even though I wanted to and tried to.

Year three: We were good, but it was never like the first year again. My trust in her was fading from run ins with random guys she would always have, and the VS mall guy still in the picture. Otherwise - a pretty uneventful year, until the end. But I'll bunch that into year 4.

Year 4: I had a VERY rough year - I spent two to three days a week with my grandpa as he was getting blood transfusions for 6-8 hours a day, and the rest of the time trying to help and find a job as I was unemployed at the start. In december, my grandma and grandpa went to vegas and my grandpa immediately had a heart attack leaving him in a vegas hospital for 10 days. Me and my family flew to vegas the next day to help, I would spent nights sleeping on his hospital floor because otherwise he would wake up calling us because of his dementia, forgetting where he was and why. I felt I was doing the right thing for my family, and didn't mean to neglect her. Eventually, late Spring hit - my dog died in my arms outside of a vet, my cat was put down, and my grandpa eventually died. I never found a way to cope, and I think to this day I refuse to allow myself to accept it. And I resent my ex - she wasn't ever there for me. Instead, she started going out with guys behind my back, not saying a thing, until 2 AM or beyond. Twice I caught her doing this, I went to her house and waited for hours until she got home because of my terror and anger - I didn't want to lose her too. I eventually broke when she threatened to leave, I spent three nights in a mental ward for suicide watch, and was finally let go to my family. I had to realize she wasn't all I had left, and that I had to create my existence outside of her. But I wanted her in my life, and we reconnected again.

She started school at a new college in September, and I found a job near her (a 40 minute drive to work). We moved in together. Things were very bad from the start - that trust I had of her was still slowly crumbling.  The second week she took a guy home to her hometown, took him shopping at a mall, out to eat, walking in a park, and to her house. I got a new cat that day (I love animals, and was ready for a new one finally) - and she was ignoring me. I was at my sisters, 40 blocks from her house - so I drove over, and saw he speeding off later learning there was a guy hiding in her passenger seat. The same guy that she invited over two days later and cooked a breakfast for after I left for work.  I think this is where my trust in her truly shattered. We argued, we fought, things were terrible - she moved out. She whispered in my ear as she left ""Is it real yet?"" - those words still sting and frustrate me to remember.

Well - we reconciled, we were OK. I moved into essentially a frat house to stay close, I waited for her to call for help, to go shopping, for anything as I was displaced from my friends and family and hoping to reconcile with her. Eventually, summer comes, and I told her I can't do nearly 11 hour days any more (8, +1 hour lunch, +1.5 hour round trip driving). I moved closer to work, and told her I wanted her with me. I gave her the offer of you just buy our food and I'll cover the rest of the rent and bills. She turned it down, she didn't follow through to come visit me on weekends as she promised - and I finally threw in the towel. Then she comes back, saying she would split all bills even just to be with me, that she would unlock all her accounts to show I could trust her (I couldn't trust a word she said at this point, my paranoia was taking over). I said no. I said we weren't healthy for one another, we need to grow apart and let it go.

I was doing good, eventually she would text me saying she cries herself to sleep every night, she misses me, she will wait for me, etc… it tore at my heart. But I remade my Facebook awhile back, and the other day I finally clicked on her picture - to find that she had been out with the same guys from before, that nothing in her life had changed. I grew so furious, enraged… that she would pry at me saying such things while still doing the exact things that drove me to lose my trust in her.

I want to make a few things clear - 

Her guy friends were always NEW, they weren't more than a week old generally before she was off with them without telling me their name or a thing about them. I used to say her response to my questions were ""fuck you deal with it.""
I reacted with rage sometimes… and it wasn't pretty. Not violent, but the things I would say were at times terrible.
I am afraid of driving home to my parents, because I got a new car and don't want her to find me. She sent me a message a couple weeks ago ""your parents look happy"" - And my parents were home. It struck me as odd.
At one point she told me how I was threatening to leave almost monthly - and I look at it as ""and you never tried to change or see why, just cover the issue with a smile or words that would melt my firm stance against you every time""

I couldn't find a way to look beyond how she could so quickly meet and go off with guys without telling me a thing about them. I couldn't find a way to forgive her, I honestly felt cheated, worse than if it were sexual. I say this because I thought she was my best friend, that we would talk about everything - but she hid these guys from me, and protected them from my questions by never answering if I persisted. Now she has my computer, iPad, printer, my engagement ring, another ring, and earrings - and won't even return the engagement ring. It frustrates me, that she would keep my stuff that she has no right to hold onto. Especially as she always brags about her money, and put me down for not having as much as her or her ex (he was a pharmacist, she's a pharmacy intern / pharm.d student who is/ will be making a lot)

Am I the asshole? Did she purposefully play me?
How do I let it go? I thought I was doing so well until the Facebook event, seeing she was playing with me with more lies.

I feel like I've lost the ability to trust people close to me as a result. My fuse to anger is… incredibly short lately. I just want to laugh and make people smile, I thought I found my true self again, then this past week with those images I completely lost it.

Any opinions, questions - on me, or her, or anything - go ahead. 

Sorry, no tl;dr - theres too much on both sides for me to accurately shorten this."

Would love some outsider input.",FlamingTong,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m2rfv/me24m_with_my_ex_21f_small_things_temporary_large/,"Hey all!  This is my first post in /r/relationships, so here goes.  

My ex and I started dating in June of 2013.  I know this is recent, but we have known each other since January 2013 and had great chemistry but both chose to ignore it as we were both with other people at the time.

By March, I had broken up with my then-girlfriend (of 4 years), and was just getting back from an insane Mexico trip with my guys.  I had a great time and was gearing up for my last term at university.

Me and recent ex had been involved in a group project together.  We were the only two committed workers of the group and did the majority of the work together while other group members surfed the wave we had manufactured.  This showed us a lot about each other and our work ethics and priorities.  We 'studied' together for that class and spent a lot of time together talking instead of studying.

We decided to give it a try in the second week of my final term in college.  She had *just* broken up with her then-boyfriend.  It was great very quickly, and we both said things like ""I haven't ever felt like this before"" and ""I didn't expect this"".  Things you want to hear.

I had gotten a job in January of 2013.  This job was, at the time, going to take me to a city over 1300 miles away for good.  I knew I was leaving for said job soon and this new girl knew this the entire time as well.  Then, all of the sudden, my job informs me that I will only be *training* 1300 miles away, then I will be moving back closer and it will take 12 weeks to finish training.  The distance between me and new girl is only going to be 3 hours driving after my training as opposed to 15.5 during.  We decided that something like this connection we had doesn't come often in a lifetime, and that it was worth it to be together.

So we went for it.  I am currently in my 10th of 12 weeks of training in the city 1300 miles away.  The distance was fine for a while, and we've been able to see each other twice.  One thing that has gotten in the way is different forms of communication: now that her internship was over (as of August 2nd), she texted me all the time.  She wants me to call and text every break I have in work otherwise she doesn't feel like I care about her.  I have spent hours on the phone with her reassuring her how important it was to me that we get through this time apart and how much I care.  I wanted to talk once a day, preferably at night, and talk about everything in our day.  This way, we have things to talk about and the conversation doesn't get stale.  She feels that this is me not caring about her enough to be in constant communication, and says she feels like she is bothering me and always the one to initiate our communication.  Really, the opposite is true because all I want is to make it so we are still really into each other even though there is a harsh distance between us right now.

The only thing I have a problem with is how we communicate when we each go out.  I have had bad experiences in the past, and therefore it is important to me that we each tell the other one *if* we're going out, and whenever we're back home and in bed we leave a message for the other one.  It isn't important *who* we're going out with or *where*, but just *that* we're going out.  It makes me feel that even though we are each out, we are thinking of the other one.  I have expressed this as important before we started our relationship, and have always lead by example when I am going out here.  She feels that this is controlling, and I feel like her wanting me to call/text ALL THE TIME is controlling.  

Anyway, I am willing to try.  I don't want her to feel like the only one who initiates communication, and basically I want to try the things she expresses as important to me. 

So I do it: I text her in the morning before work, and also during my breaks I get.  It takes her *hours* to text me back even though I know she doesn't have any responsibilities right now, and this annoys me because it felt like she just wanted me to always be initiating communication and so she could take it for granted and feel like someone is infatuated with her.  So we talk about this and it turns out apparently she wasn't trying to do that.  Whatever.  I'm over it.  But then another night out passes, and she goes out without letting me know she is and I find out the next morning.  I'm hurt only because I wanted to do the things she expressed as important and she couldn't do the things for me that I expressed as important.  So we talk the next day and she doesn't seem like there is any fight in her as far as wanting to give those things which are important to me a try.  I break up with her over the phone that afternoon.  

This isn't our first breakup mind you-- we broke up before but it was her with me and it was because she thought I was mad that she blacked out for her 21st birthday, when really I was worried when she was unable to call or text me when she was home.  It wasn't that it happened the one time on her 21st birthday (we've all been there), it was that I have had bad experiences with that happening frequently in the past and wanted to ""nip it in the bud"" and explain to her why this type of communication level is important to me.  She broke up with me and at the start of the next conversation we had, and by the end she said she felt ""180 degrees differently"", so we were back together.  But she was headed to Vegas and I didn't want to hear about shit so I told her we should take a break.  This break was because the situation hurt me, because I always wanted to work through issues and be together in the end of them.  It showed me that one of her outlets was to let this go after everything we'd said to one another.  She basically showed me that breaking up was something that had entered her mind as a possibility, and the same wasn't true on my side.

When she broke up with me, I fought for us.  I explained to her everything and told her my actual motives, and that's when she felt 180 degrees differently.  When I broke up with her, I think, deep down, that I wanted to see if she would fight for us if the situation were reversed.  When she didn't really fight for us it propelled me to continue the breakup that morning.  It felt like, deep down, she was getting what she wanted and I didn't want to deprive her of that.  

Now she is mad because I tweeted some shit when I was out after that afternoon, but really my colleagues made me go out with them because I was confiding in them and they didn't want me to just be sad.  She said it showed a lot that I could just go out after a monumentally bad day like we had, and that it wasn't something she wanted because she had stayed in and just been sad for two days.  I told her that people deal with things differently.

I am now alone in this big city.  I had those colleagues until a few days ago that lived here as well and were training along with me, but they have left as they started their training before I did.  She is still in the college town where we met, and has many roommates and a strong support system to rely on there.  This is enabling her to not have as much of a problem with No Contact, and she has many things to occupy her mind.  The opposite is true for me.  I am making friends and have had success with a few girls down here but I put a stop to it before it goes anywhere (as in, if we were still dating I still haven't cheated on her).  The No Contact is hurting me deeply.

I have expressed to her that I wanted to talk in-person to see if there is really nothing left.  I am coming back to where she lives for a friend's wedding, and we are talking the night afterward.  I don't know where she stands and what she wants to do, but I told her she can have a free 'out' and not talk to me in person if that is easier, which would give me closure and start my 'moving on' process.  If there is nothing left then I know that this just isn't what I thought it was and I can deal with that.  But she wants to talk.  I don't know what to make of that, and I want to ask her what she truly wants from this talk in person as our conversation won't be for a week-- and this week by myself is wearing hard on me.  I don't know what to ask her, and I'm giving her time to think about if she misses what we had, because a lot of the time I think things are ruined because you don't give the other person enough space to understand their true feelings.  So NC is definitely happening, but let me tell you readers that this shit sucks.  Any/all advice and thoughts are appreciated, and especially just having people to talk to and bounce ideas off of is something I really could use right now.  Thanks a ton for reading this whole novel on my life.

1m2loo,3,2013-09-09,Best way to report success of predictive model,ashwhat,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m2loo/best_way_to_report_success_of_predictive_model/,"Hi,

I'm texing up my resume, and was hoping to report on some work I did this summer at an internship.

For my summer work, (I worked at a mobile marketing firm) I developed a predictive model to quantify the unsubscribe rate that we would see following sending a message blast.  In mobile marketing, subscribers can text ""STOP"" to unsubscribe from lists, and I looked at the different things involved in predicting these unsubscribe rates.

I framed my problem as a multi-class problem, where each class corresponded with rates of list unsubscribe rate (for example, 0 was no unsubscribes, 1 was 0-.05% of the list would unsubscribe, etc etc).

What metric should I report when describing my results for my resume?  I achieved 85% accuracy with Random Forests for the multi class (91% for a two-class formulation!).  But is percent accuracy a good metric?  

If possible, I want a metric that anyone would be able to understand. So in this way, I am attracted to raw accuracy.  So I'm unsure if something like sensitivity/specificity (does this even work with multiclass) would be appropriate

yes I used cross validation and split up my training and test sets following rigorous methodologies

tl;dr Is classification accuracy (as a percent) a good way to report results on a resume?"

Sometimes people might be surprised at how things end up being the way I wanted - and I even get surprised myself - but it is only because I've carefully planned on any possibility.   
Good and bad. Kind of having plan A to Z if you might say so.  
However, despite of all the plans, I can end up in situations that I never even expected or thought about (an AZ situation? Maybe a XYZ? Something else really) which makes me enter in panic because I cannot counter them.   
I get trapped in a turmoil of thoughts and despair because I was stupid enough *not* to think on that possibility and thus not have anything for said situation.  
  
Now that such explanation is out, allow me to explain the title.  
Ever since I was little, I had planned my life. . kind of.  
I had decided where to study, what to have and skills to achieve.  
I managed to graduate from the University I wanted and without debt, I consider myself smart and blah blah blah.  
My parents support me - even though I can find them a bit annoying and conservative. . only sometimes - and I have friends who also support me.  
  
Thing is, right now I am at a stage where things seem to go not as planned.  
I couldn't get a job just after graduating and it took me 2 years to get the one I have. My average pay is roughly 120 USD a week as an intern (before you start with your pitchforks, I don't live in the US or any of the so called '1st world nations') which is less than what I might need to move out from my parents home (which I had planned to do so by the age of 25.. which would come around in November).  
I have planned to create a business with the money I'd be saving with my job but with groceries and other things I could buy, it's not really worth saving or anything that I could save would not be enough.  
I'm also a . . well, just look at my username. I'm supposed to be drawing but I am not exactly the best artist. I pretty much consider my art half assed shit. My writing isn't better given the ESL status.  
All what I wanted at this point of my life: a good job, a nice place to live, being able to have time to draw/write and be myself can't be so because .. well, I don't know.  
  
I know I should be grateful to be living with my parents at a nice home and have a nice place to stay.  
I know I should be grateful I earn enough money to spend and hang out with people, eat and buy the food I like.  
I know I should be happy that I'm doing something in my life.  
  
Thing is, I'm at a point of despair: I don't think I will accomplish any of my goals.    
All that preparation from back then - the school, the classes, the extra books I read, the skills I learned, etc - are worthless and useless.  
I feel worthless, pretty much. I can't even earn what a regular Engineer in this city earns.  
I'm stuck. I wish I could do more and slowly I am starting to feel that 'adult decay' I feared since I was little.  
  
That decay were they realize their dreams or goals can't be true and you are better off accepting your fate and shut the fuck up.    
  
""This is reality. Reality is shit. Stop whining and take it like a man. Fuck off already. Nothing you did could prepare you for this shit.""   
  
Somebody mentioned already that I should move out of my area of comfort but, since I'm too scared to do anything due to my unpreparedness and phobia of failing I don't know what to do.  
  
I am not alone but I feel alone.  
I just wish I could do more and earn a bit more.    
See if my dreams can come true.

I have a friend who just got an internship at a prominent advertising agency, and while he's making half the amount I am, it seems like the better stepping stone into the career he wants.

1m6o7u,1,2013-09-11,Near death experience (Tired Driving),redyellowblue5031,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m6o7u/near_death_experience_tired_driving/,"Over the summer I had a real near death experience. I was on an internship and traveled home on the weekends. I left early Monday morning (Up at 3 to leave at 4 to get there by 8AM) like I had the many times previously. 

I got through the first leg of my trip fine, listening to music as I always did. The same for the second leg of the trip (roughly 50 and 100 Miles respectively). The beginning of the third leg is when I started to get tired. My eyes got heavy but I pushed on because I figured I would wake up more as the sun came up (it was summer so by 6AM it was bright). 

For just a second, I closed my eyes and fell asleep. I went from the right lane to the left, and was stirred by the sound of the rumble strips on either side of the highway. By this time is was too late for corrective action to remain on the highway, and my car went off the road onto the downward sloping grass. I was immediately fully awake now, hearing thousands of tiny rocks and dirt being kicked up by my car wheels going 75. 

I was lucky though, I maintained enough mental control and didn't slam on the brakes or swerve. I calmly steered back toward the highway and sure enough, the car started to go back. At this point the back end of my car began to over-steer and exceed the front end so I'm now traveling (60?) sideways. It wasn't until this point that I thought I was going to die. I uttered but one word through the whole ordeal: ""Shit"". As I continued sideways, I knew I was going to flip once all four wheels hit the highway. The front two were already squealing and I knew the back two were only milliseconds behind. Then my life was saved by a mile marker. I slammed into the mile marker with the rear drivers door of my car. This completely counteracted the momentum the rear had gained over the front end of my car and jerked me back on a straight track, now traveling roughly (30?)

Once on the road, I came to a stop and got out. I wasn't shaking, or anything. But I was awake then. I inspected my car for flat tires, cracked rims but nothing. Nothing but a large dent in the side of my car from the mile marker I had knocked over. 

Since that time, I obviously have not driven while tired, taking a break and stretching if I even got a slight bit tired. The other side effect is that I am now questioning my life; am I on the path I want to be? Am I in a relationship that is good for both my girlfriend and myself? Are we heading the same direction? What is it that I want in life before I die because I only get one chance, and I nearly lost it that morning. "

I'm in a bit of a pickle. I came to Germany in the end of June for a summer internship after a year studying abroad in Australia (I'm from Brazil). My boss was in charge of my work visa but this week I found out that it was all a lie. I had no ongoing application for a work visa and my tourist visa is about to expire.

I have a return ticket for the 30th, but my visa expires on the 17th and my brother and sister in law are visiting me next week... It was set that I would return with them. Has anyone here ever overstayed their visa for a couple of weeks? What happened?

I read online about people who got fined and banned from europe for x years, but they all had spent at least 6 months illegal.

I really want to travel with my bro and really don't want to pack up and leave in a hurry, plus pay a lot for rescheduling my ticket on such short notice. If this happened to you or someone you know, or maybe you work at customs in europe, were/would the the implications be serious? I've contacted the authorities and they said there is no way to extend my visa at all.

I'm not sure whether I have a question, just need to write out my thoughts, or what... but I could use perspective on my situation. Sorry for the wall of text!


So here's the situation. My ex and I dated for a few months short of 3 years. We met in college and had a fun and loving relationship. He was my first serious boyfriend, my first love, and we had (have) a ton of common interests and had really great times together. Things weren’t always perfect, and we broke up twice before. The first break up was after a year of dating, he wasn’t sure he wanted to be together, didn’t want to miss out on the college experience (and other girls), whatever. We ended up getting back together after a few tearful conversations. Things were going pretty well, and we ended up breaking up a year later because neither of us wanted to do long distance while he was away for an internship over the summer. Well, we wound up talking almost every day and got back together soon after he moved back. 


Things again were great between us after that, until I got closer to graduation. I graduated in May, got a great full time position in my field right after graduation, and he has another semester left in college. I started to feel like our relationship was like a ticking time bomb, because I was so uncertain about what would happen when he graduated. We both agreed we wouldn’t want to do long distance, but we did talk about eventually being together in the same city, depending on where he found a job. Even still, nothing was certain and we hadn’t fully committed to staying together after college. I hated feeling like our relationship had an expiration date. 


Fast forward to 2.5 months ago, he visited me for a weekend (he was living in a different state for the summer for another internship. We agreed to give a LDR a try this time). That Sunday he tells me that he has decided he wants to go to grad school after graduation, and would most likely move to a different state (Colorado or somewhere on the West coast) for school. He also says he isn’t sure what he wants out of a relationship. I tell him that I don’t want to delay the inevitable, and that we should break up since he clearly doesn’t see a future with me and we were headed for a break up come December anyway. It was a REALLY hard thing to do. The breakup was incredibly difficult and it hurt so badly to know he didn’t want to include me in his future plans. I maintained NC except for a few conversations which happened several weeks apart. I spent the time since the breakup thinking critically about the relationship, working on moving on, and trying to better myself. 


Recently, he’s moved back to town to finish school, and last Sunday we ended up at the same friend’s house to watch football. We ended up talking about school, work, life, etc. I handled it totally fine, but the next day all the emotions rushed back to me. Yesterday we met up to talk again, this time about the relationship instead of just catching up, and it’s left me feeling very conflicted. He told me that he is sure that he wants to be with me, and is worried that he will end up not moving away and that he’ll have screwed everything up by breaking up over a move that never happened. He still seems unsure about his own future, but now somehow is so certain he wants to be with me, when several months ago he was uncertain about what he even wanted from the relationship. I told him that I thought we should continue to be apart, work on ourselves and think about things, and that we should revisit the conversation in a few months. That’s the jist of the conversation. 


So, I am conflicted because I was feeling okay about the break up, I had accepted it…but now I know he doesn’t want to be broken up. And I’m not sure if getting back together in a couple months is a good idea, considering our history of breaking up and getting back together. Granted, we are older now and more mature, but I’m worried I’ll get hurt all over again. 


I hope that makes sense. If I left out any important information, please let me know. I’m just really confused. I am planning on continuing to do my own thing for the next couple months, but I want to know if I am doing the right thing to consider getting back together. Thoughts? Opinions? Thank you for reading.

**tl;dr**: My ex and I broke up 2.5 months ago because he decided to move for grad school and didn’t know what he wanted out of a relationship. We’ve recently talked and he’s sure he wants to be with me, and I’m not sure if getting back together is a good idea or not.

My history with depression/anxiety is a long, winding, exhausting one. 

I remember the day that it started, I was on my road bike, on a long sunday ride that usually turns out to be a grueling, tough ride. I had noticed that I was not able to breathe in fully and take a long, satisfying sigh as I was usually able to do whenever I needed, this was my first sign.

Later that day, I tried to have my usual Sunday afternoon nap, but I was not able to fall asleep and noticed my heart beating faster and a lot harder than usual. It was a weird feeling and an odd incident since I was always able to nap like a baby after bike rides. This was my second sign.

Later through that summer (which was the summer of 2011) I noticed that I was developing anxiety, was not able to sleep consistently, noticed my heart pounding through my chest for no reason, being nervous about insignificant things and the such.

I was prescribed Xanax to help with my sleeping (which helped, but gave me nightmares and I was nervous about getting dependent on medication) but stopped after a month or so of taking it at night to sleep.

Then came the depression. It slowly built up, and it came out of nowhere. I had nothing to be sad about, I was doing well in school, I had a beautiful girlfriend that deeply cared about me, my parents gave and still give me support whenever I need it, and I have two brothers which I love (but we're not extremely close, I guess you could say.)

I was getting sad for no reason at the most random times. I would get excited about doing something, but then when I had the chance to do it, I was not excited to do it anymore and would cease doing said activity.

The biggest example of this was my piloting lessons. I currently have 36.4 hours toward my Private Pilot License and my goal in life was to end up being a Commercial Pilot flying airliners for one of the major airlines, and I was dead set on it. When I first started taking lessons, I was extremely excited, and couldn't wait for the next time I could step foot into the little Cessna 172 and continue the training.

Eventually though, that excitement turned into more of a chore, something I forced myself to do, realizing the depression had turned it from a hobby, into something I thought exciting, and when I was actually flying the plane, wanted to just stop and go home.

This depression crept into every aspect of my life, including my girlfriend, my family life, my social life, everything.

At one point during last summer/fall(2012) I was finding my brain exploring thoughts about - ""How fucked up would it be if I shot myself?"" and I would picture myself holding up a gun to my head and thinking ""Fuck, that would be crazy, fuck that.""

Even though I could rationalize to myself that it would be incredibly stupid to shoot myself, I couldn't explain why these thoughts were creeping in to my head.

Along with those thoughts, thoughts like ""You should break up with your girlfriend. You're not going to marry her, you could find someone better. Break up with her."" were constantly in my head, and I had no explanation as to why. I was extremely content with my girlfriend, we were one and the same, we understood each other, we enjoyed each other's company, but for some reason, when I was doing something not even remotely related to her, these thoughts would creep in time after time.

Finally, we come to the title of this post, and one of the reasons why I'm asking for help here.

I find myself needing stimulants to get excited about anything, or even be able to force myself to tolerate doing something, be it school, home work, talking to my family, communicating with my friends, anything.

I was doing an IT internship at the Department of Veteran Affairs in DC this summer and found myself needing to hop myself up on coffee to go talk with a user that needed help, or to get the energy to keep working every day.

Now, after school or work, I find myself rushing home for no reason, because once I get there, I'm back to being extremely anxious and depressed because I haven't hung out with friends (granted, they're busy with school and their social lives too), I have no one to talk to (my girlfriend decided that she had had enough, and she has way more than her fair share to deal with regarding her family situation as well, so I can't fault her)

It's like I want to hang out with friends or research an interesting programming or computer science subject, but when I actually start doing it, I get anxious/depressed enough so that I want to stop doing it and just go back to bed or do nothing.

This needing an external stimulant to feel regular, happy, or motivated has been going on for about a year now, and I'm sick and tired of it. I want to be able to wake up, feel like going for a run or to the gym, and keep motivated throughout the entire workout or run, and not feel like just giving up, going back home and doing nothing.

This need for an external stimulant has caused me some problems with alcohol, meaning that I tend to overdrink to ""try and keep the buzz going"" which often leads to drinking a little too much, or when I stop, I come back down to earth to the same depression and anxiety.

I am currently on paxil and have been on it since February, and it has helped me sleep, and also suppressed a lot of the anxiety part of my condition, but not completely. I still feel depressed a lot of the times, or lacking motivation to do anything, while toning down a lot of the other emotions such as happiness, sadness, etc. I feel like I am a robot who is just 'eh' about everything, not happy, not sad, not excited, just not having any emotions.

I have visited my school's psychiatrist and I was visiting her once a week before my summer internship, but I have not been back since school started. I'm still not sure if it helped or not. It helped being able to talk about what I feel, but some of the suggestions she was giving me, my brain categorized as being 'dumb' and 'useless' so I quickly forgot about them after the session and thus never implemented any of the techniques she had suggested.

Can anybody give me some other advice that I can use to get me out of this seemingly endless hole that I am in? I know it's mild compared to what others are going through, but I just can't stand this 'eh' feeling any more."

I make $1500/month (take home)from it during the summer, $500/month (take home) during school. It is a seasonal job though, so May - October. 

I am planning to not touch any of my savings until university when I'm 17. The question is... How much of my savings should I use right off the bat for paying of tuition, food, rent etc.? 90%? 80%? How much should I leave for myself? My parents have ~35k saved for me through RESP (university fund) and are planning to bring it up to 50k at the end of this year. 

I have set my mind on attending university for Computer Science, and the school I am planning on going to has the best co-op (internship) program in the country. It will be paid, and I would be able to use the money from there to pay off expenses and debts. I am planning to live as frugally, but healthy as possible in university. My school expenses (residence, tuition, rent) should be $15k-20k each year which equals $60k-80k of total debt in the end. Should I be worried about all these expenses I will be having in the future right now? "
1m9u4j,0,2013-09-12,I [18F] think that I am in an emotionally abusive relationship with my boyfriend [19M] but I don't want to break up.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m9u4j/i_18f_think_that_i_am_in_an_emotionally_abusive/,"Hi everyone! I don’t really know where to begin but I’ll try to provide some background. I desperately need advice.

My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been dating for over a year and a half. He goes to college in Maryland and I go to college in New Jersey.  We frequently get into fights and when we first got together we would occasionally get into fights that would be extremely serious (He would scream at me, call me a bitch, tell me to fuck myself, that he would never talk to me again, that he hated me, he never loved me, I was a waste of his life etc.). I made of point of never cursing at him because I know I hated it. Most of the time I would be the one ending the fight and apologizing. 

We broke up after Prom in 2012 because he wouldn’t let me see my friends and told me I shouldn’t miss anyone if I was with him. He repeatedly called me “a fucking bitch” and told me that he hated me in front of all of his friends. I decided I couldn’t continue the relationship and broke up with him. A few days later we got back together because he was extremely apologetic. He tried to blame it on alcohol and clubbing (we were living in Europe at the time), even though I know it was not the case.

We moved on from that and since then he hasn’t cursed at me much when we fight. There are times when he does act the same way he did at Prom, but he always apologizes. 

I thought that our relationship was doing really well and his behavior was improving until last night.

I was throwing out ideas of when we could see one another again for extended periods of time. I suggested he take a class at Georgetown this summer because I would like to have an internship in DC so we could stay together. He is an international student, so he can’t spend the summer in the USA if it’s not for school. He laughed at me and told me that I was getting ahead of myself (which I know I was, but I was just thinking aloud) and he told me that he thought we would breaking up in the spring. I told him that what he said really hurt my feelings, and he laughed at me and sarcastically said, “sorry for being realistic”. I asked him to apologize and he wouldn’t. He said “I’m not going to be sorry for being realistic. If you want that then you need a different boyfriend”.

I suggest we take a couple-day long break (this is the second time this week he told me to find a new boyfriend) and he told me that I wasn’t working hard enough in the relationship and that it would be my fault if it failed. 

The conversation continued as I told him that he was hurting my feelings and he said that he didn’t care. I went to bed and told him I didn’t want to talk to him for a day”.

This was our most recent conversation:
&gt;**ME**: Please just stop talking to me. I’m done for today
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Ok I will. I'll stop talking to you. Don't act like everything is ok. I'm just so pissed. It took a whole 2 days &gt;between me telling you I love you to this. I'm not telling you again Cus it messes everything up. You forget everything so &gt;quickly. That I don't know how this is supposed to work out because at the end of the day who always talks to you when &gt;your having other problems? Who always makes you feel better? Who came to you on Friday cus you had a fight with your &gt;dad? ME. But it doesn't matter to you. All it takes is a bit of uncertainty on my part and you don't want to talk. I'm stupidly &gt;trying to fix this by trying to talk. But nooooo. You're too good for that. So fine. It's your problem. I feel like such an idiot for &gt;doing everything for you. For buying your ticket to visit me in Europe this summer. For always buying everything for you. I &gt;did that cus I thought this could work
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: Stop. I'm leaving my phone in my dorm. I can't believe you just said those things to me
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Thanks for ruining my day 
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: maybe well talk next week 
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Ok. Have a nice life. I'm done. If you want to keep me you'll do what you need to do. If not have fun.
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: We should talk again on Tuesday. I have never been more hurt by you
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: We're not talking on Tuesday. In fact were never talking again unless I hear some real things from you. I'm not &gt;going to sit around Like an idiot waiting for you to talk. If you want to fix this it's up to you. If you wait till Tuesday I won't &gt;be there. It's up to you.
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: You should reread the things you said to me 
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: I did. You can argue all you want. You should reread it and see how wrong you are. You hit my breaking point. You've done this once before 
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: I didn't do anything 
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: it's when we broke up. I don't care what you say you've done or haven't done 
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: Ok. Bye
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Bye

I think that I’m an abusive relationship but what can I do so that he isn’t so mean? I love him so much and don’t want to break up with him. Do you think our relationship is worth me trying to stay in or should we just break up?

**TL;DR**: I think that I’m in an emotionally abusive relationship, but I love my boyfriend and I don’t want to break up. What can I do to make sure he isn’t so mean or do you think we just need to break up?

1m9trl,9,2013-09-12,My college isn't letting me accept financial aid because of my PTSD. Life story of triumphs and tragedies.,missselfesteem,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m9trl/my_college_isnt_letting_me_accept_financial_aid/,"This is probably going to be long.

I'm sitting here on my toilet, trying to think of a way to make myself feel better.  The last few years have been harder than I ever thought my life would be.  I'm proud of myself for getting through it, and lately it seemed like things were going to get better.  I've had two relatively successful semesters back in school, ended up dropping a class but I thought no big deal, if it helps my sanity then I need to do it!  When last semester ended, I was finally able to get a student job (and keep it!) and tried to save up as much money as I could.  Decided to go part time school this semester, but I didn't have enough saved to pay for it out of pocket.  Tried to get loans/financial aid.  Apparently dropping a class means you have to appeal for financial aid.  I did that, they said they needed more proof that I was fit to return to school.

Now I'm just sitting here asking myself, how do I tell them this story?  How do I let them know that finishing my degree means everything to me?  How can I get them to understand, to have faith in me?  It's such a long story, and I don't know how to tell it.

I had a pretty hard childhood, especially when my parents and I moved away from the rest of my family when I was 11.  They were very strict, as a lot of parents are, but I was also a really obedient kid.  Straight A's all through school, never got into trouble.  Still, they didn't trust me.  They both worked a lot, so I spent most of my time alone, doing chores, creating extra homework for myself (really...  I was doing calculus in 7th grade), inventing flying machines in my head, and writing in my journal, especially in the summer.  We didn't have TV and I wasn't allowed to see friends outside of school or sports.  I excelled on the basketball, volleyball, and cross country team in middle school despite my diminutive size (5'0"" now).  When I reached high school at 15, the coach wouldn't even let me try out for volleyball because of my height.  My dad called me fat and lazy, made me practice with the volleyball team, and forced me to run 7 miles a day to teach me to ""work harder.""  I was also required to practice with and compete on the cross country team.  I developed anorexia, and started having seizures.  By December of my 15th year, I couldn't do much of anything physical.  I convinced my parents to let me transfer to a bigger school with more advanced classes, but refused to be part of sports teams.  If I wasn't in sports, I had to get a job, they said.  So that summer I began my first job at Subway.  Since I was making money, my parents said I had to start paying rent.  My whole paycheck went to rent, and because I was no longer playing sports I didn't deserve clothes or spending money anyway and my free time went to chores and extra homework assignments.  On a summer day just shy of my 17th birthday, I had folded some of my Dad's clothes incorrectly.  He came home in a rage and said I didn't appreciate all that he had done for me.  He kicked me out.  Luckily I had an emergency bag packed already (this was not the first time he had threatened to kick me out) and it was summer.  We lived out of town in the woods, so I walked a few miles on a trail behind our house and camped for the night.  The next day I walked to my friend's house in the next subdivision.  She, thankfully, was housesitting for two weeks and let me stay with her while I figured out what to do.  I got a hold of my mom and she said I couldn't come home, but she would give me an old car of theirs to use.  At least now I had my paychecks.  I bought the cheapest tent I could find and commuted to work from my campsite every day.  I barely ate that summer so I could afford to get an apartment by the time fall and school came around.  Since I was a minor, I wouldn't be able to get one on my own.  An older friend I had from Subway did me a massive favor and signed a lease for me so I could have my own place.  I paid him the rent and he's still a great friend of mine.  That year in school was one of the best in my life.  I finally had some freedom, didn't worry too much about money, and answered to none but my own high standards.  I could finally hang out with friends like a normal teenager, though I was still very straight laced and never partied.  I just spent a lot of time at this basement coffee shop, reading, drawing, and knitting, and chatting with other regulars.  I still managed to get straight A's and take advanced classes even though I no longer had a computer at home.  By the summer before senior year, I was pretty fed up with working at Subway.  I knew I could do better so I applied at a temp agency where they tested computer skills.  I had learned to type really fast when I had limited time to do my assignments, and I got a well-paying temp job entering tax return data in a big warehouse building by the airport.  I was so good at it that when all the temp work was done, they offered me a permanent job at the State government office.  I took it, and finished my high school diploma taking night classes.  I ended up with a 4.0, and the recommendations of many teachers and counselors.

I had quite a bit of money saved at that point and decided it was time to head for the big city.  I moved to Portland and applied for hundreds of jobs.  I had dozens of interviews, but I decided I was only going to choose the absolute best.  I got a paid internship at a litigation research firm.  They were exceptionally nice to me and the office environment was awesome.  It was a gorgeous building and unless you had a meeting with somebody important you could wear whatever you wanted.  They offered me basically unlimited overtime at time and a half, and if you worked more than 10 hours in a day they gave you $40 per diem for dinner (which I usually saved $30 of).  I ended up working about 80 hours a week for a month, and they loved me so much they promoted me immediately, with 50% more pay.  A few months later I got promoted again, and started travelling to work on special projects.  I stayed in a spa in San Francisco for a month, and when I was in D.C. my hotel room had a view of the capitol building.  I went from nothing to more than I ever could have imagined, as a 19 year old kid.  I was the youngest person in the company, and won a bunch of awards at the company party that year.  It was mostly luck combined with a bit of hard work, but I was so proud of myself.

Then things started happening in the company.  I noticed, here and there, little inconsistencies in data.  I would mention them to the higher ups and they would say they would take care of it.  It seemed to happen only with certain cases, and eventually I figured out a pattern.  It was illegal and unethical.  I was disgusted.  I had never before put myself at risk by breaking the law, and I was somehow caught up in this unknowingly.  At that point, they were offering to pay for my tuition at school if I agreed to work part time throughout and come back after law school.  I had always wanted to go to school, but never even considered studying law.  Now I was wrapped up with a company that I couldn't stand by morally.  I finally realized why they had treated me so well.  I was naive, and blinded by the lifestyle, and they thought I would do whatever they wanted because I was a loyal employee.  I had so much money saved up, I decided I would quit and come back to my home state and go to college. I worked until a few weeks before school started and paid out of pocket for my first two years.  In those years, I worked really hard, did very well in classes, and won the campus-wide ""Student Employee of the Year"" award at my new position, and a city ""Outstanding Volunteer of the Year"" award for my work with a local organization that provides low-income housing.  My favorite professor would come visit me at work and told all my co-workers I was his ""star student.""  I was on top of the world again.  I went on a class trip with him to Latin America, where we stayed with a tribe of native people and learned their methods of sustainable farming.  We traveled mostly by boat, and a few days before we left, I got stuck in the back of the boat, where water sprayed everywhere.  I tried to keep my mouth closed but some inevitably got in.  I felt fine until I was in the Atlanta airport, and ordered my first American food in two months.  Ironically, it was a Subway sandwich.  I got very sick and couldn't keep it down before my flight home.  I figured it was no big deal and it was just shock from eat too much after a few months of different food.  I got home and was organizing a big fundraising event for an internship I had with a non-profit organization.  I felt fine for a few days, but was very busy and didn't have much of an appetite.  There was donated pizza at my training event for volunteers and I remember waiting to eat until everything was done because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep it down.  I went to the doctor the next day, and I let them know I had been out of the country.  They said I had probably just picked up a weird virus and they couldn't do anything.  I made it through the day of the event, but was supposed to head out to the coast for a three week vacation with my grandmother the next day.  I went, but I spent a week eating basically nothing.  I would try to eat a little here or there but it would just give me terrible stomach cramps.  I finally stopped eating entirely and started feeling much better.  I still had plenty of energy and in general didn't feel too bad so I wasn't too worried about it.  The day before the vacation ended I decided I was feeling well enough and ate a whole pancake for breakfast.  That was more than I'd eaten at one sitting in about a month.  I became violently ill and my grandma rushed me to the nearest hospital about an hour away.  In the emergency room, they found that I was severely dehydrated and malnourished.  They tested me immediately for giardia, expressing frustration that my doctor in town hadn't tested for it initially.  They gave me a strong antibiotic that made me even sicker for a day, but the next day I felt 100% better.  I don't remember what I ate, but I know it was good.  It changed the way I think about food forever.

A few weeks later, I went on a trip with my best friend and was so lethargic all I wanted to do was eat and sleep.  It was supposed to be my birthday trip so my friend was (understandably) frustrated that we weren't even having any fun.  It just wasn't like me.  We got back and I went to the doctor again.  Mono.  My body was apparently in such a weak state from the giardia that mono lasted about 8 months, if not longer.  I continued to go to school and work, but didn't do as well as I had done before, and by the Spring semester I decided to go part time.  I had fallen into a bit of a depression.  By the time summer rolled around, I was fed up with school and my desk job completely and got a job backpacking in the wilderness.  I had plenty of backpacking experience, but doing it alone was another ordeal.  I felt so strong at times, and incredibly weak at others.  By the end of summer, I was even more stressed out by bear encounters, wildfires, and a mountain lion stalking me, that I quit a few weeks early to go to rainbow gathering, where I thought I might find some peace.

And this is where the real tragedy of my life began.  I was in my tent at rainbow when I was raped and chased through the woods by a drunk/high dread-locked giant who kept yelling he loved me so he was going to kill me.  I spent the rainy night hiding in the woods and in the morning a friend I had made there immediately took me home.  We never talked about it.

I spent the next year jobless, homeless, taking rideshares around the country, living off what I had saved from my backpacking job.  I went by a different name, lived as my alter-ego, and somehow managed to be carefree and recover somewhat.  I came back to my town and got an internship on a farm, where I traded work for room and board.  I met a nice guy who respected me.  I was stuck on the farm because I wasn't making any money, so my boyfriend asked me to move in with him until I could get back on my feet.  I got a job at a thrift store for our YWCA where I thought I would have more resources to recover from my trauma (being a women's organization and all).  I worked there for a year and saved up quite a bit of money.  A male volunteer there, who had dreadlocks, ended up requesting to work with me on each of my shifts, and his behavior (and, admittedly, the dreadlocks) started triggering me.  One day I spotted him from my window sitting in his car near my house, and he didn't move for an hour.  It was too much for me, and I told my supervisor I didn't feel comfortable working with him.  They didn't believe me and refused to release one of their desperately-needed volunteers. I quit and got a job managing a strawberry and raspberry farm for the summer.  They were great people, paid me well and gave me a ton of free veggies.  That summer I got an awesome new apartment and applied to go back to school for the first time in a few years.  I was finally getting my life back on track.  It was a great summer until a few days before my birthday, a week before school started, my boyfriend and I broke up.  I was distraught but began school-provided therapy the day that school started.  I thought I just had social anxiety and had never told anyone about the rape.  A few weeks into therapy I decided it was time.  I was diagnosed with PTSD and we began working on exposure therapy.  My therapist at the time wasn't the right fit for me and the exposure exacerbated my symptoms, leading to me dropping a few classes (I was taking a full course load, but not working).  I stopped and tried to repair myself, but nothing really worked.  It's amazing the different ways trauma can affect you, in ways that seem completely unrelated to what actually happened to you.  At the end of last semester, I started seeing a new therapist who fits me better.  We haven't talked much about my trauma yet, but I feel like I'm doing much better in the day to day life.

However, when I applied for financial aid this semester, I didn't find out until a week ago that I wasn't eligible because of the classes that I dropped.  I have to go through the appeal process and in order to do that my therapist has to say that I've improved enough to return to school.  I talked to her earlier today, and it doesn't seem like that will happen.  I even called up my parents, to see if they could help me with the $2,000 I need for tuition.  I've never asked them for anything before, but in a way I feel like they owe it to me.  For me, it doesn't even seem like that much money, except that I have no way of getting it by next Tuesday.

Basically, all these little steps I've taken over the past 3 years have built me up to this point.  I am finally feeling much better, but to have school taken away also means that I can't work my student job, which will be another set back.

I hope everything comes through.  I'm just crossing my fingers at this point, because there's nothing else I can do.  I've worked really hard just to stay afloat these last years.  I was starting to feel like I was on top of it again.  Based on my past experiences, I know I can overcome pretty much anything, I'm just getting impatient.  I'm trying SO HARD, but it's such a slow process.  I just have to keep reminding myself to stay optimistic, to take pleasure in the little things, and not blame myself.  I'm trying, that's all I can do.

1m9ci0,3,2013-09-12,How difficult is it to obtain an internship?,Andhurati,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1m9ci0/how_difficult_is_it_to_obtain_an_internship/,"Greetings, r/Actuary. 

Currently, I have a 3.5 GPA and I am planning to take the first exam in either January or February. Should I wait to take the second exam before looking for internships or should I gun for them right after the first exam (assuming I pass). I just began studying 3 days ago and I can't tell how much studying I really need.

Will I have trouble looking for internships with 2 exams passed? I hear that the profession is very saturated. How many people actually make it passed the first 2 exams and get an internship?

Edit: Also, my college has a Actuarial Sciences course. Currently I study Computer Science. Should I switch, or stay with it (I've already taken 3 semesters of calculus and I am taking ""Probability and Statistics"" right now)."

1m8o3i,0,2013-09-12,"FR (good girl, so close to going home with me) + question about ASD reframing",[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1m8o3i/fr_good_girl_so_close_to_going_home_with_me/,"Hey guys, I haven't posted here before but I need some advice now. The reason why I post here and not on askseddit is because the question is more general and the following is just a good example case that happened today, also the FR part might help some guys out there.

The girl: Taiwanese, beautiful, health conscious (skinny, doesn't drink, exercises), self-disciplined, traditional values, dancer and does masters for teaching English, 25yo, had 2 bfs, last kiss 3 years ago, considers herself to be a ""good girl"" (hasn't had sex outside of a relationship), I met her on okcupid

She is very into me, said the compliments I gave her are the best she ever got and said I have good genes (she likes my eye color, hair, height, skin color) and a lot of other IOIs etc.

(tl;dr below)

The situation:
I'm currently in Taiwan for an internship, will leave the country on the 27th, the girl lives in a different city far away and is only here for 3 days (yesterday, today and tomorrow).

Yesterday we ate spring rolls together for lunch but I was so tired from the night before that I didn't really escalate and my tonality and posture weren't the best but she was always touching me on arms etc. and today she asked if I wanted to accompany her to visit an exhibition in a museum because her friend can't go. I know it's her frame but still agree because what do I have to lose and I haven't been to that museum yet, and I tell myself to escalate more today because I felt really bad for not doing it yesterday (but today I was also tired because last night I pulled a girl from the club and only slept ~4 hours).

It's an exhibition about Aliens, not very interesting (nothing new), but dimmed lights etc. and I escalate, and there is a dark room where one could go through a 3d maze of lazers and if one triggers a lazer it's game over (like in James Bond movies (no idea what that has to do with Aliens but whatever)) so I see the opportunity and tell her we should go through that maze, at the end I go in for the kiss, she verbally objects slightly at first but holds her mouth close to my mouth expectantly, so I kiss her and she reciprocates, with tongue (very good kisser).

Then we go out and to some private corner, make out etc. we walk around and asks me when my last kiss was, whether I lie to girls, if I still like my ex gf etc.

We continue walking around in circles and making out in between, there are no people around...

She always reciprocates when I kiss, also escalates me and moans when I make out against a wall etc.
She tells me her last kiss was 3 years ago, she has traditional values etc.

She really wants to have sex (and tells me that she wants but can't) but has this internal conflict, says it's too fast and she wants to get to know me better first, but she often says we are a great match...

I breathe slowly and tell her she should follow her feelings and that it's not wrong just because society tells her that etc. And I tell her I'm good in bed (all girls I've been with said I'm a 10 in bed) and she won't regret etc. but she is afraid that I'll break her heart somehow..

During the makeouts she always says ""this is crazy"" and shaking her body while laughing and she got very close to going home with me and asking me if I use condoms. But always objects something like ""I don't wear sexy underwear"" (""You don't need underwear to be sexy""), ""I'm not prepared"" (""What do you mean?"" She tries to explain it but is ashamed, I didn't quite understand what she meant, she said something with ""finger"" and mentioned again that her last sex was 3 years ago, maybe she meant her pussy has gotten too tight during those 3 years and she hasn't prepared it with her finger? Does that even happen? Did you guys ever come across this?). 

After I invalidate all her excuses she wants to come with me, asks me how far my place is.

Her relative is planning to pick her up in half an hour, and she wants to make a call to tell him she has ""other plans"", but then at the phone she talks for a very long time (like 20 minutes) (in Chinese of course, and my Chinese is too bad to understand) during which I kiss her, play with her hair and kiss her neck and afterwards she said he'll pick her up soon so she can't go. Then we have to go outside where he's waiting with the car.

I tell her then we meet tonight but she can't, ""then tomorrow"" - ""maybe"".


I really like her and the fact that she is health conscious and has good self-discipline and strong values etc. and if I was here longer I would want to start a relationship with her.

Btw, I'm 22, lost my virginity in July with my first gf (had her for one month) and have been practicing like mad (my friends call me ""THE MACHINE"") since I'm in Taiwan (beginning of August), mostly club and online game. (I haven't posted on seddit before because so far I learned everything from other sources and feedback from girls)

tl;dr: Awesome girl, really wants to have sex but has a rule against it and has strong values and self-discipline.


My questions:

1. What's the best reframe for this internal conflict?

2. What did I do wrong, should I have used more push/pull or something else? (so that I can do better next time) I think I could have done something better when she was so close to going home with me before she changed her mind (but what? she had to make the call).

3. How to overcome ASD with girls who really are ""good girls"" (most articles only deal with ASD that promiscuous girls put up). I'm always tempted to argue logically (I'm good in bed, you won't regret, it's a win-win situation) but girls respond more to emotions than logic. But is it unconducive to say those things? And how to convey the same message emotionally?

4. What's the best strategy to get her tomorrow? (getting her drunk is out of the question because neither her nor I like to drink and drunk sex sucks. Also she told me one of her requirements for a bf is that he doesn't drink which I like)

5. When she was on the phone talking for so long what should I have done? I know some guys would take the phone away but that would have made her mad. Also, was it counter-productive to kino her while she was talking on the phone (projects too much neediness?)

6. Did I behave too needy in general because of not using ""push""?

(The questions apply to any girl with similar background, so they are more general)

I'm not desperate for her (have other girls) but I'd like to know what I could have done better or how I could get such a girl in the future. Because the other girls I get are usually more promiscuous but I want to be able to get non-promiscuous girls in the future too.

I know you may think the best strategy would be to play longer game over a series of dates with such girls, but she's only here for 3 days and I'm only in Taiwan until 27th.
I'm sure some guys out there have gotten such girls in 3 dates or less so I'm interested in how it's possible in general.


If I were a girl and really attracted to a guy so that I wanted him for a relationship I'd probably also wait a few dates before having sex (so as not to appear easy) but if I knew he wouldn't be available for a relationship (esp. moving away so that he couldn't tell anyone) then I'd probably fuck him earlier (because then I can't hold him anyway). Is that just me or do you think it's a good strategy instead of giving a girl hope for a relationship to tell her that it won't lead to a relationship and that she should ""enjoy life"" while she is finding someone for a relationship? (She asked me what will happen after I leave, I said, she'd find someone else and be happy, and that she should enjoy life.)"

I am currently living in South Carolina and I'm moving to Rochester from December to mid-summer for an internship. I've already talked to someone there and they've given some good advice on living, but I thought I'd get some more opinions.

I'll be working near the Greater Rochester International Airport and I'd like to be within 30 minutes of driving distance to work.

In summary:

* 2 bedroom
* Within 30 minutes of Greater Rochester International Airport
* $700-900 is a good price range.
* 6-8 months lease, December to June/July
* Very preferably furnished, as I don't have any way to bring furniture from SC
* I prefer a house over an apartment
* I like quiet, and would like to avoid places that are prone to partying or any places that have a lot of families and young kids screaming.

Thanks and I'll answer any other questions if I wasn't clear!"

But I'm stuck on if there's a better place for my type of mindset.

I'm a third year Computer Science student. I've worked on a small start-up project on campus and helped shape their product. I've left that group last year due to class work but they're still moving forward with the product, even competing in some shark tank events. 

Anyway, I'm the type of person who likes to think out of the box. I enjoy coming up with new concepts, big ideas, and new ways to apply technology. I'm not really sure where I would best fit within Microsoft's internship programs. I've talked to the recruiter about Microsoft's research internships for undergraduates but she stated that there was a slim chance I'd be picked as well as explained that new stuff isn't always developed in Microsoft research first. I've definitely seen the videos of the things Microsoft research pumps out and they inspired me to pursue that internship.

I'm wondering, of the internship positions available, which I'd fit best. I'm always open for programming software so SDE and SDET are still my plan, but I just want to know if there's a specific program that focuses on bringing in new ideas in which I could leverage my creativeness in."

1mc7w5,55,2013-09-13,How to Network,omen2k,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/1mc7w5/how_to_network/,"One of my biggest pieces of advices for getting a job after you graduate is and always has been to network, and to start networking before you leave university. To be honest, this applies for almost any and all professions, and it absolutely 100% applies to geology based careers. 

I can't understate it: networking is an extremely powerful tool. People that are good at networking can get jobs they would have never even be able to submit a CV for otherwise. Those who are good at networking will get chosen for jobs over other people even if they are less qualified. People who are good at networking can turn a coffee-making internship into a staff position. People that are good at networking can get past the Great Wall of HR and straight into staff positions. 

Networking is kind of a subtle art and you will need to have skills in many areas. Being able to talk coherently about a wide variety of topics, to people from all walks of life, and being able to ask questions are all things that take practice. A fantastic way to develop these skills is to join many different societies at university without taking your friends with you. Debate societies in particular can be really good for developing your 'gift of gab' and being able to think on the spot. 

However universally what gets posted immediately after I mention this is usually 'how do I network?' and so I thought I'd write up some of my thoughts and experiences. 

Note: I work in the O&amp;G industry so can only really comment on my experiences. My experiences will probably differ from others and so I welcome people to disagree with me in the comments or offer their differing advice!


**PLACES TO NETWORK:**

- Various Geology Society meetings: There are lots of societies around the world and they usually meet up once or twice a month in major cities.

- Conferences: these are great because they usually have special deals for students and even special events that help you get around and meet people. Your professors might also be attending and can help you get around and maybe even wangle getting your trip paid for! Maybe you can help out on one of their workshops? Also everyone there is usually getting boozed up at around 5pm and are much more friendly than usual. 

- Linkedin: this is a great tool to start learning about your specific interests via groups, however that said DO NOT: go on and just post your resume saying you're looking for work. DO: say you're looking for a company to do your summer project with or an internship with and why (summer project is preferred). 

Getting to one of these venues, how you're going to pay for it, which ones to go to, I will leave to the comments section, but the main thing you need to know is that there are many opportunities to network and you need to find the ones that suit you and figure out a way to get there. 

and now that you're AT one of these venues…


**HOW TO NETWORK**

- YOUR MISSION: to go to one of the aforementioned events, talk (about anything) to as many people as possible, get their business card or contact information, leave on a high note and add them on linkedin when you get home. I had around 200 contacts to follow up on after I went to a week long conference, your goal is to beat my score. 

- If you are sociable, friendly, funny or attractive, then this will be a huge advantage already. Your appearance will be 80% of their impression of you, and you can quit your bitching now because it's a fact of life. If you are fat and unattractive you will be at a huge disadvantage, and you should get an expensive haircut and wear an expensive suit to compensate. 

- Talking to people is sometimes difficult, because they're usually 20 years older than you and have very little in common with you, other than you both studied the same subject and you're both at the same event. In all honesty, many people will simply not be interested in talking to you, so if you try to strike up a conversation and it doesn't go well don't worry about it and move on. I can recall once going to a geology society meeting and being politely but firmly ignored by just about every person there… it was horrible. But don't worry, it might have been them, not you. Besides they were probably really boring and you would have hated working with them anyway. If the room is really sour then just gather up everyone else your age and go out to the nearest bar. And speaking of bars…

- DO: make small talk to anyone standing next to you in the line to get coffee, at the bar of the venue, or anywhere else you're forced into close contact with other people. In fact I got my first technical job because I made small talk to the geologist in front of me in the queue to get coffee. 

- DO: make it a point to go to every single booth at the conference and find out everything you can about that company and what they do. Those people are being paid to talk to you and this is the easiest networking available. 

- DO: talk to the people who aren't geologists. There are usually groups of people who are administrators, HR, or services people (i.e. they might supply hard drives to large oil companies or something but aren't technical) at these things who somehow get invited and are merrily taking advantage of the free drinks and food. Almost always, I have found these people to be extremely friendly and open to talking to me, and almost always, they have found out I was looking for work and helped me by introducing me to their bosses and colleagues. 

- DO NOT go around asking for jobs. Sooner or later they'll ask you what you do and you can just simply mention whatever your situation is and move on, but don't try to force it into the conversation. 

- DO: read up on the current world news (especially your industry-related news). Have something ready to say about fraccing and global warming. Spend evenings watching TED talks, because it will give you a huge spectrum of random interesting conversation topics to bring up. It is extremely refreshing after an entire day of miscible flow through fractured carbonates to have someone start telling you about the latest advances in cryogenic freezing… after all you are talking to geologists, we're very curious creatures. Being a politics junkie is also sometimes good for conversation but I've seen people go off the deep end bashing on republicans or something and looking like an idiot. 

- DONT: be so serious. You're having fun remember?

- REMEMBER: Brevity is the soul of wit: be aware of your audience and don't be one of these assholes who just wants to talk at people. 

- DO NOT read books about NLP or subconscious mind manipulation… you will probably look like a twat. Instead, listen to some high-energy music before you go into the venue, focus on being positive, cheerful and confident, and genuinely being interested in the person you are talking to. Being relaxed is important because it will cause other people to become relaxed too. But in fact on that subject…

- BE YOURSELF. The cool, calm, relaxed, confident and positive version of you is going to be a million times better than the version of you that is trying to be assertive, strong willed or whatever bullshit HR has convinced upper management you need to be to get a job there. 

- DON'T: only hang around with your uni buddies who are at the same event and are also looking for jobs. But, that said: 

- DO: always be happy to introduce them to whoever you're talking to and let them in on the same contacts as you. If they leave a good impression on whoever you're speaking to it will reflect well on you as well. In fact with the right friends you can work well as a team to meet people because you know the other person intimately. For instance 'I'd like to introduce my good friend Mark, I apologise if he looks a little dishevelled, he's just come back from a 5 month trek through the Himalayas' is an easy conversation starter and makes your friend Mark look good. Also you've just told this senior manager guy that you hang out with people who enjoy being in the Himalayan mountains, so how cool do you look now.

- DO: always help your friends get jobs. You will likely see them for the rest of your career and they will remember you helping them (unless they're an asshole). I am single handedly responsible for 3 of my friends having jobs in the last few years and it has paid me back several times over. 

- REMEMBER: people's names. There are a hundred ways to do it but it is important and it does make a difference. Having said that, don't beat yourself up if you forget one and just politely apologise and ask them their name again. 

- LUCK: is going to play a bigger part in this than you might like, but work with it and trust that things will work out in the end. Put yourself in a place where good things can happen to you. 

**USING YOUR NETWORK**

Now that you've successfully built this gigantic monstrosity of a LinkedIn network, what do you do with it? 

On the first tuesday after the event, message everyone you met saying it was great meeting them and to let you know if they are ever aware of any positions for a junior geologist, or whatever. Whereas bringing it up in conversation would have made things awkward, doing this is totally acceptable. Hopefully, someone will take pity on you and work something out. In my experience though, out of 200 or so people I messaged or contacted only 5 or 6 had any leads for me to follow up on, so don't get your hopes up and don't get disappointed if it doesn't work out.

Mention their names when you go to interviews at their companies, or even better ask them for an informal reference before you have one or if they want to get coffee while you're there. 

Even better, when you finally do have a job, imagine that you hit a wall with your work and don't know what to do next. You scan your network and fire off a friendly email to that really eccentric but helpful bearded guy who was an expert in what you're working on, and he not only sends you back several relevant papers to read but also a PDF manual in the software you're working in. BINGO. 

Find out what groups your contacts are using and join them. Ask relevant questions in message boards or look for opportunities there to do your projects and internships. 


**CAREER NETWORKING**

Just because you now have a job does not mean you can sit back and relax. I cannot understate the importance of networking when you have a job. 

Always try go for beers with your colleagues/bosses after work, even if they're in a different department to you. Always take part in company social clubs or committees. When your company suddenly has to get rid of half their workforce they'll be reluctant to get rid of you. 

Be helpful. When you notice a problem you can solve even in another department, go out of your way to solve it. For example a company I was temping at had some interns finishing their jobs doing menial work over the summer and were about to give a presentation to the exploration manager. They were really disorganised and their presentations weren't very good. I sat in and offered points on presentations and then spent an hour with one of them refining his presentation. They ended up being praised for their work. Their boss ended up hiring me a few months later over another person because of that incident. 

Branch out to the other departments of your company even if they don't do technical work. IT guys are your best friends and are almost always the nicest most helpful people I have ever met. Go for beers with them and find out what they do.  

Above all, do not just sit there and do your job and then go home. 


**SOME EXPERIENCES WITH NETWORKING**

As I mentioned, my first technical job out of university was from striking up conversation with a geologist in front of me waiting to get coffee. She recommended me to another company who gave me an interview and hired me. 

I initially turned down a job once when I was unemployed because I was waiting for an offer to come through from a more relevant job. However, critically, I suggested they talk to one of my classmates who was also unemployed and they ended up hiring him for a different and much better job. My offer didn't come through, but he had done such a good job they wanted another worker and they ended up hiring me to work alongside him. 

Out of the 200+ contacts that I made at the aforementioned week long conference, usually spending around 4 hours a day going around and talking to people, almost all of them are in my LinkedIn network, around half of them replied when I messaged looking for work, and around 5 or 6 of them had leads for me to follow up on. I ended up in my current job with one of them, after speaking to the COO of the company at his booth. I would estimate that out of the 200 contacts I made, I had around 100 bad conversations with people that didn't want to talk to me and led nowhere.

===

So! Did not expect this to be so long, but this is what I've learned from 5 odd years of my career, hope that helps someone and maybe generates some interesting comments with other people's experiences. Feel free to call bullshit on anything I've said or offer your opinions, as I said I can only talk from my point of view.

I have been tasked with buying branded products for an upcoming event. The event is called ""Tech Week"", and ideally the design would like to incorporate a technical theme and these words.

I tried to incorporate different elements of circuitry (such as [these](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/design/systemscontrol/electronicsrev5.shtml) ) as well as ideas of sound and programming (C#).  

This is what I need:  someone to take the design and make it usable.  I need a high-quality image that would look good when embroidered.  This means all the letters and elements would be thicker and the same size.  If you can come up with something way better than my design, I'm open to that too!!

1mbv9k,13,2013-09-13,"My ""eating"" anxiety is ""back""...felt sick monday and now am barely eatin cause I'm afraid...",konteco,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbv9k/my_eating_anxiety_is_backfelt_sick_monday_and_now/,"Hello, gonna try to make this short guys, appreciate anyone who helps !

So, last year I joined the gym, and on the 5th month at it, I started a new diet to gain some weight, and on the very first week I had a ""diarrhea"" and a discomfort on my stomach from eatin and the things I ate(a lot of milk, oats...), guess you know where this took...wanted to know why this happened, became ""obssessive"" and bam thought I was sick and had digestive issues etc etc. Went to the doc and by the exams he said I had nothin, that it was psychological and all pointed towards anxiety...fast foward 6~8 months I grew some balls, talked to myself a lot and decided  to confront it and to overcome it, started exercising again(at home) and eatin better, I couldn't even run a little without feeling weird/sick !

So, now, September 2013, somewhat cured, I got a intern job and got back to the gym this week, on Monday, my first day, I trained ok felt nothing, was even a hell of a lot hungry after it, got back home, took a shower and went to have dinner, after the second bite I started feeling a ""heat"" coming up my neck(when we turn real red) and the food I swallowed ""floating"" in my stomach etc...I'm better now but I still have the weird ""symptoms"" towards eatin, I start eating and lose the will to eat, I am hungry out of nowhere, I drink a lil' water and feel bloated for a few mins etc...My blood probably wasn't back to the other parts of the body at that time yet especially the stomach, so when I threw some foods in there, it wanted to put out but it didn't, and now I feel a lil anxious about eating cause I don't want to feel sick(nobody does I believe lol)...And I know this ain't the exact same thing I had last year, because then I felt pain, felt full after eating just a little bit, couldn't poop properly.

I just want to know how I am able to overcome this fully, I believe I have to just ""force eat"" ( an considerable amount, nothing huge ) so my body disassociates the eating feeling with the sick feeling, right?

Thanks guys"
1mbo4j,69,2013-09-13,Women around me are constantly bodysnarking and caught up in fantasies of perfection. Never know what to do/say in response?,youshouldntbother,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1mbo4j/women_around_me_are_constantly_bodysnarking_and/,"I have had this problem follow me around for many years and I don't feel comfortable bringing it up with anyone I know personally, I'm just not one to burden others with work drama like this. 

I work at a magazine, and I've been in and around the magazine industry for many years now, going from clueless hillbilly girl to unpaid intern to freelancer to art director. I enjoy what I do because I love illuminating local journalism, the art of fashion, the dignity of personal style and beauty, etc... I want to continue on with my career path, and I genuinely adore all the fierce, articulate women I am constantly collaborating with. At each of the publishing houses I've been at, women run the whole show. You would think that these offices would be boiling over with girl power, but sometimes, it's quite the opposite, and I want this to change.

The problem is that, with alarming frequency, these women snark on their own bodies and the bodies of others. It's not always just bodysnarking, there's also a bit of fashionsnarking, agesnarking, socialsnarking... Sometimes the comments are harmless and meant to be funny, other times they seem to come from a place of hatred. It doesn't take much to understand that all of us are in this industry because we've been perusing fashion mags since we were little girls. I feel as though I grew up with enough guidance to not internalize the airbrushed figures, to realize that the images in magazines were fantasy, art, not replicable or relevant in real life whatsoever. Some of the older ladies, though they are strategic geniuses and very realistic leaders, still have exaggerated expectations of beauty from themselves and the world around them. 

It certainly doesn't help that I happen to have a figure that they desire. I'm one of those freaks of nature that is tall and thin without paying attention to diet or exercise. Perhaps I am overexposed to the comments about bodies because they think I am victim of the same thoughts they have. Anorexia and bulimia comments pop up every now and then, more in a joking way. One time I wore a necklace as a belt (a long one!) and over and over that day I was subjected to comments about my thinness. Moments like this cause me to stress about what I choose to wear every day. To dissuade from fixation on looks, I have tended to dress down more and more. Loose fits, pants, no heels. I want to be more adventurous in terms of personal style but I don't want to risk enticing comments. I just want them to like me and respect me, but mostly, I want them to like and respect themselves. 

I know that this sounds so lame, that being too thin a problem many women wish they had... It hurts to hear the comments they say about me, but more often it's directed at themselves, and that still sucks a lot. It's a very hard problem to fix, because it's so ingrained in this culture. Often we will be looking through collections of candid photos of events, and every other thing said is ""she looks SO fat here"" / ""omg. that dress makes her look like a stuffed sausage."" / ""that make-up is horrid"" and so on and so forth... I am at a loss for words, do they expect me to insult along with them? What I really want to say is ""That's very rude. She looks confident and proud that her event is so successful."" but that would just make them resent my refusal to play along. So I say nothing and I just nervously semi-giggle. That way I don't actively participate in the shaming but I also don't shame the shamer. How dramatic this all is... 

What can I say or do to help foster a culture of acceptance and self-love in the magazine industry? So far my strategy has been to lay low and remain a beacon of positivity and feminist solidarity, which has been effective to a degree, but I want to branch out to actively demonstrating how and why superficiality and self-loathing harms us all.

1mbdzg,7,2013-09-13,I (23/f) think my mother (49/f) might be a narcissist. Thoughts? Feedback?,sundayseeking,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mbdzg/i_23f_think_my_mother_49f_might_be_a_narcissist/,"I’ve been having issues with my mother (49/f) for a few years now, and I’d like your opinion on these issues. I’ve come to believe that my mother is either a narcissist or has narcissistic traits. Here are some examples of her behavior that I believe fits the characteristics of a narcissistic mother. Any feedback on these and/or advice on how to handle this situation would be much appreciated.

**Gas Lighting:** I’ll give you the most recent example. I was over to her and my dad’s house for the weekend last week. Mom woke me up to tell me that Dad brought us coffee and muffins for breakfast and that I should go into the kitchen and eat because we were going to Costco. I got up and did so maybe fifteen minutes later and my mother came out into the kitchen. She asked me why I was eating breakfast when she told me we were going out to eat. I reminded her that she hadn’t said that. She insisted she’d told me we were going out to eat. I insisted she’d told me we were going to Costco and to eat breakfast at the house, she’d never mentioned going out to eat and she dropped it. I notice that this happens a lot, but I always doubt myself and apologize after questioning her and being told “No one listens to me!”

**No Respect for Belongings:** When I was a toddler, I had a red FisherPrice boat that was a bathtub toy. My dad, being the history buff that he is, named this boat after a World War II Japanese aircraft carrier. This was one of my favorite toys as a child. When reminiscing about this near the beginning of this year, I found out from my mother that I had a whole fleet of these boats. All named after WWII Japanese ships by my father. She threw them all away, couldn’t stand them. But the red one I remembered, and asked for, so she was unable to throw it away successfully. Initially, I thought this was funny … and then I told my fiancé about it. His reaction of complete horror made me realize that maybe this behavior wasn’t normal.

More recently, my aunt gave me some Victoria’s Secret underwear for Christmas. One thong, two pairs of normal underwear. My mom was convinced that my aunt was trying to convince me to sleep with my SO. I never wore the thong. I wore the other pairs, found them to be quite comfortable, and told my mom this. The thong disappeared and reappeared in my underwear drawer several times before going MIA. The other pairs eventually disappeared as well.

**Uneven Expectations:** My mother got very upset with me my junior year of college when I ceased to call her several times a day. For the first two years, I was an emotional trainwreck in need of constant reassurance and she was my security blanket. I would call five or six times a day and talk for up to an hour each time. By the end of my sophomore year, I met my fiancé, and my need to call home lessened. I would talk to him instead, he was better at calming and reassuring me. In addition, I had moved into an apartment with friends, got additional friends, and was in a much more supportive atmosphere than the first two isolated years. My mother was upset that I never called her, guilted me about this, but would rarely call me. Even now, I “never call” but if she needs a paper proofread or her dogs watched or even me to babysit the house so my brother won’t show up with his girlfriend, she calls. She demands. She guilts. And I do it. If I want her to call me, she won’t. If I ask her to visit, she won’t. I live an hour away, but what is too much of a drive for her is no problem for me.

My mother has been to my apartment a grand total of five times. I live an hour away from her and have been in this apartment for over a year. I’ve invited her for dinner numerous times, but always get the same excuse: it’s too far of a drive, I was up at 4am to go to work this morning, I’m tired, I don’t want to leave my dog. When she came over the last time, it was because my brother (who was visiting me) was having issues with his car and needed her and my dad to bring him jumper cables. When she and my dad arrived, she did not want to come up to my apartment, despite complaining that she needed to use a restroom. It took my dad reminding her that I have a functional bathroom to get her upstairs. When I asked, she wouldn’t do it. Later that day I badgered her for an answer on why she won’t ever come over. I pointed out how hurt she told me she was that I didn’t invite her up to my dorm room the few times she was in the area my senior year of college. I told her I was trying to address that hurt and make her feel welcome in my space, but it was hard to do that when she never accepted my invitations. She told me she was trying to give me the space to do what I wanted in life. Because if I extend an invitation to someone, that means I don’t want them to come over, obviously.

**It’s All About Her:** Tell her my fiancé and I are dating? “Why are you doing this to me!?” Tell her I don’t want to go over and babysit the house because my brother’s been unstable lately and I’m afraid of what he and his friends are capable of? “You need to just do what I asked you to do.” Question her on this? “You embarrassed me in front of all my friends, arguing with me on the phone!” and “I didn’t expect you to question me!” Talk to her about my fiancé and try to explain why I don’t think God told me he’s no? “It’s been a really stressful year. My mother is sick. My dog died. I just don’t know how much more I can take!” She cries, she complains, she tells me how “money is tight” for her and my dad. She tells me she feels like a failure as a parent because my brother has gone off the deep end (a story for another time). I feel enormous guilt. I’ve offered to pay their bills. I want to be independent so I’m not a burden. Her life not being perfect flips this “fix everything NOW” switch inside of me. And what’s even more frustrating is finding Facebook chats her complaining to my other aunt about my fiancé, the aunt complaining back (despite never asking me about him or getting to know him), and my mother telling my aunt that “it’s so heartbreaking” and she feels like a “failure as a mother”. What does my aunt tell her? “I won’t let you beat yourself up.” Just WOW.

**Doesn’t Listen to Me or I’m Always Wrong:** While finishing up my senior year of college, I was also working 40 hours a week at an internship. Between my classwork and job, I worked 70 to 80 hours a week. I felt run ragged, insane with anxiety, and like I absolutely could not handle everything going on in my life. During a (rare) phone call, I told her I thought I’d need to see a therapist once the semester was over. I said it in a joking-but-serious way. She told me not to not say things like that, that I would be fine and I wasn’t going to need any psychological help. She told me to keep my chin up. More recently, I spent a week so anxious I felt like I was bordering on a panic attack. This went on for five days. While on the phone with my mother, I told her that my anxiety was so bad I felt like I couldn’t find the off switch and was considering seeing a counselor. I should point out at this point that we are Christians. She told me not to “believe the lie of the Enemy” and went on to ask how often I pray and read my Bible. “Don’t you think it would help if you did that? Don’t you think you should? Why don’t you read your Bible and pray more? You don’t need a counselor.” While I would like to do daily devotionals, I see no problem going to a counselor … especially if my stress level is so high it affects my life in a negative way. But, I’m wrong here, clearly I just need the right perspective to look at my anxiety from. If I prayed more, if I read my Bible more, then I’d be fine. Never mind that the panic is real to me and I’m less and less functional because of it.

**Needing to Control or “Speak into her children’s lives”:** When I got my apartment, my mother made me promise not to have my fiancé stay over. I was paying for the apartment, all the bills, and have never asked my parents for money towards monthly expenses. I never tell my parents when my fiancé comes over and I live in terror of them finding out he does.

This past weekend, my mother joked about being able to push buttons on her kids. She’s done this my whole life, and it’s cute and annoying. Having a grumpy day? She’ll push the happy switch. And so on and so forth. I told her that kids aren’t RC cars and you can’t remote control them. I reminded her that kids are supposed to leave their parents and their parents are called to “train them up in the way they should go”, not control them. “Isn’t it great that I have these controls on my kids?” she says. I tell her “you don’t control me; I control me.”

**Critical:** My mother has told me I chew too loudly, don’t keep my tongue in my mouth when I take a bite of food, talk to loud, stomp instead of walk, encouraged me to “put some effort” into my hair and makeup and clothes, told me I always pick out clothes that look bad on me when we go clothes shopping, and told me that I need different glasses because the ones I have don’t look good on me. When my fiancé tells me I’m beautiful, I don’t believe him. I feel ugly and self-conscious and I hate my body. I feel like other people will not like me and I don’t fit in with them because I’m not pretty enough. My mother is confused as to why I feel this way and will tell me I’m beautiful. I don’t believe her either.

I found your subreddit this past weekend while at my parents’ house and identified with many of the posts. I spent the weekend stressed out and feeling like I was seeing things clearly for the first time. Since then, I’ve been unable to process my emotions. First I’m pure anger and hatred and I want to blow up at my parents and family. Then I’m depressed. Then I’m sad. Then I don’t feel anything. Then I’m panicked. I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel lost and helpless and I just want to run away. But I also feel like I need parental approval.

What do you think of my mother? Any advice on dealing with the emotions I’m going through. Any advice or feedback would be very much welcomed and appreciated. Thank you for listening.

**TL;DR:** I think my mother is a narcissist."

Option A: 

A table with a date, and employee columns (foreign keys to the Employee table) for each support line.

1mat6y,1,2013-09-13,"Just Moved Countries. Lonely, Sad and Desperate.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1mat6y/just_moved_countries_lonely_sad_and_desperate/,"Not really sure what I'm hoping to get out of this, but I haven't really got anyone to talk to here, except for my long-suffering partner who is incredibly wonderful and loving, but who I feel so guilty about constantly unloading myself on. Bit of a wall of text, I'm sorry.

We met a couple years ago and fell in love while he was on vacation in my country. He is just an absolutely incredible person - he's incredibly loving and kind, he makes me laugh, we can talk about anything or nothing and still enjoy our time together, he's intelligent, capable, handsome, and overall just...an incredibly good man. We spent a week together after we first met, and then continued to talk regularly online after he left the country. I came to stay for six months while I was on an exchange at University, and being together was every bit as wonderful as we imagined it would be. I went home for six months to graduate, and then moved to my current country permanently to try and make a solid go of it with him. Our relationship is fantastic - we couldn't be better together, or closer. We treat each other like absolute gold and the amount of love and respect is something I've never experienced.

That's why I feel so guilty. I'm incredibly lonely here. While I was never expecting things to be a piece of cake, I thought they'd at least be a bit easier than they have been. I have been missing my family like crazy since we were very close, and it's only really now starting to sink in that I'll never be able to be close to them in the same way anymore. I feel guilty because I know that they miss me, and the idea of my parents growing old without being around to cherish time I have with them breaks my heart.

I miss my friends very much too. I am quite introverted, and while I'm fine at chatting with people on a regular basis, I have trouble making solid friends. I don't let very many people into my life in a more than superficial way, and the friends I had back home were the solid few who  I've held onto over the years. Now I have nobody.

Making friends has been difficult since we have very little extra money. We're not destitute or anything, but we are definitely struggling to make ends meet right now. I have been looking for a solid job for months now - the job I had last time I was here, even though they said they would be happy to hire me back, has been avoiding my phone calls, and occasionally messaging me to promise shifts they never deliver. I am working an unpaid internship for eighteen hours a week for nothing, while they dangle the prospect of a job in the field I got my degree in in front of me to keep me there doing unpaid labour for them. I have three other jobs, but they don't offer enough hours - each of them will give me maybe one five hour shift a week, which just isn't enough. We're barely scraping by. This means no money and so no friends, and nothing to get me out of my own little world in this country where I don't know anyone - hard to meet up with new friends for drinks when you can't afford to buy one.

I am so incredibly lonely all the time, I feel like my heart is constantly aching. I feel hopeless about the future - I have to pay $4000 for a visa to stay here and I don't know how I'm going to make the money. My family also wants me to come visit them and I am desperate to do it, but I don't know how I'm going to afford it. My dog needs surgery...my boyfriend's shoes are literally falling apart, I can't even afford a haircut. I feel like a complete failure. 

I have worked as a topless dancer in the past and enjoyed it very much, but never wanted to go full nude as I'm uncomfortable with it, and have anxiety issues that I know it would trigger - but I am feeling pressure to find some sort of job that would pay as much as that would. I just feel so much guilt and anxiety whenever I make an appointment with a club here that I wind up cancelling. But then I feel as much guilt and anxiety for the financial burden I'm putting on my boyfriend and...despair, I guess, because I'm not sure what I'm going to do or how I'm going to find the money any other way.

Again I don't know what I'm hoping for in this thread. Maybe to hear that someone has been there or something. I don't know. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm normally a happy person but I can't seem to feel anything but desperation, anxiety, hopelessness, guilt and despair for the past six months. I'm starting to lose hope that I ever will.

Sorry for the rant, Reddit. Just feeling lost."
1masy2,3,2013-09-13,"Had a discussion with GF about writing spec scripts for TV. She was very confused and afterwards, so was I. Is there a better way?",BootStiefel,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1masy2/had_a_discussion_with_gf_about_writing_spec/,"I was explaining to her that there's a show on TV that I really like a ton, seen every episode (some twice) and feel like I really know the characters.  

So I started writing an outline for what I thought would be an amazing episode.  I did the cards, wrote a bullet list, wrote an outline, wrote my huge outline with big details (just my process) and now am taking it to Final Draft.

She asked what my hope was for the thing and I told her that in my heart, I feel like it would make an amazing episode, however everything I've read said that they don't make the specs they get from people trying to get in for legal reasons.  I said I'll be using it early next year for a fellowship I'm going for (nickelodeon) and if not, it might be a good sample for a manager or possibly (i cross my fingers) it could lead to a job.
She said it doesn't really make sense that I would spend so much time working on writing an episode if it was never going to air.  I told her that every script that I write comes with that risk, but to an extent, TV was different.  She asked how.
I fumbled my way through saying that if the people who work on the show and read it, they might like me and make me a writer's assistant.  I said this is the only way that I know of breaking in to TV:

1) You write a spec of a show.

2) You enter contests and try to place or You try to get it sent into said show and you might get work from there.

The intern to assistant to writer's assistant to writer route (to me) is BS.  It is DAMN near impossible to get any of these positions.  I've been trying for quite some time and can't even get a response back.  So for me, writing and having samples is the best way.

Am I wrong?  Is there a better way?  I wasn't looking to rant, but I'm wondering IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO BREAK INTO TV?!"

Soon-to-be Grad needs to pay rent,nonconvergent,atljobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/atljobs/comments/1masj1/seeking_gsu_compter_sci_soontobe_grad_needs_to/,"I'm graduating with a BS in Computer Science in December, but I still have bills to pay and am looking for a headstart. Paid internships or even full employment, as long as it fits my current schedule, which will necessitate something part time. I can do freelance work from home on a contract basis as well.

Skills:
My degree concentration is Database and Knowledge systems, specifically the following skills in addition to the rest of my degree.

* Algorithm design and analysis
* Software Engineering
* Digital image and signal processing: MATLAB, Mathematica, and Octave
* Data visualization
* Relational database design and management - MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL
* Java, C, C++, Haskell, Ruby, Perl 5, Javascript, HTML5, CSS and Android development

And that's just the stuff I'm currently comfortable with...plenty of other stuff in my wheelhouse.  I'm also a Linux guy, but that doesn't mean I'll be lost in OSX or Windows 8 either. The rest of the degree means I have the knowledge, skills, and math to advance myself in the field when the need is there. When I don't know it, I know where to look.

I'm in class afternoons to evenings Monday through Thursday, but I can be available any time otherwise.

I'd love a job doing design, development, that kind of thing, but I'll bug test and be a general wage slave in return for a reasonable amount of money, hours that fit my flexibility. If it's good work, then at the end of the December you've got fresh pics of a recent grad whom you've already had a chance to evaluate.

So if you want someone smart, dedicated, and well motivated by financial desperation, I'm your guy.  If you want someone you can evaluate on a trial basis before deciding to invest in him as an employee, I'm your guy.  If you want someone experience for full time work, I'm not really your guy, but call me when that guy tells you he needs someone to help out.

I live ITP near GSU and Tech, so I'm pretty much central to the entire Metro area as well.

1meb0b,87,2013-09-14,Me(26m) and 26(m) bestfriend have talked about getting married even though neither of us are gay.,gayguythrowaway42,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1meb0b/me26m_and_26m_bestfriend_have_talked_about/,"Met my bestfriend in my first year of college we had the same major and became really good friends. We were roommates throughout all of college graduated and had the same classes together and shit. Afterwards we both got internships at the same company through a school club and we eventually got hired.

We have been doing shit together for so god damn long I can’t even remember its been over 8 years and we have lied with each other for the most of it. We have had our share of girlfriends (even had a threesome together couple times.) like we are the best of bros. A lot of our friends have joked and said we were gay for each other and all. We are both good looking guys.

Me and my bro would often say things like if you were a girl I’d marry the shit out of you and a bunch of other shit like that. Recently though my bro moved into his girlfriend’s place and I was a fucking wreck without him. After 2 months he broke things off with her because he wasn’t feeling right. I had a girlfriend at the time but I was depressed coming home to not having anyone to eat with doing shit by myself.  

We talked about this shit and he said he missed being roommates and all. We have jokingly talked about getting married and adopting kids while still sleeping with girls as weird as that sounds.  I know my parents and his parents would flip shit at the thought but neither of us have any faith in women to get a marriage. It’s not that I don’t like women it’s just that I feel I need some space after a while if that makes sense. I can enjoy a weekend at a gf’s place but as soon as I leave I am excited of returning home. 

Our state recognizes gay marriage, we have legitimately talked about it. Both of us from living in a shitty apartment have enough money to buy a house together and all. 
I don’t know guys I kind of wished we both were gay so we could be a legitimate couple but I think this is an okay idea. My friend said if he could somehow get this over with his parents it would be okay, I talked to my parents and told em and they kept asking if I was gay. I told em I am not gay and they said they would accept it if I was. Which is cool of them and all but not gay. 

We are both getting older and would really like to settle down. We both have a lot of money that we saved up from living in a shitty apartment. 

I don't know if this will work, it sounds like a great idea our heads but yeah. Advice please

**edit 1** - Its not just we want it for a tax benefit. We like the idea of being with each other too and raising kids together. My fears are though how would our kids view us. Would women still be okay with us if they knew we were married. Would our friends/neighbors have any respect for us. It's a lot to think about :/

**edit 2** I really don't think I am gay. I have thought about it, even would like to be but I am not. Trust me everyone has told me I'm gay for this even my own family.

I don't hate women I do enjoy my time with women I just don't like spending too much time with them. I have always been an introverted guy so I guess that doesn't help. I just think I have more meaningful conversations with my guy friends. If I was a woman and I said that I liked talking to guys more that wouldn't make me misogynistic would it?okay then. 

To those people saying I should slow things down I have know this guy for 8 years (lived for 8) and if we got married we'd prenup and all. We have been managing expenses splitting stuff since we were 18.  And yes people have talked about what happens if the perfect girl comes around. Yes I am wary of that but we discussed that kids &gt; everything. And people are asking why do you want to rush into it right now the reason is I don't have anything going on right now. I come home from work usually waste time on my computer and if it's a Friday Saturday night go out. Seriously it is dull as fuck, I don't feel like I am working towards anything. The only enjoyment I get out of my day is when I make a good amount day trading that's it. 

**Edit 3** okay first of all I appreciate the advice that you guys are sharing I have shown my friend and he is looking over the comments as well. Need to reiterate a couple things. 

**We aren't gay** - We aren't attracted to each other, I don't need him to complete me in any way or form. I value him not for a hormonal high but legitimately the loyalty and trust we have for each other. I understand I came for advice but saying you are gay doesn't do anything for me. Believe me this has haunted me for a while I did some self searching and can say I don't feel attracted to men. So please refrain from just saying **Gay in denial** - *op's a faggot** . I don't spend my time talking to him about my day or send him texts filled with emoji's. 

**I respect women**. And its not like I just care about them physically. There have been girls I have wanted to go [Hero for a girl](http://youtu.be/koJlIGDImiU). I just appreciate my personal space. I am currently dating a med school student and we have a great relationship, we see each other once or twice a week have good conversations/great sex ^^. 

**regarding parenting** - me and my friend have enough money to pay our kids through private school a tutor/nanny whatever they need. We both make a decent bit through our careers and aggressive investing. On top of that we will stick around with each other. I feel that our marriage is much stronger than the majority of single parent households and other dysfunctional unhappy marriages. I may have worded my previous edit wrong saying that I am getting a kid out of boredom. I'll try to word it better, I have a biological urge to have a kid, a kid which I can teach him my values, see him grow up. I felt as the stuff I do now is not helping me reach my deeper goals in life. It feels as if hanging out at a bar is just nonproductive just a thing I do to fill up time. 

I really wish some of you guys had the experience of having such a good bromance really is different from just having guy friends.

This means I'm anticipating a lot of expenses on interviewing at residency programs. 

Below, some examples of why I need extra cash on hand now:

The electronic app I submit tomorrow will cost me over $1000 in fees since I am applying to nearly 70 programs all over the nation.

If I interview in California, I understand the flight might be ~$500 roundtrip?

I already scheduled the Step 2 CS and CK exam (required to graduate) and that alone sucked out $1700.

My family has no extra money to lend me and I won't be able to borrow from close friends.

So my options are personal loans, right? I would like about $10000 to cover my living expenses/travel expenses for the rest of my 4th year (until I get my pay check as an intern in summer of 2014). 

I have $4000 in my bank account now, and will receive another $2000 next semester (January) from my school loans for living costs.

Is getting a loan from my credit card company a solution? The APR they offer is as low as 8% for amounts up to $25000 if that means anything.

Any help appreciated. Thanks!"

I have outstanding offers for internships next summers with multiple Big 4 firms, in their NYC offices. Very happy about that and was planning on accepting one, but thought that it was worth it to go through career fairs/recruiting events this semester (my offers don't expire until November), so as to just know what else is available and keep my options open.

I attended a seminar with GE, where they discussed their CDP program, which is aimed at accounting students. You are able to fulfill the CPA work experience through the program, something they didn't used to be able to offer. Here's  a link to the program:

http://www.ge.com/careers/culture/university-students/capital-controllership-development-program

My question is, from a long-term standpoint, do you think that choosing this program upon graduation would be significantly better or worse than a Big 4 audit position? I've been told that there are few positions that will act as a better springboard than the Big 4, so I'm hesitant to give up an offer and pursue these other positions.

1mdmfp,2,2013-09-14,"Girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me, starting to think I was never really in love, but I still miss her so much.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mdmfp/girlfriend_of_6_years_broke_up_with_me_starting/,"It has been about three weeks since we broke up, and boy was the first week a living hell. I couldn't focus on anything, felt like my life was falling apart, and that I would be alone forever. I have started to feel a lot better recently, but I still find myself going over our relationship in my head, and figured this would be a good place to put everything on the table and get some good feedback. 

I met her when we were 17, and I had just gotten out of a terrible relationship that I had been in for 2 years. My ex at the time was a very mean and abusive partner, and this new girl just seemed so perfect. She was extremely nice and fun to be around, the opposite of my ex, and I just knew I wanted to be with her. 

Fast forward two years, she has gone off to college (about three hours away) and I stayed at my parents place and went to a local college. We maintained a long distance relationship with some success, it was very hard at first, but I did not find myself missing her too much. I think this is the point where we started to grow apart. We stopped talking as much as we used to, stopped surprising each other with things. 

She graduates from college and moves back home. I am now living in an apartment with some friends and I want her to come live with me. She doesn't think it would be practical to live together, and ends up living at her parents house again while she goes to graduate school. This summer, I had been extremely busy with an internship, and spent most, if not all of my time traveling to conferences and working on my research. I didn't think about her much, didn't call her or text her very much, and it certainly did not bother me that we were apart. 

End of the summer (about three weeks ago), we are at her house, and she starts talking to me about how we have different interests and how we don't like the same things. This has always been true, we have never liked the same movies, music, books, anything at all really. We keep talking and eventually she tells me that having been apart so much she doesn't want to see me as much as she thinks she should, and that we almost never see each other anymore. She tells me that she got used to never seeing me, and that she wants to break up.

This hit me like a truck, I instantly began crying and felt like the world was going to end. I told her how I could try harder to be with her more and I could try harder to talk to her more. After a very long and terrible talk, she told me that she wants to see what else is out there, and she feels very conflicted about being with me. We talked for probably four hours, and the consensus is that she wants space. The next week is probably the hardest week of my life, I can't eat, can't sleep, I just feel terrible all the time and I can't remedy my symptoms. 

A week later she texts me saying that she still loves me, and that she just needs time to herself. I give her about a week of silence and she finally texts me again to tell me about her classes and whats been going on the past week. We then go back into no communication and I haven't heard from her in over a week. I don't know what to think, and I don't know what to do. I don't want to ignore her and let her slip away, but I also don't want to smother her and drive her away. 

It gets a little more complicated here. I felt very very terrible one particular night, and after talking to a friend decided I would make a pros and cons list of her qualities. I ended up with a list of about 5 pros, and something like 30 cons. After making the list, I felt phenomenally better. It made me realize that I really wasn't that happy in the relationship, and that we don't make that great of a match. We never really connected on a deep level, and it always felt like she didn't truly know me. I find myself thinking about this list every time I feel bad, and it cheers me up. 

One last thing, yesterday I went to a party and she happened to be there, and I was getting some vibes that her and this guy were pretty friendly. It didn't bother me at first, until I saw them hug, and now it is eating away at me. All I could think of last night was them together, and its still in my head now. I'm thinking that its too soon for me to be around her, because I felt fine before I saw her at the party. All that's going through my head is that she betrayed me, that she has ignored my feelings these past few weeks, and that I'm not sure if I ever loved her. I just can't figure out why this breakup is still bothering me so much. Anyway, I will leave it at that, and any comments would be greatly appreciated, thank you. "
1md2cd,2,2013-09-14,"I'm a non-engineer going to an engineering school, and everyday here makes me feel like a useless sack of shit",Watcherthatboxer,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1md2cd/im_a_nonengineer_going_to_an_engineering_school/,"(When I say non-engineer, I don't necessarily mean non-science. I plan on majoring in pharmaceutical chemistry and biochemistry.)

I came to this engineering school for a few different reasons, one of them being the fact that the government would pay for my tuition, and another being that it has a relatively good reputation. I left high school not really understanding the true difference between engineering and other sciences, but now I know and it makes me feel terrible.

Everywhere I'm surrounded by engineers, who will most likely be leaving college after four years with a comfortable salary and a stable job. While they seem to go down their educational path towards a brighter future, I'm working towards a degree that might not even land me anywhere. 

This isn't how I imagined scientists growing up. I thought all scientists, including the chemists, were well renowned and had wonderful lives. They worked in labs, discovered new things, and every industry wanted them. But now I know that's only for engineering; everyone else struggles to find their place, and even when they do, they're subject to the ebb and flow of whatever the world wants them to do. I keep reading horror stories of chemists with PhDs, struggling to make ends meet with salaries around 30k.

This really hit me when the school started talking with us about its career fair. This place always brags about its job placement rates and starting salaries, so I attended a seminar. They gave us inspiration speeches; they told us it didn't matter what year you were, you were almost guaranteed an internship here if you put yourself out there and tried. The spokeswoman told us about a student with poor grades and how even he scored an internship with Chrysler.

So, I raised my hand, ""what about non-engineering majors? Is it worth attending the career fair with a non-engineering science degree?""

I kid you fucking not, that bitch looked me straight in the eyes and said, ""Don't worry, I believe reps from Wal-Mart will be there""

That was the moment where I felt like I wasn't going to have any sort of a wonderful life with my degree"
1mcuwb,3,2013-09-13,21/M/USA,[deleted],lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1mcuwb/21musa/,"My birth was weird. I was facing the wrong way, and when my parents arrived at the hospital, the doctor was nowhere to be found. Things were put off as long as possible, but when push came to shove, the nurse made an executive decision and decided to try to turn me around. So without the doctor, she went ahead and turned me around, but she botched it up a bit. She wasn't fully trained for the task, and it wasn't her call to make, but she made the call, and because of it, I'm alive today. When I came out, the nerves in my left neck/shoulder area were damaged, and my left arm was completely paralyzed. 

My parents were devastated. Not much had gone right with my three older sisters so far: the first had some kind of mental condition that was diagnosed while she was in the womb, and that doctor suggested an abortion. My parents, who were Catholic, did not even consider that an option. Needless to say she's alive today because of that.

The second was fine, the third died during pregnancy.

Anyway, back to me. Arm paralyzed. Due to a ton of physical therapy, time, and prayers, I eventually regained some functionality in my arm a couple of years after my birth. I wasn't allowed to play any contact sports all through my childhood (football, soccer, basketball, anything that could potentially result in running into somebody else). Anyway, you know how kids are. Between that and being an introvert I got my fair share of grief from my peers about things just because it was fun and easy for them to pick on me. Anyway, I'm not going to elaborate on that, as it's not super relevant.

My 2 older sisters, my younger brother and I were raised Catholic. And our family was good. We went to church every Sunday, followed every time with my Dad taking the 4 of us to the children's museum. Every night we had a mandatory night prayer that we all did together, which did kinda suck (being a kid and all...), ending with hugs and kisses goodnight. Like I said, our family was pretty solid.

But we grew older, and life got more difficult. My mother had a best friend who was a Nun. And even though they lived in different states, they still got together sometimes and hung out. My mom had a hobby of making soap, and she would teach the Nun how to do it, among other things friends do together. One day, the Nun was telling Mom about how she just learned how to massage (or something like that), and she offered my Mom a massage (they were at our house). They went up to my Mom's room and closed the door. I'm not going to go into any detail, but she got more of a ""massage"" than she was comfortable with. 

This was devastating for her. Her childhood was really rocky, and she found stability in the Church. But now that this happened, and no relevant Bishops would listen to her calls, and the local clergy wasn't willing to reach out and help out with her pain. The whole experience was very traumatizing, and she started to drift away from her responsibilities as a mother because of how she was dealing with the whole thing.

On top of this, my older sister (the younger one), got to high school, and got in with the wrong crowd. Drugs, alcohol, depressing, rape, a couple of suicide attempts, and almost anything else you can think of from a stereotypical ""troubled teen"" story. My mother thought this was her fault, and needless to say, the kind of attention she received from my parents was the exact wrong kind of attention that she needed. 

My brother and I still went to church with my Dad. I look up to that man so much, and the last thing I wanted was for him to not have anybody to share this aspect of his life with, even if I wasn't interested in it whatsoever (he was in the Seminary for a while before meeting my Mother). My social life during middle school, and even until my senior year of high school, was non-existent. I was the kid that was worth talking to if you needed help with homework. I had the reputation of ""knowing everything."" But besides that, nobody wanted anything to do with me. I don't mean to brag when I say this, but just so you get to know who I am a little better: I am a highly intuitive person. I've always been good at absorbing information and keeping it. I never really take notes, and I've never really studied for exams, even through college. It's why I love math/science so much. Just so, I'm a terrible student when it comes to memorizing anything. Since I don't see the point in knowing what day of the week the Declaration of Independence was signed, I won't memorize it, even if I need to for a grade.

My sophomore year, I got really pissed that my brother was in Karate and I couldn't be. So I went to my mother and complained enough that she scheduled an appointment with the doctor just to get me to shut up. Instead of shutting me up he sent me to a Neurologist, who told me I could do whatever I wanted to. ""It'd just hurt when you get knocked there."" He also referred me to a hand surgeon, who was able to do surgery to restore pretty much all of my missing functionality to my left arm (examples of things I couldn't do: rotate my palm face-up, make my arm stick straight out to the side, similar movements). After the normal physical therapy, my passion of music really helped to increase my finger dexterity to a beyond-recovery point (guitar/piano).

Anyway, I had absolutely terrible hygiene. The thought of girls wasn't even close to being in my head. I had absolutely no trust in people, and I always automatically assumed that when somebody approached me, it would be either for homework help, or to make fun of me. This was until my senior year of high school. I was still active in my church's youth group, but mostly because I felt like I had to. Nobody was forcing me, but I didn't want to disappoint my Father. Then I signed up for my Deanery's Senior Retreat (for any Catholics who have heard of Awakening, it was that kind of retreat). Basically, that weekend breaks you down, puts you in a state where you are completely vulnerable and exposed, then affirms and reassures you (One thing that we did looks a lot like this subreddit, but in person, with a small group of people). 

It was the first time that somebody outside of my family appreciated my company because I was the person that I am, not because of what I could provide. I graduated high school, and applied for the state school's Computer Science program. 

By this time, my oldest sister, who was the stereotypical prized straight-A student, developed this notion that my mother is Narcissistic, and that simply being around her, or ANY member of our family, was toxic to her mental health. So after receiving her 2 BS degrees, she moved to Atlanta and now ignores all of our texts, messages, emails, and phone calls. Which sucks, because we were really good friends.

And in college I started to make some great friendships. I made one of my best friends my first semester. He was hospitable instantly, introduced me to all of his friends, who were all also really great, and that was my group of friends for 2 years. After the first year, I moved in with him. (Then [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1famkz/tifu_by_eating_at_long_john_silvers/) happened) 

And about halfway through the 2nd year, he found out I was Catholic. 

And that was the end of our friendship. Just like that. He didn't understand why, and constantly shit-talked me for it. And when I confronted him and told him that he was being a huge dick, he said it was for my own good. And after I moved out, that whole group of friends also decided that there were too good for me.

My Junior year I was lonely, but I refocused my efforts towards my studies. I also was able to land an internship with a start up video game company. I had also been helping out with the high school youth ministry at my old church (like 1/2 an hour away from my school), which is a completely awesome experience. 

So here I am in my senior year, still doing the Catholic thing. I found a passion in Software Project Management, which is weird seeing as I'll have a science degree, but the 2 real-world real-client projects I'm leading this semester will help beef up my resume. Hard to pinpoint exactly when, but some time in the past couple of years, I came out of my shell in a big way. I mean, it's hard to be in a shell when you're working with crazy high schoolers and leading a couple of projects. My sister (the one I still talk to) had an unplanned pregnancy, but decided to keep the child, and now I am siblings with the best mother ever and my niece is the most beautiful baby ever. Still trying to figure out the dating thing, but this past week I met someone who floored me with her personality. Thank you guys for reading this and commenting (if you so choose). It was great to write this out."

4) Contracted for Student Loan Repayment Program (SLRP) and MGIB + Kicker.

I am also attending a rigorous 5 year MS+BS program for Computer Science. Additionally, I'd like to take advantage of a summer internship with Google and/or some study abroad programs. I would like to transfer into the IRR and stop wasting the Army's money and my study time.

Does anyone have any experience with transferring early to the IRR? I also cannot tell from the wording on my contract, would that terminate my SLRP and MGIB + Kicker benefits?

1mcsg9,1,2013-09-13,Just needing to get it all out.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1mcsg9/just_needing_to_get_it_all_out/,"I (f) love my boyfriend. More that anything I've ever loved. We met at our University. The fact that I graduated in May and then we'd be four hours apart was just a faint nagging that could easily be ignored. The relationship was not without it's faults by a long shot but it was amazing. Second semester I started my internship in the same town and he was in classes full time. I hated that I couldn't see him everyday. I got sadder and sadder as time came closer to graduation. It was becoming real. He wouldn't show his sadness and instead just say it'll work out because we love each other. We have to look at the positive. Pray that it will work. I am neither optimistic nor am I religious. That wasn't too fly with me. I found myself angry at him that he wasn't consumed with the all out dread that I was. Then guilty for feeling that way. 

He was right. Summer wasn't really too bad. He visited and I visited, and it was great.  But then he left. I had a full time job and he was working full time also. It really helped. My new job was fun and it kept my mind off being sad because 8 hours of my day was taken up with work. We saw each other twice a month June-August and sometimes three. I still was broken hearted when he left or I left him but that's ok because we were making it work. After all our distance isn't too bad. Then September came. He went back to school and I started a real job in my field. He has to balance work and school while I have work full time. He works weekends.  We are at the point where we don't get to see each other again until the last week in October. We haven't seen each other since Labor Day. Almost two months. I don't know how I can do it. 

Now I find myself ANGRY at him. Why doesn't he pick up shifts during the week and save the weekends for me!? He has to take off work for other things during weekends. He assured me things would work out! What the fuck! This isn't how it's suppose to be. If I use the money to go visit him on the weekend he'll be working 8 hour shifts ending between 10 and 12 at night. That doesn't work! It's not working anymore. Now it's putting up with time. Even if I did go see him his parents don't let us sleep in the same room or even be in a room with the door shut. I am 24 and he's 23. I find myself saying things to him like ""yeah right we can do that next time we see each other....never"" or if he tries to get frisky on skype or text I get mad. ""It's not like we can do anything at your house anyways."" These things come out, I get mad at him all the time for little reason. It just happens, I can't help it! I am in bed when he is done working on weeknights and weekends sometimes also. I am so incredibly bitter. All the time I am miserable. My mom always says she hates only having ""Sad daughter"" around instead of ""Happy daughter"" that is here when boyfriend is. The pain of being away from him is getting bigger than the happiness of being with him. Sometimes all I want is to break up and try to find a way to be happy on my own. But then I think that is the last thing I want. If I am this miserable only getting to text, call ,visit and Skype imagine what it would feel like if I didn't have him at all? 

I hate being sad. He is who I talk to when I am sad. But he doesn't understand how I view things. I am not the optimistic type and don't see the bright side of life. 

We talk about getting married and moving in together. He promises me  he will follow me. Then every so often a comment comes out that sounds like he doesn't really mean he will follow me no matter what. An innocent question about how I'd like to move there. And my whole mind is screaming it's not going to work. 

I can only feel this love and happiness when I am with him. Being with him is causing me so much pain and sadness. 

I don't know what I am looking for here. Support, advice, just a place to type? I don't know. If anyone can, this community can help me find a way to soothe my ache.

1mcp85,8,2013-09-13,30/m/NJ,Bedfordshire,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1mcp85/30mnj/,"Thought this would be a good place to write some stuff down.  

So I was born and raised in North Arlington, NJ.  It's a small town right near Newark and about 10 minute drive from MetLife Stadium.  MY father was a commodity broker and did very well for himself.  In fact, in the 1980s he was a millionaire.  I have a sister that is 7 years younger than me.  My parents tried very hard to have another child but it just wasn't happening.  Finally after taking a break for 2 years, they decided to start trying again and one month later my mom was pregnant.  Funny story is she was conceived while we were on a family vacation to Disney World.  My dad got a 2 room suite and I had my own bedroom.  Happiest place on earth indeed huh?  

At age 10, after nagging my mom for almost a year, I started taking piano lessons.  My mother always had music playing in my house growing up.  There's an old home video of me at 4 years old dancing to the entire Born in the USA album.  Yes.  And that will only be shown to my wife, whenever I meet that woman.  My mother always encouraged me to be myself and enjoy life and I LOVED to perform. I loved putting on a show for people. Whether it was pretending to dance like Michael Jackson or playing Bob Barker on The Price is Right, I always loved to entertain.  This came into play when I started piano.  Immediately I took to it.  It came to me very easy.  Most things did.  I was a very smart kid and today, am a very smart adult.  I was able to know what my mother said when she asked ""where's the fish?"" on my blocks and I'd point it out at 9 months old.  I started reading at age 3.  I could read the TV Guide with my grandfather.  He passed away when I was 5 (I still remember the night he died) but he had such an amazing impact on my life.  My mom told me stories that I would read to kids in my kindergarten class.  I even had the opportunity to skip a grade in school because I was so intelligent but my parents kept me on track because they didn't want to stunt my social skills growing up.  

So back to the piano...I learned at a fairly young age that I knew what my calling in life was.  Something in entertainment.  I would teach myself songs and how to play them, etc. In 4 years I was able to read and play very complex chords and songs.  My achillies heel was that I never learned how to play classical music.  But I'm ok with that.  Elton John can't do it and he turned out ok.  So at age 16 I started learning guitar as well.  I'm just OK at that but I know basic chord structure and if I needed to play a guitar, I could do it no problem.  

I knew music was going to be in my life forever.  During my high school years I decided my dream was going to be to headline Madison Square Garden.  Problem was I never had a band.  I never could get people to play.  Plus I was a chubby kid and never really had the confidence enough to think I could be this big music act because I didn't think I was good looking.  But that was ok.  I went to Monmouth University and enrolled in their music business program and that's where I met my best friend in the world.  Her and I have been inseparable since that September.  We never were a couple, we never even kissed, but I am incredibly in love with her even though she is in a 7 year relationship with one of my other best friends.  She's everything I want in someone and it's going to be very hard for me to get past that if and when I meet someone else.  

So I was at Monmouth and acted in a few shows there, one in which I was in the lead of shakespearean play!  I had to take an entire class on how to act for shakespeare.  I wouldn't trade that experience for the world.  I was OK as I forgot some lines.  In one show I even forgot a whole monologue but my co-star bailed me out big time.  It was there my want for entertaining came back into play.  I was willing to work at it but some politics behind the scenes made me not want to work with the director of those shows anymore.  I look back on it and it was probably stupid petty shit I was a whiny bitch about but hey you learn from it.  

My senior year I needed an internship and I asked my classmate next to me where he interned because he was at a music publishing house, which is the industry I wanted to go in after taking a class on it the previous semester.  So I went there and got the internship at this place.  It was in the creative department.  I excelled at the position and they decided to hire me to be the department assistant as they were growing.  I wound up getting in on the ground floor and being part of a company that grew in the next 5 years so much that we were being looked at to be bought.  And we were.  By BMG.  At the time, I was the guy pitching our music catalog to all video game companies, any new media ventures, and anything and everything sports-related.  I knew my time may have been limited.  My company saw value in someone at that position, BMG did not.  So I lost my job.  

THIS is where everything started falling apart for me and my family. 

2 years prior to this, my father lost his job trading a everything went computerized and eliminated what he did, as he was a middle man.  He also refused to adapt and thought computers were the enemy.  You know, one of those guys.  Long story short, he went through all of his money. My father was never smart with his money as he invested in crappy projects instead of just keeping stuff small and simple.  Also during this my mother started getting VERY heavy.  I always knew her as big during my life but this just kept growing and growing.  My father is also an alcoholic. Not the abusive kind, just the self-destructive kind.  And this affected everything in the home.  

In 2008 we got a phone call from the bank that the IRS levied 9k from their accounts and now had nothing left.  So I, working at the time, and with relatively minimal expenses, decided to take up the financial burden on the home.  

It's now 2013 and my father still has not found work, my mother has crippling obesity and cannot get gastric bypass because she doesn't have insurance, and I am trying to find full-time STILL from when I was let go in 2010. 

In 2008 I started teaching piano lessons on the side to supplement my income.  It then became a way to pay our bills.  I've been teaching piano and guitar since then and have quite a few students, but it's not enough to keep everything afloat.  

There are a lot of layers to this and I know I've been rambling on for a while.  But that's my life...so far.  I'm happy to answer any questions at all.  "

I am a senior majoring in Financial Economics and Actuarial Science.  I have work experience associated with finances and budgeting of a non-profit, however it is not a traditional internship and not really pertaining to actuarial work.  I am sitting for FM this October and plan on taking P around February.  

I decided to pursue being an actuary this summer and really don't know what the best way to go about networking.  There is a job fair coming to my university next week, which I will attend, but beyond that, do you have any tips on how to interact with recruiters that I meet, or even how to go about making connections with people that I would not see personally?  My preferred path would be as an actuarial consultant.

I'm really just looking for any tips to get the ball rolling.  I like to think that I have a charismatic personality and am intelligent.  I truly enjoy conversing with all kinds of people and so far I believe people enjoy my company, in both social and professional settings.  I am just not sure how to take my first steps.  Any advice at all will be much appreciated and go a long way!  Thank you."
1mgpgd,0,2013-09-15,I [21/M] am in the midst of a messy breakup with my girlfriend [20/F]. Looking for any advice on how to soften the blow.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mgpgd/i_21m_am_in_the_midst_of_a_messy_breakup_with_my/,"First a little bit of background:

My girlfriend and I had been dating for just shy of 11 months.  From the start, we got along incredibly well.  I had never met anyone like her, and we immediately fell head-over-heels in love.  We both are in the same year at the same university.  She has a deep interest in medicine and statistics, while I have a background in engineering.  She is happy-going, studious, incredibly smart, dedicated, and quite pretty.  We have only ever had two instances in which we didn't really get along, which I will detail below:

Instance 1)

We were at a party, having fun, as we often do on the weekends.  We often drink, but rarely more than a few, no drunken shenanigans, getting sick, etc.  I walk I wander into the other room, and while getting more drinks for the two of us, I run into an acquaintance who I haven't seen for over a year.  We strike up a short 5 minute conversation, and I go back into the previous room to check on my girlfriend.  She is tongue deep in another girl's throat, her roommate's to be exact.

Now, she's in no way actually attracted to women, nor did she even find the whole thing sexually exciting or attractive.  It turns out, several douche bags had simply been egging them on in the hopes of peer pressuring them to do something entertaining (I'll save my rant on how these kind of people are some of the worst in the world for another day).  In my mind this crosses the line of cheating.  I was furious that she would simply throw herself around like that, especially with someone other than me.  But, I tried to handle the situation as responsibly as possible.

Since we had never explicitly discussed where to draw the line on this kind of behavior, and it turned out she had thought this was the line, that I might enjoy watching, and that she didn't enjoy it at all, I decided to let it go after talking about how much it hurt to watch her be used like that, and in my mind be unfaithful.  She agreed that this is completely reasonable, felt horrible for hurting my feelings, and promised there would be no chance she would ever want to do anything that could jeopardize our trust.

She stuck to this.

This happened about 3 months into our relationship.  Around 9 months in, the second incident occurred.

Instance 2)

It's summer break and our relationship has turned into a long distance relationship for the summer.  She, studying for the MCAT, is spending the summer on the US east coast, while I am stuck in the Midwest at my first internship.  At the company I worked for, I am not allowed to get any days, non-injury, or sickness related off of work.  She is studying for the MCAT at an elite camp of sorts with instructors who have scored incredibly high in the recent past, and have some level of teaching skill in addition, along with classes to refresh information that may be on the exam.  

It's mid June, and she asks me when I can come to visit her.  I've already done some research on how visiting her would work, and it does not look good.  The only weekend I could really be there would be July 4th weekend since I wouldn't have to instantly turn around and come home.  The problem with flying on July 4th (bus/car travel time would occupy the entire time by itself) is that it is expensive.  Not to mention, the rules at the MCAT camp dictate that visitors can only stay till 10, and they were not given the weekend off of studying.  Essentially, I would be showing up for 3 days for $600+ since I would be paying for a hotel as well, while she spends all of her time shut in her room studying.  As a college student I can't throw that kind of money around, so I had to explain to her that I couldn't come.  Meanwhile, it was impossible for her to visit me since she didn't even get that weekend off.

She gets very upset.  Suddenly, it becomes an issue of, ""spending time together isn't worth $600"" in her mind.  From previous experience that summer, I had a good idea of how much free time she would actually have since the limiting factor to us talking (we preferred Skype so we could see each other and smile) was that she could only give me about 30 min every other day to talk, otherwise she was too busy, no matter how much time I could make available for her.  Essentially I would only see her for an hour or two for $600.  Despite explaining this to her, she was still upset.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really come up with any resolution and she just sort of ""got over it""

That ends the story of incident #2, but there's one more bit of information to include in the story.  Despite being an elite studious camp, apparently lots of scandals were occurring within.  Guys were peeping at girls changing in their rooms, Med student instructors were doing hard drugs such as mushrooms, and a lot of students were sleeping with one another.

My girlfriend instantly clicked with some of the instructors, although disappointed by their drug use.  She easily related with them due to having similar goals, and ideas with medicine, as well as shared a common knowledge of all things medical, something which I lacked.

One evening she called me out of the blue, and asked me what I thought about smoking marijuana.  While I've never done any drugs myself, a one time incident like this seemed not only admissible in my mind, but I was happy to encourage her to try something new if that was what she really wanted and had put some serious thought into it.  I have, in the past few months mostly forgotten the details of the conversation.

As the summer came to a close, I recieved a second call, out of the blue.  ""We're breaking up, I'm starting to realize we never really connected as much as we could have.""

That was all the explanation I got.

Now, this made no sense to me.  Wait, other than two specific incidents, we never have had a problem!  We've been happily in love for months now, and at almost every stage I thought we connected beautifully, and she expressed similar feelings.

After a week or two of crying and sitting around alone, school started up.  Our friend group is the same, and while she may no longer feel in love with me, I really want her to continue being my friend, as I've seen her as my best friend for the past (almost) year who I can tell anything to.  Surprisingly, she is cordial too, and we even still hang out, sometimes just us.

We get along incredibly well, and she even hints at still having a significant amount of feelings for me.  She sleeps over one night and I get to cuddle with her again, she even kisses me once more.  It wasn't a gentle peck, it was one of those emotional ""You mean the world to me"" kisses.  Now they may have been how she intended it, or it may have been just one more ""goodbye"".

Last night, things took a turn for the worse.

After a bit of drinking at a party, I walk one of her tipsy floor mates home to make sure everyone's night ends well, and run back to the party, because she apparently forgot her phone there.  When I come back, my now ex-girlfriend is sitting out in the hall waiting to talk to me.

She asks if I realize there's a bit more to our breakup then I thought.  I admit that I had guessed as much, and in my mind I am thinking of the worst possible scenario: her kissing someone else over the summer.  (Yes we were sexually active, so this may seem a bit childish, but the thought of her expressing her emotions to anyone but me tore me apart.)

As she sits me down to talk, she admits that on the night she had smoked that marijuana for the first (and only) time, she also snorted adderall (she had never done any drugs before, remember?), gone out to a club with a lot of the drug using instructors, had been kissed by one, and then went back to another one's room to fuck.

On top of this, she adds on that she can still never forgive me for not coming to visit her at some point this summer, and that she is now unhappy because the instructor she had sex with doesn't want to talk to her, now that she's not there for the physical side.  She also explains that this only happened once.

I was speechless, and I still don't know what to say.  I walked 3 miles home in tears, thinking all the while that it might be best to just walk in the road instead.

After the issue of cheating in the past, I thought there was no way, she could ever do something like that, especially considering how much we loved each other, and respected each other.

She seemed sincere in her apology to me, and admitted she'll forever regret that decision, but she has no interest in being together again.

The worst part is, even though I am near blind with rage, I still love her, and I don't know how to handle those feelings.

I guess I just typed most of this out, because I promised I wouldn't tell anyone that would care, and I needed something to vent, but after typing it all, I realize, I have no idea how to react to my current feelings, in love, yet enraged and hurt.

I just want some constructive advice on how to improve my current situation.  Please don't up-vote or ""offer your condolences"" as I just want things to be better, and that won't do it.

**tl;dr**: GF left me after being led on by someone she saw as an inspiration and cheating on me, in a drugged up night, don't know how to react."
1mgos6,1,2013-09-15,I need some advise on three issues badly.,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1mgos6/i_need_some_advise_on_three_issues_badly/,"Obviously this is a throw away account. Back story: I am the international university college intern at a very large church. I am a senior in college and will graduate this year. But here is the situation. I have been discipling this married international woman for a few months now. I have been really careful about where we meet always in public places, husband fully knows etc and the words I choose to say to her. So most of the time I just end of listening to her talk. But right now I feel that she is using me to pour her emotions and telling me secrets that she has never told her husband. I don't mind it, and I don't have any feeling for her, but just as a single guy who is just 21 I feel I want to seek counsel from people who are much wiser than I am. I feel that I am being used by God to capture her heart, and we do talk about the Bible and she has even come to church and our international Bible study. So I really don't know what to do, I just feel like if she is using me as an emotional outlet and not her husband it will ruin their marriage, and I do not want to be responsible for that. And is it even my place to be talking to a married woman as a single guy? 

Second issue: 
I feel very stupid and unwise, I know the Bible teaches us to flee from sexual immorality, but I feel that I have dug myself into a situation with two Chinese girls. I think both of them like me, but they are non Christian and we are unequally yoked. But the question I have for you guys is as an international intern at a church does it take away the glory from God if a date a international girl? I feel that it would because I know some people will say oh he is just doing this not for God's glory, but to have a international girlfriend. Frankly  the girl doesn't matter to me, as long as it is God's chosen girl for me.

Last one: 

I have a friend from high school that went to the same college as me. I have known this guy for many years and I have invited him to church, but he is not interested in Christianity. But the other day I invited him to a church meeting with my international students and he became friends with one of the girls. And the other night he has invited this girl to the bar, and even asked her to smoke marijuana with her. The girl refused his offer, but I feel I see him as a wolf now and will not invite him back to any of our events again. Just very frustrating to me that he would do this, but I know I still need to love him. 

Sorry for the rant, and for the people that made it this far in reading this comment thank you very much. "

I was hoping I could get advice/guidance from the women here because this is honestly the only place on reddit i feel comfortable posting this to. I don't know where to start or what to tell so I'll just tell the entire story.

I had sex for money and now my partner of 1 year wants to leave me. I'm not upset at her, I understand why she's upset.

I was thrown out of my parents house, in the middle of my last year in community college, because they found out I was taking estrogen and transitioning. I wasn't working because I couldn't find a job with hours that would fit into my school schedule, and it was the beginning of the year, I was still looking for a job after completing my summer internship. Anyway, I didn't have a lot of money because I really didn't expect my parents to throw me out so my partner let me stay at her apartment rent-free for the time being. I ended up finding work after a few weeks and was able to pay for my share of rent and food. My partner's mother hated me though, mostly because I was trans, and she thought I was taking advantage of my partner because I lived with her without paying rent for a few weeks.

Anyway, my partner and I ended up living fairly comfortably in a small studio in Los Angeles for the rest of my school year (this is 2012-2013). I tutored, and did freelance graphic design, PR, and writing. She wasn't in school and worked as a graphic designer for a big real estate firm. Once the summer came, I couldn't stand not living full-time and decided to be full-time female, except at work. In an extremely unfortunate event, my boss for the hagwon I worked for saw me and my girlfriend at a boba shop in Koreatown. We didn't see her but she had called me an hour later essentially telling me that I was a pervert, that I wasn't getting my final check (about $900 in cash), and that she never wanted to see me again. I couldn't afford a lawyer, and all of the employees at the tutoring center were paid in cash to avoid taxes. Luckily, I had money saved up from the freelance work and was able to support myself through the rest of the summer doing legal courier work and some free-lance writing.

Anyway, come August, my partner left for San Jose to finish up school, and I could no longer afford to rent out our studio at $1300 a month. I had only one more month left before I had to leave for Santa Cruz for school, so I was going to try to find something on AirBnB but then my friend who's a Stanford grad student and lives in San Francisco told me I could stay with her and share her room in Potrero Hill for $500. I wired her the money, and at this point, I had little money left. Like barely enough for the gas to get me up to San Francisco but I didn't really have a choice, I had to go somewhere and that was probably the cheapest and safest option I was going to find. So I start to run out of money and I ask my partner for a loan that I can pay back once I get my financial aid disbursement check and she says she can't because her parents monitor her bank account. I even called my parents and begged for a loan but they didn't even want to speak with me.

I only had $10 left in my bank account to last me 10 days, I had to do something, especially because I needed money for gas to get down to Santa Cruz for move-in at school. So I put an ad on craigslist. And I had sex with someone for $200 that night. I regret every moment of it. I still feel disgusting and I hate myself for it. I never want to do it again. I feel like I can never tell anyone because I know they're going to think i'm a wh***. I feel like I'm a stereotype. The trans sex worker. I needed the money though, and I wasn't finding work, and I couldn't wait any longer so I just did it.

I told my partner and she just started immediately crying. I feel so fucking awful because she was there for me throughout my transition and I betrayed her. She wants me to take a train down to San Jose tomorrow to talk about things and I don't know what to say. I don't know how to express just how much shame I feel and how much I needed that $200. I'm sorry this is so long... I didn't know how else to tell it."

1mfslm,9,2013-09-15,"I'm back, after a long time.",genericwit,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mfslm/im_back_after_a_long_time/,"Please ignore my badge for the time being, it needs to be reset.  I gave up on quitting drinking a while ago.  I originally quit drinking around the same time I stopped doing an excessive amount of Oxycontin, took a trip to India, and made a half-hearted suicidal attempt/gesture. After a few months, I started to cave in on occasion, before going another month without drinking.  And when I'd started again, it wasn't so bad.  The consequences weren't too severe.  I kept to drinking maybe once on the weekend in a given week, even though I was typically getting very drunk.  It didn't really effect my life, that much, except maybe I couldn't work out on Saturday or on Sunday.  I was able to get back into my grad program and finish, with pretty good marks.  

Generally, I was able to keep it under control as long as there was a structure, a reason for me to keep it under control.  But eventually, that too began to slip.  I started drinking during the week, on occasion, though not so much that I couldn't go to school or my internship the next day.  Pretty soon, though, I discovered poppy tea and could get high and feel all pleasant and carefree without a hangover, so that didn't stay a weekend activity for long.

I stopped that in June, and had my first ever withdrawal, and have pretty successfully stayed away since.  But after a few successive vacations, the summer quickly blurred into a long bender.  Whatever measure of control I'd managed to assemble fell to the wayside, and I was back to drinking most nights a week to the point of blacking out.  Instead of having the resolve to stick rigorously to a schedule of searching out jobs, I've let my life lapse into a half-miserable hedonistic malaise.  I don't think alcohol is the reason, at least not in isolation, but it's not enriching my life whatsoever and only serves to prevent me from confronting the changes I need to make, like some external defense mechanism.

I'm tired of feeling like a hypocrite, as my actions do not nearly match my beliefs and my values, and I know that means making changes in my life and my approach to life.  For one, that includes remembering lessons that I've learned in the past, and among those is the lesson I have had to learn several times over--that there are times when I enjoy drinking with friends, but those times are far outweighed by the trouble drinking brings, and also by the problems I do not solve because I choose to drink instead.  

Thanks for listening.  Hope everyone has had a good weekend!"

She is a redditor as well so there is a chance she might see this and recognize the circumstances even if I use a throwaway. I just need some additional perspective on surviving long distance relationships with two career invested partners.


My girlfriend and I have been in a long-distance relationship for two years now. I'm madly in love with her and we see each other regularly (about 8-10 times a year) and have done several long vacations together (several weeks to two months). We discuss the idea of marriage regularly and are pretty well committed to get engaged at the end of her last year in college, when our careers permit. She recently started an internship position which requires her to work very long days in addition to doing prep work at home. In general, our communication during the weekdays has been limited to several texts in the morning and evening and maybe a short phone or video call, usually with the implication that talking is cutting into time that could be used for her work.


On the weekends she spends even more time doing prep work and will spend her evenings with friends, meaning our communication is only marginally improved. Even so, the volume of communication is not the issue, but the inability for us to connect when we do speak. My college life and career choice were extremely stressful and demanding and I have found myself in her shoes on many occasions. I ensured that I always spent time with her regularly, frequently at the expense of my almost non-existent free time and sleep. Far from bitter, I couldn't have imagined doing it without her.


I respect what she is going through immensely as I have lived through it personally for years now, it is just difficult for me to accept the lack of communication as it is causing many secondary problems. We have been talking past one another about the fears of our future toegether going unaddressed, particularly the sacrifices we are making to be with one another. This has caused the most serious fights we've had so far in our relationship. She has become very quick to anger recently, however this is a recurring theme whenever she is stressed; yelling and being unaware of her combative tone escalating the conversation. She starts to think everyone is mad and disappointed at her, so she reacts accordingly even when they are not. I am currently in a lull in my work so I am trying to use this time to be extra supportive, writing her letters, sending her pictures, trying to be as attentive as I can get away with without asking too much in response. It has blown up in my face as I am tormented by the fear of feeling like a doormat, especially since I initiate the overwhelming majority of conversations now, paying careful attention to do so when she is least busy, and find myself often feeling wilfully ignored.


In the past, when she was stressed she wanted as much affection as I could give her and I did my best to do so, but now it feels like she wants little to do with me. If I back off, our communication all but ceases and if I press to talk about how this is hurting us, it usually ends in a fight.


Recently, after a particularly bad brawl we sat down and talked things through and I left feeling convinced that we were starting to see eye to eye, but I thought we turned a corner several times already and was left disappointed. I worry that once the weekend is over the progress will be undone again. This hurts most of all because our relationship was born out of a long distance conversation in which we got to know each other more intimately than I believe would have been possible if we had started dating face-to-face. I want to recapture that connection before we lose it.


A side note on our careers: My career is the rigidly inflexible one so she would eventually have to work around me for a while should we get married. It is possible and we've worked hard this past year to make sure that she doesn't have to give much up to be with me, and I've tried to involve her in every decision I've had the power to make so far. It is a situation we are well aware of and we've talked about more than anything. Though I can't change my career path to be more accommodating of hers yet, I support the relationship financially and have every intention of following through on my promise to ensure we have a stable family life as soon as possible. I wish I knew what more I could do.


**TL;DR** *Stress from career is causing communications breakdown in my relationship. I need help reconnecting with her without adding to her stress.*"

Or if you're feeling a little more adventurous, there is a whole sub-genre of [bageling](http://steadfastappliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tfal-toaster-ver2.jpg) and if that's not your kind of thing, there is always toaster [bukkade](http://www.eurograduate.com/images/articles/news/Toaster%20project%201.jpg), [squirters](http://d436bf61292a5a72eb74-0b84e0b94db0dd2da26f73dca6f0cfa3.r35.cf3.rackcdn.com/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/1/01_BM_toaster2.jpg), [BBT](http://www.kcmltd.com/equipment%20pics/toasters/CT540.jpg), [orgy](http://www.chefline.co.uk/images/CT1.jpg) and of course [vintage](http://www.best-toaster-ovens.com/wp-content/gallery/images/antique-toaster.jpg).

The toasters over at /r/ToastersGW know how to have fun and they love to submit pictures of themselves being in mighty [dirty](http://i.imgur.com/3RM7Dni.jpg) circumstances and from time to time, enjoying some [weiners](http://i.imgur.com/jI8c3Ho.jpg) and some taking a whole [bagel](http://i.imgur.com/I4TbyzU.jpg). All these pictures are available for you guys to enjoy in a sanitary and understanding way. /r/ToastersGW do not allow slanderous comments nor do they condone interaction of the creepy nature. No, it is an environment where you can watch buns get toasted safely. Where everyone can enjoy the sight of a toaster in action but must stay respectful. Respect one another and we can all have a good time.    

I know what's on the end of your tongue and it's fine. I'll answer. You're welcome. I know it's hard to find what you're really looking for on The Internet. Sometimes, you get lucky and discover a place where your needs are fulfilled. Now that I'm sharing /r/ToastersGW with you guys, I hope you will share it with others. The others that you have seen looking at your toaster lustfully, that guy at work who always insists on cleaning the toaster and even yes, that dude at Ikea that spends his lunch-break in the appliances section. We know what you're doing and that's OK. /r/ToastersGW is here.

/r/ToastersGW has moderators, as I said, to keep us in check. Here is what they had to say:
 
&gt;##1. How did /r/ToastersGW start?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** ToastersGW was set up as initially a way for horny toasterers to express their ways, without interfering with the battle over at /r/toasterrights. Kind of like posting to /r/gonewild instead of /r/pics.

&gt;##2. What's your toaster like?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Silky smooth and sexy curves, right out of the Latino heartland.

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** She is a sexy deep blue Kitchenaid, with two slots for double the pleasure.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth** My toaster likes it real slow, real light at first. Then it gets crispy. ;)

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK** It has big ol slots for extra fun.

&gt;##3. Do you have a favourite post?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** No, I dont discrimate. I will spank the one eye wonder to any colour, gender, religon or creed (except the dirty toaster ovens)

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** 
http://www.reddit.com/r/ToastersGW/comments/1gx4mx/close_up_double_penetration_two_thick_slices_in/

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth**  Not usually one for favourites, but... Toasty buns and big wieners.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  http://www.reddit.com/r/ToastersGW/comments/11x147/want_some_japanese_toast/

&gt;##4. What does this Subreddit do that others don't?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Accept everyone for who they are. We dont judge, either.

&gt;&gt;**META_FUCKING_POD**  As far as I know, this is the only subreddit to have hot pictures of toasters above the legal age of toaster consent.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth**  Pretty good role-playing thing going on. And come one. Perverse toasters.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  Toaster porn and high spirits.

&gt;##5. Would you like to say anything to your Subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Treat your toaster well, you may never know when accidents may occur. I lost my last SO to a thunderstorm where a power surge knocked the life out of her, I'm still grieving, years later.

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** Thank you for all the support you have given, and thanks for help expanding this subreddit.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth** Keep them coming! I'm running out of fap material here.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  We are going to start cracking down on Creepy PMs. This is just a warning.

Thank you very much for reading. If you too would like to write for Subreddit of the day, apply for the [Internship programme](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/ywgo3/subredditoftheday_is_now_hiring_read_the_details/c7wwcxi).

I'm so far behind that apparently freshmen are now ahead of me (and my entire class somehow). I know I'd do well as a psych major; people assume I am one all the damn time. Everyone I talk to honestly thinks I'd make a better psych major than a computer science major. Hell, the people at my IT internship preferred me to do work that involved dealing with people and their ideas over programming. 

All I want is for you to understand that I'm not just giving up after the work got hard. I'm getting to a point where I understand my skillset and it feels best served somewhere else to me.

I'm sorry if I disappoint you. I just want you to support me. And if you're upset, that's fine. Odds are, I will change my major unless my current advisor gives me some damn good advice. I'll take the financial responsibility if I have to. Just keep in mind that I wanted to go into psych before I applied for school and you pressured me out of it.

I love you guys and have done everything to make you happy. Can't you just respect my wishes here, just once?"
1meosf,10,2013-09-14,An SC2 eSports story. By just another reddit user.,eXeBreaker,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1meosf/an_sc2_esports_story_by_just_another_reddit_user/,"Alright, so... I guess I'll start this off by explaining my motivation towards the SC2 scene. I played Halo religiously before switching to SC2. I figured that SC2 was the greatest skill indicator towards a single player vs another single player, and I was not much of a team player. I saw a couple of VoDs on youtube about tournaments, casting and so on. I think the first game I ever saw was HuK vs. QxC some time back in 2011 and that inspired me to buy the game.


My major in university was Chinese, then I saw my first NASL in 2011. I thought to myself, ""These Korean guys are really strong."" Then one three-letter name popped up among all others: Sen. When I found out he was from Taiwan, I totally flipped. This was, more or less, a direct culmination of something I was genuinely interested in, and something that I studied for my major. A Chinese-speaking player, a **foreigner** that was taking down Koreans like a boss. I was amazed that he took third place at the first NASL I had ever seen. This inspired me to make my next study abroad location Taiwan. I had been to mainland China twice anyway, so why not try Taiwan? They have one player who is this strong, I wonder what the rest of their players are like.


So, I went to Taiwan to study abroad. There, I met the big name casters as well as Sen, at two different barcraft events. I extended my social networking, and saw if their tournaments needed an English stream. I made contact with a few people who needed English streamers, and one day I found my event. I found my ticket. The Asia Star League's Admin, Ken, gave me his facebook info and we got to talking about it after I returned to America.

The days when I met Sen, Joeman, and SoBadRush (the strongest Taiwanese zerg and two big casting personalities respectively), I was super inspired to become a stronger player. The next day I went 10-0 on the ladder. I got in to diamond NA, and platinum TW/KR.


But there was another event headed by team Millenium's Coach, LLewellys, that I got to cast. It was called the MSI pro world cup and took place between 6 different Koreans, a Chinese player who is the little brother of DoTA 2 legend Sky (his name is LoveCD), and GamaniaSen.


Because of my relative inexperience to casting, I had no clue how to set up my stream and because I had only a single monitor, everyone could see everything I was doing on my screen. All 2,700 Chinese-speaking viewers. That day people made a meme for me. It basically goes, ""ForGG Threw out the GG!"" (what I actually said in Chinese was 佛GG打GG了！） [This Chinese casting legend](http://images2.china.com/game/zh_cn/esports/djtuijian/11085976/20100830/2010083018571875631800.jpg) added me on Skype between games and invited me to cast an offline event just a few minutes before my stream was finished. We got a skype call going, and 2,500 viewers could not believe I was talking to him. One of my Taiwanese friends said to me, ""Do you know who that was? That was XiaoSe! He is the best caster in China! He is like Day9 for China!""  The event he invited me to cast for was a major offline event in China, the NeoTV Star League, and if you guys remember [this trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxnr-aznBJA), it was amazing stuff. I loved being there for it from start to finish even though I was not at the live event.


March 2013 rolls along, and an MLG Winter event took place in Dallas - driving distance from where I lived. I initially wanted to start up a Chinese stream for it, and frantically tried establishing contact with them. In the end they didn't need a Chinese stream / cast. What they did need was an in-game observer, an in-game cameraman. They set me up for an interview with Axeltoss, and I was 90% sure going in that I would not get it. Adebisi did instead.


When Axeltoss told me that I didn't get the position, he still encouraged me to keep doing what I'm doing now (Casting Chinese/ Taiwan events in English, and casting western events in Chinese). He said he was casting and coaching for two years before he started getting paid for it.


It has now been a year and one month since I've started casting. I get paid via paypal by some organizations while simultaneously making some money off of twitch revenue. But of course, that does not constitute stable income. I'm in Korea at the moment. My logic for coming here was simple, I thought to myself, ""Um, well I know some Chinese leagues have invited Tasteless and Artosis to cast, as well as invited some Korean players to compete, even paying for accommodations. What sets me apart from them? I have on paper that my Chinese is 'fluent', and my plane ticket would be the same price as anyone else's from Korea. It would also be nice to just see a WCS KR event or two while I'm here.""


Right now, my status as a caster is just ""community caster"", ""amateur caster"" or anything else in between. I am hopeful that one day I can get in on a Chinese SC2 event. That's all I want. I don't want OGN, I don't want GSL. But at the same time, I set a deadline for myself. If in August 2014, I have not gotten in on a mainstream event, I will probably just continue community casting on the side and do teaching English as a second language as my main job. 


It is also worth me mentioning here that seeing a few different figures and personalities, players and the such in eSports popping up that are new, like Terry the Intern, AcerScarlett, and Nathanias, are what drive me to keep going."
1mjafn,1,2013-09-16,[30/m] complicated story with crush,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mjafn/30m_complicated_story_with_crush/,"Hey,

me and my crush got to know each other last year. We both moved to a foreign country to study the same program. We are both a bit shy and sometimes get hit by anxiety/depression attacks (me more than her). In one of our first nights out - in this new country - her, me and some others went out. When we had some time alone, she asked me what I am looking for in a girl - and I told her, cause of my childhood and past, it takes a long time before I even consider ""hooking"" up with a woman. 
Over the year - with a couple of breaks, since my depression got worse and I had to go back home for a couple of weeks/month - we got to know each other. When I was back home she messaged me and asked how I am and we messaged each other almost every day and when I was back in town we spend some time together and discovered that we have a lot in common. We share the same values, we both get bored easily, that's why are both interested in many different topics/activities; we have the same humor, hate the same people and so on.
Since she managed to get an internship in her home country and I decided to stay here, we don't see each other any more but message us almost every day.
Last weekend I wrote her an Email and told her how I feel about her. She send me and Email back and mentioned that she enjoys our talks (serious or bs topics, doesn't matter), she also thinks that we share the same views and values and ""[she] also cares about me and has an affection for me"". But she hopes that I will find someone else in the town I am recently living in, that can see how ""awesome"" I am.

36 hours after her short - but in conlcusion - ""rejection"" email she messaged me again and asked how I am doing. Since I was still ""crushed"" and didn't want to get more emotional, I replied briefly with a random story. Since then every day she messages me and ask how I am and what I did. I don't know how to handle this situation.
I can't forget her, but I feel I have to try, since she ""rejected"" (more or less) and I don't want to get more emotional attached than I already am, and move on with my life. But since she messages me every day, I am not sure if she wants me to ""chase"" after her, or if her rejection is some sort of defense mechanism - she ones told me that she ""pushes"" away people so she won't become too emotionally attached - and I should still try to get together with her.
Maybe she ""rejected"" me since she doesn't wanna have a long-distance relationship?
Her sentence that she also cares about me and has affection for me still leaves me in the dark. Is her rejection serious or is she scared? I don't know if there is anyone else with this kind of story, but nevertheless, maybe you can still give me some advice.
Shall I move on, shall I keep in touch with her, should I ignore her or still try to get together with her?
Advice is welcome. "

1miyba,11,2013-09-16,Help for a Prospective Transfer (Sort of a Long Read),adagiosaur,UTSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTSA/comments/1miyba/help_for_a_prospective_transfer_sort_of_a_long/,"I'm currently a freshman at Texas A&amp;M (College Station) in my very first semester. I'm from San Antonio, and was involved in a particular highschool program that really pushed A&amp;M and engineering. I didn't really have a whole lot of guidance as far as colleges went, as I'm pretty much the first in my immediate family to go. I graduated top 5% of my class, got an 1820 on my SAT and was fairly involved, so the obvious push was to go to a tier 1 university. I had only visited A&amp;M, and was already being pushed to go there. In the end, that's the only place I applied, and got financial aid that covers about 3/4 my tuition, at least for the first year. Towards the end of the summer, I just had a gut feeling that I didn't make the right decision, with both my choice in major (aerospace engineering) and university. 

Now I'm here, and the gut feeling is overwhelming. I'm not enjoying myself. I changed my major to economics (one strong interest of mine) during add/drop week mostly for the sake of getting out of engineering. I don't enjoy living on campus, and would much rather go back to living in a house (I would move in with my college minded brothers who live near UTSA and are currently going to vista). Worst of all, I don't bleed maroon, and find many of the traditions that A&amp;M is so well known for as distracting and annoying (believe me, I'm not anti-social and like to have fun, but I'm sick of saying Howdy!). Being from such a diverse city I can't fit in with the crowd here and have simply gravitated towards hanging out with a few friends that came from my highschool.

What it comes down to is, I want to get out of here, preferably before next semester. Problem is, I'm having a hard time getting over the hump of going from tier 1 to tier 2. And it's not that I have a superiority complex or something, I'm just worried about how much weight employers may actually put on the college you came from. I'm a believer in the idea that college is what you put into it, but many people would tell me that it would just really not be a good idea to go from A&amp;M to UTSA.

My plan would be to either go into computer science, as I have had an internship at a large tech company in the area, and actually quite enjoyed my foray into computer programming, or I would continue pursuing my new found interest in economics. So, what do you guys think? Is it a good idea, a bad idea? Do these programs have good things going for them?

EDIT:
I forgot to mention that finances are an issue as well, as I'd prefer not to have any debt, and my family cannot help me pay whatsoever, and even the idea of taking out $6,000 loans a year that I'm having to do at A&amp;M isn't very appealing, as I'm likely going to shoot for at least a masters.


TLDR: I don't like A&amp;M, but it's tier 1. Should I transfer to UTSA anyways?"

I miss the excitement of trying to catch their eye, trying to seem cool walking over to them, the rush you get when you hold eye contact for just a second longer than normal and trying to make that first impression excellent. 

I miss hip-bones under panties, unfamiliar perfume, high heels, eye-shadow and lipstick. I miss thepounding heartbeat between your first and second kisses. I miss groomed pubic hair. I miss effort. 

Supposedly after a while the excitement of the new gets replaced with expert knowledge of your partner. Is five years long enough for that? Five years of iron-gripped-tugging hand jobs, barely-there-minimal-effort-no-climax blowjobs. I had an ex who could suck me off in under three minutes, she was crazy as fuck, I miss her when you *finally* give in and try to give head. People are supposed to communicate in the bedroom but you never give any instructions, even when I literally stop to ask and god-fucking-forbid I try to explain that the skin at the base of my dick shouldn't really move when you half-assed try to jerk me off.

You should thank your fucking stars everyday for our daughter, if it wasn't for her you'd still be in the run down shitty apartments you and **your** daughter were in. You should be thankfully blowing me every day that you 'accidentally' got pregnant. That little girl is the only reason you have anything at all.

It's been a while since I posted here. I wanted to tell my story, or where I stand now. It's not going to be a motivating story, but I want you to understand where you may end up.

I'll start from the beginning of my journey. I was a person who used to watch porn and fap everyday (often more than once). I was depressed, alone, without hope. When I started nofap I was happy all my troubles would one day go away. My first streak (19 days) was awesome. People noticed a change in me. As you may have guessed I've relapsed (many many times). During my nofap journey I've applied to an internship and later got a permanent job there, I worked out every day, I meditated everyday, I stayed positive, I took cold showers. Even tho I still had my insecurities with me, I was dealing with them.

Time has passed and I am still relapsing every 7-10 days or so, I am trying to deal with compulsive urges (not only with fapping), but they beat me each time. I still meditate, take cold showers, but I am nowhere further in my spiritual developement than I was few months ago. Each day is harder for me. Doesn't matter whether I relapsed yesterday or last week. Each day I struggle with feelings of despair and emptyness. Those who know what it feels to be empty inside and still try to do everything one has to do will understand. I have actually stopped comming to nofap for a while and didn't count the days since the last time I fapped. It didn't matter. I still relapsed whenever there was a chance.

What I am now: I talk more (I think), I feel less anxiety, I have some motivation, but my insecurities are also stronger, I have no hope I will ever connect to people or advance in my meditation. I honestly don't think I will ever be able to go longer than a month without fapping. People are amazed at how disciplined I am, but they do not realise how weak I am.

This story is not to discourage you, but rather to aware you that this journey is incredibly hard (most of you know that already). I am not giving up, but I don't have motivation to try harder either. This is the post from a man, who is at crossroads. And he still doesn't know where he will go. Stay strong, and I hope you are doing better than me."

I don't know where else to post this. I was hoping I could get advice/guidance from the women here because this is honestly the only place on reddit i feel comfortable posting this to. I don't know where to start or what to tell so I'll just tell the entire story.

I had sex for money and now my partner of 1 year wants to leave me. I'm not upset at her, I understand why she's upset.

I was thrown out of my parents house, in the middle of my last year in community college, because they found out I was taking estrogen and transitioning. I wasn't working because I couldn't find a job with hours that would fit into my school schedule, and it was the beginning of the year, I was still looking for a job after completing my summer internship. Anyway, I didn't have a lot of money because I really didn't expect my parents to throw me out so my partner let me stay at her apartment rent-free for the time being. I ended up finding work after a few weeks and was able to pay for my share of rent and food. My partner's mother hated me though, mostly because I was trans, and she thought I was taking advantage of my partner because I lived with her without paying rent for a few weeks.

Anyway, my partner and I ended up living fairly comfortably in a small studio in Los Angeles for the rest of my school year (this is 2012-2013). I tutored, and did freelance graphic design, PR, and writing. She wasn't in school and worked as a graphic designer for a big real estate firm. Once the summer came, I couldn't stand not living full-time and decided to be full-time female, except at work. In an extremely unfortunate event, my boss for the hagwon I worked for saw me and my girlfriend at a boba shop in Koreatown. We didn't see her but she had called me an hour later essentially telling me that I was a pervert, that I wasn't getting my final check (about $900 in cash), and that she never wanted to see me again. I couldn't afford a lawyer, and all of the employees at the tutoring center were paid in cash to avoid taxes. Luckily, I had money saved up from the freelance work and was able to support myself through the rest of the summer doing legal courier work and some free-lance writing.

Anyway, come August, my partner left for San Jose to finish up school, and I could no longer afford to rent out our studio at $1300 a month. I had only one more month left before I had to leave for Santa Cruz for school, so I was going to try to find something on AirBnB but then my friend who's a Stanford grad student and lives in San Francisco told me I could stay with her and share her room in Potrero Hill for $500. I wired her the money, and at this point, I had little money left. Like barely enough for the gas to get me up to San Francisco but I didn't really have a choice, I had to go somewhere and that was probably the cheapest and safest option I was going to find. So I start to run out of money and I ask my partner for a loan that I can pay back once I get my financial aid disbursement check and she says she can't because her parents monitor her bank account. I even called my parents and begged for a loan but they didn't even want to speak with me.

I only had $10 left in my bank account to last me 10 days, I had to do something, especially because I needed money for gas to get down to Santa Cruz for move-in at school. So I put an ad on craigslist. And I had sex with someone for $200 that night. I regret every moment of it. I still feel disgusting and I hate myself for it. I never want to do it again. I feel like I can never tell anyone because I know they're going to think i'm a wh***. I feel like I'm a stereotype. The trans sex worker. I needed the money though, and I wasn't finding work, and I couldn't wait any longer so I just did it.

I told my partner and she just started immediately crying. I feel so fucking awful because she was there for me throughout my transition and I betrayed her. She wants me to take a train down to San Jose tomorrow to talk about things and I don't know what to say. I don't know how to express just how much shame I feel and how much I needed that $200. I'm sorry this is so long... I didn't know how else to tell it.

1miane,2,2013-09-16,"Me[21M] with my girlfriend [18F] 1 year, says she has serious self esteem issues.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1miane/me21m_with_my_girlfriend_18f_1_year_says_she_has/,"Sorry for the wall of text...

So I'm in college and have been dating my girlfriend for about a year now. When we first starting dating, her confidence was one of my favorite aspects of her. 

Recently she was applying for a internship, but never got the job. She was devastated. She has also recently been effectively cut from her school's soccer team, which also hasn't helped the whole confidence thing either. Last week she sat me down and told me that I seemed like I was getting distant, and with everything that had been going on in my world, I saw what she meant. She said she couldn't go on if things didn't change. So I stepped up, got out of my comfort zone, and stopped being so distant. 

After our talk, the roles seemed to have completely flipped. She had been acting distant from me, so last night I called her out on it. It wasn't aggressive, or name calling stuff, I'm pretty good at handling issues with the whole, ""When ____ happens, it makes me feel ____. That might not be our intention, but that's how I saw it"". I felt like we were working things out at first, but then she started having something like a mental breakdown. We have been dating for a year, and have never once had an argument. It probably has to do with the fact that I don't really let things get to me, and that if they do, I usually just let them boil until the pressure builds and I kinda break.

Either way, she started talking about how she was getting nervous about our future, and where we were going with our lives. She mentioned how she was scared that things were slowing down because I have a job offer lined up for when I graduate, even though it is in a field that I'm not even sure if I want to work in. It felt like she was drawing some correlation between the fact that I have my shit together for the first time in my life, and she isn't sure of her future. I guess in her field knowing some programming languages really helps in finding a job, so I offered to teach her them, because I am a CS major. She said, ""It doesn't matter. No one will hire me.""

It made me feel like she was angry/jealous that I'm finally getting rewarded for my hard work, where for the first time she isn't getting rewarded for her work. 

She said she felt like her relationship with God has been lost since she started dating me. She knows I've been agnostic for some time, but I've never been against her beliefs. Hell, I've offered to go to church with her if she didn't want to go alone, and if she didn't feel comfortable with me there, I could give her a ride to anywhere she wanted to go Sunday mornings. Recently my mom went through a crisis of faith, and she seems much closer to God now. I told her she could talk to my mom if she wanted, or I could ask what my mom went through to find God again. She started talking about how she believes things should be; God first, family second, self third, meaning God should be your highest priority, followed by family and friends, and finally yourself. That's fine. Some people need God in their lives. But, she told me she thinks it isn't fair that she spends more time thinking about me than she does God, which I'm still kinda confused about.

She talked about how in the beginning she told me she never wanted me to change myself for her, but along the way she's changed her mind multiple times. For example, I grew up in a family where sweeping things under the rug was a norm. So when I was going through some issues, I'd handle them myself and never really open up about them. She wanted me to be more open, so I was. I told her about my relationship with my family, and how terrible it actually has become. About how on the surface it might seem like we're a pretty normal family, but underneath my mom has been pretty mentally abusive to me over the years. About how I had some serious self esteem issues growing up, and turned to unhealthy ways of coping with pain.

She was happy I opened to her, but I think she feels/felt overwhelmed by it, and thinks that leaving me will perpetuate/start a cycle of self deprecation like it had in the past. It felt like she was saying, ""I'm in the relationship now for you, not for me."" 

She told me she knew she'd never find another person like me. That she never had someone who was so kind and understanding in her life. She told me she knew if she broke things off, it'd be the biggest mistake of her life. She said she needs time to recollect herself and to find her confidence again. She said she still wanted me in her life, but she needed space. She asked for a break.

I told her I couldn't do that. I told her that I can't do breaks. She said it wasn't like I was over crowding her, or I was in her face too much, but she wanted to keep me around, but just not be officially together I guess. I told her if she didn't want to be together, that's fine, but I wouldn't wait around for her to be ready. That isn't fair to either one of us.

She then said, she wanted to be *more* serious then. She wanted to talk about the hard stuff in our lives. She wanted us to be closer. She wanted to talk about my past and hers, because it has made us who we are. I'm not so sure though how much I really want to talk about our pasts, especially dating wise which is what she wants to know about mine.

I'm not a girl, but I do know what its like to have a total breakdown. It seems like the whole world is spinning around her head, but she can't make it stop. She doesn't know what she wants but she does. 

What should/can I do to help her out? I'll be there as much as I can for her, because I love her to death, but there's only so much I can do. I really feel like she's just in a slump and can't get herself out. She's not the person I knew I liked when I first met when I was 15, or the person I fell in love with over the past year. She says she wants to be serious, but wants space. She says she wants her life to be unpredictable, but wants to plan out the rest of her life. She wants me to be successful and happy, but is bummed out that things aren't working out for her, and kinda takes it out on me.

TL;DR: My girlfriend has self esteem issues.

We were generally very happy and had a great relationship.

For about a year towards the end, I was very unsure about the relationship. Small things started to bother me, and I almost started to resent her for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. However, our relationship was still great and we still had fun together and so I was never motivated to break up with her.

I ended up going halfway across the country for an internship this past summer, and the space gave me time to think. I finally broke things off with her about a month ago, saying that I wouldn't be happy staying with my first and only girlfriend forever without wondering ""what if"". For the past month I've been generally happy and sure about my decision, despite her trying to hang out with me and things like that.

The problem is, we agreed to stay friends and so I didn't go ""no contact"". I still followed her and her friends on multiple social networks, and we talked occasionally. We also have a lot of mutual friends still, and so we run into each other and parties and things like that.

Now that it's been a month, she seems to be starting to move on and have fun with her friends and things like that. i see her talking to new guys, and I feel like I'm beginning to regret breaking up with her. I finally stopped following her and her friends on the social networks, because I couldn't stand seeing all the posts and pictures.

My question is, is this real regret that I'm feeling? Should I try talking to her, or is this just an immature case of only wanting her now that other people do too? This was my first (and only) real relationship, and thus my first breakup too. Need advice!

**TL;DR:** Broke up with first and only girlfriend of 3.5 years after a generally great relationship. Now that it's been a month, she seems to be moving on and my confidence about the breakup is going away. Is this regret and should I contact her, or is it an immature case of only wanting her back because other people are talking to her now?"

I was born at 0230 in humanna hospital in newnan georgia early january in the year of some dead guy 1988. that hospital still stands but under a different name. shortly after my birth i was circumcised, not a fan rather ticked but i press on. when i was days old my family adopted hannah, our faithful dog whom i would know most of my life and all of hers. i was a cute kid with porqupine blond hair-very adventurous before the age of four i held a rock and dropped it-red sparks isued forth as it struck the ground and at that moment the power went out in the house-i was convinced it was magic. around that time a tornado came close to our home as a result of hurricane andrew, i remember the sound of roaring wind and the sight of dark purple clouds as i slept in my neighbors split level basement. when i had been four for a short while my nextdoor neighbor was going through a difficult period of adolescence-which translated to him molesting me out of a sense of rebellion. i was not harmed at any point, and i thought he truely cared for me, this carried on. i met my first friend when i was five, he lived down the street from me and i would almost always be at his house when i had time-he was very artistic. i was always fighting in school, if someone hit you you got int trouble: my eldest brother would always be picked on and hence in trouble; my other brother wouldn't get caught; if you hit me you were going down-that carried on for three years. during this time i fell in love with an older woman. i was now in the second grade and visits from my neighbor were rare, she was in the fifth grade-her mother was furious when she found out... we broke up and i was heart sick or a while. a few weeks after columbine a boy at school asked me if i knew how to make a bomb, my neighbor had read an article on the young internet and we had made match-head mines so i said yes and if he came to my house i would show him... someone heard and the telephone game began-when the teacher had heard it turned into ""yes and i'll bring it to school and show you"" so i get called into the principals office and theres a child interrogator, my parents and the bitch of a principal. the officer asked me if i knew how to make a bomb, i said yes and told him how; he asked if i were to bring one where i would use it, i told him where i thought the most damage would be done; he asked me if i would do it, to which i replied ""HECK NO MY MOM WOULD KILL ME!"" the principle still tried to throw the book at me, emphasis on tried-my mom was pissed! so at around this time the molestation finally ended, no drama he just started selling illegal fireworks and didnt need me anymore (que years of questioning who and what i was, in the end im alright) at this point i get involved in boy scouts and it really helped me grow as a person-i wanted to be the one people followed-that people wanted to follow- for everyones smiles to be because of me, not out of mockery but of respect. stayed the course to the end and got eagle scout with 10 days before my 18th birthday (thats the deadline) i traveled many places through the scouts. mountains mostly but once i went sailing through the keys-that was the most magical summer of my life. durring middle school i went to a different school than i was supposed to, my perents were scared that my local school was too violent. well i developped a knack for shoving my foot down my throat. what got me kicked out was i had learned a word that i didnt understand-asked for clarification and got bad advice. so i walk up to my favorite (pregnant) sub and say ""im glad you got laid""... yeah. so for the 8th grade i go to where i was supposed to and it was allright-the admin werent assholes and it was actually better. met the people i would hang with for highschool and my first real girlfriend. some kid thought it would be funny if he took my book and pissed on it-he got in trouble-i got a new book. then this kid from florida showed up and i swear to you that his haircut looked like a penis-no lie straight up his hair looked like a giant blond cock. he was a bully, one day he put a piece of fat from his tray onto mine at lunch time and i put it back-he proceeded to rub into my head aggressively and i elbowed him away he said ""ok"" and punched me three times in the face. i stood up and turned his ass in. whe i was a freshman in highschool i got a job as a bagger at kroger and worked there for two years, it was a good job and i liked my co-workers. on my off time i would walk 2 miles to the nearest bookstore and read for 6hours straight. sophmore year marked the first and last time i contemplated suicide-it was stupid really i was failing french and started thinking stupid shit-i decided that if anyone came and talked to me i would stab my cheast with a pencil-thirty minutes later it was like my brain rebooted and i was like well tat was stupid. i quit the job to take school seriously for senior year, found a group of people that i could actually enjoy being around and had the time of my life. sometime durrng the later half of my highschool time i had an epiphany i was going to die in seventy years... i had no idea what i was going to study at college... and that if i continued on as i was i would live a life so unremarkable that you could replace me with anyone and barely notice i was missing. so i decided that i would live my whole life towards an impossible goal that would take my whole life to accomplish. even if i died before it was completed, if i gave everything i had to make the dream happen and held nothing back... i could always die with a smile. sounds weird but that has kept me from suicide ever since (8years and counting) so i decided i would be a leader and change the world so that it would rock... i would be a king, i even bouth how to start your own country by erwin strause. there was just one problem-all the land was taken, thought i solved the issue by deciding on antartica-NOPE its devided between all the world powers, eventually settled on the moon and i delved into spaceship design in my spare time. went to college after applying to two military schools (was accepted into both picked the one with less hazing and better food) i decided on a major in criminal justice and met a very special girl who never left my side. i was dating my first girlfriend again at the time (this was my fourth relationship and first double dip) eventually we broke up and this girl and i were joined at the hip officialy. i learned many things and my subordinates genuinly likedme and would do what i asked them to do without too much fuss! life was good. then i decided to propose and tried to be as traditional as possible. my parents didnt approve, this drove my love to madness and started a year and a half of bickering. i proposed under a wilow tree on valentines night, when i was with her all was well when i was with my parents the fighting got worse. in the summer of 2009 i was kicked out, my relatives took me in and i joined the national guard. did well enough on the asvab to get a loophole into the SMP program and i was able to finish school while living with my fiance and trying to patch up my family ties. i took an internship with the department of family and children services and was put in the file room, eventually i finished-they were amazed nd actually wanted for me to tag along. everyone of those people was a saint-one was a little shady but not too much. i graduated got married and commisioned into the active duty component of the army in the same week. my family was there and that day holds the happiest memories of my life to date. then it fell to hell-the wedding night wasn't so great... a few days later i went off to train... a few months later she confessed to an affair... then asked for a divorce... it was my turn for madness... the divorce took 15 months to complete and i am still not healed. i had to fight to keep my job because my peers attempted to claim that i was mentally unfit for duty, well he made a mistake and my commander took advantage of it. won the battle and transfered-and very soon i will deploy and take a huge chunk out of the debt i incurred to pay for college and support my wife even durring the proceeds of divorce. i lost my faith and things i had seen in my life suddenly became evidence that god either did not exist or was evil, my molestation, my friend who lost an eye an ear a nose half his face and parts of his scalp to the hyenas who killed his family the same night, the LRA of uganda, and the night my fiance broke-i grabbed a knife out of her hand as it was pointing to her cheast-she looked at me started sobbing and it turned to laughter that haunts me to this day. my life has hells but they do not hold a candel to what i saw done to others, especially to the children i saw durring my internship. if there is a god i will smite him for abandonning the weak and defensless, until i am no more. i once had a dog of my own, her name was havoc ""the dog of war"" those who know me now can tell who i am but-hopefully they dont know when the narwhal bacons. the land lord said he would shoot her, she had to put her in a pound, i tried to adopt her but was too late-the man said a little girl fell in love and she was gone... there was hesitation in his voice, i hope she is alive. I am far better off than where i was, i havent cried in months. and each day i am made proud by seeing what those who have and are under me now accomplish-part of that is my responsibility if only because i dont get in the way, hopefully im helping but either way...their success makes me happy. after this deployment i will continue to kill off my debt as soon as possible, and now i am setting my sights on mars-throught mars one. it does not matter to me if i become a king or not anymore, only that i advance the torch of human knowldge so far that it can never be pulled back. i hope that i can love again, or at least have a non serious relationship soon-but for now i am getting comfortable with who i am as a person. i'll use the spare time and money to get a masters degree in psychology and travel where i can."
1mhgf7,0,2013-09-16,I[19M] have been with my Gf [18F] for 2 years and I'm not sure if it's best of us to continue our LDR.,C_lupus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mhgf7/i19m_have_been_with_my_gf_18f_for_2_years_and_im/,"**History:** High school to college LDR started off fine now a little depressing.

We started dating my senior (her junior) year of high school and got off to an awesome start. We just clicked from the beginning and she really made my senior year what it was. She's my first S/O and I'm her second, they dated early in high school so neither of us have much experience.

We decided to stay together through my freshman year at school which for the first semester was a little tough for her at first but we made it work. 

The second semester wasn't the same I had a much higher workload and she had an internship that kept her pretty busy. Communication broke down when neither of us could make time for one another. When I was home for break it was back to the good old status quo and we spent as much time together as we could till I had to leave.

Now were both in college still several hours apart: she's pledging and I'm taking 19 credit hours with a 6-10 M-F. So again we are having a hard time talking to one another. We can't find a common time for both of us to dedicate too each other. Last semester was awful and I didn't want to stay in that situation if it continued to the next one.


**The problem:** : LDR doesn't work for us I want to see other people.

I'm a bad BF in LDR's, I'm a work-a-holic I dedicate all my time and energy into one thing and don't pay attention to much else. I'm outgoing and meet a lot of people, it's easy for me to get caught up in everything going around me and leave her texts unanswered and calls unnoticed.

But as busy as I am I feel lonely, I hate not having her here with me. Physicality is a huge part of our relationship so it sucks not having that person to just relax and cuddle up with after a long day.

When I meet girls I find myself being a little reserved and holding back, withdrawing so I'm less pressured by temptation. It's human nature to be attracted to people both physically/personality wise regardless of whether or not you're single. I still meet people just fine but I don't like having to hold back especially when I'm out at parties. (That being said I've never cheated on her or danced with other girls at parties, grindings far from innocent.)

It leaves me a little depressed and alone I wish I could be single and experience this post high school dating scene (but not the one night stands or hookups that some partake in every weekend). 

At the end of the day I want to be single, I want to see other people. Not because of anything she's ever done or because I have meet someone I'd rather be with but because I want to know what else is out there. I've changed a lot in the past 2 years I'm the the same guy that I was when we started dating and she's not the same girl.

My spring semester sucked I didn't want to feel like that into my second fall semester but so far I do. She's visited for a weekend so we actually slept in the same bed for once. But as she pulled away I couldn't helped but feel underwhelmed. Seeing her again was awesome we had an awesome time but at the end of the day I was walking back to my dorm alone again.

**Options**

There's three paths this relationship can take:

1. We break up and find other people
2. We stay together and get married
3. We break up then get back together

**Thoughts:**

I don't think I can marry my first girlfriend I've never known anything else and I know I'll always have some doubt whether or not I made the right choice.

I know that she doesn't want to break up, we've talked about it and while I'm unhappy now she'll says she would be ""clinically depressed"" if we broke up now.

She hasn't made friends as easy as I did my freshman year. I think she's still finding where she fits in and who she want's to be. I'm hoping things workout with her new sisters and she'll feel like she fits in at her school. 

But because she doesn't have anyone she can really talk to yet there and I'm her best friend and BF she wouldn't have anyone to go to. I don't think right now is the right time to break up with her but I think it needs to happen this year. Ripping the bandaid off is going to burn for a month or two but it's better than slowly pulling it off over our next year or two at school.

If I didn't love her this would be easy but we've done so much over the past 2 years it's hard to imagine not being with her. I also worry we both love the security of having each other but ultimately won't work. Sometimes I think that I love her but I'm no longer in love with her.

I hope all that made sense and wasn't too reminiscent of /r/offmychest content. I'll answer just about any question that you guys have. Thanks for your time!

1mh9gd,35,2013-09-15,Opinion on a patient and guidance for a lowly intern,Propofabulous,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1mh9gd/opinion_on_a_patient_and_guidance_for_a_lowly/,"Hey guys, anesthesia intern here...looking for guidance from my more veteraned colleagues.   I'm in my 3rd month of internship, currently on pediatric inpatient wards and doing my best to adapt to our volume (usually 30 patients/day with 8+ admits and discharges/day).  Each day I gain new respect for the fallibility of my knowledge, but the awareness at least gives me motivation to keep studying.   

The reason I'm posting is I wish to get an opinion from a physician more senior than myself on a case that struck me on an emotional level.  Let me begin by saying I'm not usually an emotional guy.  I've seen my share of horrible cases (rape, sexual abuse, DWI child fatalities, unexpected sudden cardiac death, etc..) and did a month on the palliative care service doing daily family death conferences so I feel I've developed as thick a skin as expected in an intern, but this case got to me (I'll give the outline without any identifiable information). 

This is a prebuscent male who presented in the past to our pedi inpatient service for vision loss.  We get a call at 6pm from a pedi resident pgy2 (btw, is known as a weak resident).   
""hey guys, I got this kid coming up, he's been here like 6 hours...Been seen like 6 times for migraines over the past month.  Nausea/vomiting several times over the past month with 4 day hx of blurry vision with darkening... Oh and a weird eye exam, blown pupils that are not really reactive"" 

At this point,  my upper level freaks out and I hear ""WTF? Call the optho and neuro attendings from home now!  You've been sitting on this kid for 6 hours?  What's wrong with you? I'll be down in 5 minutes.""  I had not heard the HPI at this point, my upper level tells us to handle the floor and runs out.

This kid comes up, and basic HPI as follows...prebuscent boy, Severe headache began a month ago.   Has had intermittent vomiting and blurry vision.  Mom has taken him to be seen a total of 7 times by various ER's and clinics (seen in our ER 2weeks ago)  over the past 30 days and been given a repeat diagnosis of migraines (mom has migraines).   His vision had been worsening, so much so that for a week he has had friends walk him around school by hand as he cannot see.  He presented to our ER with 4 days of agonizing headache, bilateral vision loss, and nausea/vomiting.   

Fast forward to him arriving on the floor.   I escort him up and am met by optho, Neurology, neurosurgery, and Pedi attending.   I do my best to give an adequate presentation (totally nervous with 4 attendings so concerned).   He gets in the room and after I present they huddle and began talking.   After about 15 minutes of questions I go in to check on him.   He's listening to ""The Lion King"" with the remote speaker to his ear, eyes facing the floor (at this point, I realized he can't see the TV screen).  His pupils are so dilated that there is only black (he has blue eyes).  Sweetest kid in the world and looks/acts just like my youngest brother.   He repeatedly thanks me for taking care of him and keeps apologizing that he can't see my face.  He tells me he can't wait to see again because he has sisters he has to take care of.  I smile and speak with the family, explaining our concern.   At this point, all the attendings file in and begin questioning, they get the same HPI as described above.   They do an eye exam, and I've never seen 4 attendings get so pale so quickly.   This previously healthy kid can see nothing bilaterally whatsoever, even with the pen light only a few centimeters from his orbit, and mother states it's been this way 4 days and that he had declining vision before and she was told ""migraines.""  She also states that, to her knowledge, an eye specialist was never contacted.  

We leave the room and I've never seen more livid attendings (thank God it wasn't my fault). The neuroro/optho attending can't believe they weren't contacted 2 weeks ago, in the first ER visit, for nausua/headache/blurry vision to evaluate for ICP.  They are even more pissed that this child sat in the ER for 6 hours and the resident didn't see blown, nonreactive pupils as an emergency.   

Long story short, steroids are initiated and multiple imaging studies are ordered.   A diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri with optic neuritis is made... But the general consensus from my superiors is that he will suffer irreversible optic nerve damage bilaterally, the extent unknown but with potential blindness.  I spend a lot of time with him/his family and say we're going to do everything we can, but my stomach is sinking the whole time.   I know the prognosis is poor and he'll likely lose the majority of his vision, but I don't know how to say this to the family, so I tell them we'll wait and see. 

I guess my question is, shouldn't this have been caught?  I realize his physical exam and pupil size/reactivity likely has changed over the past 30 days, but wouldn't the vigilant physician have considered an optho/neuro opinion for a case that screams textbook increased ICP?  I guess I'm having trouble accepting that several hospitals told this mom it was only migraines and it would pass, when it was getting worse and treatment could have been initiated earlier.   Or, am I just totally over analyzing this and letting my inexperience show?  For some reason or another, this patient hit me in a soft spot.  I've been revisiting this case several times in my mind and I'm just looking for advice, maybe for my own emotional reconciliation and as a clinical pearl to take forward."
1mh84b,4,2013-09-15,Chugging.,Sal_the_man,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mh84b/chugging/,"Just need to type this out:

It's been a long road to be whom I've wanted to be. I'm nearly there, but I've fallen into a ditch...these are the reasons why

1) **I've been a terrible person lately**

I'm always arguing with my parents about petty issues. It will start with a small thing such as cleaning my room and turn into a whole 1 hour exchange on the problems we have with each other. I love them, but I feel empty saying that I sometimes find solace being away from them. I felt even more torn when family members threw a surprise aniversary party for my parents and I was away at school.

I've also been trying to improve my ignorant, stubborn, and sometimes domineering character. There have been some bad relationships in the past, and amending them has been an embarrassing and slow process for me. I'm actually a very nice person and make friends with everyone easily, but trying to expunge my bad traits has been a journey

I am trying to change, it's just I feel that there is always a war going on in my heart and mind.

2) **Peak time in college**

I'm currently a third year pre-med student and really have to improve my current academic statistics to further my chances of getting into medical school. However, I have also thought about picking up a second major of Public Health so in case Med School doesn't work out I can go directly into a job field I like. Parents have somewhat shot it down since they know how tough the field is right now, but two of my friends who graduated with the PH major have attained great success. 

So improving my grades, paired with considering the extra workload of another major, and thinking about where I am going to go in life in two years is a huge thought in mind.

3) **My car dreams have fallen apart, for now at least**

I am a avid car enthusiast and ever since childhood I always had this dream of working tediously to buy a car completely on my own. I am fortunate enough to be coming from a stable family, and I was always grateful for what my parents treated me with, but I wanted to do this on my own to prove to myself that I'm a man.

And after 4 months of 15 hours a week in college, and 40 hours a week at an internship over the summer, I finally bought a true sports car, a 1991 Toyota MR2! I was extremely happy the moment I bought it, and felt so proud, **not prideful**, that I was granted the opportunities to attain this luxury. Life was good, until 3 days after I bought it and it broke down.

It's been in limp mode for a month, and I've thrown in more money than I expected. As a result my funds have depreciated and I am not in a situation to pay as much for my tuition as I wanted to (because I wanted to prove to my parents that I can be financially responsible of my life too). 

Although the money factor does come into play, my parents have constantly reminded me what a bad investment I made. I'm good with the wrench, and I am willing to do my work no problem, but my rents have always dissuaded my car passion as they tell me I'm wasting time &amp; money instead of working in school and for my future.

All my friends have supported me though...I could care less if it was a hybrid civic. To put so much physical &amp; mental effort at my internship &amp; work to fulfill my dreams, and then have it burn down in front of me has been such a huge mental blow. 

But that being said, I remind myself that I've had car problems before and that ultimately **this thing can be fixed**. I just have to be patient for the funds and shift my priorities. 







**Where am I now?**

I currently feel that I am barely held together by expired glue, but by some miracle I am holding up against a brisk breeze. Broken, yet still holding on...

 I knew that I would face hardship in trying to be financially responsible **but that's what I expected and wanted** because eventually I am going to have to face the world for myself. It's very intimidating, yet a good learning experience. Ultimately, I just want to show my parents that I'm a man now, and I want to make them proud.

Minute by minute, hour by hour, and day by day I am improving myself then improving my situation. If I can do this now, by myself, I can do anything in the future. 

That's all I wanted to share. 

Thank you for reading this."

I don't do much typing anymore, except for script edits which I know there are apps/keyboard buying options for an iPad, the only thing I'm hesitant is that if I want to get more into editing, that a laptop IS essential. 
If I don't do editing as much, then is the iPad a good option?

1ml6fp,3,2013-09-17,[Help] Starting summer housing search early - East Coaster intern looking for any and all advice!,[deleted],SFBayHousing,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayHousing/comments/1ml6fp/help_starting_summer_housing_search_early_east/,"Hi all,

I'll be doing a summer internship from early June to mid-August in the Financial District. As an East Coaster who's been to SF once at the age of 8, I don't really know where to start with regards to looking for housing. This past summer I interned in NYC and arranged for housing on my own through Craigslist and it worked out just fine, but I was already familiar with NYC and knew more or less what I should be looking for and at what rates.

So I'd really appreciate any guidance you guys could give me at all here. I know this is super early since I won't be there until early June, but I'd like to be as prepared/knowledgeable as possible, and would also like to arrange for housing as soon as possible.

* I want to minimize my commute -- walking distance to the office (in the Bank of America building) would be ideal. I will not have a car.
* I paid ~$1400/month, including utilities, this past summer in the Financial District in NYC. I'd like to spend roughly the same if possible, but could go higher. I don't need a super-nice place, but it does have to be clean/comfortable.
* I'm perfectly fine with having one or two roommates.
* I will have very long hours, and so would like to be somewhere that doesn't constantly have loud parties/street noise that might disrupt my sleep.

Considering all that, 

1. What neighborhoods/districts should I be focusing on?

2. What is a reasonable range of rent?

3. Is Craigslist the best search method?

4. How early should I start seriously searching / how early can I possibly expect to have things settled/arranged?

5. Anything I should be cautious of; things to look for; important factors I'm leaving out? Anything at all, really.

Apologies for the long post, but I really would appreciate any guidance you guys could provide. Thanks in advance!"

1mksj4,22,2013-09-17,"33/M/US, Texas",[deleted],lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1mksj4/33mus_texas/,"I'm ethnically Chinese, was born in Taiwan and lived with my maternal grandmother and my uncles until I was 4. My father was a student in California with my mother, until they came back for me and brought me to the states with them. My parents refuse to talk to me about those first years of my life with my grandmother, I suspect I was molested by my uncle who was later beaten by an angry mob and permanently wheelchair-bound after he molested a neighborhood kid years later.

I enjoyed California, the weather and coast were nice. He finished grad school a year later and, unable to find work, piled us and my newborn little sister into a Ford Pinto for the drive to Texas. We've stayed here ever since. He found work as a Chinese restaurant manager and has been doing that ever since in buffets, take out joints, you name it. He never was much of a father, was always working, which is typical of first-gen Asian immigrants. He is also a huge gambling addict and gambled away what little money we had on Vegas trips several times. The final time was in '97 or so, he flew back and beat my mom. I almost strangled him to death. I haven't spoken a word to him since, I was 17 at the time and I don't regret it at all. I've never really known him, to be honest, and what little I do know is terrible.

My mother is a shut-in, has never made any effort to assimilate and speaks little English in spite of being in the country for almost 30 years. I was a shut-in with her as a child, as a result, and never really learned how to socialize properly. Whenever I wanted to go out and needed a ride to go to Boy Scouts or camp or friends, she was yell at me for being selfish. I can will myself to be social around people and polite, but it is exhausting. Social anxiety is a problem for me, I just want to be left alone most of the time. Being very tall from a young age, six foot seven now, didn't help, I've always tried to hang back and blend in, not be noticed.

My mother's language skills left her few options for work, so she went to the massive flea market in town that is open on weekends and she opened a store that sells shoes and household goods from China. She's been doing that ever since. She dragged my sister and me with her every weekend, so I pretty much hate the place. I blame her and that place for being so alone as a kid.

I left for college at 17, went to a large in-state public school, almost flunked out that first year because I completely was unable to handle all that freedom. I got my act together and graduated in four years. Went on to law school as a fall back, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I ended up hating the idea of being a lawyer and during my second year, I dropped out to take a job with a business media startup that paid generous commissions for subscriber growth. It was the first thing in my life that I was super motivated to do and was good at, so I worked my ass off. Ten years later, the company is a national, prominent publication now and my pay exploded. I didn't know how to handle all this money I was getting, I was very poor kid who didn't even have cable TV until I moved to college. I just saved everything and invested it. My net worth crossed $1 million a few weeks ago, as a result. I'm so grateful that this job came into my life, it's been the most fulfilling thing I've done, by a mile.

My sister is not a shut-in with social anxiety like me, somewhere during her early adolescence, it clicked with my parents that they had to do something different or she would turn out like me. She was allowed to go out and have friends and do things and, thankfully, she's turned out well-adjusted. So much so that she did corporate sales very successfully for a few years after college, a very interpersonal-intensive line of work.

She's now studying for her MBA at a very good private school here. She was prepared to take out $100,000 in loans - some public Stafford loans with 6.8% interest due to expiring subsidies and the rest private loans with interest as high as 14%. I was infuriated at how much interest that was. So I loaned her the money as a nominal rate of less than 1%. It was strange - she didn't ask me at all, I forced it on her yet I was extremely unhappy that I was doing it. $100,000 is an obscene amount of money for me, I just have a hard time getting over it, I guess. She graduates in May, already has a $80,000 offer on the table from her summer internship. So that's going to work out well.

I'm unmarried. No kids. Been awhile since I had a gf. I'm not that preoccupied about it, it's others who are. My sister says she cries for me, which amuses me greatly. I know she means well, but this is what I want.

I want a new start somewhere, I've been in Texas my whole life. I love it here for a multitude of reasons, but life is short, I'd like to see some of the world. I love my job but I'm probably going to quit in the next year so I can leave unencumbered. Ten years is a long time to do any one thing, I want to learn a new hard skill and try something else.

I'll always be upset with my parents for my upbringing, but I forgive them for how things were. They tried their best, for the most part, and I'm not starving. I have to take responsibility for what I am and will be, I can't live in the past forever. It is hard, however, her language skills means she pesters me every hour to do something for her. Whether it be pay bills or look up something or explain something. Sometimes I use it as an excuse to launch into a tirade about how much I hate her, I feel terrible about it.

I still go with my mom to her flea market space every weekend out of guilt, I help her open up and close and stick around for a few hours in between. She's not getting any younger. My parents have zero savings and have sunk what money they had in the past into screwball business ventures that have all failed miserably. My hope is I can turn my million into several million through investments so I can care for them adequately in their later years. We'll see."

It is not like this AT ALL when we are together. I can't go on living like this though, and neither can she. I am asking for any kind of help possible, I appreciate anyone's time who reads my long, drawn out story. "
1mkkth,3,2013-09-17,"My boyfriend [25M] and I[21F] live together, but he can't hold down a job and we hardly ever sleep in the same bed.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mkkth/my_boyfriend_25m_and_i21f_live_together_but_he/,"My boyfriend is 25M and I am 21F. We have been living together for four months, and we have been dating for six (known him for over a year). 

**Background:**

I originally moved in with him because my lease ended in May and I was unable to make ends meet (I had a crappy part-time internship), and he owns his own home so there was plenty of room. I am a full time student, and he graduated two years ago but has not worked steadily since. 

We had only been dating for about two months when I moved in, but he and I get along well and there were not any major problems with living together. About two months ago, I got another job and have been working full time and going to college full time.

He and I both are night owls, so it was not unusual for he and I to stay up until the dawn when I was unemployed. He is a big drinker and he would often go out to a bar every night to socialize, but he stopped doing that as often when we started dating (his choice, not mine). 

As soon as I started to work full time, I had to be awake at 6:30AM to get ready to be at work at 8:00AM-5:00PM. It is a normal office schedule and it sucks, but I do it. My boyfriend is still staying up all night long, which would normally not bother me but it creates a problem.

**Problem #1:**

When he stays up until dawn when I have to be at work, it means that he and I never are in the bed at the same time. This is is severely impacting our sex life and how much intimacy there is in the relationship. He will not come to bed with me unless I ask and make it a point that we need to have sex.

It seems as though he would rather stay up all night long and watch television and play on his phone than to sleep in the same bed with me. He and I share the same bed, but it is not until 5AM in the morning that he will finally lay down and go to sleep. The only way I have gotten him to have sex with me is if I ask him to do it right after I get home from work.

I have tried communicating with him, and it's gotten a bit better sexually, but it is still frustrating to never have sex with my boyfriend at night and in our bed.

Edit: He and I both used to have daily sex, and it is what I want and what he told me that he wanted when we started to date. He and I have both had 50+ partners, and you don't get to that high of a number if you DON'T like to have sex...


**Problem #2.**

He can't seem to hold down a job. This is not a critical issue at the moment, as he has enough in savings to get through a year at least, plus he owns his own home and car (both are paid off).

I am not sure whether or not it is due to the fact that he is unhappy at the jobs that he has gotten, or if it is a lack of dedication and work ethic. He has had two jobs since we started living together, and both were in sales. He earned his degrees in Political Science and Psychology, so I'm not surprised that he cannot find a degree in his field. He is a very intelligent person, and he is not willing to accept an entry level position.

Before we started to date, he was employed as a financial planner, but it required investing his own money into seminars in order to turn a profit. He does not want to be in finance, so he stopped working in the field and switched to sales when we started to date. He had two sales jobs, but he quit both after about 2-3 weeks. Honestly, I would have quit the jobs too (both had terrible managers and they lost his paychecks at one position, the other was straight commission and the product would not sell), but the point is that he can't seem to find a job and stick with it long enough to see a return. 

He is willing to work if the work is interesting, but he does not have any solid work history to land a job with. It's been two years since he graduated, so I'm not sure if this is just a result of the recession, or if he's just not dedicated to working.

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend and I are living together. He can't hold down a job, so he sits at home playing games until late at night, which is preventing us from having intimate time as a couple."

1mjyly,8,2013-09-17,How my dad and my boyfriend became strangers... and how I'm starting to get through it,xyggz1,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1mjyly/how_my_dad_and_my_boyfriend_became_strangers_and/,"Needed to get a rant out of my system! Prepare for novel..

About six months ago my dad told me he was in a serious relationship. He is divorced from my mother but they have been fighting each other in court for the past 4 years as they worked together building my dad's now successful company. He believes she deserves nothing, she believes she deserves everything. I think they're *both* frustrating idiots (in context of the divorce I mean). But right from the start I have insisted that I am not taking sides. I moved out shortly after the start of the divorce and stayed on speaking terms with both parents. Both parents were extremely frustrated by this decision. Both parents wanted me to stop talking to the other. Both parents admitted on separate occasions that they resented me for keeping in contact with the other. Both believe the other is the worst most selfish greedy awful human alive.... You get the picture. All I will say is they have *both* done bad things but I love them both regardless.

Anyway, ever since he told me about the new woman in his life, my dad stopped making any time at all for me. I saw him maybe three times after he told me about the new girlfriend, and each time it was a rushed affair, because he was on his way to meet her. We used to go out to dinner together and talk for hours. Suddenly he's barely there. 

Then he tells me he's getting married. I'm not invited to the wedding. The next time I see him, he's married. He's acting very weird. Saying awful things about my brother (my brother is schizophrenic but he is the sweetest guy there is, so this was shocking to hear). My two sisters have fully sided with my mother and do not speak to my father, but my brother, like me, still remains in contact with him. According to my brother, who I guarantee would never lie, the last thing my dad said to him was that if it weren't for my mother, he wouldn't be burdened with my brother. Obviously the schizophrenia has been a lot to deal with and my brother needs to be checked on on a regular basis, but this came out of left field.... 

If it can get worse, my dad announces he and the new wife are moving to the Caribbean.... tomorrow. He literally gives me one day notice. I am so shell shocked I barely react. He says nothing will change, gives me a hug, and that is the last time I saw him. 

After a few weeks of him leaving and pure radio silence, I start to build up this resentment. Resentment that I took so much guff from my mother because I chose to keep him in my life, and he just chooses not to keep me in his. I send him a pretty unsavoury text saying I don't find it fair that this new woman in his life gets priority over everyone else. He tells me a new spouse always takes priority and that ""children do not rule the world"".

Nothing for a few more weeks. I find out from my sister, that happened to bike by his house, that he came home and was in town. And he didn't tell me. I text him asking why he would avoid telling me he was in town after I specifically expressed I was upset he wasn't making time for me and he replies with the most confusing answer ever: that I betrayed him and to never speak to him again.

WHAT?? 

Well, it turns out my mom found out he had left town from my brother. She used this knowledge to grill his ass in court because he was required for some reason to stay in town and not move any of the valuable objects they were negotiating from the house, which apparently he did. My dad claims I outed his moving to my mother, that I betrayed him, and that unless I smarten up and apologize and take responsibility for what I did, he has no time for me. 

Let me emphasize two things: 1) I did not tell my mother a thing, I knew it was a sensitive issue - and, more importantly 2) he never told me not to tell her, so how is it fair to be upset even if I had told her?

... Unbelievable. At this point I am sick of texting and want to call or see him in person to try to explain how completely wrong he is about this whole ordeal, but he won't answer my phone calls. Claims nothing good can come of this for him if we speak on the phone. I probably call him 30 times, in tears and freaking out the whole time. No voicemail on his phone. He continuously doesn't answer. Then he repeats via text to smarten up and take responsibility for what I have done, despite my insistence that I had nothing to do with it, and again, tells me not to waste his time otherwise. 

It's pretty clear to me at this point he has made his choice to start a new life and I am just some inconvenient 21 year old loose end. I send him an email after I cool off telling him I love him but that I can't talk to him for at least a little while because we will clearly never agree on the issue. I tell him if he does decide he wants to talk to me that I insist it be a phone call or in person and that I can't believe this whole fiasco went down through text message. 

And that was almost three months ago. Haven't heard a peep from him since. I'm doing my best but it has been tough. 

At exactly the same time as my dad's departure, my boyfriend announces he got an internship starting in august running until january which will require him to travel on a train all over the US and Canada. 

It was a sore subject because he had applied to the internship originally without telling me, and when he did finally tell me about it, he insisted he would never get it. I was emotionally dead thanks to the dad-drama and was really, really harsh on him when I found out. Got really upset, felt betrayed. I definitely overreacted because my boyfriend leaving just emphasized the abandonment with my dad. We talked about breaking up, but didn't do anything at first, staying together. But we had already been having issues and had already broken up once before (for like 20 hours mind you) And, like I said, once I found out about the internship, I was really quite aggressive. We fought pretty much everyday after I found out.

We only lasted a few weeks after he broke the news. I called him one night telling him I didn't see this working out, not with the way things had already been so crappy lately. He said he'd need to think about it, and the next day while I was at work he texted me saying I was right. And that was that. 

He was my best friend for years before we dated and 100% my emotional crutch. Lost my virginity to him, convinced myself we'd be together forever - told myself that we were best friends that fell in love and that we would never fall out of it. 

Breaking up would have been hard enough - pairing it with my dad leaving, a stressful 40 hour work week and studying to write the MCAT, I pretty much broke down. 

I couldn't get out of bed in the morning, I was crying ALL the time, barely eating, my performance slipped at work (bosses noticed), I couldn't bring myself to study for the exam... I obviously begged my ex to stay with me many times, needing the emotional support. Social outings were a nightmare because all my friends are also friends with my ex, and weren't about to not invite him to come out, especially considering he would be leaving soon. I don't blame my friends, at all, I'd have done the same. But it definitely hindered any progress. It was a seriously shitty time. It was bottom. Honestly, it was rock bottom. 

But it got better. 

I dropped the MCAT. Not a good career move, but there was no way I was going to be able to get a good score. That helped relieve some stress. I forced myself to meet new people that didn't know my ex.

I started volunteering at the hospital, and interacting with patients having it so much worse than me really helped me realize that the world didn't stop turning just because I wanted it to and that there were people out there who had it so much worse, and yet kept positive attitudes.

I moved apartments - clean slate. Didn't have to sit in the living room where I cried as I gave my ex back his belongings or where my dad dropped the bomb that he was moving. Didn't have to sleep in a bedroom where my ex had slept with me most nights. 

Then my ex left town. Social outings with my old friends became therapeutic. I didn't have the anxiety of running into him. Then I found out I made dean's list at my school for the previous academic year, and dropping the MCAT felt like less of career killer. 

Things got better. 

At some point I realized I was thinking about my dad and my ex less and less.  At some point I realized the only time I thought about them was to think about how little I had been hurting lately. 

It's still hard sometimes. I'll stumble across a memory of either of them while I'm least expecting it, and it'll be everything in my power to not let it bring me down. It's still hard to think about the fact that two people that I cherished and never wanted to imagine out of my life - are exactly that, out of my life. 

But I haven't cried in a long time. I get out of bed in the morning. I care about my work again. Volunteering is as rewarding as ever. 

Some days I think about how I literally begged my ex to take me back and how he said no, and I am so relieved that I am just so disgustingly happy. We were unhappy together. I needed him emotionally, but we weren't good together. I can finally see that.

And I am so much stronger now. Because I got through that emotional shit all by myself. I am happy alone. I am not dependent on a boyfriend to help me through hard times. 

And I really am genuinely happy alone. An ex boyfriend that dumped me rather brutally about 5 years ago started talking to me upon finding out I was single and after a few weeks asked me to give him a second chance. 

And I said no! Because I am stronger now. I don't need some guy in my life (especially some guy that saw it fit to dump me) to be happy. 

And I'm proud of myself for saying no. Proud that I can be alone and happy and okay, only three months after shit exploded. When I was with my ex boyfriend I hated being alone. I was so needy. I constantly needed his attention and affection. And now, for probably the first time ever, I am perfectly happy to have alone time where I just read or listen to music or watch TV... alone. Sometimes it's even all I want. 

So I guess I will wrap up this seriously long rant to say that no matter how shitty you think it is, it gets better. It really does get better. 

I feel like I am fully sober after a very long, painful hangover. But the fact is I was drunk before. And not the good kind of drunk. Things needed to change. 

So you know what, life? Bring it on. And thank you! I am a stronger person because of it. 

**TLDR** Dad leaves town with new wife, relationship with boyfriend ends because of an internship and pre-existing problems. Cue emotional breakdown... But I am getting through it. And I am so much stronger because of it! Woohooooo"
1mjygk,1,2013-09-17,Need some advice,djgucci,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1mjygk/need_some_advice/,"Hey guys, first time posting here. A little background for you: I'm 19 years old, have my B.S. in Mathematics with a Certificate in Actuarial Science, have exams P/1 and FM/2 under my belt, and I'm currently studying for MFE/3F in November. Yes, I'm young. I went to an accelerated high school with a dual enrollment program.

I was hired June 2012 for a summer ""internship"" at an underwriting company, lets call them Company X. Company X has no actuaries. They hired me on the idea of starting an analytics department. After the summer, I was hired part time while finishing my Senior year of undergrad, and upon graduation this past spring, hired full time under the title of ""Actuarial Analyst"" with a salary of 30k. 

While I can't say that the work I've been doing has been 100% actuarial, it has familiarized me with some of the internal workings of the insurance industry and I worked with some extensive data, finding trends and doing some basic rate analysis. 

Here's my dilemma: I've been talking to the person who originally hired me at Company X, who has since left to become a part owner in Company Y. He wants me to leave X and join him at Y, to do very similar work, with a bit of a raise (I wouldn't even bother leaving for any less than 40k) and a promise that the company is experiencing rapid growth and I have a very bright future at Y, leading to a CFO kind of role. Obviously this seems enticing, and I most likely don't have the same kind of future at X, a larger, but stagnant company. However, neither of these companies are doing real actuarial work, and I'm a bit concerned that I'm not learning the skills I would need if I were to leave and join an actuarial firm or something like that. I also want to make a decision on what path to take soon, because if I keep taking exams I may end up overqualified and under-experienced, narrowing my opportunities. 

Tl;dr: I have 3 choices:

1. Stay at Company X
2. Move to Company Y
3. Leave X, Decline Y, and find a new job at an actuarial firm or other employer able to give me better Actuarial specific education.

I'd appreciate any advice you more experienced actuaries are able to give me. Thank you very much!"
1mjvmn,0,2013-09-17,I'm tired of this,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mjvmn/im_tired_of_this/,"No. I can't stand it. I've got to say something.

First of all, I'm a freshman in highschool. That doesn't mean I'm an immature twit, as is commonly inferred. I'm more of an intellectual type. I go home and instead of my ""Algebra II"" (really prealgebra review) homework, I study quantum mechanics and programming language design. I'm in love with knowing. I'm an INTJ/INTP (not really sure which, probably a bit of both).

I want to be an adult. But I'm not. I'm limited by this leash marked ''minor'' that prevents me from doing anything. I want independence. I want to be able to fuck up, and then get back up myself. That's what independence is; the freedom to screw up as hard as you can so you can pick up the pieces.

I want to sustain myself. I want a dose of reality. I can't stand sitting here, doing nothing productive with my life. I'm waiting for some spot to open up where I applied for my internship, but it's... probably not going to happen. I'm only 14, so I'm not sure they're considering my application very seriously.

I want to turn into a trainwreck (hyperbole behind) now so I don't have to later. I want to learn to pick myself up after I fall, but I can't fall. I'm not standing. So how am I to learn to stand the getting back up?

This leash marked ''minor'' restricts me in every way possible. Not just through legal matters, but through social matters. I've been told I matter less, I've been told I'm foolish, I've been told I'm not up to par with an adult, just because I'm younger.

God dammit, it's not like being 18 makes you automatically better! I've climbed mountains, and at the top of a mountain, you're pretty equal to the next guy who climbed the same one. I've carried a pack about 1/3 my weight for 50 miles. I think I'm at least an equal to that guy over there who's 19 and a total loser; complete druggie, going nowhere but down.

I've always thought you have to hit the wall as hard as possible to realize there is no wall. It happened on my backpacking trip. It's happened with academia. It's happened with programming. It's happened with school. It's happened with becoming me. It's happened with finding myself. It's happened with overcoming my depression.

I came out better for it; but this leash keeps me from hitting the wall labelled ''adult''."
1mjulg,2,2013-09-16,What do employers want in an intern?,evomax01,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1mjulg/what_do_employers_want_in_an_intern/,"Hi. I've gotten a toehold into this field by passing the P exam a couple of months ago. Right now, I'm just getting my ass kicked in this topology class. I doubt that I'll have to know any of it to be a successful actuarial intern, so right now I'm thinking about taking a lighter load this semester and plan on passing exam FM during December.

I've switched my major around, so the only actuary-related course is a AP-stat equivalent stats course, and a regression half-course this semester, and possibly intro microecon. 

I don't think passing exam FM this December is a stretch, so given I have that much, what else can I do to make sure that I get an internship this summer? It's very important since I'm a junior (I know, I should have gotten on this career shit earlier) and this is my last summer break before graduation.

Any help would be appreciated.

1mjex2,3,2013-09-16,Working towards a new year and a new self,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1mjex2/working_towards_a_new_year_and_a_new_self/,"Please forgive my long-windedness. I don't know how many of these tl;dr posts actually get read but it doesn't really matter - I want to get it off of my chest.

I'm a 20-year-old male living on the East Coast of the US. I don't even know exactly how long I've been using porn. It must be something like 10 years. I've been masturbating for almost as long.

I can sympathize with what seems to be a very common story: increasing thresholds for explicit content, desensitization, etc. When I was very young my parents confronted me about what they found on our computer but I didn't stop. That should have been a warning sign to me, but, as a lot of young men can probably attest, when the conditioning gets in that early, before decision-making skills have really had the time to mature, it can be a nasty habit to kick.

I got religion, so to speak, when I was 15. I can't imagine where I would be right now if I hadn't latched onto some kind of value system that early in young adulthood. Thank God, I have no interest in the kinds of horrifyingly exploitative and sometimes illegal stuff that caught my impressionable and internet-reared brain when I was younger, but after 5 years of trying to kick the habit I still find myself returning to pornography when stressed and having an interest in extreme sorts of content that, intellectually, I know is unhealthy from every possible perspective. I'm sick of it. I spent much of my high school years abnormally unmotivated, exhausted, and emotionally desensitized. While I know there was a lot more than just PMO at work there, I also know that years of frequent and persistent self-abuse certainly didn't help. It was only recently that I realized that this was an addiction, and one that needed to be confronted as one. I couldn't just shrug it off and expect myself to quit. It is a recurring, conditioned behavior that started before I was able to discern any better and has made me a shell of a person. I have had so many interests and passions that I have abandoned halfway, partially because of a lack of trust in myself and partially because of my own lack of commitment and emotional wherewithal.

My parents split up a little over two years ago. What was supposed to be an amicable separation turned into months (and years, now) of hateful conflict, manipulation, and emotional abuse from members of my family that I trusted. I left college after my first semester because I was feeling burnt out. I didn't bother taking my finals. I left friends and student organizations that were counting on me hanging because of my own confusion and exhaustion. Since then, I have been trying to rebuild myself. I spent the last year working as an intern with a community that serves the poor in Canada. I've been able to prove to myself that I can commit to things that are difficult and see them through to the end, but there's still a lot ahead of me. I look at people my age doing the things I want to do - making music, making art, serving their communities, doing meaningful work and succeeding academically - and, if I'm being perfectly honest, it can be a bit discouraging. When I look at portfolio requirements for art school, I realize how much people my age who are flourishing creatively are expected to have done by this point in their lives. It feels like poking my head out of a cave and realizing that the world has been going on without me while I was caught up in all kinds of psychological snares I stepped in years ago. I know it sounds silly and self-pitying, especially because I *am* very young, and I recognize that but it's how I feel, and I need to be honest and realistic with myself about it. 

So, I've decided to make this coming year a ""Jubilee Year"" of sorts. I want to be free of the bullshit I've let myself get caught up in and commit to the things and people that matter to me. With the help of a gradual reform of my diet, a more rigorous excercise routine, and antidepressants I've been lifted part-way out of a fog that has been strangling me for longer than I can remember, but there's still a lot of work to be done. Most importantly,  I *need* to quit PMO. I'm pretty sure it's the single greatest drain on my physical and emotional energy and my psychological health. My loved ones deserve better of me, and I deserve better of myself. As of right now, I am going to commit to being porn-and-masturbation-free, with everything that will require of me. Over the next year, I am going to commit to practicing and recording music with *real* regularity. I am going to *finally* pick up the martial art I have said I was going to for years and attend practice more than once a week. I am going to make a list of novels I've missed out on and finally just fucking read them by the end of next summer. I am going to put out the first issue of the zine I've been talking about for months by early Spring. I am going to start practicing a craft, even if it's only very rudimentary. 

But it needs to start now, with a commitment to stop PMO. Thanks so much for providing me with a framework within to begin the process and such an encouraging community to help along the way. "

1mnksa,5,2013-09-18,Why do people dislike audit?,mrwobblez,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1mnksa/why_do_people_dislike_audit/,"I'm in the middle of recruitment right now, and will be interviewing with the B4 starting next week. I'm based in Canada East.

One question that keeps popping in my mind, is why so many people dislike audit. 

I've asked my friends who just completed their summer internships, some current associates, as well as people who have switched into other service lines, and the common denominator is: ""audit is boring"" or ""audit sucks"" etc..etc..

What are the reasons all these people rush to escape audit after attaining their designation?"
1mn96j,15,2013-09-18,"I think the television show ""Dexter"" is best appreciated if you stop watching after the end of season 4. CMV",Halbrium,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mn96j/i_think_the_television_show_dexter_is_best/,"I feel like every season subsequent to the fourth season of Dexter is tired, contrived, and suffers from ""wheel spinning"" plots such as ""Quinn suspects Dexter"", ""Creepy Masuka intern guy"", and ""Pretty much anything to do with anyone else at Miami Metro, *The Country's Worst Police Force™*""

Who can forget classic television moments like  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlZnbagyj6c

I feel like Biney, Lila, Miguel, and Trinity each touched upon a critical area of Dexter's psyche. They brought interesting ideas for the character to explore and the series ending with Dexter finding Rita dead with Harrison in a pool of his mother's blood just as Harry found Dexter brings the series full circle. It shows that Dexter's lifestyle has consequences while giving him a chance to not make the same mistakes again with his son.

I really enjoyed the first four seasons of this show. It's sad how unwatchable the show is now. It was so jarring after Breaking Bad's ""Ozymandias"" to turn on Dexter and see the stilted dialogue and uneven performances."

Right now I am very much struggling with this.. at times I don't think it will be like this forever, but I still don't feel like looking forward to the time when I will have overcome all my problems as it doesn't seem like anything that could possibly follow this would be worth going through this much pain.

I don't know whether I suffer from depression, but I can describe what I'm going through right now.. I'd have tons of stuff to do but soon as I start working on something I feel this overwhelming stress and powerlessness, I end up in my bed crying over everything that has been going on in the past few months. I sleep most of my time, I don't really go out anymore except from buying food for me and my cats (which, to be honest, are the main reason I haven't killed myself yet), I can't find the energy in me to do anything really.. It's just all so stressful. 

The problem is that as I said I'd need to do tons of stuff, like I'd need to take care of my finances for next semester, I'd need to apply for an internship for next semester, I'd need to write two essays till the end of the month.. but I can't even get started because I end up having breakdowns when I do.

1mmivm,1,2013-09-18,Need Advice on Christian Relationship/Timing,ScotchandClass,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1mmivm/need_advice_on_christian_relationshiptiming/,"Hey guys!  So I've just finished my second year of an internship at my church and last may I confessed my affection for a girl who was in first year of doing the same thing.

She liked me too and we spent the summer not dating but spending all of our time together with friends hanging out.  We grew closer and stronger in our relationship, but not dating because she wasn't sure if she would be really ready or not when she began her second year.

Well, last Saturday she told me that she can't do it.  She can't handle the emotional requirement to date AND devote herself fully to the church and the internship.  

I totally understand, and am at peace about letting her be all who God wants her to be and to devote herself to this season.

Here's the issue: I can't tell if she's fully closed the door on me for a relationship in the future.  She told me that she still likes me and cares for me and that we're still great friends first and foremost.  But it's been a few days and she's totally shut me out from her life.  When I see her she's so happy an seems non-chalant about ""breaking up"" even though it was tough for her to tell me.  

It's been rough the past few days emotionally and I don't know what to do.  I want to fight for our relationship and wait for her.  But now I have to lay aside all of my emotions for her and be her friend without being intentional and pursuing her.  It's harder still because I work for our church, lead at the same campus and have the same friend group.

I don't know if she will still like me and if I should hold out or not.  I don't know how to just drop my feelings for her and be her friend while I watch other guys hit on her, when I see her in church, etc.  

I know I need to respect her decision and her space and let her be, but my emotions are the point where I don't know what to do.  I don't want to go to her so early since our discussion and tell her my feelings and my intent to wait.  She had said that she didn't want to keep me in a state of limbo when she wouldn't know when she would be ready and that it would be unfair to me.  

But I want to be with her and I want to wait.  She's worth it to me.

I guess I'm just asking for your advice and insight.  I've never been in a relationship let alone be in this state of limbo.  She means so much to me and I think we could really have some together.  

Also, I could use some prayer for my emotions and my peace.  I feel like God keeps bringing me back to Psalm 37:3 where David says, ""Trust in The Lord and do good, dwell in the land and feed on His faithfulness.""  But I'm not sure what it could mean.

Thanks guys!

TL;DR: I'm confused about a potential relationship with a girl who needs space and wants me to be just friends.  I don't know if I should wait for her or move on but I know that I want to be with her and need advice."
1mmgqq,0,2013-09-18,Has my significant other stopped loving me...?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mmgqq/has_my_significant_other_stopped_loving_me/,"Guy here.. I'm 24 from NY, my girlfriend is 22 and from KS.

--

We have been in a long distance (1200mi) relationship for almost a year now. Actually, our one year anniversary is coming up this weekend. I feel like I should be totally excited, after all, it's my first ever committed relation that has lasted this long, and it has all gone so well. But this past month has been emotional for me.

--

We met each other when I was doing a 6 month internship for a company out in Nebraska, at the time, she was going to school at UNL. I should say we met within my last month of being there, and really, everything happened extremely fast. At the time, I didn't want to commit on being in a relationship, not long distance anyways. I'm pretty affectionate for a guy, thus I knew the distance would kill me. But we both knew how we felt about each other, so I decided to be strong, and give it a go.

--

Fast forward a few months, we were still very passionate. While we couldn't be physically intimate with each other, we had our way through phone, texting, and Skype... and this was practically a daily thing with us. There was the constant I ""love you"" being bounced back and forth, sending selfies 24/7, we even left our laptops open with Skype on so we could fall asleep together.

--

This all went on for about 5-7 months but it started to slow down. However, she got to spend almost the entire summer with me when I was doing a 6-month internship down in Virginia. (and hear I am tearing up as I am writing this) You don't realize how truly special someone is until they are taken away from you. I got so use to coming back to my apartment, with her waiting for me, smiling as I returned home from work. It was a amazing feeling. She couldn't stay all the way through August as she had to fly-out and get back home so she could prepare for graduate school back in Nebraska.

--

Our last two weeks together were emotionally rough, and I for one, especially for being a guy, cried so much when I had to kiss and hug her goodbye at the airport, not knowing how long it will be until we are together again. When she left, that entire week I was so depressed. 

--

Now I am back at school, and she is too, and its been almost two months since we have, well, ""gotten off"" to each other. The ""love yous"" are minimal, and it seems the only time it is said is when I initiate it first. Going through my text messages, 90% of them are my girlfriend saying ""I love you too"" or ""I miss you too"".

--

One night, she said she was under some stress with her work. I told her I know a good way to relieve some of that stress ;) Her response was, ""It sounds like *YOU* need to relieve yourself."" I was taken back by it as I felt she was only going to sext me because I wanted to, not because she wanted to. And yes, I confronted her about it. I told how I had been feeling, like how we hardly say I love you to each other and how we have yet to pleasure one another. I even proceeded to ask her if she was no longer attractive to me and she said ""No, no, it's not that at all."" I mean, she has clearly stated to me there isn't a problem then proceeds to say we can get off. By then, the mood was ruined and nothing happened that night, nor was anything said about it.

--

Fast forward one more month (current times here now) and our communication has just been awkward. I almost don't even feel like talking because I'm thinking she needs space away from me. I decided to go ahead and communicate that to her and she reassured me how everything is fine. ""We are fine."" When I asked about our sex life again, she said it's because she has been busy and hormones effect whether or not she's horny. It's like I get that, but for almost two months, you mean to tell me you haven't had the slightest urge to get off with me. Not unless I say something and even then, nothing happens. She really didn't have a response. I feel like if she does anything now, sext or whatever, it will feel forced because I have brought it up three times in the past few months.

--

So here we are now, a year into our relationship, and our goodnight messages, well, they are just that, ""goodnight"". I'll occasionally toss in a ""I love you"" and I will get the usual response, ""I love you too."" I really don't know what to think of all this. When I say ""I love you"", I do mean it. But I'm almost afraid to keep saying it if her 'too' replies are not true. I've told her this before that sometimes its nice to hear her say it first... but it hardly seems to happen.

--

I'm lost here Reddit.

1mlyx2,27,2013-09-17,It's My Birthday.,[deleted],Glitch_in_the_Matrix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1mlyx2/its_my_birthday/,"It was back during an internship I was doing on winter break from college. I landed a pretty sweet gig, was living at home, and New Years Eve was around the corner. On the outside, things were pretty good, but on the inside I was a little jittery. 

I was taking lunch outside on a busy city street. As usual, I was thinking about life, my future, and other silly things that I can hardly recall now. I was caught up in anxiety, that I do recall. Between a bite of my sandwich and a look up to distract myself with some quality people watching, a woman walked up to me. She was in all white from her hair to her boots, must've been in her 40s, pretty for her age, and smiling at me. 

""It's my birthday, and I wanted to share this with you."" 

She handed me a five dollar bill and walked away. That was it. Like everything around us stopped for a moment and this five dollar was opening up a new perspective I've never felt before. It was the strangest thing, such a small act that drove home for me seeing as I was literally just all caught up in the small stuff. 

The glitchiest part was when I looked down at the bill. On it was written, ""worry less, love more.""

I ate my lunch, went back inside, and vowed to truly start living my life. Now, two years later, I've been worrying noticeably less... and damn does it feel great. All it took was that woman in white."
1mqnx1,114,2013-09-19,My husband [23M] threatened me [22F] and I called the cops. Now I don't know what to do.,vivalaemilia,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mqnx1/my_husband_23m_threatened_me_22f_and_i_called_the/,"Wall of Text incoming.

We've been married for 3 years, together for 6. We've been fighting a lot lately. A lot, a lot. There's some big issues, after all. We haven't been having a lot of sex, he's always the one to initiate and he feels like he has to beg for it for a week before I'll give in, I'm not pulling my weight in housework, we're both unemployed and the savings are gone, the whole deal. Divorce has been brought up a few times. But when he loses his temper, it's over the tiniest things. 

Today it was because he couldn't get our 4 month old's onesie over her head. She's a big kid, in 6m-12m sizes for a while now. I'm busy getting my shoes on because I'm running late for this huge internship fair and I've got a shot at a paid internship in my career of choice. I glance around to see what the problem is, he's trying to get it over the crown of her head instead of over her face first and it's just not working. Try that first, I said. He's already tried that. Well, okay, that onesie's got a snap on the shoulder to make the hole bigger. It's already open and I'm a bitch now because I'm not paying enough attention. 

We get in the truck and get ready for the long drive. Oops, I stepped in mud trying to jump into the passenger side with a carseat in my hand. Honey, could you go get me a paper towel? I'm in dress pants and can't risk getting out again. Sure, sure. He gets back in the car, we drive off. Oh, I let baby's sun shade up, I'll put that down since she's in the middle of the bench seat and doesn't need it. Now I'm an inconsiderate bitch because my putting the sun shade down is interfering with his driving. Alright, I can take that, it was kind of inconsiderate, but we're at a stop sign. He gets huffy. I say, ""If you're going to be like this today, I'd rather you stayed home."" I'm not interested in sitting in the car for an hour an a half in silence or with him yelling at me.

Shit hits the fan. He'll stay home, but I have to take the baby with me. There's no way I can do an interview with a baby in tow, he knows we need the money and I need this opportunity. Too bad, he's made up his mind. He turns the truck around and we go home. He wants a divorce and he's taking the baby. Sure, he's got anger management issues but there's classes and therapy for that. But I'm a bad mom. Last night, I was ignoring baby so I could update my resume while he played video games! He had to STOP PLAYING VIDEO GAMES to take care of our baby so I could get ready for an interview! Internet addiction, right there! (I don't deny being addicted to the internet, but this was going a little far.) He tells me to take the baby and go find somewhere else to stay because he's getting a lawyer. ""Have some quality time with her before you lose custody.""

Okay, fine. I start packing my suitcase. ""Where are you going to go? To your mom's? To your boyfriend's?"" I'll figure something out. He backtracks, wants to talk, wants to figure this out. No, I'm done. You want a divorce, nothing I can say will stop that, we're pretty obviously not happy together. He redoubles. If I walk out the door with the baby, he'll ""put me six feet under"".

""Bring it."" 

He takes his hatchet, conveniently at the bedside for use against pesky home invaders. He takes the cover off, runs at me, raises it over his head... and I duck, yelling ""[his name], STOP!"" He bends down to my level on the floor, roars in my ear ""YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS SERIOUS! I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!"" 

I run out the open bedroom door. I go to the backyard, dialing 911. He follows me, yelling ""DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT CALLING YOUR MOTHER"". He doesn't realize who I'm on the phone with until I say, weeping, ""Hello, I'm having a domestic dispute with my husband..."" then he's trying to wrench the phone out of my hands and I'm shouting at it ""PLEASE SEND SOMEONE! PLEASE!"" as it flies to the ground. 

""What have you done, why why would you call them, you've fucked us, WHY?!""

He picks up the phone, talks calmly to the operator. Gives them our address, tells them what happened, that we were fighting and no, there's no need to send a deputy, I shout at the phone ""HE THREATENED ME WITH AN AX, PLEASE SEND SOMEONE"". He glares, the operator tells him to hand me the phone. He picks up the hatchet, puts the cover on it, sets it on the kitchen table. I'm talking to the operator, he's wandering around saying ""I'm going to prison. Yup, going to prison. Fuck everything. Fuck it, I'm going to prison."" 

The deputies arrive. One takes him outside, the other keeps me inside. They take my statement, they're very determined to hear me say that I was afraid, that I thought he was going to kill me. They want me to say those words. The officers switch. Same deal. Gotta say that I was afraid for my life. I follow the officer outside this time, just in time to see them putting my husband in the back of the squad car. 

I don't know what to do now. I've got no money and no support, I've got school to worry about and the house, and most of all, THE BABY. My mom wants me to come live with her. She's got a spare bedroom, and a rental she manages is opening up in November. I could live there. All of my family is there, it's like built in childcare. There'll always be someone who can watch her for an hour or two, no problem.

But I'll have to withdraw from my classes this semester and I'm doing so well. I've had to take a lot of time off in the last few years (depression, baby, administrative bureaucracy) and this felt like my last shot. The university where she lives doesn't even have my major so transferring there is out, I'd have to commute 2 hours both ways to the nearest one with my program, and it'd be out of state. 

To make things even more complicated, his ""boyfriend"" comment while I was packing wasn't out of left field. I'm polyamorous and my boyfriend have been together for a year and half. He's undocumented and pretty much an indentured servant under the people he works for. He wants to come with me to my mother's city but there's no way he could get there. He can't drive and he can't speak English. He'll have to wait here until November when that rental opens up and I can come rescue him.

I know I can't stay at my house. I'm supposed to tell the prosecutor that I want conditions on his bond, that I don't want him to come to the house until I've moved out. But move back in with my mother? She's coming down tomorrow to help me get my things together before husband gets back and something worse happens. Somebody help me out here. Tell me I'm doing the right thing making my escape.

It's my first serious relationship, so I was all excited as it grew, ignoring that I had to study (fortunately I did well anyway). We don't have much in common besides both having very few interests and being overall boring people. We talk about everyday stuff and act like most 40-year old people act. Most of the summer we're away from each other, but since the academic year starts in roughly 2 weeks we'll be together again living in the same building. Or..?

Today she told me how bored she feels and how she needs to take a break - no talking till we meet in the university in october. She needs to think it over. It's depressing to imagine I could ever end up without her, but I'm past feeling devastated about it (our beginning wasn't easy either due to my having to study all the time so there were moments when I feared that). What I mean is that I almost feel like I don't care anymore, but somehow when we had *a talk* today I felt like crap and my eyes watered up. I'm confused.

I find her really attractive and she's smart too... she reads books and does well socially, but studying is not her thing. Medicine is none of her interest too, she's studying nursing only because it guarantees a job. To tell you the truth I would totally ignore the incompatibilities and spend as much time as I could with her (don't know if I can say ""whole life"", but that's what I mean). She just seems bored with me. It's like I'm not the kind of guy she wants, although she might appreciate my helpfulness, honesty so she won't tell me that.. During internship (we have to do every summer here) she met an interesting guy with whom she chatted a lot and spent some time and was really excited about him, even though *he's an arrogant jerk*. She told me she wasn't interested in him as much as in me, but I just don't know. 

What should I try to revive what's between us? Or is it not going to work anyway and I should give up any attempts? I really want to try, but don't know where to start. I'm not going to talk to her until we meet and then see what she came up with while *thinking it all over*.

I'm currently looking for a potential room someone has to rent or a flatmate to live with starting about mid-November. I'm a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Manchester, so I'm on the market for a more young professional type of living situation rather than student. 

My current lease is ending at the end of November, but I will be out of town from 14/10 - 11/11.. which is unfortunately one of the best times to look for a place to live. I'm hoping to find a place by the time I leave in Oct. and be ready to pack up and move once I return in Nov. I will most likely be applying and with any luck receiving an internship over the summer, so I'm just looking for a place to stay for the next 8ish months or so (end of May/beginning of June). It's an odd amount of time, but it's what I'm going with at the moment.

Things kind of fell through with a flat I was looking at recently, so I thought I'd give you guys a shout and see what anyone thought. If anyone is interested, or knows of any interest please let me know.

We had instantly chemistry and within a month, he told me he loved me. And I found that I loved him too. He went to a college about 3 hours away in another city, so we did the whole long distance ordeal. 

We've had our fair share of problems, and have broken up a couple times and got back together after a day or so. We do have communication problems to where I can't understand where he's coming from and he can't even begin to understand mine.

However, the biggest issue arose actually when he moved to my city after college for his first real job. Nothing has been the same. We fought 2 days after I came back from seeing my family in China where he accused me of being clingy. Suddenly he wants his space all the time, and spending the whole weekend with me is almost like a 'treat' for me now. I'm confused and I don't know how I should act or relate to the situation.

He calls and texts me every day and constantly tells me he loves me, but when I try to push him to ask him to let me know his weekend plans, he gets irritated that I'm not letting him have his space. We don't really see each other during the week because he has work and I have school + an internship. We game together and he's more than happy to game with me, but I guess spending time with me in person is a whole other thing.

What should I do? I want to be with him more, but he doesn't seem to want that. I don't want to be in a long distance relationship anymore and that's honestly what it feels like. I miss him. How can I stop obsessing over him? What should I do to make him want me again, like he used to? Every time we try to calmly talk to each other about it, we just can't understand each other.

Extra: he's a programmer, he's a gamer, he's introverted. I'm very extroverted, emotional, but I game too. We have the same friend group, which I see and interact with all the time. He doesn't do much outside of work other than 'his own thing'.

1mq7m7,1,2013-09-19,Good day gone horribly bad due to one person's greed.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mq7m7/good_day_gone_horribly_bad_due_to_one_persons/,"**TLDR: On my way to a job interview today, my wallet fell out of my pocket and someone swiped it, causing me to miss out on a job, lose $100, making me have to go through the stress of replacing all my shit. This is despite the fact it was only on the ground for 10 minutes and was lost only a block away from my house.**

To start the story off with some context, I've been unemployed for a while. After a lengthy unpaid internship that didn't manifest into a job I've been having trouble finding a steady job. About a week ago, however, the founder of a company I used to work messaged me on facebook to see how I was doing. I told her about my life since and she told me to come by the office and we'll have a talk, and a talk we had. She told me about this internship that I could apply for through my connection with that company and that I could possibly come by and do some work for them too. The internship was only minimum wage but hey, it's a start. I was excited for the opportunity.

I applied for the internship, got a response, and set an appointment. That same day, another job that I randomly applied for gave me a call back. It was a part time research job that paid quite well. We made an appointment for an interview the day prior to the internship interview. I didn't schedule them for the same day because my mother recently got out of the hospital and is more or less confined to her bed. I didn't want to be out the house too long on one day in case she needed me. This, as you will see, will end up working in my favor.

Now we get to yesterday. I have a little bit of money, so I decide instead of going to these interviews with the same old clothes that I've gone to previous interviews with, I'm going to get myself a new shirt/pants set and a haircut. (I've lost weight since I got them and they weren't cut that well to begin with). This ended up costing me about $85, plus the transportation costs to get to the interviews cost me a full $100. At this point I only have $100 left over. No more money in any form. I get home, prepare everything for the interview and sleep early.

Now it's today. The big day. My first interview for the better paying job. I'm up early. I get all my clothes ready. I have breakfast. I even jump rope for ten minutes to get the blood flowing and to get myself pumped. I shower, I dress, I leave, and I'm ready to kick some ass.

I'm walking to the bus stop, because even though I do have a car, the bus is often faster because I'm not the only person who thinks it's a good idea to drive to the train station, so it's not uncommon that it would take me more time than it would to *walk* from my house than it would to find parking. I get to the intersection where the bus stop is and two significant things happen at once. 

The first thing was that I hear a huge and rather disgusting splat on the floor. I turn my head to see that a bird just took a huge shit. Directly next to me. While I was in shock at how fucking lucky I was that I wasn't standing just a few inches to the right, I noticed something else. While I was at the intersection, not one, but two busses come. This, especially at this time of day, is a death sentence. The direction I needed to take the train, sits across an intersection with a traffic light that takes way too long to change. It's not uncommon that you'll be waiting for the light to change, and as your waiting the light to change the bus will come, pick up and drop off all it's passengers, and leave before the light changes. However, at this hour, busses run slow. That's just the way it is.

At first I'm like ""fuck!"" but then I realize it's no biggie, I'll just run back to my car and worst case scenario just pay to park in the station. So instead of gambling with the next bus time I take a light sprint back to my car. As I start running back I hear a ""clink"" sound as if I dropped some change. I stop for a second, turn around but see nothing. I resume running and I hear it again, but this time I don't stop because I figure it's something irrelevant. I get to my car, drive to the train station and get lucky and found a parking spot immediately. Then, as I was walking to the train, I found out what one of those clinks were. It was my wallet, falling out of my pocket. Which included: My drivers license, My metrocard to take the train, my health care card, and $100 which, by the way, was the last bit of money I owned. I returned to where I was quite certain my wallet fell out of my pocket. I see my lip balm (which was likely the first thing that fell out of my pockets due to the location it was in) but no wallet. I missed the interview because of this.

What kills me about this is that I lost this wallet **one block away from my house**. Instead of being a good person and returning it, even if they stole the money out of it first, they just chose to steal the whole wallet. The worst part is my ID is out of state and last time I had to get it replaced it took them almost a full three months to get it to me. I also need an ID to get past security tomorrow. 

Today really fucking blows. At least that bird didn't shit on me."

(Sorry, long and sad)",ChiliCloud,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1mpckc/might_as_well_do_an_intro_also_i_just_had/,"Hi everyone! I haven't done an intro yet but thought this might be a good time since I was going to make a post about my horrible last two days.

I live in northern Sweden with my SO, two dogs and a turtle. We used to have two guinea pigs but sold them about a week ago since we will need the time and space for the baby. We have been together for 4 years and we are both studying to become teachers at the moment (I'm doing my final internship before writing my exam paper). We are also both graduating by the end of January just a few weeks before the baby is due. Today I am 16+5 weeks along. 

My favorite things to do are read books, take walks in the forest with my dogs and watch movies with my SO. 

I had an copper IUD that I removed May 29th. We got pregnant on the first try and I got my positive pregnancy test June 25th. I had an fairly easy first trimester with a lot of exhaustion, sore boobs and some nausea. I only threw up like 3 times or so. By 15 weeks the nausea was gone and my energy levels were almost back up. Finally I felt like myself again. 

Then of course I got sick! Tuesday morning I woke up with some stomach pain. I went to work anyway (couldn't call in sick because my mentor was out of town and I was the only teacher that could take care of his class that day) but the pain kept getting worse through out the day. I just sucked it up until I got home at 4.30. As soon as I sat down on my bed I broke down in tears and my SO had me called the medical guidance line.  They told me to go to the emergency room immediately. Waited there for about 3 hours until I got to see an OB. 


He did and ultrasound and I GOT TO SEE MY BABY! (mom joked that it was all an elaborate plan for me to get a free ultrasound :P ) It was perfectly healthy and I finally felt some relief even though I was still in a lot of pain. The OB referred to it as a ""she"" one time but I'm still not sure what the gender is since the doctor was foreign and ""he"" and ""she"" sounds really similar in Swedish (Han and Hon). I didn't ask about it though, all that mattered was that the baby was fine. I also got my date changed to March 1st. 

Then I got to meet a surgeon and turns out I was not as fine. They suspected that I had appendicitis and transferred me from the emergency ward to the surgical ward. I had to wait a couple more hours and my sister and SO came and visited me until around 1 am. At 1.30  they told me I was going into surgery but they didn't want to use general anesthesia because I was pregnant. Instead I got a spinal one and got to be awake during the surgery. It was super scary and at one point it really hurt. I got a little bit of morphine and local anesthesia but mostly just powered through cause I didn't want to take any risks with the baby. 
The surgery took over 2 hours cause they couldn't find the damn thing but then finally they did and they saw right away that it was guilty. 
So, now I am at home with only paracetamol to help with the pain. If not for the baby I would be doped up and happy but now I am just miserable. I can barely stand up by myself and my SO have to help me when I need to go to the bathroom. I've cried several times because I feel so helpless.




 At one point I had to go to the bathroom and my SO was at the computer with the headphones in another room. Our deal was that I was going to call him on skype if I needed help but I dropped my phone and couldn't even pick it up. I sat on the bed for 20 minutes crying and just hoping that I wouldn't pee myself. Then one of my dogs came and I wrote a note on a paper and told her to go to ""Husse"" (like master in Swedish) and she took it her mouth and went and gave it too him. She is such a good dog.  
I think she knows that I am sick because she's been staying really close ever since I got home and start whining whenever I cry. The other dog is just happily oblivious :P 
This got a lot longer that I intended too but it was hard to tell the story in any other way. Thank you for listening/reading

Anyone else got their appendix removed? how was it? How long after where you in pain? I just want to get back on my feet! 

**TL;DR:  Got to see my baby for the first time on an ultrasound and it was healthy. Had to have emergency surgery to remove appendix. Now I'm in a lot of pain and feeling helpless.** "
1mp74s,1,2013-09-19,Need help for making internship at UFRJ come true,Kattekongen,Brazil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/1mp74s/need_help_for_making_internship_at_ufrj_come_true/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm currently applying for an internship at UFRJ, the deadline is this Sunday, September 22. I'm a student of political science. I have a couple of questions in relation to this, some of which are really essential for making my application valid. I hope some of you are able, willing and have time to help me :)

Firstly, the webpage of UFRJ is not working, but I need essential info about:

1. How many credits do I need to take a year in order to be a ""full time student""? I have to know this in order to be able to know how many courses to take - it's mandatory for me to study ""full time"". A link to the statemant about full time credits would be very helpful. 

2. Is there by any chance a list of all the courses at UFRJ in English? 

This second question leads to my third question:

3. Is it a stupid idea going to UFRJ not speaking a word of Portuguese right now? I plan to follow a course in Portuguese this spring plus take an shorter, intensive, personal course in Brazil prior to my studies. 

4. Also, my second choice of university is probably PUC in Sao Paulo (I have to prioritize 3). Do you have any thoughts on this? Question 1 and 2 is relevant in relation to PUC SP as well. 

I hope someone can help - please feel free to speak up if you have any ideas, thought or anything else relevant to my plans! "

Let me preface this by saying that I understand that this is very late for a reaction post. Just wanted to put my feelings down before I forget (as if that'll happen). 

Hey guys you may or may not remember me from a couple months ago on this sub/second place in the art competition but it's alright. I took the summer off from anime for an internship, so I was really behind on the series, and I really wish I had talked to you guys more! 

I power-watched five episodes in a row. 

I just finished it. 

I don't even know what to think. 

So many feels right now. 

Please make me feel better, guys...like is there going to be a continuation? I'm seriously really really really fucking bummed out right now. I am very attached to these characters and I want to know how to feel better. 

Cheers

SamMee

Edit: I was wondering something else- when Kyousuke turned down all those girls for Kirino, was it in vain? Is he still continuing his relationship with her? I'm so confused..."
1mouwz,1,2013-09-18,"About to turn 27 on Monday, unhappy for 3 reasons",NoFapAgain,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mouwz/about_to_turn_27_on_monday_unhappy_for_3_reasons/,"I was going to write this in a Word document by myself and delete it but I think putting myself out there and getting this off my chest will be better. 

I am unhappy right now and I don't know why. 

I am about to turn 27-years-old on Monday. I don't have any plans to go out with anyone. Growing up in high school and my early years of college, I had a lot of friends and a core group of close friends. For different reasons we've all changed and things aren't the same and I keep in touch with a few but on a surface level. My current closest friends don't live in my area and I see them once or twice a year (although one, who is a former college roommate is visiting in October). 

I'm not a big birthday person but I feel sad that I'm going to turn 27 and I'll be by myself. Sure I'll get a bunch of Facebook ""happy birthdays!"" and a good amount of calls from family but all I want is for a group of close friends to take me out for a drink or two and laugh and have fun. And it's not going to happen. 

                                              ***
Another reason I am unhappy is my job. I hate my job. I graduated in the height of the recession with a journalism degree. (Double whammy). I worked two unpaid internships and I hustled and worked my way to having a job with the government that on paper is enviable. I liked it the first few months but I've been here for two years and I can't take it.

The management team is inept. They only care about making themselves look good. You should see how they talk about things that happen in the media and how it reflects on their image. It's not about the tax payer at all, all the work we do in the office is self-serving. 

The morale in the office is bad. There are some lifers who are hanging on just so they can collect the huge benefits and retire. Then there is a younger set around my age who are using the place as a stepping stone. 

I've been trying to leave for over a year and I haven't found a position. I have a pretty strong network and they've sent me opportunities and put in good words on my behalf but I keep getting to the final interview round and not getting the job. 

I started a blog/website and that has found some success. Not as quickly as I hoped but I've thrown events and am planning to do so again in the future. I really would love to work on that full time. But really, I just want to wake up and go to work and feel like I'm contributing towards something that matters. I would love to be rich, but that's not my goal at all. I just want to come home at the end of the day and feel fulfilled, like my effort and time wasn't for vain. 

When I wake up in the morning I dread going to work. Right now as I type this it's 11:32 p.m. and I am shaking my head at the thought of going to work tomorrow for another terrible day in that dysfunctional place. I know it's not just me, there are many people trying to leave as well. 

I've been trying to make the best of the situation, waking up early around 6 a.m. to do at least ONE thing for me like workout, write, work on my site, or just relax for a few hours before work. This way it lessens the feeling like work is the central activity in my life. When I do this, I do find my days are better but the fact remains my work environment is very toxic and I'm there most of the day. 

I'm a contractor and my contract ends December 31 and I have decided I won't be returning, no matter if I have another job lined up or not. My emotional health can't take it anymore. I am looking at other jobs like being a courier or even working at a restaurant if I have to. I'm also saving some cash aside now so I have a few months rent and food just in case. The situation still causes me some stress though and I think the number one thing I want in my life is to just have fulfilling work. And the fact I've been looking and trying to get it for so long and haven't made it happen makes me extremely frustrated and also extremely scared that it'll always be like this. 

                                              ***
The third thing I'm unhappy about is I am realizing I am emotionally unavailable. I was a late-bloomer in terms of women. I always, from the time I was young really was super invested in women and I was always ""the friend"". I thought I was ""too nice"" but the thing is I just wasn't assertive and honest with them about my intentions because I didn't want to face the possibility of rejection and that was my fault. 

I read a book called No More Mr. Nice Guy and from there I learned where I went wrong and slowly became more confident with women. I recently ended an almost 3-year-relationship. For many reasons, it just didn't work out. I love her but she was increasingly extremely needy and insecure and even when I talked with her about this and offered to help her - it just never got better. I felt trapped and drained with her, even though I think she's a great person. 

I miss her but realized I needed to move on, so I did. This was about a month ago. 

I went onto Match.com and met two women. I'm still getting to know both and I've been on 3 or 4 dates with each. I like both for different reasons but I'm interested to see where things go. I can tell that one of the two is definitely full on interested and she's emotionally available. The other one just recently broke up with a boyfriend of two years and although she says she's ready to date, my gut tells me she isn't (or she's just not into me -- although I called her out on this and she says she wouldn't invest time in me if she wasn't). 

Something about the one girl being very into me is something that scares me and I don't know why. As soon to be 27 I imagine I will settle down soon. Also as a late bloomer who has come into his own with women, a part of me wants to see what's out there for awhile. 

I'm seeing her tomorrow night and I'm sure we'll have a good time. I want to tell her part of what I just wrote, about the emotionally available stuff but that's a terrible idea and self-sabatoge. I think I just need to really figure out what it is I want. 

I SAY I want a solid, committed relationship and then when the potential is staring at me, I'm not feeling as excited as I should be. I also feel like I'm cheating on my ex even though we have been broken up for a little over a month. 

Part of the emotional unavailability I think stems from porn addiction. It's something I've been battling with, hence the user name. It's not something crazy where I jack off in the bathroom at work or something. It's just that I've been trying to quit porn for over five years and I haven't been able to do it. Hell I've been on reddit.com/r/nofap for about a year or two years where the first goal is to go 90 days without porn and my best is like 65 days or so. 

I think that connection I have to this porn makes having the connection I want in real life more difficult. Actually as I write this I'm more certain this is a core problem to the emotional unavailability. 

So I know this is a wall of text, and I don't know if anyone actually will read but these three areas are making me unhappy and are cause for trouble on my mind. I'm open to any advice if you have it, or a story of your own that may help. 

Anyway, I feel better getting this out and hopefully someone can relate as well. "

1mszi3,1,2013-09-20,22F feels like she never should have met 21M.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mszi3/22f_feels_like_she_never_should_have_met_21m/,"My boyfriend and I have known each other for over 7 years. We have been together for 3.5. We used to be super close and called each other best friends. When we got together it felt like it was truly meant to be- especially if you know our weird background story. But now I feel like we should have never met. 

I have centered too much of my life around him. He's not going anywhere, either. He's living with his parents, has never had a job, and spends every cent he gets from his allowance on weed. I mean, I won't judge him for living with his parents but he has 0 work ethic and just sits around smoking weed. I don't like him spending his father's hard earned money on it when he lies to him and says it's for snacks. I go to school full time and have been working internships lately, and he laughs at how ""easy"" they are although he has never done any long term himself.

Marijuana abuse has already ruined a past relationship for me. And I feel like it's happening again. He will ""stay the weekend"" with me and instead go next door to his friend and dealer's house and stay there until 4am smoking because I banned it in my apartment. I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like he and his friend were taking advantage of me having my own apartment and were being rude about it. They would be loud, eat all of my food and leave everything a mess after they would leave at the end of the weekend. I feel like he chooses weed over everything else.

After I recently came back to my apartment from a 6 week long internship abroad, we weren't even alone for an hour before he invited people over to sell them weed and he spent time with them instead. While I was still gone, he was texting this girl he has known for as long as me about how he missed her although he barely talked to me at all the entire time I was gone. Always a ""going to play a round of LoL"" instead of ""I miss you"". He never says anything positive towards me. I receive no compliments. I receive nothing but 100% neutral speech although I flood him with compliments.

We barely communicate anymore. If we do, it's only because of my own efforts reaching out to him. By the time we talk again, I am always upset because of the lack of affection and start ""nagging"", in his own words. He pushes every issue away now, saying, ""this conversation is making me angry. Stop talking about it or I'll get pissed off"" and then goes back to ignoring me.

I can't take it anymore. I used to be such a happy person. WE used to be so happy. Together. I feel like his depression and his marijuana use has destroyed everything we had. Don't get me wrong, I love him. If I didn't, I wouldn't have been able to hold out this long. 

But after an issue of him talking to the same girl again back in March and messaging her ""get your cute butt over here"" (I felt like he was flirting with her judging by the content of the other messages too) I tried to leave him. 

I don't even remember what happened. But the next day his parents drove him back to my apartment to ""stay the weekend"". He had cut himself all over his arm. I felt fucking HORRIBLE. And the next time I almost left him again, he said ""I cut myself for you. I wouldn't do it if I didn't love you"". It left me speechless. I don't understand him anymore.

I have shortened our entire story. It's so freaking long and probably just as naive as many of the other stories posted on here. The obvious answer is always going to be ""just break up with them"". Part of me has been screaming ""what the fuck are you doing still in this relationship"" and the other part tells me ""but you love him and that one little hug you get sometimes makes everything better"". 

I moved to the city closest to him and started attending university there. I feel like with me living 20 minutes away and hardly seeing him, I am not good enough for him to go a little out of his way to see. I have begged him a billion times to please change some things and let's work on this relationship. Even for him to get professional help for his depression. He will agree and then the next day, everything reverts back exactly to how it was before.

What do I do? How can I leave someone I have subconscously formed so much of my life around? I regret meeting him. I feel like he's destroyed the happy person I used to be. Part of me believes he knows exactly what he's doing. And then the other part of me believes he's kind of dense and oblivious to how his actions affect others and maybe he doesn't do it on purpose. 

I thought we would have been living together by now, after 3.5 years together. I live so close to his house and even closer to his school than his parents. But he isn't ready to live with me and I feel like it would honestly be a disaster if he did. I used to be able to see a future with him that I haven't for a long time now.

If I leave him, I'm going to be in pain for a long time. He's been such a huge part of my life for many years. I even started studying his language when I was younger and now I am living in his country. It's become a part of me and my identity. It all reminds me of him. This is exactly why I regret meeting him.

But if I stay with him, I think I'll continue to be taken for granted and practically ignored. I've tried so hard to be there for him through all of his issues. I don't understand why he started acting this way. I begged him to start antidepressants about a year ago and it's been a nightmare of a roller coaster since. Our online conversations consist of him telling me ""going to play a round of LoL"" and then I don't hear from him again or in person, where he tells me ""I'm going next door to dealer's for a bit"" and then he comes back way after I'm asleep. 

Where do I go from here? I'm feeling pretty hopeless. And I know I really am. I am seeking possible solutions/advice from outside sources. Some for staying together, and others for leaving him. I feel like I am only asking for advice on how to stay together because deep down, I really can't leave him. I have been considering going to a therapist. Please give me advice, thoughts or opinions and then I will start looking up practice numbers on Google. 

Thanks for reading."

Jon Phelps is a friend of Mark Driscoll, an investor, and someone who seems to some roots at Mars Hill.

**Jamie Munson will be involved in day to day operations, leadership, sales, management and community engagement at Storyville Coffee.**

Jamie Munson has had the highest level of involvement of leadership in Mars Hill. 

A short bio: ""Jamie Munson is a long-time pastor and board member at Mars Hill Church and author of Money: God or Gift and Authority: The Leader's Call to Serve. Born and raised in the state of Montana, Pastor Jamie came to Mars Hill as a 19-year-old non-Christian, not long after the church began. He met Jesus, got baptized, and after a stint in the corporate world, became the first Mars Hill intern in June 1999.""

Munson was appointed Lead Pastor of Mars Hill Church in the by-laws Jamie Munson drafted in 2007.  When two pastors disagreed with the by-laws Munson formulated charges against them. One of the charges was a lack of trust or respect for Munson himself.  Munson stated Scott Thomas was in charge of the investigation and Scott Thomas stated the investigation process was not a witch hunt and informed a member that ""a conciliatory process"" had been completed.

From Wiki: As a result of the large growth of the church, their bylaws, which outline how the church is organised, have been rewritten on a few occasions. The outcome of this process in November 2007 led to changes in leadership organization. The new bylaws installed Lead pastor Jamie Munson and preaching pastor Mark Driscoll and pastors Scott Thomas and Tim Beltz as ""executive pastors"" who led the objectives of the church ""under the authority of the Board of Directors"" on which the executive pastors also serve as directors. The change precipitated the firing of two pastors.

""Mars Hill leaders said in forum postings that one fired pastor was removed, in part, for ""displaying an unhealthy distrust in the senior leadership."" They said the other was removed for ""disregarding the accepted elder protocol for the bylaw deliberation period"" and ""verbally attacking the lead pastor"" — charges the fired pastor denied, the leaders added.""[19]

**Kris Rosentrater is a coffee specialist and is involved in roasting and production.**

Rosentrater has ties to Mars Hill through their music programs and has worked with several ""fiery"" Christian acts. A description of one, [""Spy Glass Blue""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_Glass_Blue):

Spy Glass Blue, a post-punk / New Wave / Brit Pop band formed by Allan Aguirre of Scaterd Few, is credited for legitimizing and authenticating the post-punk genre in Christian alternative music (ACM)[dubious – discuss] much in the same way that Scaterd Few defined punk rock in Contemporary Christian music (CCM).[1] In the words of the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, Spy Glass Blue is a ""rare example of Christian goth music.""[2] As Allan's solo effort, shows Allan's artier (""mellower, artistic"")[2][3] side where Scaterd Few showed his edgier side. Aguirre likens the bands presence to the restructuring of other Christian Alternative bands: Mortal to Fold Zandura or the Crucified to Stavesacre.[3]

After the housing crash of 2008 occurred, the jobs problem began. Why the housing boom occurred? Easy credit. Easy credit from banks from subprime loans because they knew they can profit from these loans as soon as the teaser rate expires and turns into a large interest rate. With easy credit from banks, businesses used them to fund their companies and the salaries of workers and their owners. Once the easy credit dried up, that when the problems began.

Usually, when the Great Recession of 2008 (or Artifical Great Depression of 2008) began, they tend to cut jobs and people have to make do with less. But in this year they figured out that it was more profitable to hire people who are willing to pay for no money (unpaid internships) or hire no people at all. If you combined that with an excess population who have BA and MAs in various degrees, and the need for constant rising profit margins in publicly owned corporations for executives and share owners and you have the situation that for every one job opening you have 650 people applying for a job. Not only college graduates but people who have been laid off or downsized in order to cut costs or gain more profit.

Then to make the job search more of a farce, they put in many hoops you have to jump through. Some of them include: Automatic Job resume scanners that reject your resume if you do not have enough buzzwords, Human Resource members that don’t call back, fake job postings just to collect resumes, multiple interviews,automatic rejection if you have no experience/not enough experience/not the right experience ,mandatory personality tests. Even if you do make it you will get punched in the face by three reasons: Internal candidates, Referrals by other employees (read: Connections via networking), people who look hot and have breasts (read: Females). This has turned into a job market into a job lottery. A lottery that if you don’t win before you’re homeless, you are screwed to lifetime unemployment! (How good is staying positive if you’re going to be homeless?!)

Besides, every human has a limit of bullshit they can take before offing themselves. And they need real help, as underfunded suicide hotlines, therapist that are wait-listed for months and meds won’t help if the root of the problem is the living environment.

Despite the growth in jobs boasted by your politicians: Most of the growth come from food and retail industries. They put you to work in 30 hour weeks, and those those weeks are flexible at the employers end making it impossible to get a second job. If you have a resume that has a B.A., you will be automatically rejected! Even if you do get in, they prefer people who speak Spanish. Which explains the the fact that these days, they tend to employ people who speak Spanish and english. They also offer no benefits or health care because companies are too cheap to offer health care despite record profits because they know Obamacare will be in force by October 1st and it’s expanded medicaid provision will pick up the slack.




To the employees who lost his or her jobs, you will going to hear what I call the “Jobs market Chorus”: Be an entrepreneur and start your business! Network! Temping! Go get new skills! Freelance! Flip some patties! Go to North Dakota in the oil fields! Drive a truck! Join the Military (read: Join the army and die)! Go move where the jobs are! Go teach English at Japan/China/Taiwan/Korea! I promise you that you will hear at least one of these knee-jerk advice in a week in your miserable job market.

The problem is that these type of advice are (for too many people) worthless. Some job hunters have authoritarian parents who want their college graduates to get a actual job. Some job hunters are homeless. Some job hunters have family obligations, or have medical condition (physical, developmental, or mental.) Also, some job seekers have little income or none! Another great reason: EVERYONE ELSE HAS THE SAME IDEA!

Another thing job hunters will hear is the feel-good message which consists of variations of two parts: “Oh don’t worry you’ll find one” and “Stay Positive”. This is before the following if you’re actually trying to network: “I can’t help you!” or “I don’t know anyone.”  Do you know which people say these things? People who are lucky to held their jobs this long or people who are employment advisors but are too lazy to actually help.

So for Congress the real job creation solution is similar to health care: Disappear Quickly! Either by suicide, jail by resorting to crime due to unemployment, or homeless. Because Congress is proudly too politically lazy to actually fix the problem.

Basically for you job seekers out there here’s what our uncaring and unsympathetic, and lazy society is telling you: YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN AND THE SOON AS YOU VANISH BY ANY REASON OUT OF OUR HAPPY LIVES, THE BETTER!"

1msf5w,24,2013-09-20,Wandering Through the Desert,ACryintheDark,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/1msf5w/wandering_through_the_desert/,"September 20th is an inauspicious anniversary that I am tired of “celebrating.” It’s a mark of my failure to become the professional that society, my family, and I expected of myself. The date is the three-year anniversary since my first job application. I was just starting my third year (a.k.a. 3L) at New York University Law School. I knew the job process would be harder for me because of my focus on international law and human rights, but in 2008, I wasn’t worried. Never did I imagine that three years later I would be living back home with my mom without a job in sight.

I still remember the day in Contracts in 1L year when half the class couldn't focus on the lesson as they were to busy refreshing the news of the Dow Jones’s record freefall; nothing changing with each refresh except the level of the drop. Everyone knew this was bad and would impact employment; no one knew how bad.

It was the end of that summer in 2009 when people first discovered how bad things were getting. With a number of firms in a tailspin, others already gone, and the rest trying desperately to stop the hemorrhaging, the Early Interview Week recruitment for the 2011 class was one of the worst ever.

With so few firm hires, the job scramble begun in earnest. The lucky ones got jobs in financial institutions that were just starting their massive recovery. Others tried to get hired outside of Early Interview Week or began to court non-Vault 100 firms (think US News &amp; World Report’s yearly school rankings but for a richer and more pretentious industry). Others started competing for public interest jobs, wrongly thinking the public interest sector downturn would be any less vicious.

NYU Law’s Public Interest Law Center (PILC) has a post-graduation “launch grant” that is commonly known as PILC welfare. PILC welfare went from a program that was unheard of by most of the pre-crash graduating class—because everyone gets jobs out of NYU Law—to covering a little more than 10% of both the 2011 and 2012 classes nine months after graduation.  This originally three-month program (extendable to six months upon request) was expanded to a full 12 months for the class of 2011, no questions asked.

Regardless of the “launch grant,” graduates weren’t able to stabilize themselves after a year and often took whatever job they could get. One 2011 grad had a funded fellowship doing reproductive rights work for a year that she loved but took a job working for a county on the other side of the country after the fellowship ended. Another used his PILC welfare doing legal aid work before signing a two-year contract doing work he’s not happy about in a city he loathes. Still another, after a year of clerking for a federal court, is an unpaid intern doing really interesting work he loves. The choice is often between taking an unwanted public interest job or taking a risk and pursuing what you want to do.

I took the latter route, jumping from fellowship to fellowship to fellowship. I can't say that I haven't been able to get some phenomenal experiences, but it hurts to think that the 2L summer fellowship stipend, that I received over three years ago, has been my highest “salary.” I've represented CIA torture victims in an international lawsuit, drafted legal memos for the revolutionary government of Libya, and increased the capacity of a post-soviet human rights ombudsman. Outside of work, I started a fairly well read niche blog, published multiple op-eds, founded a non-governmental organization, and networked more than I could imagine.

For all that work, I have little to show for it vis-à-vis employment. I've impressed countless people with my professionalism, ability to learn new skills, commitment to working hard, and overall capabilities. My last interview with a USAID project went extremely well, especially as I was willing to work for a local salary (less than $1500/month). They fast tracked my hiring process, potentially worried someone else would snap me up. Then after three interviews and having filled out their hiring forms, they tell me that they won’t hire me, but they did offer me a part-time internship. This change was so sudden and unexpected that the original draft of this article was about finally landing a permanent job after a long struggle and how I would finally get to do all the backlogged things I’ve been putting off until I had a job and was a little more “settled.”

I've gone back to NYU Law’s Public Interest Law Center multiple times since graduation. I keep hoping that each time they'll tell me something new, some nugget of useful knowledge relevant to graduates. Instead I'm told to not customize my resume per job because I might introduce errors and to triple-check my cover letters to make sure I don't have any typos. I get the feeling that I'm not welcome; I'm evidence that their cookie-cutter advice of networking, staying flexibly, and proofreading your documents for typos isn't sufficient to get a job in this market.

Let me emphasize that while insecure income sucks, except for my student loans, my financial situation is not nearly as affected by the lack of job as my psychological state. I was able to live cheaply and save money during law school and while working under PILC welfare. I accomplished this by tracking every quarter I spent and ensuring I lived within my budget. My six digits of student loans will be covered by NYU Law’s Loan Repayment Program, as soon as I find a public interest job. Unemployed law graduates are not comparable to people living in poverty. The point of this article isn’t to say that my life is hard but to express the almost unfathomable failure it feels to be a 29 year-old lawyer that has had to move back into my childhood room at my mom’s house. Unemployed, living at home, and depressed, imagine how my dating life has been.

The interpersonal costs caused by the insecurity are a double blow: they’re painful and they stopped me from forming the personal bonds that help one persevere. My required geographical flexibility (yet another PILC recommendation) made me end my two-year relationship with my law school girlfriend after months of being 3,000 miles apart. I hurt another girl when I told her that I could promise her nothing since I had no idea where I might have to move for a job. Since then, I have consigned myself to only casual dating and only forming relationships I would be willing to break. When I graduated in 2011, I didn’t know where I’d be six months ahead. That number decreased to three months as of May 2012 and is now down to two months.

The very worst part is the crying. I'm not the most emotional guy; I've never cried from a movie and only very rarely from a book. Making those times when I spontaneously and uncontrollably start crying especially hard to handle. I force myself to stay busy working. It's when I'm alone and able to look at where my life is compared to where I thought it would be that I completely lose my composure. This has caused some *really* awkward flights for those sitting next to me (Sorry!). Writing this has brought me to tears twice now. And, while it’s good to let these feelings out, it’s not the best to do so on a crowded post-soviet bus. There is no doubt in my mind that I would benefit from therapy, but until I have health insurance, I'll just have to add it to the list of things I'll do once I have a job.

I want a job that is the beginning of a career. The idea of going to the same office day in, day out, year in, year out sounds like an unobtainable dream. I want to get on with my life. I want to write a well-researched journal article, not another well-researched cover letter. I want to teach myself how to play an instrument, not international aid best practices, in the hope that the latter will get me a job. Most importantly, I want to invest in my surroundings, including friends, relationships, and professional contacts, knowing I’ll be able to reap the rewards for years to come.

I don't know what lessons can be learned from this. I write this as a release—as a scream in the darkness—for me and for those in my situation. The only advice I’ve found useful is Churchill’s “if you’re going through hell, keep going.” Here I am, two and a half years after graduation and I am applying for the exact same jobs and fellowships as 3Ls. Wish me luck."

1mrbc0,11,2013-09-20,Tips on clearing negative energy? Low point in life/suicidal thoughts coincided with a move(story inside),[deleted],Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1mrbc0/tips_on_clearing_negative_energy_low_point_in/,"This happened in the winter/spring of 2010/2011. I moved to St. Louis for an internship. Found a room to rent off craigslist. It was the top bedroom of a three story row house. I imagine the building was pretty old, this was in Soulard in St. Louis and those houses all had to be at least 50 if not 70-100 years old. 

I'll just list the things that happened there chronologically:

* Before I moved there I had started a new relationship with literally the girl of my dreams. She was PERFECT. Perfect everything, the relationship was awesome.

* Move there, I feel lonely and isolated, but that's pretty normal because: 1) it's winter, and 2) I just moved to a new place away from all my social support.

* My car breaks down the first week I'm there. Never had car problems in my life before.

* Start my new job, initially very excited about it.

* Two weeks in - still feel lonely and isolated. Start playing WoW because I don't have anything else to do with my free time.

* Girlfriend seems to be getting more and more distant. I feel increasingly lonely. Probably getting clingy. She breaks it off about a month into living at the house.

* I get super depressed. Again I think it's normal because I'm in a new place, I'm stressed from work, and my girlfriend just dumped me.

* Work sucks. I hate it. I am isolated from everyone there. Make no friends. I just sit doing taxes all day. 

* I struggle to get out of bed every day. 

* Car breaks down AGAIN.

* About 2 months in I start actively fantasizing about blowing my brains out(I own firearms and have some at the house with me). To the point of putting loaded weapons up to my head and putting my finger on the trigger. But I don't think I was ever **that** close to pulling the trigger, still, something's not right when you're taking loaded guns to your head.

* House is extremely cold all the time, I feel just absolutely isolated there. 

* **One day I am laying in bed trying to rest when I experience sleep paralysis.** I've experienced sleep paralysis many times before so it doesn't really bother me. I just go with it and start trying to wiggle my little finger so I can wake up. Then I see my bedroom door slowly opening toward me. At the point I intuit that there is something very evil on the other side of that door(getting goose bumps now writing this). I'm laying there paralyzed. I see my door swing fully open to me and I see this black mass hanging in the air in my doorway. And it looked like the girl from the grudge. My only explanation for this is that my body sensed some sort of negative energy and it just pulled the closest construct my brain had for something really terrifying and evil and pulled the image of the girl from the grudge out(I'm terrified of that movie). I try to scream but am paralyzed and nothing comes out. At this point I lose consciousness. I wake up half an hour later and initially didn't even remember the sleep paralysis episode until something jogged my memory and all of it flooded back. The odd thing is it didn't cause me much fear at the time, but looking back on it now I wonder if all of my problems that winter/spring were because of a negative energy in that place.

* I moved out during the Summer, had an awesome summer, and completely pulled out of my depression. 

So... anyone else experienced something similar where it seems like a LOCATION was the cause of low energy/depression/suicidal thoughts? The reason I ask is because I seem to be experiencing some of the symptoms again albeit not as intense as last time(moved in to a new place with new roommates in August). 

My intuition tells me it might not be the location this time but one of my roommates. He's had some pretty bad PTSD and trauma in his life(bad childhood, was in initial invasion of Iraq in '03 and has bad PTSD from that). His energy is all over the place. Classic manic symptoms. So I wonder if his energy is interfering with mine. 

Question would be - what can I do to cleanse the energy of the house or at least protect myself from any possible negative energy here or disruptive energy from my roommate? Moving is not very feasible and I'd rather find a good solution then be at the mercy of whatever energy each new place I move into has. "

1muc8k,7,2013-09-21,One day you will miss me.,[deleted],UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1muc8k/one_day_you_will_miss_me/,"Dear Dad,

You raised me to be a self-loathing girl. You told me I would never be pretty like my sister, smart like my brother, or successful like you. Every achievement I had was to please you, to get you to tell me you loved me.

Growing up, you led me to believe that I was the one at fault. I was the reason why the family was unhappy. No matter how many times I was on honor roll or won singing competitions, I was never good enough. I believed it. I constantly pushed myself to do my best.

I thought you would be proud of me when I got a full-ride scholarship for vocal performance. You told me wanted me to work in Finance. I got an internship as an auditor. You told me the company was too small. I finished my internship and joined a bigger company. You told me it was still not good enough.

I hated myself because of you. I thought so highly of you and looked up to you so much. Because everything I did was never good enough, it killed me inside. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong, sometimes I still do.

Finally someone who did genuinely care about me when I was twenty convinced me to see a therapist. I went every week. ""Therapy Thursdays."" I feel much better about myself. Sometimes you get to me with the things you say, but now I am capable of getting myself out of that dark place.

I don't hate myself anymore, and I can't bring myself to hate you either. I feel sorry for you and for everyone in your emotionally destructive radius. That's the only reason I come to visit you. Mom already said that once us three kids are done with college that she is moving in with her mother. Sister, Brother, and I are moving away too when we're done. You will be by yourself, wondering why you're alone. You will only have yourself to blame.

One day you will miss me.

Sincerely,

cinnabaker"

One of them told a waitress (who was relatively fit) that she should lose weight, and gave her a coupon for the gym.  He also hit on her.  They gave the intern manager a D, even though she was the best manager we had.  They made us go to the grocery store to pick up cigarettes for them.  They didn't give us breaks on 14-hour shifts. 

All in all, horrible managers.  Everyone in the restaurant ended up quitting within two weeks of each other.

Anyways, when I was offered the job, I told the manager I would love to take the job, but I needed the weekend of August 2nd off (this was a few years ago), since both my parents' birthdays are on that weekend, and he said that was fine.

Thinking that my manager would keep his word, my parents book a hotel and dinner reservation for us to stay the weekend in the mountains.

A week before, I verify with my manager that I need that time off.  He says that it's policy to not allow weekends off, and I had to work that weekend.  I reminded him that he told me I would get that weekend off, and he said that it was ""too bad.""

I beg to get that weekend off, telling him it's *both* my parents' birthdays, and that we already have reservations, and he still says no.

After thinking for some sort of compromise, I call his office ten minutes later, and offer to work Friday morning and Sunday evening, so I could have the most of the weekend off, but would still work for the weekend--he laughed at me, asked the other manager if he should give it to me, then tells me no.

Next time he comes by my stand, I ask him one more time, and he says, ""Look, you're not getting the weekend off.  Your parents are going to have a lot more birthdays, so it's not like it's important or anything for you to be there.""

Some background:  My dad had gone in remission from cancer after having his larynx removed and undergoing radiation therapy just a year before this, and we weren't (and still aren't 100%) sure if the cancer would come back.

I started crying on the spot."
1mtlkj,28,2013-09-21,"Starting another school year of long distance, reflection and what we learned last year",circuitGal,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1mtlkj/starting_another_school_year_of_long_distance/,"Sorry about the length and spelling/grammar. I'm tired and watching some soccer, so distracted.

My BF and I have been dating for 6 years. Last year (during the school year) was our first of long-distance, as we both started graduate school in different states. It was tough. Not going to lie. I missed him like crazy because he is my best friend and the love of my life. Fortunately he was able to get an internship in my area for the summer and he lived with me. It was amazing.  Monday we start another year of long distance. I will see him over Thanksgiving, Christmas, and spring break. He will make it to my graduation in June. I already have the countdown setup in my room.  Recently I had a few people ask how we did it and I sat and talked with BF about how we could manage the next year.  It is hard since we know when he is done but I'm in a Masters/PhD so I don't quite know yet when I'll be done.  This is the advice we came up with for my friend or a reflection on how we made it work.

Don't let your focus slip. Whether work or school is the reason for long distance, when you are at work/school focus on that. It is easy to start daydreaming about BF when I'm supposed to be doing research. So I don't let myself until I get home. I remind myself that if I want more leeway on taking my full vacation breaks from research to visit him that I have to stay focused while I'm there.

Communicate Communicate Communicate. Whether it be skype, google chat, email, texting, phone calls, or good old fashioned snail mail. It keeps the spark alive. When BF has a huge test and I don't want to distract him I write emails that I save as drafts and send to him after his test with only a brief good luck email before the test.  If I'm feeling lonely or sad or upset, I tell him, even if it is for stupid reasons. I know he has lab work on Thursday and I know it is stupid to be sad he can't talk then, but if I tell him then he knows why I'm feeling down and I don't end up taking it out on him later. And he doesn't end up feeling confused as to why I seem upset. 

Focus on yourself. Find something about yourself that you want to improve and work to do so. Find a hobby that you've always wanted to have and explore it. My BF says he loved that when he visited this summer that I clearly was still developing as my own person. I started playing more soccer and fishing. He developed an interest in rock climbing. We now have something to share and teach each other. We also have something to talk about. We aren't letting our depression from missing each other rule our lives. You can't be miserable the whole time. It is hard the first bit, but worth it. Do I wish I could be sharing the experience with him? You betcha. Am I happy that he has something healthy to occupy his limited free time and de-stress, even if it limits our chats? Yes of course.

On this same line: make friends. We both went to new places and knew no one.  He doesn't always understand my school work and I rarely understand his. It is good to have friends to talk to about school/work and even just chill with. I knew a girl who refused to make friends so her BF wouldn't get jealous. She was never happy and that wasn't a healthy relationship.

Work on trust. My BF goes country dancing with classmates (girls) and lives with two girls. My closest friend is a guy. Both of us trust each other and are very open with each other. Jealously isn't an issue. I have no idea how to advise those who don't have it, but I just know that it is essential.  Things that helped: we both met each others friends on visits (and via skype), we set boundaries with our friends, and we communicate our boundaries with each other (ie. I am okay with him swing dancing with other girls, just no slow dancing).

Respect the other person's time. I have to let him study and he knows that I won't talk much (or at all) on the last week of projects.  

I guess I don't know what this is. I just wanted to share from personal experience. Are we experts? Not by any stretch of the imagination. Do others have it rougher than us? For sure. We are grateful to be in the same time zone.  I'm not looking forward to being away from my best friend, but I know we will survive it. "

I hadn't seen him in awhile, but had slept with him once in the past (several months before) when we were both very drunk. This was instigated by him.

The semester ended, and I went home to start work at my internship, but was back once to see him before he had to go away on an eight week trip (school related). While he was away, he texted me ever couple days. It was about an even split between ordinary conversation and something sex-related (dirty talk, pictures, etc.).

When he came back from his trip, I drove back up for a weekend to visit him (about a month before the fall semester started). We hung out, went out to dinner, had sex a bunch of times...it was a fun weekend.

In the last month before the fall semester started, we continued to text just as frequently. The weekend I moved back in for the fall, I saw him twice, and about once a week for ever week after that.

The first problem that came up came to my realization about the time I moved back to campus--I had developed feelings for him. I know, I know, that's the typical end to a friend with benefits situation. Someone develops feelings for the someone else, person with emotions involved gets hurt, situation implodes. I had planned to talk to him about it yesterday or today, whichever day he had time to meet up with me. I had to tell him on the off chance that he had some sort of feelings for me. You never know, right? I asked him if he was free yesterday, but he had work. When I asked him if he had any free time today, he said he and his friends hadn't figured out what they were doing yet. Okay, I can deal with that. I'll ask once they figure everything out.

So this afternoon rolls around, and I sent him a text: ""What are you up to tonight?"" Nothing. At all. For the last six hours. It's not like he's busy and just hasn't checked his phone either--this guy is always on his phone. I can't figure out why I'm suddenly being ignored.

So Reddit...what gives? Am I just paranoid?

**TL;DR: Developed feelings for a fuck buddy, he starts ignoring me before I've even come forward to say it.**"

This part is shorter but it was hard to write and the real fun starts afterwards if my memory serves me well.


Part II.
Opening The Portal

I called my old social worker at the outreach place I use to go to in my home city sporadically to catch up, and through him learned that a good friend of mine (albeit one I used to ""use"" with) had been in jail for a few months for something minor. I was overjoyed because I thought that it was awesome that by fate we had both gone clean, even if he had no choice in the matter. 
I found him and started religiously sending letters and books every week. 

""R.L"" was an old friend and like myself, trustworthy even when he was strung out.
He was one of the few people I've ever met that I could have a really quick ""back and forth"" with because our brains were both really fast, buggy and filled with pop culture references and general snarkiness. 
He was as smart as fuck, funny as hell, a kick-ass writer and always pretty chipper despite having a horrible, abusive upbringing that involved moving from foster home to foster home, being sexually abused, burned with cigarettes, hooked on junk and turned out as a gay prostitute at 15 (even though he identified as straight). 
R.L was even more awesome for living through that hell and still being a person who had some love in him. 

R.L's release date came on fast and when he told me, I was ecstatic! We were both clean and I'd help him finally get his shit together. 
He had nowhere to go and despite the fact that I didn't have the room by any stretch of the imagination, I told him he was welcome to stay with us and I meant it.

I excitedly mentioned my friend coming to Larry in passing with no ulterior motive and Larry said ""he can stay with me if he wants"". 
Sweet! Lonely old guy, charismatic young punk looking to start fresh like I did, and avoidance of the whole ""guy on couch and I want to get laid, argggg fuck!” scenario. 
Everybody's happy! Great!

But…not great.

We had some wonderful time catching up, walking in the park, talking about our new found dreams, but after about 2 weeks past, I started getting a niggling feeling that he was using again. 

One early Saturday morning I was on my way to the clinic internship and decided to go say good morning to R.L before I left.
The door was ajar and I got goosebumps - the moment I saw R.L from the back I knew something was wrong. Larry was nowhere to be seen and R.L was reclined on the couch. I approached and saw he had half of a Mike's Hard Lemonade perfectly balanced on his chest. 

As you maybe already guessed, he was dead. 

Judging by the foam around his mouth and nose it was obvious to me it was a heroin overdose because I had seen them before and apparently it's a standard symptom of an opiate overdose (medulla oblongata suppression, involuntary breathing response stops, lining of lungs comes up in ""foam form"" blah blah blah.)
 
I still think it must have been a suicide because R.L was a seasoned user and any junkie knows never to mix junk and booze, or if you do, be careful.

Or maybe he thought his tolerance was higher than it was after being clean for awhile, which is a  common reason for O.Ds.

Regardless.

His skin was light grey, his eyes the palest China blue. 
I sat next to his body and took a long look at him, asked him why , expressed my anger and my sadness, told him that he was free now.  Eventually I called the cops and a coroner came within an hour, zipped him into a crinkly maroon body bag.

Before they left, one of them took R.L's cuff off his wrist and gave it to me like we give a dog's collar to the owner after euthanasia. Both touching and fucking heartbreaking.
If I hadn't have been there to tell them his full name, he would have been ""John Doe"". 

His birth certificate arrived in the mail the next day. I still carry it in my wallet to this day.

Understandably upset, I called the clinic and told them I wasn't going to make it. 
I sat in that apartment a long time waiting for Stoic to return from work.
Larry came back to the apartment hours later, visibly shaken. I didn’t have any words so I faced the wall struggling to find something to say.
He spoke first.

""I can't stay in this place anymore"" he said urgently, in a strained voice. 
""Ghosts! There's going to be ghosts! He died right there and now it's wide open and it's all your fault and now it's wide open! Wide open!""

""...Open?""  

He shrank and brought his arms up to his head like the sky was falling.

""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Fuck fuck fuck!"" He shouted, His eyes widened with fear. 
""They'll...hear...you!""

""Who will hear me, Larry?""

He leaned in conspiratorially and whispered 
""Them.  They know now.""

“Wait…who knows? What are you talking about?”

His eyes were wide and mad, rolling around in his head, his mouth agape and twisted into a grimace of horror that contorted is face into one of pure horror.  
He looked me straight in the eye and let out a long, ragged groan that chills me to think about.
Then before I could say anything further, as if answering a call I could not hear, he abruptly got up and walked away muttering to himself with his hands on his ears, swatting at things that weren't there. 

This was the first indication that he was a little...wonky. 
I figured he was just dealing with the death in his own way and respected his space.

* I'm black, but born in Canada. I hear the social hierarchy goes like this: Natives, white westerners, other Arabs, rich South Asians, blacks, Filipinos, poor South Asians, with each hierarchy getting paid less on average. How true is this?

But here goes. I've been with this woman for quite some time now. We've been to hell and back. We had crazy obstacles. We overcame them. Hope you guys have a campfire and a 6pack nearby....

6years ago, I met this girl in a library while in highschool. I was on my way out of senior year and going to college. She at the the time was in her junior year. I tried to make a pass at her and she turned me down since she was already involved with someone. Right then and there I apologized to her and left her to her devices. Havent spoke or heard from her in 2yrs. One day, I'm in class when I get a text from a friend of mine to meet her awesome dancer friend. Since I was single at the time I went to go meet this person. It ended up being the girl from the library. She imstantly remembered me and told me she was single. Later that week we went out and she went for the 1st kiss. She caught me so unexpectedly I almost fell into an oncoming train. So now that we're involved, I asked her if she was still a virgin. She took this as me wanting to have sex with her anytime soon. She told me if I wanted her so bad, I'd have to wait and yes she was a virgin. Albeit, I wasn't concerned about having sex with her. It was an honest question. She ended up losing it to me a month later. On her terms, on her time and without me asking. We got together in May 2010 and she lost it to me in junJune of that year.

Things went great until it was her birthday weekend in July. Sadly I couldn't be with her because I had prior engagements to a family outing. It was then for some odd reason that she confessed to me she was an illegal immigrant. She only told me she was french and italian initially. But then told me she was also mexican. She really looks like Selena Gomez' doppleganger. Sorry, off topic. Anyway, I didn't care. I'm a mix of puerto rican and domincan. I had people in my own family who are here illegally. She thought I'd leave her because of her woes. Clearly I didn't and worked with her the best I could.

September of ththat year I left to jobcorps way out in cassadaga. She was in college. In my absence, she met a guy. She's a very friendly person, but is oblivious to most guys intentions. She told me about him in december of that year and how he's turned into a stalker and won't leave her alone. I asked her if she allowed any kind of contact with this guy. She said no. So I phone my dad (he's nypd) ams tell him the situation. He says her story sounds off and then phones her. After my dad spoke to her, he found out she infact gave her number to this guy. That raised a red flag for me. Why would she lie? Me miles and miles away from nyc saw it as her cheating and lying to me. We got through that fine.

Fast forward ro march 2011- i got kicked out of jobcorps under false accussations of me stealing money from the pharmacy I interned at. How much? $30. I'm home and my dad sees me as a failure. He kicks me out in June of that year. I'm homeless now. Literally. Coney island was my home until september of that year. My gf stood by me all that time. I got into a non profit school for IT and was going there every day I could. In july of that year, once again its my gfs bday and I can attend. I throw some birthday cake in her face for shits and giggles. Her dad saw it as me being abusive. I found this out as I was going back to coney island from my gf and her dad tried to abuse her (her dad is a very controlling and abusive man. Though he did seem to like me. I was hidden a whole yesr from him until she decided to introduce me. Its now septmeber of that year. I got a very good job from the IT school, my dad welcomed me back to his nest and my gf was now living in her dads hell.

Fast forward to August 2012. Her dad kicked her out because she was still with me. All the savings from my job was then put into an appartment for us so she could leave that life. She also gave me a ring for me to marry her. I found it odd, but I accepted and we were then enagaged. Its unfortunate that when we started living together, she became the abusive one. I had enough to the point where its march 2013 and I leave her. From there I was living my life, talking to other people and exploring the world again. I went out a lot with a good friend of mine. She's VERY attractive, but we never saw eachother in a relationship. We go out for some drinks and she's trying to be my therapist. My ex at that point in time carches wind of this and thinks I'm cheating?? When that wasn't it. I hear about this in April when I decide to give her another chance and she now forbids me from seeing my best friend. I say whatever and continue talking to my friend. We're like brother and sister. Inseperable. Amd I got her a great internship at jpmorgan. She now make more money than me lol.

Fast forward to August 2013. She meets this long lost cousin of hers out of the blue. Her cousin is happy married and runs her own business. Along with her cousins husband, comes this guy. One thing leads to another and she gives him her number. I grew suspicious on tuesday august 13 when she would hide her phone whenever she texted someone. Soon, she goes to take a shower. I hack in her phone by tracing the key strokes on her touchscreen. And what I saw destroyed me. She was having a more than flirtatious convo with this guy. I am in shock and I just layed there in the bed perplexed. She comes back as if she's not guilty of anything. I give her oppurtunites ro confess until friday. Each day I'm seeing this thing get worse. Friday was to be the day she would send pictures and this guy comes over my house while I'm at work. Its Friday now. I take off from work and she takes me out for breakfast. I take her to a store and buy her a new outfit- all the while more trying to get her to say something since I foiled her plans. Eventually we come home. I fall asleep and she disappears into the bathroom. I wake up, almost 30 minutes later she hasn't returned I get up- mt emotions stiring my stomach so much I'm dizzy and I'm ANGRY.I knock on the door and ask her to let me in. I need to use the bathroom. I hear scrambling. So I break the door down and she a razor in her hand, very very tiny hairs in the sink and her phone in hand.

I snatch the phone from her and I tell her I know what's going on. She tells me I'm crazy and that I should trust her. She is going apeshit for her phone guys. Eventually I lock myself in the bathroom with her phone and I saw she sent a picture in the outfit I just bought her, to that filth. I then felt a pain unlike any other. I opened the door and there she was. Other than hit her, went hulk on the apparment. I left the house with her phone. I called that son of a bitch. I knew everything about him. I evem had his pictures. I called him and scared the living shit out of him. I was destroyed reddit.

I call my dad. Tell him what happen amd we get all my shit the same day. I kill the cable. Everything. All the while, I found out she did what she did off the notion that I ""cheated"" on her. I went on to post everything she did on her own facebook. Right down the picture she sent. Her friends couldn't believe this. She opposed adultery and spoke down to anyone who did. And here she is being a hypocrite. Soon after, herr girlfriends contact me saying I hit her? Its news to me. Then I see pictures. This girl has brusies everywhere. I'm not surprised. I'm a blackbelt in krav maga an my bones are conditioned to a point where people will hurt themselves trying to hurt me. She bruises easily. But those two together and it looks like I kicked her ass. That same day, tell my dad. He takes me to one of the labs where they can tell if I hit anyone or not. My hands come up good.

Now I give her another chance guys. I'm madly in love with this woman. We are trying it out again. But now, I just don't know. We're now hiding from the world, facebook is gone amy means I had to commuicate with my friends are gone. Its just her. And I don't feel right reddit. Should I have taken her back? Or should I just close this chapter in my life?

 TLDR- A good relationship that's gone south due to imagination and lack of integrity. I've gone to lengths for the woman I love and moved moutains. She made a very bad choice where others would want to leave their significant other IMMEDIATELY. I want to save the relationship. But; is it worth it?"
1mwl8s,0,2013-09-22,Day 8 - Progress Update,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1mwl8s/day_8_progress_update/,"So it's been a week, and I figured I might as well contribute to the community and keep a log of my progress at the same time.

**Why I started nofap:**

Although I was not really a huge porn ""addict"" per se, I definitely did abuse porn and used it unhealthily. I realized that I had gone too far a little while ago when I started having mild ED, even with porn. I wasn't sure if this was because of other reasons (I had a nasty viral infection at the time) or because I went too far with porn (fapping 2-3 daily to alleviate my viral infection symptoms). I knew about nofap but never really took it seriously until this moment. I decided that enough was enough and started out on my nofap journey.

Prior to this, I did not have the best sexual experiences either, and I do believe PMO was the primary cause of this. I was not able to finish with a girl who gave me a BJ, and also did not finish when we had sex. I think I had major, major DE and we just didn't go long enough; I'm attributing this to my constant deathgripping and PMOing.

Furthermore, I had been developing stranger and more extreme porn tastes, and it was getting to the point where ""normal"" porn was nowhere near enough to get me off.

**My Journey Thus Far:**

For me, my goals are no P, no M, no E. Sex is fine; after all, that's one of the main reasons I'm doing this.

I haven't had much difficulty getting this far. There were maybe one or two moments that I wanted to fap, but I told myself there was no point and I'd regret it immediately. I reminded myself of how shitty I feel after fapping. What was keeping me going was the thought of how much better my sex life, and perhaps social life, would be if I stop PMOing. I've been able to last 7 days with this mentality! The only other time I've gone that far was when I was on vacation.

**Effects:**

I haven't experienced any superpowers, but I've become less anxious talking to people in general, and girls in particular. I went out to lunch with one of my female coworkers (we're both interns), and I never was really nervous as I was before. I didn't think about what to say next or about anything sexual with her. I just tried to have a good time, which we did. I don't attribute this entirely to nofap, but it definitely helped me feel more relaxed and not think about everything sexually.

As for my ED, I can't be sure if it's fully cured or not (I'm not going to test it out), but I have been getting morning erections again and they are pretty hard.

Strangely enough, I'm not sure if this is because of lack of exercise (my sickness prevented me from going to the gym for 2-3 weeks) or because of nofap, I haven't been truly hungry in a while. When I see food, and start eating, there is no problem. But in my mind I never get the feeling that ""I'm really hungry right now and could eat a lot."" Has anyone else had this? I'm really curious what's causing this.

Most of all though, I now have extra time and energy that I can expend on other things, and I'm no longer thinking about the next time I can fap.

**Overall:** I expect to reap more benefits the longer I go. I really want to reboot my brain to not rely on porn to get off and to be able to enjoy sex, which before was not that enjoyable because of desensitization. To everyone: keep at it! Have something motivating you, whether it's a girl you like, your problems in the past, or wanting a better life. Every time you think about fapping, think about your motivators and don't fap! Just don't do it; it's not worth it."
1mwkfr,154,2013-09-22,"""I don't mind paying, but I'm going to have to speak to your manager first.""",gh0stfl0wers,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1mwkfr/i_dont_mind_paying_but_im_going_to_have_to_speak/,"I have been working in restaurants for about 4 years now, and thankfully the customers who make me want to punch them in the face are few and far between. But this just took the cake as the worst customer experience I have had.

I have been working at this particular restaurant on &amp; off since they opened in February 2012, I took a couple breaks in between to go home for the summer or, more recently, because I was doing a 6-month internship abroad. But I love the business and the owners and they value me as a loyal employee who cares, so they are always happy to have me back. It's a hotpot and sushi restaurant. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of hotpot/shabu: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu

This story took place a few weeks after returning from my 6 month break, about 2 months ago. There were a lot of new regulars who I didn't know from before I left, and this is involving one of them. 

A girl walks in and greets my boss in a friendly manner, so I figure she must be a new regular or a friend of his. She asks him if it's okay if her friend orders something at a take-out place a few doors down and eats it outside on our patio with her while she orders some hotpot from us. I find that a little rude to just bring food from somewhere else, but she's a regular and she will still be paying so my boss says it's okay.

I'm already slightly annoyed just because people eating outside is slightly more inconvenient for me, especially when they're eating the hotpot. I have to bring out the burner and dishes (the tables inside are already set with hotplates and dishes so it just gives me a little more work). But it's a nice day, so it's not an unreasonable request. I bring them their waters, set up the table and then as I'm heading out to see if she has any questions or is ready to order, I see that she is on the phone, so I decide to wait until she is done with her conversation. 

10 minutes later she hangs up. I notice she hasn't even touched the menu yet, but since she's a regular she might just already know exactly what she wants. So I head outside to take her order. She says (with an impatient undertone as if she had been waiting for ages) she will have the vegetarian combo with brown rice and our vegetable broth. And could I please put up an umbrella, the sun is in her eyes. 

Not a totally unreasonable request either. The sun does get at an inconvenient angle in the evening. But you could tell that it was going to disappear behind the buildings in about 5 minutes. I was a little annoyed that she couldn't just stick it out until then, but whatever, not an unreasonable request, I'll do it. 

I bring out the food and everything is going well, except for that slightly bitchy and impatient undertone I keep getting from her. I boss and I inside laugh when both she and her friend start taking selfies. Seriously, for about 10 minutes neither of them were eating, they were just taking selfies. Usually if I see a table taking pictures I will offer to take one with everyone in it, looking back that would have been hilarious (and obviously rude) to put them on the spot like that. 

At the end of the meal I bring the check after asking if they want any dessert. When I swing around to pick it up again is when the fun starts to happen.

""I'm sorry miss, but I come here all the time and order the same thing all the time but it's usually only around $14, I don't understand how this got up to 19$.""

I have a look at the check to see if maybe I punched in something wrong. Nope, everything is right. The vegetarian combo is on there, theres $1 extra charge for the brown rice, and the broth is on there as well. Plus tax, everything adds up fine, I didn't do anything wrong. I remember getting an email from my boss while I was gone (it was a group email to all of the staff, and I was still on the mailing list), that some of the prices had changed. I point this out to her and ask when the last time was she had come here. Nope, it was already after the price changes so that can't be it. I go in to bring her a menu so she can verify the prices. I point out what she ordered, and where it states the extra charge for brown rice. I explain that what might have happened is that others may have forgotten to punch in the broth or the extra charge for brown rice, and also that our lunch dishes are cheaper (and significantly smaller) than the dinner portions, so this might explain the price difference. 

""Okay, I don't have a problem paying for this, I just want to speak to your manager first.""

Sigh.... I send out my manager. He again points out the prices, says that her previous servers might have made a mistake when punching in the order, but that the way it is on the bill is the way that it usually is. Because he doesn't want a pissed off customer raging on Yelp, he tells her he will take off the broth for her, so she will only have to pay for the combo and the brown rice. 

She finally pays for her fucking meal and leaves without tipping. Which is totally fine, I don't want her money anyway. But man, that was the angriest I have ever been with a customer. And even though this was already 2 months ago it still pisses me off. 

Turns out, she never actually paid for her own meals, she usually has her guy friend do that for her. So how would she know how much it costs? And my bosses were annoyed with her already because she always complains about something when she comes there to eat. So they agreed that the next time she comes in, they will bring her the check right after she orders and before her food is brought out, just to make sure everyone is on the same page of how much it is going to cost. She hasn't been back since."

The firm decided to drop me from the graduate programme.

I have been job hunting for about a year now and it has been relatively fruitless and pretty frustrating.

If I happen to get an interview, the majority of places I have interviewed give me little to no feedback, either saying, ""You came across very good, but we found someone better suited to out requirements"" or ""We have chosen to hire internally"".

Without any feedback, I don't know what to improve on and I'm really unaware as to what to do.

When someone says that, I'm good, but they've found someone slightly better, are they saying just that or, are they shying away from giving me any notable feedback?

Spent a year or so after a year of internship trying to kill myself (got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder), then started school again this year, in a new major within my program. Hence, I am back in my 3rd year of school.

**Why do you have a crush on her?***

She is breathtakingly beautiful - that's the main thing. She's also neat as a person, in the sense that she is involved in this one pretty cool club (women only, geared at recruiting more women for our program), and has some interesting views on stuff like feminism, etc. that are a new perspective to me. 

**Should we know anything else?**

I am in a group of 5, including her, that is working on a semester long project. Oh also, I made her laugh a lot.

**What have you done so far?**

I created a secret gmail account and emailed her, letting her know that I have a crush on her, but because I am ugly and not someone she would go for a whole bunch of other reasons (the biggest one being that I am a different race from her), I'd like to pretend to be platonic in real life, but then perhaps attempt to get to know her a little bit through email - i.e. ask her the questions I want to ask her (""what do you think about X? what's life like with all the things you participate in? blah blah"") which will help me flesh her out as a person from behind the safety of anonymity, and thus continue to daydream for a while before finally forgetting about her...

**What happened then?**

She never responded. Then I sent her a whole bunch of messages like: ""was that really creepy to do?"". It was pathetic.

**So what do you want to do now?**

I want to message her on facebook, and say ""hi AlphaBetty"". Then ask her what she thinks of me, and then finally admit to being her secret admirer.

**What do you think will happen if you do that?**

She'll be creeped out, and everything will become awkward, and she'll tell everyone, and everyone will look at me weird. Then the police will arrest me for stalking her.

**Do you care that things might become awkward?**

I have begun to care a lot less about a lot of things, and with regards to some things, I don't even know if I should care. Should I care that things might become awkward? I don't know...

**What do you want from us?**

Dissuade me. Persuade me. Give me advice. 

**tl;dr**

I have a crush on a pretty girl. I don't know whether I should admit I have a crush, but for some reason I sometimes really want to tell her that. I am a borderline personality disorder person so I can't really trust myself - I am prone to being intense, and I am in a group project with her."
1mw1kq,263,2013-09-22,"The wrong parent died: Mum's dead, my Dad scarred me and almost destroyed my house, and my boyfriend left me. I need to talk.",stuckhere_throwaway,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mw1kq/the_wrong_parent_died_mums_dead_my_dad_scarred_me/,"Me: 28, Dad: 70, Ex: 32

In 2007, my mum died from cancer. I saw the whole thing- her eyes rolled back and her tongue protruded, Dad standing next to me in shock, the nurses hovering intently over her hospital bed, the foamy red stuff pouring out her nostrils. I was 21. I replay that scene over and over in my head. It's still vivid.

I was devastated and needed to grieve. My Dad said that if I moved back to my hometown, he'd take care of me while I recovered. So I did. I left my friends and my big city dreams and moved back home. She had left her house to me in the will, so I moved in. Dad was living in a retirement village at the time and seemed very depressed and alone, so I told him to move in with me.

That was a huge mistake.

I ended up being the one to take care of him. If I was crying, he'd ignore me. If I told him I was depressed, he'd change the subject. He sat around in his boxers with his balls hanging out in the loungeroom while I was stuck in my bedroom f5ing 4chan all day. No hugs. No ""are you okay""s. No talking or caring or support. My friends were all in a different city, so I was alone. Sometimes I'd go days on end without being spoken to. I sung to myself a lot just so I could speak. 

Dad sat around watching war documentaries on TV while I cooked and cleaned. He soon started to hoard (I believe this comes from being raised by depression-era parents- when you're poor, you can't afford to throw anything out). The humble little house that Mum had given to me became clogged with his junk and empty boxes. Every time I cleaned, he'd fill the space with more junk. 

I made a huge effort to take care of him- did all the chores, took him out of the house on trips, bought him expensive presents that would end up cast aside and covered in dust. I put my life on hold, turned down job and travel opportunities so I could stay home and take care of him. But he never took care of me. If I talked about going overseas, he'd get upset and say that it was dangerous and I should just stay home with him. He wanted me to stay trapped with him forever, the same thing he had done to Mum when she was trying to leave him way back in 1996.

In 2008, in a fit of grief, loneliness, and depression, I took a bunch of pills in the hopes that I would die. About an hour later, I got stabbing pains in my stomach. It really hurt and I was scared that instead of dying I'd be left with internal injuries, so I drove up to the hospital where they induced vomiting. I stayed in overnight. Dad was called the next day to pick me up. I told him I'd tried to kill myself and I felt so sad and worthless that I desperately wanted to die. He told me about the new brand of dog food he'd purchased from the shops.

It became a pattern. I told him I'd gotten into uni, he'd nod and continue watching TV. I told him I was depressed, he just stood there making a sandwich and talking about peanut butter. I told him I had an internship at a major newspaper, he said ""oh"" and continued fussing over our dogs.

I couldn't bring people over to my house because it was so messy and he was always walking around half-naked. He swears a lot and says a lot of hateful things, the sort of stuff you hear on talkback radio. He never has anything nice to say, never takes an interest in anyone else's life. I tried to confront him about it, I told him how much it broke my heart that he ignored me when I tried to tell him about my accomplishments or problems, especially when I was relying on him to help me get back on my feet after Mum's death. He shrugged and said ""oh well"".

His hoarding and bad attitude became too much for me, and I had to move out of my own home. He didn't seem to care. He'd send me text messages saying he loved me occasionally. I understand that it's hard for old guys to express their emotions, but you don't ignore your daughter when she's begging for help. My cousins were outraged that I had been forced out of my own house. I couldn't have been happier- I was no longer anxious about coming home from a happy day at work only to be destroyed by him ignoring me and walking around muttering hateful things about women and black people. 

However, the condition of the house worsened with his hoarding. He stayed in the house guiltfree because, according to my cousins, he believed that I was just going through a phase and I would soon be back to dedicate my life to taking care of him. It was heartbreaking seeing my beloved mother's house get turned into a dump by that brute. He destroyed her with his hate and viciousness, destroyed their marriage. Although after her death he talked about how happy they were together, as though he'd never turned a gun on her or prevented her from seeing her family/friends so he could control her. He never loved her as much as he did after she was dead.

Thankfully my cousins spent a lot of time speaking to him and helped him move into a retirement village again, where he gets his own apartment and is free to live his life. He is not happy about it and often comes over to my house unannounced just to hang around with the dogs... for six hours. I came back to my home and spent days clearing out an estimated 15 square metres of junk. 

Dad was not the only broken bird I was trying to look after during that time. At the same time, I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who, despite being 32, had never had a decent job and was unemployed for our entire relationship. I paid for everything, I helped him apply for university courses he never stuck with, I drove us everywhere. He had depression - as do I - but refused to see a psych about it. He got upset with me a lot because ""I can't just get a job like you okay, I have actual depression, the fact that you can get out of bed in the morning means you don't have depression after all"" when all I had asked him to do was pay for his share of a meal. It wasn't emotional blackmail- he truly believed what he was saying. 

Last month, he dumped me because he basically didn't have the energy to maintain our relationship. He spends all day in bed, lives on welfare with his mother, and expects other people to pay for him all the time. I went out of my way to make his birthdays and Christmases special, he'd say ""thanks"" and would never reciprocate. I was so lonely, and despite his flaws, I could talk to him about my life and feel validated. I guess you accept the love you think you deserve.

So now I'm alone, desperately missing my hopeless ex, desperately feeling invalidated. For you see, I grew up well below the poverty line. (Dad worked but he wouldn't give us any of his earnings. We piled clothes on top of us for blankets and our dinners came out of cans.)

Both my ex and my father, the two people who were supposed to love and support me the most, relied on me to baby them and would get angry when I challenged them about this task. I feel betrayed by the people I love. Now I have no one close to me that I can turn to, no one who is interested in my life or who will give me hugs. I know at 28 I should be over the need to feel a parent's love, but I'm not. The support and unconditional love of someone who cares about you is something I crave so badly. There's no one who's proud of me, no one who wants to talk to me about my problems, no one who cares whether I live or die. I feel so sad."
1mvts7,30,2013-09-22,My story with Mary Jane.,Danda16,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1mvts7/my_story_with_mary_jane/,"My story starts off when I was in high school and I saw the image of smoking to be an attractive thing. I remember smoking from makeshift pipes of whatever my best friend and I could get our hands on. Smoking whatever weed we could find. The start of senior year I was that typical stoner who would always smoke for the social scene and ditch classes to rip a bong at a friend's apartment. Everyday after school my friend and I would drive over to these guy's house to smoke. We would make frequent trips to get fast food, hackysack, play CoD, smoke prime times. We would do this for hours.
As fun as that sounds- I was unhealthy. I was overweight. I was insecure. I suffered from depression and anxiety- took medication for both. Life was mostly grey.
Anyways, I had always loved my time spent in the mountains (I'm from Colorado). I randomly decided to apply for an internship of a teaching job up near Mt. Evans. A lab school for 6th graders. I got the job and enjoyed my time up there. I would drive home for the weekend and would meet up with friends to smoke. Soon enough though my emotions got in the way of work. I would have occasional anxiety attacks and have weekly breakdowns. For a professional job working with young kids, my behavior was inappropriate. My bosses sat me down and said I need to shape up or my time there might be up.
Over the course of that weekend, with the positive influence of Mary Jane, I pulled my shit together. It was an epiphany moment where color started to shine through areas once of grey. I stopped taking my antidepressants, started to exercise and eat healthy. All while controlling and keeping my emotions positive. 
During that weekend, I also learned how to control my high. Almost every time I smoked I would go on a run or clean my house. I found music that defined me. (Dead head over here.) While staying on top of my school work.
I ended up graduating high school and the internship program with flying colors. I lost a fair amount of weight. I was happy. And I still loved marijuana just as much.
This past summer I flew out to Vermont to work at a Girl Scout Camp where I sobered up for 3 months. They were wonderful months in which I learned a ton about myself while not being high.

But here I am, back in Colorado, at college. Everyday I will walk to a small nearby forest where I set up a small picnic, layout some studying material, and might open a book. All while taking a couple hits off of Tulip- my pipe. 
I'm happy. I have no complaints in life. I cannot wait to see what else it has to offer. I love trees. So much.

Sincerely, a slightly high colorado girl. [5]

If you made it to the end- thank you. :)"
1mvnu1,10,2013-09-22,"Had a rough night at work, had a breakdown, then had to deal with insensitive parents and brokedown even further. Could use another perspective or just some comfort.",HermitTheBrah_Here,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1mvnu1/had_a_rough_night_at_work_had_a_breakdown_then/,"Hey guys, 
So at work tonight, 2 of the cooks treated me very disrespectfully. They threw food at me, and when I asked them to explain in words why they were mad, and not throw things at me, they yelled at me and told me to shut up. Two of my other coworkers saw this and felt it was wrong enough that they called the owner and complained. The trouble is the 2 cooks who mistreated me are the brother and cousin of the owner. So I talked to the owner on the phone eventually and by that point I was crying. He told me to go home, he apologized profusely, and said he would talk with the cooks in the morning. 

So I come home totally distraught and explain the situations to my parents. (Both of them know that I'm transitioning). My Dad kept trying to solve the problem and I told him all I wanted was some comfort and them to tell me everything would be alright. He kept on trying to fix it, and then told me to calm down. I lost it a little bit and yelled at them to not tell me to calm down, then I recovered a bit and and told them that I would rather not keep talking about it, and would like to go to my room to relax. 

I went to my room and my Dad came in a minute later and started telling me that I was being disrespectful yelling at them. I was completely taken aback and said that all I was trying to do was vent and that they weren't being very helpful. He keeps digging on me telling me that I'm being rude and overreacting. I keep telling him that I'm working 50-60 hours/week (between school, work, an internship, and being involved in organizations) and I'm transitioning, so of course I'm stressed out. And I definitely don't need them digging on me. I just need someone to tell me that the situation sucked and everything will be ok. But they keep at it. So I snap and yell at my Dad asking if he doesn't think I'm doing enough in my life and and that he doesn't support me in my transition as well as he should. It was a low blow, but by this point, I'm overworked I already had people yelling at me, and now I have insensitive parents telling me I'm over-exaggerating and being rude to them.  

I just absolutely broke down. I am so heartbroken right now. My Mom recovered a bit and THEN started comforting me, and talked me down for like 20 minutes. I ended up apologizing profusely for being rude (even though I honestly don't think I was being that rude). I am in a very emotionally vulnerable state and couldn't even turn to my parents for comfort. 

I'm doing my best to relax and work it off, but to be honest I don't think living at home is working out for me anymore. (I'm 22, for reference). Besides being emotionally unavailable, my Dad has been semi-financially supportive. He allows me to live at home rent-free, pays for school, and sometimes pay for my books. Everything else, I pay for. Food, clothes, phone, gas, hanging out with friends, counseling, and medical co-pays. I'm ok with supporting myself in these ways, in fact I quite like working and being busy. However, being pre-med (I plan on applying to medical school next year), and transitioning is (I think) draining me too much right now. 

I have incredibly supportive grandparents who offer many a times to support me in whatever way I need, they especially put an emphasis on financially. They've been supporting my brother with $2,000 a month for the last year, but recently cut him off because he was using them, refused to get a job, and got another DUI. Do you think it would be too exaggerated of me to quit my job and ask my grandparents to help support me for $1400 a month (that's about what I make working), and if my Dad gets mad and says I shouldn't ask them for money (he's very adamant that I keep my job[even though I've been working since I was 15 and have struggled since then with work and going to school full-time plus all my extra-curriculars). I'm pretty sure my Dad won't approve of this idea, and if he really protests, then do you think if it's a good idea that I move out and ask my grandparents for $2000 a month so I can pay for rent too. 

What are your thoughts? I'm a very independent person and asking people to support me is very hard. I would much rather work and support myself fully if I could. But I really want to go to medical school and be a Doctor, so I have to take on a huge workload school-wise. Is it that far of a reach for me ask for my grandparents to help support me? I'm really conflicted. Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to make sure I got a sufficient summary of my dilemma. "
1mvixc,3,2013-09-21,My personal story from happy to sad introvert thanks to nursing (x-posted in r/introvert),foxdancer,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1mvixc/my_personal_story_from_happy_to_sad_introvert/,"x-posted in r/introvert.  This is my first post on Reddit. YAY!

I’m not sure if I am writing this to just vent or to actually seek help, perhaps both. Here’s my story.  My first Bachelor’s degree was pretty much a waste, so I went to go work as restaurant server shortly after I graduated.  I felt like a failure because I had done so well and all I could get was this stupid job. {Insert the usually college grad/sucky job argument here}.  Not long after I started working I realized that I LOVED my job.  I am introvert but I loved working as a server, mostly because I worked with some GREAT people and I loved the busy nature of the job, and helping my customers.  Of course there were some awful customers every now and again, and not everything ran smoothly all the time, but those were small potatoes.  How could an introvert love serving? I don’t know, but I did!  Maybe it was because I worked with people that eventually became very good, lifelong friends to me, and there was really no time to make small talk before the next crisis happened.  Plus, the working environment in a restaurant is very diversified personality wise- you have your introverts, extroverts, those in-between, high school educated, college educated, sane, insane, hipsters, religiously conservative, drug addicts, etc.  I just made the assumption we were all crazy.  Judging your co-workers for who they are usually didn’t happen, unless they are just a poor or lazy worker.  Even though I didn’t become friends with everyone, we all enjoyed working together and never let anyone sink. I also trained new employees every now and again, so I knew the job pretty well.  I do understand this is not the same at every restaurant, but this was the restaurant culture that I know.

So I decided to get another Bachelor’s degree, this time in nursing.  The whole time I was working as a server, I really never stopped thinking that I shouldn’t be there.  I graduated from a college prep high school, graduated with honors from college; basically I thought I was an intelligent person who should be contributing to society in a different and better way.  I assumed that since I enjoyed customer service and I’ve always been interested in medicine this would be the way to go.  Fast-forward two years in nursing school, and it was the worst two years of my life.  Thank God this was not my first round of college, I actually was able to enjoy college the first time around and be in an actual academic atmosphere. Nursing is not a very academically challenging profession, and you really do not learn skills or how to work in a hospital. Yes, you do have clinicals, for about two days a week, and the nursing staff is hating that you are there the whole time.  I did have a nursing internship one summer and that did make up for the lack of education I received about the hospital environment I got in school.  I don’t want this to become a rant about nursing school though, that’s a different beast.  I tend to ramble, sorry.  I received all As, graduated with honors, passed the NCLEX, and got a job.  

My job was on a med-surg floor at a hospital that was in a different city than where I attended nursing school.  Great! I was working with people again and helping others.  Now let’s back up to the first paragraph.  Naturally I am an introvert, and my tendencies are usually that I am not fond of small talk and it takes time for me to open up to others, and I do need my time to recharge.  Everything was downhill from the get-go.  I was written up for having no confidence, and this came from an instance where I forgot to clamp the IV tubing while priming it and coldness of it on my scrubs shocked me. This freaked out the patient’s family or something.  I just generally felt like I couldn’t do anything right.  Then I was told I don’t talk to my co-workers enough.  I felt like I talked when I could, if there was even time for that, and I usually like to read during my lunch break to decompress, and this was apparently a problem with everyone, but it’s just what I liked to do.  I must clarify that there really wasn’t any eating your young, though I know that this may come across as such. The hospital over the years really took the hammer to it and any nurse who was seen as a bully was asked to leave. But this initiative to combat bullying prompted everyone to always act fake all the time with his or her happiness and friendliness, so I can see how my innate quiet nature would appear to be seen as a potential problem. They were just really, really worried about me, from what I could tell were my introvert tendencies.  

This was a horrible time in my life; I cried everyday, had a panic attack almost every morning, and I just hated life so, so much.  I hated that I made this stupid decision to be a nurse.  Healthcare is so poorly managed, and nurses are not given the tools in order to develop professionally.  I started to hate myself, my personality, I kept thinking to myself if I wasn’t an introvert and just talked all the time and never needed alone time when I ate my sandwich then I could have made it.  If only I just acted normal.  But I was still learning! As a new nurse you are basically still a student! 

I quit the job with 5 weeks left of my 12-week orientation, and I believe this action saved my life.  Also, thankfully, I have a great fiancé who supported me throughout this, and as an extrovert he keeps reminding me there is nothing wrong with me being who I am, an introvert.  I have an anxiety driven life right now, I am scared to death to apply for a new job, no matter where it is.  I feel like no matter where I go someone is going to have an issue with whom I am.  Why did I have to leave my job as a server?  No pay, no benefits could make up for what I went through.  It has been months, and I do need a job.  I am studying for the GRE in order to go to grad school, hopefully thinking that where I need to be is back in academia since that is a place I really succeed.  My pride also tells me that with two Bachelor’s degrees, the last thing I need to do is be a server again.  I just don't want to hate who I am.

Thanks for reading my rambles :-) x-post in r/introvert as well.

EDIT:  I feel kind of bad for saying in the title, ""...thanks to nursing."" I understand nursing is not to blame.  That's pretty much my bitterness at the moment coming out. I didn't mean to offend anyone :).

I guess I wasn't exactly clear about my quitting, I probably should have explained more clearly. I removed myself from the floor, with my manager's permission and blessing, at that time and the manager and a family member high up in administration tried to get me moved to another area. That didn't happen so after my 90 day trial period I didn't have a home in the hospital, so I was obviously gone. Later I was told that the reason I didn't get a transfer was because of poor inter department communication within the hospital and that I came come back in a year. The manager herself quit not long after I was gone also. My city/area in my state is over saturated with nursing schools and grads, most have to move away (I don't have that luxury for personal reasons, fiancé is a lawyer and this is where his practice is). And most require a year's experience in the hospital to work anywhere, even in an office.

1mvhry,15,2013-09-21,My personal story from happy to sad introvert thanks to nursing,foxdancer,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1mvhry/my_personal_story_from_happy_to_sad_introvert/,"This is the first time I’ve posted on Reddit. I have only been lurking, and I have really learned a lot by what everyone posts in this subreddit.  I’m sorry this is long, but I needed to get this out of my system, and I felt this subreddit may be the best place to post this. Thanks in advance!

I’m not sure if I am writing this to just vent or to actually seek help, perhaps both. Here’s my story.  My first Bachelor’s degree was pretty much a waste, so I went to go work as restaurant server shortly after I graduated.  I felt like a failure because I had done so well and all I could get was this stupid job. {Insert the usually college grad/sucky job argument here}.  Not long after I started working I realized that I LOVED my job.  I am introvert but I loved working as a server, mostly because I worked with some GREAT people and I loved the busy nature of the job, and helping my customers.  Of course there were some awful customers every now and again, and not everything ran smoothly all the time, but those were small potatoes.  How could an introvert love serving? I don’t know, but I did!  Maybe it was because I worked with people that eventually became very good, lifelong friends to me, and there was really no time to make small talk before the next crisis happened.  Plus, the working environment in a restaurant is very diversified personality wise- you have your introverts, extroverts, those in-between, high school educated, college educated, sane, insane, hipsters, religiously conservative, drug addicts, etc.  I just made the assumption we were all crazy.  Judging your co-workers for who they are usually didn’t happen, unless they are just a poor or lazy worker.  Even though I didn’t become friends with everyone, we all enjoyed working together and never let anyone sink. I also trained new employees every now and again, so I knew the job pretty well.  I do understand this is not the same at every restaurant, but this was the restaurant culture that I know.

So I decided to get another Bachelor’s degree, this time in nursing.  The whole time I was working as a server, I really never stopped thinking that I shouldn’t be there.  I graduated from a college prep high school, graduated with honors from college; basically I thought I was an intelligent person who should be contributing to society in a different and better way.  I assumed that since I enjoyed customer service and I’ve always been interested in medicine this would be the way to go.  Fast-forward two years in nursing school, and it was the worst two years of my life.  Thank God this was not my first round of college, I actually was able to enjoy college the first time around and be in an actual academic atmosphere. Nursing is not a very academically challenging profession, and you really do not learn skills or how to work in a hospital. Yes, you do have clinicals, for about two days a week, and the nursing staff is hating that you are there the whole time.  I did have a nursing internship one summer and that did make up for the lack of education I received about the hospital environment I got in school.  I don’t want this to become a rant about nursing school though, that’s a different beast.  I tend to ramble, sorry.  I received all As, graduated with honors, passed the NCLEX, and got a job.  

My job was on a med-surg floor at a hospital that was in a different city than where I attended nursing school.  Great! I was working with people again and helping others.  Now let’s back up to the first paragraph.  Naturally I am an introvert, and my tendencies are usually that I am not fond of small talk and it takes time for me to open up to others, and I do need my time to recharge.  Everything was downhill from the get-go.  I was written up for having no confidence, and this came from an instance where I forgot to clamp the IV tubing while priming it and coldness of it on my scrubs shocked me. This freaked out the patient’s family or something.  I just generally felt like I couldn’t do anything right.  Then I was told I don’t talk to my co-workers enough.  I felt like I talked when I could, if there was even time for that, and I usually like to read during my lunch break to decompress, and this was apparently a problem with everyone, but it’s just what I liked to do.  I must clarify that there really wasn’t any eating your young, though I know that this may come across as such. The hospital over the years really took the hammer to it and any nurse who was seen as a bully was asked to leave. But this initiative to combat bullying prompted everyone to always act fake all the time with his or her happiness and friendliness, so I can see how my innate quiet nature would appear to be seen as a potential problem. They were just really, really worried about me, from what I could tell were my introvert tendencies.  

This was a horrible time in my life; I cried everyday, had a panic attack almost every morning, and I just hated life so, so much.  I hated that I made this stupid decision to be a nurse.  Healthcare is so poorly managed, and nurses are not given the tools in order to develop professionally.  I started to hate myself, my personality, I kept thinking to myself if I wasn’t an introvert and just talked all the time and never needed alone time when I ate my sandwich then I could have made it.  If only I just acted normal.  But I was still learning! As a new nurse you are basically still a student! 

I quit the job with 5 weeks left of my 12-week orientation, and I believe this action saved my life.  Also, thankfully, I have a great fiancé who supported me throughout this, and as an extrovert he keeps reminding me there is nothing wrong with me being who I am, an introvert.  I have an anxiety driven life right now, I am scared to death to apply for a new job, no matter where it is.  I feel like no matter where I go someone is going to have an issue with whom I am.  Why did I have to leave my job as a server?  No pay, no benefits could make up for what I went through.  It has been months, and I do need a job.  I am studying for the GRE in order to go to grad school, hopefully thinking that where I need to be is back in academia since that is a place I really succeed.  My pride also tells me that with two Bachelor’s degrees, the last thing I need to do is be a server again.  I just don't want to hate who I am.

FYI, I am an INFJ

1mvdif,1,2013-09-21,No Direction,scummz,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mvdif/no_direction/,"I don't know if I'm actually depressed or if this is even the right place to post this. I do know that I'm sad, I'm lonely, and my hobbies no longer interest me.

I'm certainly introverted and I've always been a smart guy.  I definitely found school to be uninteresting and did not feel challenged whatsoever.  I'm in my last year of college (great GPA, respected engineering program) in a place where I had to start from scratch, socially. My closest relatives live a few thousand miles away from the city I'm studying in. I was initially successful at making friends, but acquired a girlfriend who occupied most of my time (same program) and I moved off campus and fell out of contact with them.

I spent almost every second of every day with my gf; this is mostly because we did all of our studying and had all of our classes together.  For three years, I made the mistake of letting her control the direction of my life and helped her pursue her passions, rather than focusing on mine.

This summer was definitely a low point for me. I had an internship at a well-known company, but didn't enjoy it due to issues with coworkers, moral dilemmas, a long commute, and a generally negative company attitude. My girlfriend broke up with me in June, which made it that much harder. To this day, I still have no idea why she left.

I used to be really good at making and fixing things, from cars to computers to musical instruments. I have absolutely no motivation to continue doing this sort of work. I haven't picked up any new hobbies to replace these.

I used to really care about my health, but I've started smoking and drinking excessively as a form of escapism. I spend a lot of time behind a computer screen, playing videogames and drinking until I pass out. Two years ago, I suffered a spine injury that continues to haunt me and renders me almost entirely immobile when it recurs.  I haven't been eating much, and have lost quite a bit of weight.

I dread calls from my family. I don't want them to know that I'm unhappy and questioning my current path in life. I feel like I've just skated by up until this point, and have no idea what to do next. I feel like I used to be ambitious and I know people expected so much of me, but I'm letting everyone (including myself) down.

I've tried getting my life back on track by making to-do lists, finding new music to listen to and love, and improving my living situation. None of it has provided the motivation I need; every setback hits harder and demotivates me even further.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to be able to make my incessant google searches for ""I'm demotivated"", ""I'm depressed"", or ""help me I'm fucking sad"" provide any new insight.

I've tried going through multiple forms of counseling at my school, but still am not receiving any useful tools to dig myself out of this hole. It seems like the only things going for me are that I'm intelligent and financially solvent (barely). Those two apparently aren't enough to make me happy.

I feel like there should be a really simple solution to my problem, and that is why I'm appealing to you, /r/depression. Is there something I'm missing?"
1mzq3b,12,2013-09-23,[F4M] Reversing Gender Interaction,yourlittleslut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1mzq3b/f4m_reversing_gender_interaction/,"So the title took me a bit to come up with, but I think it basically explains what I'm looking for; a roleplay in a society where women act as men, and men women. The ""traditional"" male role would be as a homemaker, while the woman goes out to work. Women would be the ones notoriously thinking about sex, constantly hounding men whom try their best to be modest under constant harassment.

When a woman fucks as many guys as possible she is praised as a ""stud"" while a loose guy would be a whore. Women would constantly be leering, grabbing, groping and making crude remarks at the expense of men, who take it due to the social order. I think it would be fun to see how we would interact with our roles reversed, and here are a few scenarios that I think could be a good canvas for it. In descending order of preference. 

1) The Halcyon Days of High School:

The roles are truly reversed. Gone are the days of high school football ruling athletic departments from Ohio to Texas. Rather, women's soccer, volleyball and softball dominate their respective seasons. Cheer leading would still exist, but a female cheerleader would be the unicorn that a male one is at many schools of today. I could be the hot shot three sport athlete: striker, volleyball and star second base. 

You're my boyfriend who I've been trying to get in bed for weeks, but you want to save it. I do my best to be sensitive, but deep down I can't stop thinking about what you look like under your cheer outfit. I constantly think about every muscle, every bit of skin. When you go down on me, I long to feel you inside me. Yet you deny me and I must earn your virginity. Perhaps you have religious beliefs, perhaps you're physically insecure, perhaps you think I just want you for sex? 

2) Office eye candy:

Being an executive has its perks, especially being a hiring manager. I get to see all the talent (sexual and professional) and pick the best for where I want them. One day, you walk into a group interview for an internship and I'm rather taken. I, of course, place you on my team and take you under my wing, teaching you the industry; spending many late nights together. 

Without pre-determining too much of the story, we grow closer and I long to take advantage of you while we deal with the ethical, moral and sexual tension? Where does the tension come from? Perhaps you're taken (dating, engaged, etc), there may be an age difference, power dichotomoy being my subordinate. Lots of fun topics to explore. 

3) Paying Her Debts

Your wife has a gambling problem, with both frequency and skill. Like many degenerates she came to me for a loan thinking she would win her way out of the hole; needless to say she was wrong. So after weeks of dodging me, I finally pin her down at home. When I come knocking on an otherwise peaceful, ordinary Sunday, its a revelation to you. You had no idea she was blowing every pay check at the bookie. 

But regardless of what you know, I know what I want in repayment: you. Your body, your mouth, your hands, your cock. You may not want it, but I'm going to have you, all while she watches so she knows what I'm taking from her. 

4) Unsatisfied

I constantly beg my husband for sex but its never forthcoming. ""I'm tired,"" ""I have a headache,"" ""I have to work in the morning..."" Its always some excuse whenever we crawl into bed and my hands start to roam. I'm sick of it and while not seeking infidelity, my eyes are roaming more freely than ever. Finally one day I go to a friend's bachelorette  party (or the beach, or wherever you fancy) and decide to make a move on you to quench my thirst. 

I am sure I will think of some more, but these should be something to get us started. 

A few notes to begin:

* No Kik or skype. Looking merely for PMs, Gmail if things progress well.

* Please don't respond with, ""I'm up for any of them!"" Its great if you want to respond, but which one connected with you the most, I'm giving options and beginnings so we can start from a place of common interest.
 
* Furthermore, tell me why you liked the scenario you did. Give me some details you'd like to include, or some possibilities that jumped to mind for where the story could go. If you have something in mind for your character tell me. 

* Don't feel the need to write a book, but more than a line or two is sure to be eye catching. 

* Please use proper capitalization, punctuation and passable grammar. Again, you don't need an English degree, and I make mistakes too, but if you can't be fucked to hit the shift button then we aren't looking for the same things in a pen pal. 

Well I hope that didn't come off too demanding and that some of you are still with me. I will be around for a little while immediately, and then readily available this evening (~10PM EST). If I don't get back to you right away that is why. I will give every thoughtful response a response back, even if its a declination. 

Last thing, if you spy something in my post history that intrigues you, please let me know with the above guidelines. I'm very open to many things.

Thanks for reading,

1mzmid,5,2013-09-23,I just found out my Grandfather has early to mid stage Dementia. Looking for guidance.,[deleted],dementia,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1mzmid/i_just_found_out_my_grandfather_has_early_to_mid/,"Bit of back story; Alzheimer disease runs on his side of the family. He's lost two siblings to it and one is currently suffering with it. That being said his condition is likely only to get worse. 

This isn't exactly unexpected news. The last few years his memory and other cognitive functions have been noticeably impaired. The confirmation is still a harsh shock of reality though. 

I'm currently living with my grandparents in order to be closer to school and an Intern job I have. I've found it difficult at times to communicate with him as he often seems confused as to what he's trying to get across, which in turn confuses be and makes for an awkward situation. I don't want to patronize him though; he has his pride and he has moments of clarity and I love the guy to death but knowing it's only going to get worse from here makes me want to prepare myself for inevitable communication barriers. 

So I'm really just looking for tips anyone might have on better communicating with sufferers of Dementia, ways to deal as it gets worse (preferably without coming off as if I'm patronizing or 'talking down' to him.) and really *anything* that experienced persons might be able to add. 

Thanks.

1mzhip,2,2013-09-23,I want to gain control of my life... but it just keeps getting more and more screwed up,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mzhip/i_want_to_gain_control_of_my_life_but_it_just/,"Where to even start, it's been so fucked up for a while/majority of it. 

I'll give the super-abridged version: I'm the gay middle son of 3 from a pretty fucked up family with a father who was emotionally abusive (when he was there) and a mother who suffers from almost-crippling dependency issues. Things were shitty and i was diagnosed with depression in high school and put on medication. 

In 2005, I go off to college to learn how to make video games, and I start feeling pretty damn great and eventually the doctor slowly took me off my meds. I even landed a job working about 30 hours a week for over a year (I had to leave because my classes were becoming more difficult and I was starting to falter a little in them) I felt so fantastic and so in-control of my life for almost 3 full years (finally coming out helped a lot too) Unfortunately, about 6 months before i graduated, I just got wave after wave of negativity: ruthless critiques in school, my mother cry to me saying my father was leaving her, failing an important class for the dumbest reason that I had no control of. I just... fell back into depression really badly, but I still had some hope because I had been offered a decently-paying internship in California. But, right after i graduated and moved out to Santa Monica, I was informed that the internship had become non-paying all of the sudden. I couldn't afford to live there without paying work, and while i tried to find work, i was unsuccessful, and was forced to move back to Texas with my family, who lives in this small town with nothing for me work-wise (and also pretty homophobic to boot)

Almost a year later, in 2009, I finally land another job (after not working for almost 2 years) and despite the job being in fast food it was... alright for the moment. I was also talking and eventually in a relationship with a guy from New Jersey. The long distance sucked, but we talked often enough that it sorta made up for it. Almost a year later, he had convinced me to move out there and he said he would help me secure a job. Well, I did... but he didn't. It was one of the biggest mistakes moving to New Jersey. The relationship ended rather horribly, but I managed to find another mindless job and live there for almost a full year after the breakup until a storm of shit fell upon me that forced me to move back in with my family.

I've been back in Texas with them for 2 years now. I've submitted at least 100 applications in that time frame, and might have gone on maybe 7 interviews. Today, I just got back from a hiring event for a store that's opening nearby that i'm really excited for, but... it went worse than horribly. I'm not being overly dramatic either. There was construction going on around the building and I stepped in wet concrete because the construction crew couldn't properly mark off shit, and, while they were only having short conversations with people today, the hiring manager I spoke with gave me the brushoff he was giving to all the people who put zero effort into trying for the job, and I think the only chance I will have for a callback interview is going to be my cover letter, and the wait for the next two days are going to fucking drive me crazy.

I'm at this point in life where I just want to say FUCK YOU to everything and crawl away... but I can't. I've been almost doing that for the past 2 years now and it took me possibly fucking up a friendship/possible eventual relationship (if it goes that far/he's up for it at some later point-in-time in our lives) with a pretty awesome guy I've known for over a year and a half now (who also happens to live 2000 miles away, but at least I'm wise enough now not to go chasing after a guy until I have my shit together) to make me realize that. And I've been trying my damnedest to retake control of my life but... nothing wants to go right, even when I try to steer it in my favor. 

It's not like I want to be rich and famous or anything. I want a normal, well-paying job (I would be happy with 30K a year) live in a location where I don't feel afraid to be myself (that's probably 3-5 years off from now, slowly saving back a bit each month) and find and date a nice guy who understands I'm a bit of damaged goods because of my environment or circumstances, but can see that there's more to me than my worrying, my fears and insecurities, and my slight clingyness when I'm afraid or nervous. But day after day, the simple things I want just seem further and further away and... I seriously don't know what to do. I try my best, and find myself getting my hopes up, only to be rewarded with disappointment and failure. 

tl;dr: I'm a fucking mess trying to climb up from the pool of shit and depression I've been living in, but the more and more I try, the more and more it seems that I get pushed back to where I was or even deeper, and I'm starting to feel like I have no fucking clue what to do. 

**UPDATE:** Well, in a bit of good news, I have NOT fucked up anything with said friend. It was just my derptastic brain under stress jumping from A to ZZ. The knowledge that I can still almost pass as a basic human being is somewhat settling. "
1mzaxs,1,2013-09-23,"""I can't believe I'm actually asking this..."" They sent me here...x/post from FatPeopleStories",[deleted],fatpeoplehate,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/1mzaxs/i_cant_believe_im_actually_asking_this_they_sent/,"What's going on you little piggies? I know it's a surprise and shit, but I've been reading this sub for a while, and this is my first post. Fuck green text. Oh yeah, this story started happened last week.
So be me, mid 20's, 6'1'', 180 lbs, in shape and active guy. I work as a freelancer in the advertising industry and last Monday I started a gig doing account management and creative strategy at a decent ad agency here in the city. So I walk in for work, meet and exchange niceties with everyone, and you know, start earning my paycheck. Booze ain't gonna pay for iself. All of a sudden, my chair starts rolling back. What the fuck? A split second later, I hear the floorboards of this awesome old school hardwood floor start creaking. It's getting to the point where I gotta grab my desk so I don't roll back any further. ""Huh, uhm Hamber. It luuks like we'ah gunna be wurkin' next tuh eachotha."" This stunner must've been 5'3'', mid 20’s, and 350lbs of pure curves, the kind of curves that scream ""I fuck black dudes.""
Shit. Now don't get me wrong, I hate fat people as much as the next guy. But working right next to a god damn mini moon? Fuck me.
We shake hands and and after wiping the crisco from my digits, I get back to sending out emails.
Then it starts. crunch chew crunch chew It's not even 10 am and this bitch is eating onion rings. Motherfuckin' onion rings. Where she got 'em from? Damned if I know. I squint my eyes and look over at her from the corner; I must have looked like an evil villain plotting someone's demise or something, when I notice her wiping her greasy pig hooves on her pants. Nice. Then the smell hits me. That smell. Ever drink coffee at the fried food tent at a county fair? Me neither, but I'm pretty sure this odor and experience was pretty damn close. Every 10 minutes on the dot, no joke, this cocktail of nothing is talking to me about things I couldn't care less about. ""Yuh know thut band 1 Duhrection, they so cuuute."" ""Aren't they like 16?"" ""Haaay, what do yuu thunk abuut gurls wearing white pants after labor day?"" ""If my girlfriend tried it, she'd be eating by herself for a week."" ""HUH HUH HUH HUH!!! YUH SOOO FUN-NEE!"" ""What makes you think I'm joking?"" Like you need to be seen in white pants anyway...
So it's like 11:00 at this point and this she-cow just started on her second bag of potato chips and is eyeing up a box of cheez-its like it's name is Jamal Williams. You know how as soon as you meet some people you just automatically don't like them? I'd rather hang out with those people for an entire weekend then work next to this abortion for a minute longer. I wanted to drown this bitch.
Lunchtime rolls up on me. Not a minute too soon. Some of the other employees who I met earlier approach me at my desk and ask me if I want to go out to lunch with them. No doubt. As I get up to walk away, I glance in Hamber's direction and notice the slight look of rejection come across her fat face as we walk away. That's right bitch, I'm going to sit with the cool kids and you ain't invited.
Lunch is pretty uneventful and we start walking back to our office building. On the way, we stop at a Whole Foods. Some of the guys wanted to grab something to snack on for the rest of the day. Oh, that's cool. As I'm walking around with some of the group, I see hummus is on sale. No. Way. See, like anyone else, I have my vices. Booze? You fat-asses couldn't tie my drinking shoes. Gambling? My dad once drove 4 hours up to my college to slap me around after he found out I blew half my tuition check at the black jack table in a weekend. Strippers? I'm known as the guy who walks into the strip club screaming ""who wants to go to college?!?!?!"" But hummus? Ohhh hummus. I could eat 2 pounds in a day...ask me how I know. So bam, I jump on that pack of hummus like a fat kid on a cupcake. Now where are the baby carrots? Boom. How about some cucumber? I’ve got plans for you, too. Okay, back to work.
So it’s around 2:00 and I hear that hummus calling my name. I'm coming baby. I take my cucumber and carrots to the kitchen, wash 'em off, slice and dice 'em and go back to my desk…your man's about to get busy. I dive into that shit like Scrooge McDuck. That's when Hamber starts staring at me. I mean STARING at me...like I called her kids ugly or some shit. Fuck her. I enjoy my Middle Eastern treat for the rest of the day and am so wrapped up in it that I completely forgot Hamber’s existence 8 feet to my left, you know, until she started wiping her crumbs off of her gullet/stomach and they came flying at me like some fucking shrapnel. Fat bitches, always trying to share their empty calories…who do they think they are?
Tuesday rolls around like it normally does. I get to work, start typing. Boom, email from HR comes in. Oh, okay, probably something for me to sign, right? I mosey my way down there and get to homeboys office. ""Hey, I'm Paul_El, you emailed me?""
""Oh yeah, come on in Paul, have a seat. So Paul, I know you just started freelancing here, but an issue has been addressed.""
What the fuck? Should I not have slept with that hot intern after I took her to the bar last night?
""You see, Hamber has filed a complaint.""
""Oh, this oughta be good.""
He actually laughs when I say that, ""Oh, it is. Paul.."" he actually looks down and shakes his head…”Jesus Christ, I can’t believe I’m actually asking this…Did you go out and buy health food yesterday and eat it at your desk in order to fat-shame Hamber?”
I actually burst out laughing. I'm in full on hysterics. As you can tell, I don’t really take anything too seriously. Life’s too short and I’m just trying to live. (In between breaths) “What?!?!?!”
“Yeah, I know, I know…”
“No I didn’t finish…did she actually write ‘fat-shame’?!?!?!”
“Yeah, man.” Round two of laughing commences.
As I wipe the tears from my eyes, I notice HR dude even sees the humor in this, but then I realize, this is corporate America, and I get serious for a second. “Listen, HR Dude, can I call you HR Dude?”
“Yeah, go right ahead, Paul_El.”
“HR Dude, I didn’t have to take PSYC101 in college to tell you this is a clear cut case of her insecurity. That woman was eating onion rings at 10am yesterday, by 11am sh-“
“She was eating onion rings at 10am?”
“YEAH! By 11 there wasn’t a Cheez-It in the building that was safe.”
He looks down at his desk shaking his head… ”Jesus…”
“That’s what I’m saying! So back to it, HR Dude, she knows her eating habits are atrocious at best and the fact that I choose to eat healthy pissed her off, even more so because I was eating healthy in front of her. I wasn’t trying to ‘fat-shame’ her (oh you better believe I used air quotes), the only shame she felt was her own. All I was doing was dipping some vegetables into hummus and enjoying my snack.”
“You didn’t look at her or suggest that she change her diet?”
“WHAT?!?!”
“She feels that you were ‘silently judging and suggesting she change her lifestyle.’ “
“Oh, this is priceless,” I say. “Honestly, HR Dude, I find it unbelievable you’re wasting your time with this. This is like me taking a car to work while you choose to bike in and then I have the audacity to say you’re ‘envio-shaming’ or ‘green-shaming’ (more motherfuckin’ air quotes) me by saying that you’re silently judging me and making me feel inferior because I choose to drive and pollute the environment.”
“Dude, you’re preaching to the choir. Listen man, just go back to your desk and enjoy your day. I’ll take care of all of this.”
“Thanks. Can I ask you something?”
He already knows. “Yeah, I get a lot of complaints from her.”
We both laugh. HR Dude is good people.
I walk back to my desk, and there she is, all 350lbs. of disgustingness. “Just getting in? Luttle late huh?” Bitch, the word little has no business coming out of your mouth.
“No.”
“Oh, where wurr youuu?”
I can't fucking stand people like this. Snitches who need to know what happened by acting all nonchalant about the situation. “You know I was down at HR dealing with your complaint.”
“Ohhh, well I hope uh got muh point across. Uht’s not nice tuh do whut yah did.”
Oh bitch. Ohhhh bitch. At that, I calmly got up, walked to the kitchen, took a handful of my baby carrots out of the fridge and walked back. When I got back, I walked up next to her desk and stared at her and when she looked up at me, I shoved all 6 baby carrots in my mouth and began chewing. I must've looked like a goddamn hamster trying not to laugh. That's about the time she ran out of the room. I wonder where she was going?
My first thought, “See you later HR.”"
1mz528,6,2013-09-23,Internship in Johannesburg,HobelsArne,southafrica,https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/1mz528/internship_in_johannesburg/,"Hi Guys!

I (German, Bachelor of Science in process engineering) have been offered a process engineering internship at a large industrial engineering company in Johannesburg, but their conditions are relatively harsh (2800 R ""pay"", no accomodation, no flight coverage). So I have a few questions:

* How much money is needed for a decent living there (rent, food, internet, commute)?

* Are there any volunteer organizations for foreign students that I can contact, that could help me get along there?

* Are there any low level amateur Rugby clubs there, and how expensive  are memberships?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Apple is coming to my school's career fair...,god_uses_a_mac,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1myubo/so_apple_is_coming_to_my_schools_career_fair/,"They're hiring in my major for full time positions, and I graduate in May, so I'm a fairly good candidate for a position. I have internship and design team experience, but my GPA is just under a 3.0. I've wanted to work there for literally as long as I can remember, but I never thought I'd get this good of a chance. I'm not the best at interviews though, which is probably my biggest weakness.

Does anyone have any suggestions about talking to them or interviewing with them? Or does anyone work there already, and have any other thoughts?

Thanks all....

EDIT: My major is Electrical Engineering. Also, I'm one of two ACMTs on campus. I'm extremely familiar with Apple hardware and software, because of this. "
1myt9d,4,2013-09-23,How do I [21/F] foster a relationship [3mo] with a great guy [25/M] who's moving away?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1myt9d/how_do_i_21f_foster_a_relationship_3mo_with_a/,"Where to start.

So I had an internship this summer at chemistry lab in the city I go to college in and met an alumnus from my college who graduate the year before I came (I'm a senior now). We were both chemistry majors and he tried to talk to me a lot more in the beginning but I was totally oblivious to his interest. When I started working in his department in mid-July, he got bolder and was super flirty (tickling me, cracking jokes, lingering looks). He grew on me very quickly. We started to go out for drinks after work, despite him working 2nd shift and I worked 1st shift. After I left the lab, the past month and a half we have been going to shows (he took me to a Talking Heads cover band last weekend) and movies, along with drinks and dinner. He's hilarious (he's into clowning), a realist, smart, responsible and good in bed. We are pretty smitten with each other. I’m so excited to get to know him even better, have great experiences, conversations and adventures. We are really good together.

What's the problem?

He got a research position 4 hours away in another state and moving today.

This whole weekend has been bittersweet. I had drinks with him and his friends on Friday and he asked me to be his girlfriend. He's was like ""Ehh, long distance, but it'll work"" or something along those lines. I stayed over that night and we went out for a usual breakfast the next morning. He's a great conversationalist as well very observant of his surroundings in a comical sense. So am I, I haven't found someone like that, ever. We always notice the ridiculous things people do and just find them super amusing despite the average person not finding it funny.

This maybe weird, but he was casually dropping marrying me. He was joking about how we are gonna have 6 kids and I jokingly added that they will all have biblical names starting with the same letter like Malachai, Matthew etc. Yesterday he continued to make comments like that. We went for breakfast again and there was this super pregnant petite lady in front of us. He said that I will probably look that when I got pregnant, super cute and glowy and petite (I'm 5'2"", 103 lbs) He asked me if I wanted kids but I sort of laughed nervously as he stated he wanted no more than 3 kids. He's one of those guys that will be such an amazing husband and father in the future.

It must be hormones or something, but I think that I'm having this weird marriage fever feeling recently. I fantasize about marrying an awesome guy and just having a great life and family together. It was something I never had. Only child of a single mother (only child too). What a combo man. My guy grew up with 3 older brothers and family is super important in his life. His oldest brother just recently got married and it’s probably getting to him too.

Anyways, we had a bittersweet moment last night after one last dinner. He says he slightly regrets taking the job since he met me, but he’ll probably feel differently in 2 weeks once he gets settled. We exchanged CDs (I made him a mix and 2 Old Crow Medicine Show albums, which is my ""band""; He lent me 5 Phish albums, which is his ""band"")He was super nonchalant (despite being pretty  glum and anxious about moving in general)about the interaction. I went home super crushed, I was surprised, because I’m normally a pretty level headed person when it comes to emotions. I’ve been in a funk all morning, I can’t really stop thinking about him.

I’m slightly worried about him meeting someone in his new city, but (as conceited as this sounds) I’m a really good catch especially for him. I guess when you see us together, you may wonder “How did he get her??”. He’s a super awkward nerdy looking guy, not particularly cute or handsome, but damn, he has a great personality. I’m honestly not into anyone at my college or in my city. I’m also super busy with my senior thesis and school so I haven’t wanted to date anyone, other than this guy.

I graduate in May 2014 and will be looking for chemistry related jobs. I’m fantasizing that he may be able to get me a job and I can move down there. (The city is a very old southern coast town, close to very awesome city that I would love to live in)

So r/relationships, I really want to make it work with him. I plan on visiting him, mailing him stuff, and potentially staying with him for a week in the winter. I see him one last time tonight (hopefully) and I want to really talk to him about what will happen in the next few months. He constantly mentions a “future” of us doing stuff together (me visiting for his birthday in November, coming to see my thesis presentation next semester). Any advice or observations?


*tl;dr: Met an awesome clown, but he’s moving 4 hours away and I want to still foster our relationship, as it has the potential to be really great.

What's going on you little piggies? I know it's a surprise and shit, but I've been reading this sub for a while, and this is my first post.  Fuck green text.  Oh yeah, this story started happened last week.

So be me, mid 20's, 6'1'', 180 lbs, in shape and active guy...I know, I know, what a catch right??  I work as a freelancer in the advertising industry and last Monday I started a gig doing account management and creative strategy shit at a decent ad agency here in the city.  So I walk in for work, meet and exchange niceties with everyone, and you know, start earning my paycheck.  Booze ain't gonna pay for iself.  All of a sudden, my chair starts rolling back.  What the fuck? A split second later, I hear the floorboards of this awesome old school hardwood floor start creaking.  It's getting to the point where I gotta grab my desk so I don't roll back any further.  ""Huh, uhm Hamber.  It luuks like we'ah gunna be wurkin' next tuh eachotha.""  This stunner must've been 5'3'', mid 20’s, and 350lbs of pure curves.  The kind of curves that scream ""I fuck black dudes.""

Oh fuck. Now don't get me wrong, I hate fat people as much as the next guy.  But working right next to a god damn mini moon?  Fuck me.  

We shake hands and shit, and after wiping the crisco from my hand, I get back to sending out emails. 

Then it starts.  *crunch chew crunch chew*  It's not even 10 am and this bitch is eating onion rings.  Motherfuckin' onion rings.  Where she got 'em from?  Fuck if I know.  I squint my eyes and look over at her from the corner of 'em, I must have looked like an evil villain plotting someone's demise or some shit, when I notice her wiping her greasy pig hooves on her pants.  Nice.  Then the smell hits me.  The motherfuckin' smell.  Ever drink coffee at the fried food tent at a county fair?  Me neither, but I'm pretty sure this experience was pretty damn close.  Every 10 minutes on the dot, no joke, this cocktail of nothing is asking me shit I couldn't care less about.  ""Yuh know thut band 1 Duhrection, they so cuuute.""  ""Aren't they like 16?""  ""Haaay, what do yuu thunk abuut gurls wearing white pants after labor day?""  ""If my girlfriend tried it, she'd be eating by herself for a week.""  ""HUH HUH HUH HUH!!! YUH SOOO FUN-NEE!"" ""What makes you think I'm joking?""  Bitch, like you need to be seen in white pants anyway... 

So it's like 11:00 at this point and this she-cow just started on her second bag of potato chips and is eyeing up a box of cheez-its like it's name is Jamal Williams. Jesus Christ, you know how as soon as you meet some people you just automatically don't like them?  I'd rather hang out with those people for an entire weekend then work next to this fucking abortion for a minute longer.   I wanted to drown this bitch.

Lunchtime rolls up on me.  Not a minute too soon.  Some of the other employees who I met earlier approach me at my desk and ask me if I want to go out to lunch with them.  No doubt.  As I get up to walk away, I glance in Hamber's direction and notice the slight look of rejection come across her fat face as we walk away.  That's right bitch, I'm going to sit with the cool kids and you ain't invited.  

Lunch is pretty uneventful and we start walking back to our office building.  On the way, we stop at a Whole Foods, some of the guys wanted to grab something to snack on for the rest of the day.  Oh, that's cool.  As I'm walking around with some of the group, I see hummus is on sale.  No. Fucking. Way.  See, like anyone else, I have my vices.  Booze? You fat-asses couldn't tie my drinking shoes.  Gambling?  My dad once drove 4 hours up to my college to slap me around after he found out I blew half my tuition check at the black jack table in a weekend.  Strippers?  I'm known as the guy who walks into the strip club screaming ""who wants to go to college?!?!?!""  But hummus?  Ohhh hummus.  I could eat 2 pounds in a day...ask me how I know.  So bam, I jump on that pack of hummus like a fat kid on a cupcake.  Where's the baby carrots? Boom.  Cucumber? I’ve got plans for you too.  Okay, back to work.

So it’s around 2:00 and I hear that hummus calling my name.  You got it baby.  I take my cucumber and carrots to the kitchen, wash 'em off, slice em and dice em and come back…your man's about to get busy.  I dive into that shit like Scrooge McDuck.  That's when Hamber starts staring at me.  I mean fucking STARING at me...like I called her kids ugly or some shit.  Fuck her, she ain't dipping her chips into my hummus. This MY hummus.  I enjoy my Middle Eastern treat for the rest of the day and am so wrapped up in it that I completely forgot Hamber’s existence 8 feet to my left, you know, until she started wiping her crumbs off of her gullet/stomach and they came flying at me like some fucking shrapnel.  Fucking fat bitches, always trying to share their empty calories… 

Tuesday rolls around like it normally does.  I get to work, start typing.  Boom, email from HR comes in.  Oh, okay, probably something for me to sign, right? I mosey my way down there and get to homeboys office.  ""Hey, I'm Paul_El, you emailed me?""  ""Oh yeah, come on in Paul, have a seat.  So Paul, I know you just started freelancing here, but an issue has been addressed.""  
What the fuck? Should I not have slept with that hot intern after I took her to the bar last night? 
""You see, Hamber has filed a complaint."" 
""Oh, this oughta be good."" 
He actually laughs when I say that, ""oh, it is.  Paul.."" he actually looks down and shakes his head…”Jesus Christ, I can’t believe I’m actually asking this…Did you go out and buy health food yesterday and eat it at your desk to fat-shame Hamber?”  
I actually burst out laughing.  Like full on fucking laughing.  As you can tell, I don’t really take anything too seriously.  Life’s too fucking short and I’m just trying to live.  (In between breaths) “What?!?!?!”  
“Yeah, I know, I know…”  
“No I didn’t finish…did she actually write ‘fat-shame’?!?!?!” 
“Yeah, man.”  Round two of laughing commences.  As I wipe the tears from my eyes, I notice HR dude even sees the humor in this, but then I realize, this is corporate America, and I get serious for a second.  “Listen, HR Dude, can I call you HR Dude?”  “Yeah, go right ahead, Paul_El.”  
“HR Dude, I didn’t have to take PSYC101 in college to tell you this is a clear cut case of her insecurity.  That woman was eating onion rings at 10am yesterday, by 11am sh-“  
“She was eating onion rings at 10am?” 
“YEAH! By 11 there wasn’t a Cheez-It in the building that was safe.”  
He looks down at his desk…”Jesus…”  
“That’s what I’m saying man!  So back to what I was saying, she knows her eating habits are atrocious at best and the fact that I choose to eat healthy pissed her off, even more so because I was eating healthy in front of her.  I wasn’t trying to ‘fat-shame’ her (oh you better believe I used air quotes), the only shame she felt was her own.  All I was doing was dipping some vegetables into hummus and enjoying my snack.”  
“You didn’t look at her or suggest that she change her diet?”  
“WHAT?!?!” 
“She feels that you were ‘silently judging and suggesting she change her lifestyle.’ “
 “Oh, this is rich,” I say. “Honestly, HR Dude, I find it unbelievable you’re wasting your time with this.  This is like me taking a car to work while you choose to bike in and then I have the audacity to say  you’re ‘envio-shaming’ or ‘green-shaming’ (more motherfuckin’ air quotes) me by saying that you’re silently judging me and making me feel inferior because I choose to drive.”  
“Dude, you’re preaching to the choir.  Listen man, just go back to your desk and I hope you enjoy your day. I’ll take care of all of this.”  
“Thanks.  Can I ask you something?”
He already knows. “Yeah, I get a lot of complaints from her.”
We both laugh.  HR Dude is good people. 
I walk back to my desk, and there she is, all 350lbs. of disgustingness.  “Just getting in? Luttle late huh?”  Bitch, the word little has no business coming out of your mouth. 
“No.”  
“Oh, where wurr youuu?”  
“You know I was down at HR dealing with your complaint.”  
“Ohhh, well I hope uh got muh point across.  Uht’s not nice tuh do whut yah did.”  
Oh bitch. Ohhhh bitch. At that, I calmly got up, walked to the kitchen, took a handful of my baby carrots out of the fridge and walked back.

I am tired of managers undermining company policies and making me look stupid after they specifically told me to never go against the policies. I am tired of being thrown onto tasks I am not trained for. I am tired of coupon ladies. I am tired of incompetence.

I am really just exhausted. I don't know what to do. I have to get out. I can't travel too far because I am still in school, but I need a new job quickly so I can live while I finish school. I only have a class and an internship left. I have typed up a CV but nobody will answer me. I feel like I am undesirable outside of retail. I type nearly 80 words per minute, I have great computer literacy. I am going to school for software development, and I am pretty handy with a computer. Everybody just wants me to count change and say, ""Have a nice day!"". Does anybody know how to get out?

My only two jobs so far have been a retail job and a fast food job. The retail one I did for a year and around eight months. My current job I have only had for around four days. It is a fast food job and I already know that it is going to be just as bad as my last job. They tossed me up on the register with no previous training at noon on a Saturday. I have anxiety and suffer bad panic attacks and I let them know this and they put me on a register with no training at lunch rush. I was the only open register. 

I really need help figuring out how to get out. Tech support, data entry, being a receptionist. I have been searching on Indeed, CareerBuilder, SnagAJob and Monster, and I just can't seem to get anybody to respond to me. How do I get out? What do I do? I have posted to job boards, gone to employment agencies, and done everything I can, but is there some kind of trick I don't know about? What is wrong with me? Why am I trapped in retail?

I have a B.S. in Soil Science and Hydrology from UC Davis and live in CA. I did a year long internship at Davis and than worked for over two years with a small company that did environmental monitoring. The job was very low key, and did not require many formalities (certs). I have no regrets and enjoyed the work, but the company went under and I have to start from scratch. I do not want to work in environmental monitoring anymore. I just don't see much promise in the field (cue someone in EM handing me a job).

I have NO environmental certifications, but I have time and money to get them. I cannot however go back to get an MS or PhD. Grad school would be nice, but I want to pick a real career first. I'm ok with entry level and not getting paid as much as I used to. Just want a career I can build and I can respect.

I'm not a ""follow your dreams"" kinda guy. Been there, done that. i want to make money and work my ass off. I also can move to nearly any location as long as my fiancee can work (she's a a psychologist).

* What kind of certs should I go for?  I'm OK with getting certs I might not use. I'd rather have options.

* I'm not sure which field I want to work in right now, but I'm open to many things. Any suggestions with my skill set?

* Last time I looked for work, the state was crippled by the recession. Is anything different?

* I tend to dislike the public sector. Am I doomed to work for them?

* Is being a Environmental Health Specialist any fun?

* If I had (insert a certification), would I have a better chance of being hired?

* Are there any bullshit certs that I should avoid or are a complete waste of money?

* Should I do HAZWOPER online or in person. If in person, then with whom and where?

* What kind of jobs can you get with a Registered Environmental Forester, Registered Environmental Biologist etc?

* Is a professional geologist impossible for me?

Thanks for your help. I'm a bit frustrated what to do here.

HIMYM, or How I met Your Mother is a comedy of a father telling his kids the story of how he met their mother.  He ends up going way off track, and telling about all the fun times he had with his friends, things he did at the bar, and dating. People love the show's mix of comedy, romance, and seriousness.  

The [first episode](http://media.tumblr.com/ca5695005c71ab44ecb0914809abe7ee/tumblr_inline_mfjvetyYPk1r5g3i5.gif) of the final season of How I Met Your Mother starts tonight.  [Ted, the main character and father](http://i.imgur.com/6fDxMJk.jpg) has yet to meet his future wife, who was shown on the final episode of the previous season, so this season will be filled with their relationship.  Also, the majority of the season is said to take place at [Barney](http://i.imgur.com/lZ7TqJx.jpg) and [Robin](http://i.imgur.com/5J60hHT.jpg), two of Ted's best friends, wedding.

[Remember, newer is always better!](http://i.imgur.com/vqD8jZh.gif)

Here are some Q&amp;As I had with the mods of /r/HIMYM :

****

&gt;##1. Favorite episode of HIMYM?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** Oh wow, loaded question... S02E09: Slap Bet is definitely a classic. I love how this joke continues throughout the series. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** Favorite ep would have to be the one where Marshall finds out his dad died. Jason Segal didn't read the other lines in the scripts, so he didn't know what the countdown was for and his reaction at the en of the ep was genuine. The feels man, the feels.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hard to answer, but the one that sticks out in my mind is Bad News. Some people think the whole countdown aspect took away from a very poignant moment, but I really feel like it added a lot to the episode.

&gt;##2. How do you feel about the show coming to an end?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** I hate when any show I enjoy finally ends. Honestly though, it's run its course. As much as I don't want to admit it, it's time. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** I'm not going to know what to do with myself. 

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hate to say this as the (more-or-less) creator of this sub, but I am glad it's ending. I still love the show, but like atticus says, it's definitely run it's course. It's time.

&gt;##3. Any other shows that you especially enjoy?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** Oh man, where to begin? Some of my favorites are Modern Family, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Trailer Park Boys, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia... I could go on all day, but I'll stop there. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm40e** Long list here. Scrubs, Entourage, True Blood, Breaking Bad, Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, Eureka, Warehouse 13, Stargate(all of them), Jeopardy and so many more.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Breaking Bad, Firefly, Black Books, Louie, Arrested Development, Buffy/Angel, Dollhouse, The Wire, Game of Thrones, Parks &amp; Rec, Community, Chuck, The IT Crowd, Deadwood, Justified, GIRLS...I watch a lot of TV, and love most of what I see.

&gt;##4. Any thing else you want to share with reddit?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** For all you TV fanatics, you may want to check /r/television's recent updates. With the fall season starting, the sub features helpful info on season premiers, new TV-related subreddits and other stuff you may find helpful.
Oh, and check out /r/TelevisionQuotes and /r/StartledCats :)

&gt;&gt;**dm40e** I named my dog Swarley because of himym.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** **You are all beautiful wonderful people.** I am a tad drunk.




Also, because I am a new here, I am going to do a quick introduction.  I am a new member of the [internship program](http://bit.ly/15O0xJw) and glad to be here, .

Here are some Q&amp;As I had with the mods of /r/HIMYM :

****

&gt;##1. Favorite episode of HIMYM?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** Oh wow, loaded question... S02E09: Slap Bet is definitely a classic. I love how this joke continues throughout the series. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** Favorite ep would have to be the one where Marshall finds out his dad died. Jason Segal didn't read the other lines in the scripts, so he didn't know what the countdown was for and his reaction at the en of the ep was genuine. The feels man, the feels.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hard to answer, but the one that sticks out in my mind is Bad News. Some people think the whole countdown aspect took away from a very poignant moment, but I really feel like it added a lot to the episode.

&gt;##2. How do you feel about the show coming to an end?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** I hate when any show I enjoy finally ends. Honestly though, it's run its course. As much as I don't want to admit it, it's time. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** I'm not going to know what to do with myself. 

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hate to say this as the (more-or-less) creator of this sub, but I am glad it's ending. I still love the show, but like atticus says, it's definitely run it's course. It's time.

&gt;##3. Any other shows that you especially enjoy?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** Oh man, where to begin? Some of my favorites are Modern Family, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Trailer Park Boys, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia... I could go on all day, but I'll stop there. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm40e** Long list here. Scrubs, Entourage, True Blood, Breaking Bad, Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, Eureka, Warehouse 13, Stargate(all of them), Jeopardy and so many more.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Breaking Bad, Firefly, Black Books, Louie, Arrested Development, Buffy/Angel, Dollhouse, The Wire, Game of Thrones, Parks &amp; Rec, Community, Chuck, The IT Crowd, Deadwood, Justified, GIRLS...I watch a lot of TV, and love most of what I see.

&gt;##4. Any thing else you want to share with reddit?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** For all you TV fanatics, you may want to check /r/television's recent updates. Will the fall season starting, the sub features helpful info on season premiers, new TV-related subreddits and other stuff you may find helpful.
Oh, and check out /r/TelevisionQuotes and /r/StartledCats :)

&gt;&gt;**dm40e** I named my dog Swarley because of himym.

I've been lurking a while in Reddit and decided to finally suscribe today to make the best use of it.
So I'm gonna go and paste what I already wrote on the Official LoL forums.
I truly hope I am not trespassing any rules by posting this kind of message here. 

I will be doing an internship in Dublin for 6 months, starting next week or the one after. 
Therefore I am wondering if they are any League players over there (I'm pretty sure there are given the fact that Riot Headquarters are located there !) that I can play with or watch some matches with, hang around, or do all the things above !

Playing League with someone (in the same room) is definitely one of the things I will miss the most and I actually enjoy the most in my life. So if you guys want an other player or just want to have fun in general !

I can link you my couchsurfing profile if you guys want to have a better look at me.

Have a good one,

1n1sh1,6,2013-09-24,Is a Shiba Inu right for me?,bryckbreaker,shiba,https://www.reddit.com/r/shiba/comments/1n1sh1/is_a_shiba_inu_right_for_me/,"So I have never had a dog before and I know the attitude towards Shiba's as a first pet but I have spent the last year or so researching dogs and suitable breeds and to be honest I have fallen in love with cant get away from the idea of getting a Shiba Inu.

I have wanted a dog for years but I was away at university and moving around for my internships so it was never the right time. I started grad school and have settled back in with my parents (for the next two years minimum).

I was hoping that maybe I am a unique case and /r/shiba would be the best to judge whether or not it would be a good fit. (keeping in mind I am well aware of the responsibility and work I will have to put in)

things to consider

* I live in a detached house with my retired parents and a huge back yard
* I spend 5-6 hours a day at school (during the week) but have no other commitments so all the free time in the world
* I also have a cottage a couple hours north of my house that's on a lake which I spend many weekends at during the summer... (do shiba's in general like water?)
* I don't know may people with dogs so I'm concerned about socializing him as a puppy (do people use dog parks in the winter?)
* I prefer the Shiba mainly because of its unique look but also because i have heard they do not bark very often and are very clean and intelligent and of course like many dogs they are loyal and loving.

also just a side note: I think a lot of people that say the Shiba Inu is not right for a first time pet owner may only consider it through their own experienced point of view... while very valid of course, I think you can sometimes forget that from my perspective having nothing to compare it to may work in my favour. making a more difficult dog to train just seem normal, which may reduce the amount frustration because I have no expectations other than the broad (but large) responsibility of owning a dog.

1n0zho,6,2013-09-24,Getting back into hockey after a long layoff. What do I need to know about the team?,zbeg,ColoradoAvalanche,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoAvalanche/comments/1n0zho/getting_back_into_hockey_after_a_long_layoff_what/,"So I used to be a diehard NHL fan starting about 1992 until the lockout, and I just wasn't able to maintain interest in the NHL after that. I guess I was mad or disappointed or heartbroken or *something*. It doesn't really matter why. Anyway, I'm going to give it another go.

I was a pretty serious Avs fan since the day they moved from Quebec. I even talked my way into an internship with Mike Haynes (then with the radio team) in the 98-99 season and got to go to a bunch of home games for free on the ice, had press access, etc. It was pretty sweet. I don't think I missed more than 30 Avalanche games *combined* from 1999-2004.

But since the lockout, I've watched and followed the NHL zero. Zip. I couldn't tell you who won the Stanley Cup in any of those years. I've looked at the previews to get an idea of the team, and I've just gone through the NHL rosters to see who's still around. 

I've learned something: if I recognize the name, they're old. I guess Radim Vrbata isn't a young up-and-comer anymore. Are the team previews enough? It's weird starting over almost from scratch, though I've watched thousands of hours of hockey. 

Any major rule changes since the lockout?

Is Mike Haynes still doing play by play? Who's doing the TV and radio broadcasts? I live in Washington State now, so I'm trying to figure out my best option for watching games.

Thanks for any help you guys can provide."
1n0t19,3,2013-09-24,[22/m] Girlfriend's [20/f] weed habits are an issue to me and it's making me feel crappy.,every-day-throwaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n0t19/22m_girlfriends_20f_weed_habits_are_an_issue_to/,"So my girlfriend (Lyn, we will call her) and I have been seeing each other since sometime in the summer. She did an internship where I work (professional environment with random drug testing) where I have been for five years. I never did anything out of line in high school; not a drop of alcohol until college and still never smoked pot or done any drug due to random testing. Lyn goes to college 4 hours away, so we werent planning on much more than a summer fling, but we hit it off really well and our personalities meshed quite a lot, so we have decided to give an LDR a try.

Now, I knew already that Lyn smoked every now and then, and now and then doesn't bother me much. However, I'm not really cool with an all the time regular thing. I have a lot of family issues over drugs and it makes me uncomfortable, which she is aware of. However, we were talking about a lot this weekend while she visited me. Somehow the topic came up and she told me that she probably smokes more than I'm cool with. I thought about it for a bit and asked some questions (she told me it was a solitary thing when she's lonely or had a bad day) and I told her it was fine, that it didn't change my feelings for her but that I was hurt that she intentionally hid it from me.

This has been bothering me for the last couple of days, so I confronted her tonight about it. I asked how often, and its basically every day or two. I'm not really okay with this. I don't know exactly why it makes me so uncomfortable (my thoughts didn't immediately go to my family, so I don't feel like it's that) but it does and I especially don't get it when she complains about money but is buying enough weed to smoke almost daily.

I told Lyn that I'm not really okay with that and she immediately went on the defensive. In no particular order: ""What the hell does that mean?"" ""I don't get why it affects you what I do in my personal time or see how that's your business at all."" ""If you tell me to stop I'll stop."" I find it hard to remain calm and rational when someone else can't, but I tried to explain to her that I just don't understand why she does it so much and that it makes me uncomfortable, and that it still bothers me that she hid what clearly is a big part of her life. I also said I'm not going to make her do anything because I know that she would resent me for that just the same as I'd resent her if she asked me to give up a hobby. If she gives it up I want her to want to.

Here's the thing: through this conversation, there was never even mention of a compromise, and that bothers me. She never asked me how much is ""okay"" in my mind or if I would accept her doing it less. I know I've never been high, but I just don't understand why its so appealing to smoke that often, and she kept avoiding it when I tried to ask her why (I even asked if I could smoke with her once to try and understand a little better and it seemed to only piss her off). Still, regardless of the 'why', she is knowingly doing something that isn't cool with me and getting defensive when confronted about it and like I said avoiding it and just telling me its not my business.

I really like this girl and except for this I feel a very strong connection to her and everything else is great. We have a great time together, the sex is phenomenal, and she is otherwise extremely loving and caring. I don't want to end the relationship. How can I tell her that I am hurt by the fact that she didn't even mention compromising and that that makes me feel like the relationship isn't important enough to her to want to make what seems to me should be not a huge change to help it (when she has said before she wants to do whatever it takes to make us work), but without seeming like I'm guilt tripping her? I just want her to be aware of how she's making me feel, but I'm afraid of it being taken as an attack on her. Thanks for your advice.

Update:For the record, to clarify, ""hiding"" it from me was her phrasing, not mine. Perhaps that's part of why I felt the way that I did. 

I took what several of you said to heart and took a couple steps back. I sat down and tried to figure out where I got such a negative view on this, so I looked at all the experiences I've seen with it and quickly figured it out. I organized my thoughts and we had a long and productive conversation. Long story short, we were both able to communicate a lot better after some time to cool off and collect ourselves; we both felt that we had ended up just attacking each other originally rather than attacking the issue at hand. She was able to explain to me why she likes to do it (and, as many of you said, better than being drunk) and that its not something she wants to keep doing forever anyway, I was able to explain to her where I got such negative views and that I was concerned because I care and I didn't want it to become a crutch, not because I want to dictate her life. We saw each other's points and she told me that she would cut back. I told her that I would prefer it not be an all the time thing and I truly do appreciate that, but that I'm by no means giving her an ultimatum or requiring that she change at all and that my feelings won't change regardless. I have no guarantee of whether it will be lessened or not, but after talking about it I'm okay with that and I trust her to use her best judgement. And, as was said by a couple of people, if it doesn't really affect me or our relationship then it doesn't matter a whole lot.

I'm really glad that we were able to work through this. I care a lot about her and have honestly fallen quite hard for her considering the length of our relationship. As I said, my feelings for her haven't changed through this (which I made very clear to her) and whether or not it changes now or down the road isn't a major concern to me anymore. I still am not a huge fan, but I've decided that I'm going to try it with her sometime to try and understand better, which she agreed to do. I really truly appreciate everything that all of you said (even the negatives). It helped immensely to have several more opinions to show me that neither of us was necessarily right or wrong and I couldn't be happier with how things turned out; I now realize that the weed wasn't really my biggest problem in the end, it was that it scared me that we couldn't talk about a problem and deal with it without ripping each other's head off. I'm just glad that we ended up being able to talk about it, understand each other, and compromise. I didn't want to lose the relationship over it and I don't see it being an issue anymore.

Thanks again everyone for your advice."
1n0o5s,1,2013-09-24,What is unique about you which is explainable as an INTP thing?,Galaxymac,INTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1n0o5s/what_is_unique_about_you_which_is_explainable_as/,"As on the tin.

Mine are as below, wall of text warning.

&lt;**body**&gt;

&lt;**Money**&gt;
I have a tick about money, which I think is understandable, as it is one of the few things in daily life which can be measured with numbers. Money is easy to deal with logically and in a frugal manner. Not only am I frugal, but I hate it when other people spend money on me. I can't stand when people buy things for me, and if asked what I want, I will often choose the most efficient use of the money being spent, if choosing at all. Part of this, I think, is tied to my desire for autonomy, and it really makes me feel shitty when I feel as though I can't deal with it myself. Another part of my dislike of money spent is the social obligation to return the favor, and I have a really, really shitty time with that.

When I went to prom with my ex-gf, it was paid for by her parents; tickets, tuxedo, the whole nine yards. Even so, I had a really hard time accepting that, and I was very concerned that the tuxedo be the most efficient use of the cash at hand, my date less so, willing to spend almost anything. Looking back, the tux was stupidly expensive for the quality, and I was more than a little dismayed about that. This being a little redneck town in the boonies, I think I could have worn my navy suit with gold buttons and I would have been fine, but no, she insisted that it match her dress and that it be a tuxedo. The matter of the tuxedo brings me to my next topic.

&lt;**Fashion**&gt;
I am concerned with looking nice when I go out at all. Beyond basic hygiene, which everybody should make an effort about. I take pains to make my shaving clean and razor-burn free, I put an effort into grooming my beard, and I get annoyed when my hair is shaggy. I like to wear snarky/geeky graphic tees, but more so I prefer to wear a dress shirt and waistcoat. It isn't so much fashion as it is a desire to look professional or respectable. I am really quite technical with clothing, and I know my way around a man's wardrobe. I really like the dress of the early 1900s, and I think that I try to emulate my grandfather a little. I like old things, I guess. I think a lot of this is related to my desire to perform, on the stage and on the street, which brings me to my next topic.

&lt;**Performance**&gt;
I am a performer, an entertainer. I street perform during summer (dressed very well while at it) and I perform with community theater when I get the chance. I am told this is common for introverts, though I have no idea about INTPs, and it seems to be an inherently extroverted activity. I certainly have the voice for it, and the radio station is interested in hiring me for an internship. Surprisingly, I have a lot of talent for theater, and I'm able to communicate ideas very well on stage and with the director. I think a lot of the reason for this is the release I get out of it. When I perform on the street, I adopt a persona, and I am outgoing, talkative, charismatic, and flirty. I have a weird amount of success with flirting when I'm in performer mode, having had several free meals as the result of dates. I guess what I'm saying is that with  performance, I don't have to be me, I get to be whoever the heck I want, and it is quite liberating.

&lt;**Correctness**&gt;
I really hate being incorrect. I try to be very humble and unassuming, and when criticism is offered I will listen. I appreciate candor and honesty in people, and I will ask people to enlighten me on topics about which I have little knowledge. I actively ask participants in conversation to correct me. I am also concerned with having sources for the knowledge. I don't like being wrong, and I will accept criticism easily, and adjust  my words or myself based on what was said. I also ask that participants in conversation tell me their thoughts and feelings on what I'm saying, and that they tell me when to shut up, as I don't enjoy bad socialization and I have a tendency to go on tangents and long monologues.

&lt;**Chivalry**&gt;
I am almost entirely certain that this one is just me, but I make a big deal out of chivalric values. Chivalry in its original form is outdated and rather patriarchal, so I prefer a more modern approach, which has the same ideas at its core. Part of the reason for this is that I am a history nerd, and I partake in the SCA. I read books like ""King Arthur and His Knights"" and ""Robin Hood"" when I was young. The combination of the SCA and old tales of chivalric knights, who were honorable and loyal and brave, really stuck with me. So, I try to behave with chivalry in mind. I think one reason I find chivalry important, from an INTP standpoint, is that it is really concerned with being fair and just, and that the loyalty it describes isn't arbitrary; as a guideline for being an excellent person, chivalry is pretty logical.

&lt;**/body**&gt;

I'd like your input and what you think. I look forward to some interesting responses.

I could make a whole other thread about my relationship with my ex, both during the span of it and currently. It was a really interesting and confusing time, I must say. I do have a few things about it which I would like to share with a like-minded group, though I do not think a relationship thread would necessarily be welcome. If there is interest, or better, a good place for that, I would appreciate it if you would make me aware.

**TL;DR: Money, fashion, performance, correctness, and chivalry. Also, share your ideas.**

I was thinking of getting some RedHat certification( I have no experience with RedHat or CentOS but I assume it can't be *that* different) but I thought I should ask here first.

What do you think I should do to get into this? I already plan on helping with the colleges' server and so on( read a lot of posts on /r/linuxadmin and /r/syadmin).

So  i don't know what the fuck i am doing.  For the last year i have had a painful condition in my feet.  Right now only my right foot.  Left foot has healed so far.  Pretty much the tendons in the bottom of my feet got inflamed and sore.  From a combination of probably, bad life style, bad genetics, shitty shoes.  However i have been making progress in trying to heal them.

While i have a serious problem.  The longer this goes on the more likely it continue to develops until the whole thing is mostly scar tissue.  Then i am probably screwed.

I always wanted to be a cop and have thought about the military.  I need pretty much 2 months off my feet.  No labour jobs and nothing but working on stretching and losing about 20 pounds.  With luck it will go away like my left foot.

I am 25, just finished a 3 year course in Canada.  Currently job hunting.  The problem is my typical job i have experience doing is general labor (landscaping) or kitchen work (prep cook) where i am on my feet all day.

My parents either do not believe me or simply do not care.  To them having a job is a must no matter what.  They just as always refuse to listen to anything.  I just finished school.  I worked for free for 4 months.  You would think i had done nothing for the past year on a couch.

TLDR

Foot is painful
Really painful
Could be come permanent
Parents think i am lazy and don't want to work, or don't care that i am in pain and demand i work anyway.

1n39t7,95,2013-09-25,When did the show fall apart?,CharliePancakes,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1n39t7/when_did_the_show_fall_apart/,"Season One: There's obvious clinks and clanks that 99% of new shows have. I would have preferred if Brian/Rudy/Biney stayed a little longer. Dexter actually almost gets caught this season because Masuka notices and investigates a needlemark on one of his victims necks. Dexter isn't seen as an a poor mans Batman he's a complex killer trying to blend in not because he wants to but because he doesn't want to get caught. Flashbacks were 1000X better than GhostDad. Overall solid season.

Season Two: Best season imo. I know a lot of people hated Lila and thought she was annoying but that was kind of the point of her character the Dex and Doakes scenes were amazing. None of the plotlines were wastes and they even affected eachother. The best part is Season One had a bunch of fallout that affected this season. Unstable Deb leading to relationship with Lundy, Paul in prison causing Dexter to go to rehab, Doakes suspions that were increased led to an amazing plot.

Season Three: This is where it starts getting bad but this season isn't as bad as people say. Jimmy Smits was amazing as Miguel and the Prado brother storyline was great. The whole Skinner plot dragged down the season and so did Masuka's emoness that went to nowhere, Deb dating a pothead and Batista dating a prostite/cop/whatever. There was little fallout from last season affecting anything I think Doakes got mentioned once by Miguel but wouldn't the fact that the most profilific serial killer in Florida history was working there cause some kind of overhaul or investigation? Quinn was tolerable this season he was a potentially corrupt cop and not a Deb obsessed crackhead who ruins everything. Interestingly Miguel notices Dexter's computer activity and GhostDad was well done this season.

Season Four: Amazing season just because of the Trinity family. The plot between Arthur/Dexter and Quinn/Daughter made sense. However most people forget the stupid Anhel Maria plot where they get married for no reason. There is also little fallout from last season. Rita's death seemed brilliant at the time but ended up being a copout so the writers could have Dexter have less collateral and go back to basics. A single father of three killing wasn't going to work unless they planned for him to be discovered next season but Rita was also an anchor.

Season Five: Rita's death while somewhat of a catalyst for Dex helping Lumen was swept under the rug. Early on there's a scene where Astor says Dexter doesn't even care about their moms death but I wouldn't be surprised if the actress said that to the writers and promptly got sent to PlotHolelando. Batista easily forgets about seeing Dexter talk to the Trinity killer. It was cool at first to see Quinn investigate Dexter by the end of the season he decides he'd rather fuck his sister and drops the investigation forgetting about his murdered friend Liddy like viewers would the next season. The writers show their cowardice when Deb doesn't discover Dexter killing and [Lumen leaves because ...](http://i.imgur.com/vE1aHYQ.gif) It was remarkably like season 8 with missed opportunities and cowardice throughout the writers room. Lumen could have easily stayed and Julia Stiles would have been stupid to refuse to do more than one season and if she did they could have gotten thousands of others who would gladly take her role. On the plus side the show still has it's dark humour.

Season Six: Starts with a timeskip just because. Batista and LaGuerta get divorced but are still cool just because. Debra doesn't want to marry Quinn just because. Dexter officially gives up trying to hide his secret and hires Batista's never mentioned sister to babysit Harrisson 24/7 in a bikini while he's killing. There is no fallout or mention of the barrell girls, Lumen or Liddy's death. The villian for this season was always over the top with his tableaus. Speaking of tableaus Anderson was a good addition. The villian could have been great if it was Olmos and not Tom Hanks jr. Olmos was a lot more convincing, menacing and had the religious cult leader presense to him butthe producers decided to rip off fight club and put a very uncomfortable looking Hanks in the drivers seat. Dexter doesn't learn from his mistakes with Trinity and Miguel and makes Travis his partner for a couple episodes. Quinn spirals out of control because he has the maturity of a 17 year old rejected from prom when Deb isn't ready for marriage and continues to fuck up the season and not investigate Dex anymore even though his only real tie to him is gone. The tableaus become increasingly more stupid escalating from a somewhat cool stomach of snakes and decapitated horsemen to a gas attack that doesn't kill anyone, a small fire in the ocean and the kidnap of Harrison for 7 minutes (that won't ever be mentioned again). There are some decent references to the past killers during the intern plot and Louis seems interesting as a character. Eventually the season culminates in what the writers were too scared to do last season and ends with Debra finding out Dexter.

Season Seven: The writers do the first few episodes really well. Sirko has all the charm of Ray Stevenson, Speltzer the Skyrim fanboy was a cool villian. Debra dealing with Dexter was interesting and had lots of callbacks to former seasons. LaGuerta secretly investigating Dexter was well done. However the show kills of Anderson (get them to sign for more than one season it isn't that hard) and Louis for no reason after reducing his character to the only person more immature than s7 quinn, Hannah is forced into the plot in an unconvincing way, Sirko is killed by bad hair nightclub owner, who is killed by Quinn because he fucked a stripper. Quinn never has any reaction to killing bad hair club owner and Dexter doesn't really care about Sirko's murder even though at this point he's a Bruce Wayne wannabee. Dexter doesn't even work anymore or spend time with his son and the Batistas never discuss that ""Hey Angel can you stop working Dex so hard i'm in college I need to go to a club, or study for finals or have a some sort  life"" or ""Hey Jaime can you stop halfassing this babysitting job we need Dex at the office"". Dexter orchestrates LaGuerta's murder and we wonder is that really our guy who is killing a detective after causing her lover to die so he can keep killing. Debra shoots laguerta and is worse off than before.

Season Eight: Dexter decides to do another time skip because that worked so well before and LaGuerta is reincarnated as a bench that nobody uses. Angel doesn't give a shit anymore. Quinn is focussed on banging every female Dexter knows. Masuka is interested in trying to get his daughter who popped out of nowhere to quit drugs and possibly even sleep with him. The season starts with Dr. Vogel appearing and retconning the whole series. We don't get attached to her character and don't care when she dies. Dexter investigates with a computer that would make HAL look like a calculator while neglecting his son and sister (who magically becomes stable and accepting of Dexter). The writers forget the point of Jaime and show us her fucking Quinn instead of preventing us spending time with Harrison who has grown up to be a 7 (briefly 42) year old shit. Hannah returns for no reason to the city where she's most wanted and becomes bff's with Debra. Dexter who hasn't spoken spannish in several seasons decides to move with her to argentina with Harrison. There's so many holes in this season that I'd get an anerysm listing them. But the point is the slate is again wiped clean pretty much and pointless less than a season characters are added (zach, vogel, cassie, marshall). Dexter finishes off by dumping his sister in the ocean depriving Quinn of going to the funeral of a woman who shouldn't want him back and abandons his son in Argentina with a serial killer to live out his dream to become a Lumberjack. Nobody found out about Dexter's secret, nobody wondered why he dumped Deb in the ocean and commited suicide, nobody is curious to where Harrisson is, Elway is defeated with temporary horse tranq and Dexter kills in front of Batista who is still too stupid to realize anything. Maybe they did succeed in making Dexter darker it's not the story of how a serial killer got caught or how a sociopath discovered love and empathy it's the story of how an intelligent, hard working family oriented man became a deadbeat dad, husband, friend and brother to fulfill his dream to become a lumberjack. Even Walter White somewhat cares about his family. Dexter truly is the most selfish and evil being to star on television but only after Scott Buck himself."

1n33z9,4,2013-09-25,NY Experience Req: One year experience = 52 weeks or number of work hours in a year?,UrManBoobies,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1n33z9/ny_experience_req_one_year_experience_52_weeks_or/,"In short: What does NY consider ""one year full-time experience""? Do they review it by number of weeks worked or number of work hours in a year?

**Background:**
I currently passed all my CPA exams and now I am looking into the CPA experience requirements in NY. To qualify, it says I need:

1. one year full-time experience under a CPA (35-40 hours per week) or,
2. part-time (no less than 20 hours per week) experience will be considered on the basis of one week of experience for every two weeks worked.

I worked at my tax internship for 22 months during my last 2 years in college. Within the 22 months, 8 months were full-time and the remaining 14 months were part time (some weeks more than 20hrs, some less than 20hrs, and even ~4 weeks of 0 hours.) I calculated that I had 2208 hours worked under a CPA certified accountant.

Any help is appreciated! :D"

**Timetable 9/17**


**19:30** 

I started feeling contractions that are hard to ignore. I cannot continue cooking dinner as I had to sit every time they come. My husband had to take over finishing the noodle soup.


**20:00 to 20:30** 

I tried timing them and they were all over 40 seconds and less than 5 minutes apart. I ate dinner and watched a movie to distract myself.


**21:00**

I asked my husband to clean up the kitchen, to freshen up and do last minute preps.


**21:30** 

I freshened up, and the pain of the contractions are still there.


**21:45 to 22:30 ish**

We sat together in the living room and timed contractions again. They were all under 3 minutes. At this point, my husband insists we have to go now. I wanted to wait out since I do not wanna be disappointed. I have been dilated 4cm since last Tuesday after all. What if I go now and I will just be 5 cm? Anyway, off we went.


**23:15** 

At the hospital IE room, I was checked to be at 6-7 cm and officially in active labor. Off to the labor room.


**23:40** 

My doctor showed up to check on me. She reminded me I can ask for a pain reliever if the contractions get too painful too handle. She left me with her resident and one intern who is constantly monitoring my contractions and the baby


**Timetable 9/18**


**00:30** 

The contractions are becoming ~~painful~~. The Resident asked me if I wanted to get the pain meds. She says it actually is a sedative that will help me relax b/w contractions and they will no longer administer it if I am 9-10cm since it would be useless and might also sedate the baby prolonging labor. I said I want them NOW. She advises to wait until my next IE at 1:15 AM. They continue distracting me with light conversation in between pain. I play along :)

**01:00** 

She sees my increasing pain and I can no longer stick to a topic, so she decides to IE me and I am at 8-9. She orders for the sedative and informs me she will break my water to hasten the baby coming down. The intern keeps rubbing my back to help out.

**until 01:40** 

Sometime between 1 and 1:40 the pain meds were administered (injected), my bag of water was snipped ( I saw the elongated scissor thing slip into me as the intern was just casually chatting up the Resident), and my Doctor arrives to sit by my side.


At this point I am weaving in and out of sleep is during contractions so I could not really hear what they were talking about. All I can hear is myself ""oooohing"" and ""ahhhhh-ing!"" and moaning through contractions. My solace was watching the clock tick as the pain starts and ends. I can comfort myself with the thought that the pain comes in waves so it is manageable and I should not panic.


I started having the urge to push or I just need to poop really bad. It tell my doctor this and she says ""Just poop if you want to"".  They then let me do practice pushes while they counted ""Inhale 1,2,3,4. Push 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10"". By the third or so practice push I see something change in my Doctor's face and she barks out sweetest thing I have yet to hear all through 3 hours of labor ""Delivery room now!""


**2:05** 

Two nurses comes in to wheel me out into the delivery room, just 2 doors down the labor room.

**until 2:35** 
They let me climb up the delivery bed and strap me in. My doctor orders me to just push when I feel the urge to. So I do that. By the second contraction, after the second push, they instructed to push one more time. I know something is up since they only taught me to push TWICE PER CONTRACTION at 10 counts per push. So I pushed anyway. The next wave comes I push again. On the last push, they told me to lift my head up as I push. I did this as well. I closed my eyes, listened to the counting and PUSHED. 

**When I opened my eyes there he was and I could not believe it!**

If my counting is right I did it in 7 pushes!
7.1 lbs Sam is born at 2:35 9/18.
He was placed on my chest and guided to suck. He did not cry at all, he gave out this soft ""Ah ah ah"". He finally belted out the full ""Waaaaaaa"" when the nurses took him away.

I feel truly blessed and grateful for the normal delivery of my baby. :)

I wish and pray the same for all the expecting Moms out there, especially first time Moms like me. 

Just listen to the Doctors.

Do not panic with the pain, they come in waves so you can comfort yourself with the thought that they will not last forever and you can manage it.

It is going to be painful.

**IT IS GOING TO BE WORTH IT.**

I've been trying to get an interview for a programming job with Blizzard, here in Austin, Texas. For those of you who have never applied to work for Blizzard, their process is very closed and automated, from the applicant's perspective. It's difficult to make connections with Blizzard employees and get to know them, etc. They don't really advertise their contact information, and for good reason.

But!

They do have several job listings for programming jobs here in Austin that I would be a great fit for. I've wanted to work for Blizzard since before college, during college, after college and still now. I applied for internships during school and all of that. I've applied via their careers page, but that process is probably their plan-B. I'm sure they favor personal references and things over the web-based applicants. But now, I am trying to make my most epic attempt at somehow landing an interview. Not necessarily a job, just an interview. I say that because I'm confident that if I can just get an interview then I will have a good chance at getting a job there.

So I ask you, r/Blizzard, does anybody know of a good way to break through this difficult barrier? Would it be bad to actually visit their offices in person? I haven't done that because I haven't seen anything that has given me the impression that it's acceptable. I'm willing to attempt anything before I accept the fact that you may not be able to work at the place that you want to.

Thanks!"

Chapter 2.
Opening The Portal

I called my old social worker at the outreach place I use to go to in my home city sporadically to catch up, and through him learned that a good friend of mine (albeit one I used to ""use"" with) had been in jail for a few months for something minor. I was overjoyed because I thought that it was awesome that by fate we had both gone clean, even if he had no choice in the matter. 
I found him and started religiously sending letters and books every week. 

""R.L"" was an old friend and like myself, trustworthy even when he was strung out.
He was one of the few people I've ever met that I could have a really quick ""back and forth"" with because our brains were both really fast, buggy and filled with pop culture references and general snarkiness. 
He was as smart as fuck, funny as hell, a kick-ass writer and always pretty chipper despite having a horrible, abusive upbringing that involved moving from foster home to foster home, being sexually abused, burned with cigarettes, hooked on junk and turned out as a gay prostitute at 15 (even though he identified as straight). 
R.L was even more awesome for living through that hell and still being a person who had some love in him. 

R.L's release date came on fast and when he told me, I was ecstatic! We were both clean and I'd help him finally get his shit together. 
He had nowhere to go and despite the fact that I didn't have the room by any stretch of the imagination, I told him he was welcome to stay with us and I meant it.

I excitedly mentioned my friend coming to Larry in passing with no ulterior motive and Larry said ""he can stay with me if he wants"". 
Sweet! Lonely old guy, charismatic young punk looking to start fresh like I did, and avoidance of the whole ""guy on couch and I want to get laid, argggg fuck!” scenario. 
Everybody's happy! Great!

But…not great.

We had some wonderful time catching up, walking in the park, talking about our new found dreams, but after about 2 weeks past, I started getting a niggling feeling that he was using again. 

One early Saturday morning I was on my way to the clinic internship and decided to go say good morning to R.L before I left.
The door was ajar and I got goosebumps - the moment I saw R.L from the back I knew something was wrong. Larry was nowhere to be seen and R.L was reclined on the couch. I approached and saw he had half of a Mike's Hard Lemonade perfectly balanced on his chest. 

As you maybe already guessed, he was dead. 

Judging by the foam around his mouth and nose it was obvious to me it was a heroin overdose because I had seen them before and apparently it's a standard symptom of an opiate overdose (medulla oblongata suppression, involuntary breathing response stops, lining of lungs comes up in ""foam form"" blah blah blah.)
 
I still think it must have been a suicide because R.L was a seasoned user and any junkie knows never to mix junk and booze, or if you do, be careful.

Or maybe he thought his tolerance was higher than it was after being clean for awhile, which is a  common reason for O.Ds.

Regardless.

His skin was light grey, his eyes the palest China blue. 
I sat next to his body and took a long look at him, asked him why , expressed my anger and my sadness, told him that he was free now.  Eventually I called the cops and a coroner came within an hour, zipped him into a crinkly maroon body bag.

Before they left, one of them took R.L's cuff off his wrist and gave it to me like we give a dog's collar to the owner after euthanasia. Both touching and fucking heartbreaking.
If I hadn't have been there to tell them his full name, he would have been ""John Doe"". 

His birth certificate arrived in the mail the next day. I still carry it in my wallet to this day.

Understandably upset, I called the clinic and told them I wasn't going to make it. 
I sat in that apartment a long time waiting for Stoic to return from work.
Larry came back to the apartment hours later, visibly shaken. I didn’t have any words so I faced the wall struggling to find something to say.
He spoke first.

""I can't stay in this place anymore"" he said urgently, in a strained voice. 
""Ghosts! There's going to be ghosts! He died right there and now it's wide open and it's all your fault and now it's wide open! Wide open!""

""...Open?""  

He shrank and brought his arms up to his head like the sky was falling.

""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Fuck fuck fuck!"" He shouted, His eyes widened with fear. 
""They'll...hear...you!""

""Who will hear me, Larry?""

He leaned in conspiratorially and whispered 
""Them.  They know now.""

“Wait…who knows? What are you talking about?”

His eyes were wide and mad, rolling around in his head, his mouth agape and twisted into a grimace of horror that contorted is face into one of pure horror.  
He looked me straight in the eye and let out a long, ragged groan that chills me to think about.
Then before I could say anything further, as if answering a call I could not hear, he abruptly got up and walked away muttering to himself with his hands on his ears, swatting at things that weren't there. 

This was the first indication that he was a little...wonky. 
I figured he was just dealing with the death in his own way and respected his space.

I started college this semester and my grandfather drives me to school and picks me up each day.  He's always been my ride- to work, to extracurricular activities, and now to college.  I saved up enough money and made the grades myself, no thanks to you high school dropouts, to go to a local college.  When my Pell Grant came in, I used it to buy a car.  You didn't contribute a penny.  You wouldn't even let me go around test driving multiple vehicles.  I could only pick one to try and if I didn't like it, I was fucked.  Luckily, I did like it.  Now I'm trying to get insurance and you refuse to put me on yours because you're afraid I'll get in an accident?  You've never driven with me.  You've never made an effort to help me learn to drive.  My girlfriend's mother helped me infinitesimally more than you.  And now you're afraid that I am going to get into a wreck?

We could have had a nice life.  Maybe.  We finally started to have money, but then, you decided to have another fucking kid.  If you're on goddamn welfare, don't start fucking breeding again.  Can you really be that irresponsible?  When we finally have the means to support ourselves, you decide to fuck that up?  What is the reasoning?

Yeah, you're so fucking smart.  1240 on the old SAT.  I got a 1500 on my English and Math portions.  But of course, you're the fucking genius.  With your nice IT degree that you took out loans to get.  So you could stay at home and pop out kids like the white trash you are. Then you try to give me monetary advice.  Yeah, next I'll get the blind guy to describe colors to me. He'd certainly do a better job of it than you could.

I've put time and effort into internships, networking, and independent study to work towards my electrical engineering degree.  I chose to use protection with my girlfriend so we didn't end up 16 and pregnant like you. I'm sick of you judging me on every fucking little thing.  ""Oh, you atheist.  You're going to go to hell.""  If you're in heaven, then I'll take hell in a heartbeat.  ""You don't work out enough.""  I'm sorry, let me balance that with my 18 course hours and my job hunting.  And now I have to pay higher insurance rates because I got my license two years later than everyone else?

All of my friends had their parents help with their car and insurance while they were in school.  I've had absolutely nothing from you but oh-so-sage advice and insults.  No, I don't respect you.  Why should I.  You can't provide because of your own shitty life choices, and when I offer alternatives, you say ""It's not your money, you don't get to decide what we do with it.""  What a shallow worldview.  Everything you do impacts the entire family.  How are you so narrow-minded?

I truly despise you.  Thanks for giving me the fuel I needed to get into heavy metal, to teach myself guitar, and to work towards my own goals.  Thank you for providing me with one or two meals a day, depending on the day.  Thank you for giving me a place to live.  Honestly though, you've given me the pure will to work for anything I want.  I developed it so I could get out of the lifestyle you'll die in.  I would rather be underground than live like this the rest of my life.  I didn't get willpower from you, but in response to you.

I feel like a dependent on the tax forms. Not your child. You'll never be a parent to me.  If it weren't for my loving grandparents, I don't know how I would even function.  If it weren't for my friends who helped me visit my girlfriend or would pay for me when they went out to eat, I wouldn't have any social life.  They never judged me because of what I couldn't do or have because of you.  But you even disapprove of them.  You insult them constantly.  You say one is crazy gay and wants me.  I don't fucking care if he has a shrine to me he masturbates to each day.  At least he fucking gives a shit and helps me.

Never wonder why I don't speak respectfully to you.  Doing something half-heartedly after weeks of hounding-once in a blue moon when the moon and the stars align- doesn't count for shit.  Not anymore. I can see through your bullshit.  Stop asking why I'm emotionally unstable.  Why I have flashes of anger and depression.  You are the root cause of everything wrong in my life.  I'm actively trying to fix everything.  To fix my health, lose weight, gain muscle mass.  Improve my grades, make friends, become self-sufficient.  Eventually I'll get there.  I know I will.  But it won't be because of you.  The worst part of it all is that I truly need help.  I can't get through life alone.  And I keep trying to rely on you.  And it always turns out the same.

This became longer than it was supposed to.  But I don't care.  It's what I've felt for years now and I'm tired of keeping it inside."

1n79p0,19,2013-09-26,An interview with the RWBY animation team.,scheatum,RWBY,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/1n79p0/an_interview_with_the_rwby_animation_team/,"**This is from /u/saskure**

*Hey guys. i wanna thank yout o those who submited questions for us to ask. i know it has been a long time since an update came, and that was cause of finals weeks. To let you know, this is not written out the best because i was giving the questions and also taking down the answers. I hope you enjoy the read. i did my best to get all the information. Once again, this is not really put together other than the direct question and the direct answer, but don't let that discourage you from receiving great information. Thank you to the RWBY team and my animation teacher who set this up for the school. we really appreciate it.*

**Why do they use Poser over the industry standards of Maya and 3DS Max other than for sponsorship reasons?**
&gt; Maya: they are catered to bigger studios. it is more bare bone. Complicated things don’t come into play with the smaller application. It has more of a Gorilla tactic towards animation.

**What's next for the animation team? Is it RWBY from now on or are there other projects in the pipeline?**
&gt; A lot are on contract for season one. Some projects need a large team of animators. Do not know what is next. No promises. It is more of a project to project basis.

**What is the normal day in the office like?**
&gt; Nerf darts. Very long, Extra hours. Everyone kinda doing their job. Rec\view days. Make sure everything is working since there are Different methods for anyone who is animating.

**How long does it take to make an episode?**
&gt;Depends on how long it is.

**Why bi-weekly. It is what they know.**
&gt; Shorter and more often. Some spit cause they

**Who did the original concept art for the characters and comes up with ideas for Visuals and weapons? Monty, somebody else, or is it a collaborative effort?**
&gt; Shane and monty. Tilean Spellling Cad - monsters

**Game industry vs animation?**
&gt; Games a lot longer. Really invest it. Very dependent on other people. Just because you are good doesn’t mean it will. Games have technical restrictions. Only have 16 frames that have to work as attack jump DJ aoe. All that animation in that slot that works. It will cycle. Takes a lot of work. If you animate the camera, you can really polish what you will see.


**What kind of artist do you guys look up to or inspire you?**
&gt; Mark histler. Cameron building demo reel. Turomk stuff. Blue skyand stuff. joe worked on the origanal ninja turtles. Monty. Animation

**Second season of ruby?**
&gt; *Insert Grunt here Fingers crossed*

**When first starting out the animation, was there much of a time constraint?**
&gt; Having the first episode being shown at RTX Time is still strenuous to where we meet a week to week deadline. Cleaned up episode one since there is now time.

**When first asked to help out with this show, what was your initial reaction?**
&gt; Yes. Everyone wanted to jump on board. Some were working on a Demo reel. Some were not told about it. didn’t even know RWBY to start. A specific animator walked in late and she found out she was working on a show she didn’t know about.

**What are some lessons/tricks you have learned while working on the show?**
&gt; Don’t be afraid to try new things. Just throw art on to the screen. Just put poses on the screen. Just work it out. Monty keeps using the same animations over and over and no one has noticed yet because he always uses it from a different angle and tweaks it a little bit.

**As Monty has said before, Battle has a certain Rhythm that the mind will accept. How much of that goes into the thought process while animating any sort of confrontation?**
&gt; Not as much. If combat has a rhythm that the mind accepts while it’s on screen. The impacts are important parts. Not much time for the sound. Petty important.

**What mistakes have you learned from?**
&gt; Always plan for more. When he was making the first trailer, did not see it to be as popular. Did not really communicate it was a smaller project. Saving projects. INCREMENTAL SAVES! Keep building your portfolio. Try and know what you are going after. If your reel is directionless then it can confuse employers.

**Did you ever try and camio yourself in any of the episodes?**
&gt; No, not really.

**What was it like when you were first starting out?**
&gt; Never give up. You won’t get a lot of feed back in the beginning. People were very non-responding. Keep the recourses online. Update stuff all the time. No one is guiding anyone. Everyone in the room is your biggest asset. (Classroom or workplace)

**Were any scenes Mocaped?**
&gt; Scenes are a combination of mocap and keyframe. Blend a lot of the stuff.

**Negitive criticism?**
&gt; Brush past it and keep doing what you are doing.

**When you were first learning to animate, what were some of the obstacles you faced, and how did you overcome them?**
&gt; *Monty*: started now. Tech would be farther ahead. Just start now and live with a stamp of tech. A lot of doubt and fear to apply and show work just in case you suck. Just do it and do what you can and put it out there. The part where people fail is where they are told they arn’t good and don’t want to push forward. Finish things. Don’t just noodle.

**Are there any moments in your career you would have done differently, if you could revisit them?**
&gt; Monty is Perfect. (no)

**What do you use for your audio?**
&gt; Goals. Real life action feature. Learn how to take short cuts. Premier. Up to 100 tracks. Sometimes over. Multiple clips for just weapon transformation. Rubys scyth. 7 tracks? Exporting to mixhouse. Sends prtools project off to our mix house.

**How much in house recording for sound effects do you use?**
&gt; Mostly stock. We do some custom recording.

**What numbers are you generating from the series?**
&gt; They are pretty high. Does not keep track but everyone is happy with the numbers.

**How many episodes are in the first season?**
&gt; 16 episodes.

**Creature design inspiration.**
&gt; Bear type creature. –type creatures. Written into script. There is a certain color
Poly count for a character. The poly count was not kept track of. Tried to keep it low. Between 8 and 12K

**Why do you black out the majority of people in the show?**
&gt; Is this to keep people focused on the story or time constraints? Do not want to fill a bunch of characters that are not important and keeps people to a story. It is just the typical anime style. Sometimes we use a mixture of 2D and 3D. tons of 2D stuff that they can’t do. It is what it is.

**When season 2 comes around. Do you plan to keep the short format?**
&gt; Would prefer to go longer, but It could be a format thing or it could be a promotional thing. How well can you sell it and who you are working along side.

**Where would you suggest a student to apply for internships as far as animation and what position would you suggest?**
&gt; The best experience is real experience. Being at obsidian showed an animator how much you need to complete in a day. You do not know how much is required until you actually get there. 

**2D animation or keep 3d?**
&gt; 2D is expensive. We have a short Time frame. People are talking to Monty wanting to learn from him. The turn around on 3d is a lot quicker, so you can then bounce ideas off each other.

**How/Why did you want to become an animator?**
&gt; One animator answered that she loved Disney movies and wanted to do that when she got to school. When it got hard, it hated her.

*Question for monty:* **Do you feel your work animating RvB for Three seasons help you in getting RWBY animation off the ground?**
&gt; Yes. Not just the library of animations. A matter of a sense of story telling. A steady climb moving into his own animation style.

**RWBY Game?**
&gt; As far as entertaining the idea of a fighting game, Monty said He knows the stats of the characters so It would translate very well, but there is no plan to make one right now.
RWBY movie? An OBA movie would be great if you were to stitch all the episodes together.

**Characters first or the story first?**
&gt; If you get the Right characters, the story will write itself.

**How much did the map and environment play on the characters?**
&gt; A lot and a little. In season one, they are only touching on one city. Future seasons will want to explore more of the world. Seeing more Cultural diversity. Establishing the world map and saying these areas are in these places. Geography determines culture and people. A lot of fun can be had exploring the world.

**When you are just having a bad day and need to take a step away from it all, how do you blow off steam?**
&gt; By playing Dive kick. Keep it light hearted. You also need Chicken wings in the kitchen.

**Why an anime style feel? Was there any other style up for consideration?**
&gt; It is Natural for Monty. They like anime and it is easy to do. It is an Easier rendering. It has More of a Flat color.

1n6liq,7,2013-09-26,[26/M] My girlfriend [23/F] just dropped an ultimatum. . .,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n6liq/26m_my_girlfriend_23f_just_dropped_an_ultimatum/,"Backstory:

So, my girlfriend (23/F) and I (26/M) have been dating for a little over a year. We had known each other through work for about a year or so before. Which brings me to Part One:



We both worked in retail, and I was her manager for about a year. It was my first job out of college, and it was her job on breaks from college. Long story short, apparently everyone at the store knew she had a crush on me, and I never knew (because I'm oblivious). Always thought she was very attractive, but I'm not the type of guy to outwardly (or slyly) hit on or flirt with someone. So I never knew that she was into me. Granted, she did use me as a reference for an internship, and I usually called her when I needed someone to fill a shift - because she was a hard worker and very versitile. Nothing more to it than that.



Part Two:
Fast forward to February of last year. I quit my job (career change that turned out to be for the best), and was on the outs with my girlfriend (at the time). By the end of March, my relationship had ended, and my current girlfriend and I started to talk fairly regularly. Again, being that she was 22, and still in college (I was 25), I didn't really see her as a prospective partner. But the more we started talking, the more we hung out. Eventually (by the end of May), we were hanging out and hooking up regularly. At that point, we were both open about our expectations and wants, because both of us had recently exited long-term relationships. We both had the ""let's just see where this goes"" mentality, and we weren't in a rush to get serious. But by the end of July, we were ""official"".



The first few months were great. She was living at home, and I had an apartment with my younger brother; she would stay with me a couple times a week, and most weekend nights. We went to parties, baseball games, out to the bars, and always found something to do that both of us enjoyed. Best of all, I never felt smothered, and I continued to have ""me"" time to do the things that I like to do (play music, work out, read, etc.). This helped tremendously, as we don't share a ton of common interests, although we do see eye to eye on most issues. We both expressed doubts about the idea of marriage, having kids, and about how many of our friends rushed into marriage too quickly out of college. We both talked about how our previous partners had pressured marriage and long-term plans against our will, so I was happy to be relieved of that pressure.



Part Three:
In April, my brother started dating his current girlfriend. From the start, my girlfriend never really liked her - for what seemed (to me) to be arbitrary reasons. She (my girlfriend) didn't like that she was quiet, and snuck out in the mornings after spending the night without saying anything, even if we were on the couch in the living room. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I don't get upset about a whole lot. I knew my brother's girlfriend from when we were kids, and so I was always giving her the benefit of the doubt. I constantly had to tell my girlfriend to ""just let it go"", ""it's none of our business"", and ""she's not doing anything to you"". A couple times, my girlfriend got into it with my brother about how she didn't like his girlfriend, and thought they got drunk too much, and were ""rude"" to her. Now, I don't really care what my brother does, or what his girlfriend does, as long as they're not hurting themselves or anyone else. I do think my brother blows through money too quickly, and I think he'd benefit from slowing down...but I'm not going to tell him what to do. I'm open with him, and let him know when he's doing something that bothers me, but for the most part my motto is ""live and let live"".



Part Four:
Nevertheless, in June of this year, we moved into a bigger apartment in our complex, so that my girlfriend could move in. This was after much discussion between the three of us, and my girlfriend and I had decided that it was a logical ""next step"", and that it would be less pressure than moving in together right away. But due to the issues mentioned above, it seems that this has caused stress on our relationship. I don't quite understand it, but sometimes she'll want to hang out with my brother and his girlfriend, and sometimes she'll want nothing more than to be as far away from them as possible. If my brother's girlfriend comes over, and they go to his room to hang out (door open), she gets offended that they ""don't want to hang out with us"". But other times, she says (to me) ""ughhh - why is she always here?!"" Most of the time, it seems like she is looking for me to approve of what she says, and complain along with her. In truth, I don't care of my brother's girlfriend comes over to hang out, if they go to his room and fuck or if they hang out in the living room. It really doesn't matter to me. But when I express that opinion, my girlfriend gets upset with me, saying that I don't ""support her"", and that I should talk to my brother about his behavior. Two things here: (1) If she has a problem with my brother or his girlfriend, I think she should have a conversation with one or both of them. I think it's unreasonable for her to expect them to know what she expects, and it isn't my job to communicate for her (especially when I hold a different opinion). (2) When I try to explain that we were the same way when we started dating (going out all of the time, drinking, spending money, and hanging out in my room), she insists that ""that was different - we weren't THAT bad"".



Also, over the last few months, she has been dropping hints about saving for a ring, and talking about ""our"" future. She had never done this before, and it appears that her feelings have changed about marriage and children - but she won't have a conversation about it when I ask her how she feels.



Here's the icing on the cake. This week, my mother (who lives out of town) invited my brother and I to go to dinner with her and my grandfather. Originally, we were supposed to go on Tuesday, and it is always implied that girlfriends are invited. Of course, my brother had something to do on Tuesday, and it was rescheduled to Wednesday; which sucked, because my girlfriend had a hair appointment that night. So, not only does she blame my brother for having to move dinner, she tells me that I should tell my brother to not invite his girlfriend, because ""if she (my girlfriend can't go)"", it's not fair. I tell her that I understand she's frustrated, but I'm not going to tell my brother to not invite his girlfriend, and if she wanted to ask him to do that, she could. But I wasn't going to do it for her. (Context: There have been plenty of times where my girlfriend has been at family events that my brother's girlfriend couldn't make.) So, of course, I wind up going to dinner with my mother, grandfather, my brother and his girlfriend. When my girlfriend finds out, she flips out on me, saying that I ""don't respect her feelings"" enough. I reiterated that I understood that she was upset about not being able to make it, but again, I'm not going to tell my mother or brother to uninvite someone just because you can't go.



When I got home that night, she was watching a movie in the living room. My brother and his girlfriend walked in, said hi, and proceeded to his room to watch a different movie. So at this point, not only is she upset about dinner, but she is also upset that they ""didn't want to hang out with her"". I said ""why would you want them to hang out with us; it seems like you don't like them anyway"". She proceeds to turn the volume on the TV up so loud that my brother closes his door. The following conversation ensues:
 


Me: Why are you doing that?
My girlfriend: Because they annoy me.
Me: Is this really how it has to be? 
My girlfriend: Yep.
Me: Fine, I'm going to go to bed.



I proceeded to brush my teeth and go to sleep. She gets in bed about an hour later, doesn't say a word. We get ready this morning, doesn't say a word. 



She texts me when she gets to work: ""If you're never going to love me you should just tell me now."" 



What. The. Hell. 



I don't even know how to answer that. I don’t like ultimatums (in my experience, a relationship shouldn’t hinge on them), and it seems like she’s putting the ball in my court. Frankly, right now she is making it very difficult for me to feel connected to her, let alone to say I love her. Honestly, I don't think I am ""in love"" with her, and I don't want to use that word if I don't mean it. I'm pretty sure she loves me, but she won't say it or open up about her feelings.



At this point, I don't know what to do. I care about her tremendously, and for the most part, I greatly enjoy our relationship. But her attitude towards others, and the way she behaves when she doesn't agree with someone, or merely doesn't like someone is a huge turn-off. It's things like this that make me question whether we should be together long-term, let alone get married or have children. If and when I have kids, I don't want them to act that way, and it would be extremely hard to enforce behavior if she acted like that.



I know we need to have an honest conversation about our relationship, and it could very well mean going our separate ways. Any advice?



**TL;DR:** Girlfriend said ""If you're never going to love me you should just tell me now."" Shit's getting real...need some input."
1n6b4b,3,2013-09-26,"[21/m] Took A Girl (20/f) Out For Drinks Last Weekend, Went Pretty Well I Thought But Now She's Now Talking To Me",IAmDirtyRandy,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n6b4b/21m_took_a_girl_20f_out_for_drinks_last_weekend/,"Hey,

So I met this girl through a friend in February or so and I thought we hit it off so I kept on trying to schedule something with her and every time she had some excuse or flaked on me so I assumed she didn't like me so I stopped trying. But then she began talking to me (facebook, texting) like every day all summer while we were apart (across the country at home for the summer) and we told eathother we liked eachother and stuff. So I figured there was a chance maybe we could have some sort of relationship. Now for this school year while she is at school I am on internship continuing to live at home so I am a 3 hour drive from my school and I'll be back for my final year next year with her since she is a year younger than me.

Anyways since I both wanted to see her and visit other good friends I drove up last weekend and we went out for drinks on the Saturday. I thought the night went well, we had a good time, laughed, walked around town barhopping, I kissed her at the end of the night after walking her home (kinda sloppy though as we had both drank too much) and she texted me while I was walking back to my friend's place (where I was crashing) telling me thanks for a good night, had a lot of fun and some drunk flirty stuff and to text her when I get back safely (not the safest area of town where I was staying). She was a little sick on the date and I think drank too much and wasn't feeling great which is why I wasn't invited in. Also I think she wouldn't do that on the first date, which is fine, its not why I took her out.

So the next day (Sunday) I text her saying I'm glad she had a good time, I did too. No response. I text her on the Monday just to chat like usual and she sends a few short messages and then stops responding. Now its Thursday and I've heard nothing from her.  Does she not like me anymore, I don't know, maybe I'm being paranoid or over thinking this but I can't stop feeling like I messed up or freaked her out or something. Should I stop messaging her and wait for her to message me? In 2 weeks (my school's homecoming that I am going to drive up for regardless) at my school my faculty is hosting a semi formal and I want to ask her to it but I'm not sure of how to go about it while I'm unsure of her she's feeling.

Any advice or related stories/ experience would be greatly appreciated. Maybe I am just being an idiot and everything is fine. Basically I have no one around here I can talk to about this so I turn to you reddit. Thanks.

tldr: Not sure if I freaked out girl as she now seems unresponsive to me after date/ kiss. I want to ask her to semi formal but unsure of it. Am I being paranoid about this stuff?"
1n5wdd,7,2013-09-26,Sometimes Good Things Just Fall Into Your Lap,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n5wdd/sometimes_good_things_just_fall_into_your_lap/,"Sit back, I've got some serious baggage to let go of.

So, I'm a male college junior and I can admit that I have never really had a serious relationship. Not for lack of trying though. I had the normal crushes in high school that amounted to little more than all of her girlfriends laughing at us in the end and the whole thing degrading into a pile of awkward silence and pent up feelings. My experiences in high school ruined me relationship-wise. By the time I started college, all I wanted to do was something that impacted the world, so I opted for setting my sights on neurosurgery, since my family's medical history made me familiar with the subject of neuroscience. I knew what I was getting myself into, 13+ years of schooling, long hours, little to no social life in the end. I accepted it. I didn't want anything to do with love, I had my blinders on and I was hitting the road. Well, Freshman year I met a great girl in my classes that was interested in medicine as I was. Naturally, I started to develop feelings for her, but after she acquired a boyfriend, I gave up and dealt with a mild depression for the next 6 months driving those feelings out of my soul. I succeeded. I went back into my blind sprint towards the medical profession. For awhile, I loved the fact that love meant nothing to me. It was sort of liberating. I had a few surgical internships that cemented my love for fixing people with my hands rather than meds alone. I was on top of the world and felt myself moving towards my goal.

Now, this is where the true meat of the story hits. The back half of my Sophomore year. I had just been accepted into an undergraduate research position in neuroscience. I was doing great. Then I met her.  She was beautiful, smart, eccentric like me, single, and actually gave me the time of day. We developed a somewhat close friendship (or so I thought) over many conversations and outings, with me listening to her, and providing her an open ear and a caring heart. She never reciprocated. She told me about her past, about her ex that she still cared for, despite his actions that led to the termination of their relationship. I tried so hard to get her to forget him, but she did not. For another 3 months, I cared for this girl and was there for her, but she refused to be there for me. I didn't start to see just how futile my actions were until about 3 months ago. I started to see just how little she cared about even having a friendship with me. She stopped talking to me altogether, even avoiding me when she could. After school kicked back in, we went out with a couple of our mutual friends for a night, and started to talk again as we had, so my hopes started to rise, but it was useless. She contacted me a couple days after the night out sounding worried and off-kilter. When I asked her what was wrong, she didn't answer. I naturally began to worry. After she didn't answer two phone calls from me, I went looking for her. After a 3 hour search of her usual hang-outs and apartment and numerous more texts, I got a text from her that simply said ""lol, gotcha."" That's when I saw it. She was what my friend had dubbed a ""tease."" She merely kept ""close"" friends to fulfill her need for attention. My friend had told me this from the beginning. It wasn't until the incident then that I realized that we were never really friends from the start. Every conversation had been initiated by me, and I had driven every conversation, with her always acting disinterested and distant. I had been used, and I felt terrible. I felt like the lowest human being on the face of the planet. I came to find out that she had been seeing her ex again, and was very close to rekindling the relationship.  It was high school all over again.
After I realized and accepted that another relationship had failed to get even off the ground despite my best efforts, it dawned on me again that I should just stop trying, that it was an uphill battle, and that a life alone but spent in the benefit others was all I needed. I accepted my fate once again and did my best manic-depressive-charlie-brown act of not letting it show, but letting it eat at me.

Fast forward to about a week and a half ago, at a meeting of an organization I'm in. This girl sat down to our meeting as a new member. The minute I saw her my heart leapt up into my throat so much that I nearly choked. I was giving a talk to the members and literally found myself lost after I saw her. She was beautiful beyond any girl I had ever seen. EVER. Now, though I found her beautiful, I knew from past experience that ""wolves in sheep clothing"" are far more common than anyone gives credit. I wrote her off as another beautiful face that would never really be interested in me. It turned out I was wrong. After seeing her activity on the Facebook page for the organization that I first saw her at, I became slightly intrigued. She didn't seem like any other girl I had met. She was interested in various nerdy things that I never thought a female would be interested in. I gave in to the curiosity and struck up a casual conversation with her. Talking to her was so fantastic. She took the conversation and drove it, wanting to actually know about me and my interests. I was damn near speechless. We talked for nearly 6 hours that night. It turned out we shared almost every interest we had. This had never happened to me. I had found someone to relate to, comfortably talk to, and to share things with. We have been talking regularly and went out as friends a couple of times for the last week or so. But...but...I can't be doing this. It's just going to end in heartache again, right? Wrong. I said I had feelings for all of those other girls. This is different. I actually feel chemistry with her. I feel a connection with her. I can say that, without a doubt, I **love** this girl. I cannot even describe half of the feelings I have when I'm with her. When I see her smile, I get chills. When we talk, I'm on cloud nine. This is what I have either been robbed or robbed myself of my entire life. I have found something that I wasn't even looking for, and had accepted as fantasy for the hopeless. I found the girl of my dreams, after I stopped searching so damn hard.

TL;DR: Numerous failed relationships. Gave up on love, then it fell into my lap."

1n5qe2,0,2013-09-26,BREAKING NEWS: President Obama to relinquish control of the United States at 12:00 PM tomorrow,MungoBaobab,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1n5qe2/breaking_news_president_obama_to_relinquish/,"**WASHINGTON, DC --**  In a stunning move, President Obama announced he is relinquishing control of the Continental United States at 12:00 EST tomorrow and handing all executive powers to Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of al-Qaeda, in order to end the War on Terror.

In the first phase of his plan, which was outlined in a series of 66 press releases dictated to various government functionaries ranging from unpaid interns to US senators, President Obama will travel with his cabinet and govern the United States in name only in absentia from his home state of Hawaii.  He will also retain the title and duties of the Commander-in-Chief, and will enforce a strict no-fly zone around the Continental US.  All day-to-day government functions within the remaining states will presumably be taken over by al-Zawahiri and al-Qaeda, who experts believe will likely institute a strict interpretation of Sharia law.  Despite handing over all executive functions and powers within the US to al-Qaeda, however, the White House has made it clear they will expect the population to abide by all current federal and local laws.

Phase Two of the President's plan involves sending Vice President Biden to the occupied US to serve as a rallying cry for the remaining population. Although it is extremely likely al-Qaeda will imprison and publicly execute Vice President Biden once they locate him, his sacrifice will prove to the world one can live according to the principles and ideals as laid out in the US Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights.  Regarding President Obama's decision to send his vice president to certain death, Secretary of State John Kerry has stated in a press release dated March 16th that any American citizens supporting him will not be destroyed in Phase Three of the operation, and will have access to so-called Obamacare and other Obama Administration initiatives once the United States is retaken.  144,000 loyal American civilians will then be selected to join the Obama Administration in Hawaii to help govern the United States once the President's plan has been fully implemented.

Phase Three of Obama's plan will involve a series of drone strikes, carpet bombings, and tactical nuclear detonations against American civilian populations the administration determines gave undue support to al-Qaeda during the course of their occupation.  The leaders of al-Qaeda themselves, including al-Zawahiri, are to be captured alive and sent to the Guantanamo Bay prison facility for a period of ten years.

After securing control of the United States away from al-Qaeda, President Obama claims he will then implement all policies and initiatives he promised during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.  After the terrorists have completed their ten-year detainment in Guantanamo, in Phase Four the President will free them within the United States, where he promises they will be free to recruit as many American civilians as they can.  However, once they have recruited new members, Obama warns, he will sign an executive order whereby any and all individuals in al-Qaeada will be put to death, immediately and without trial.

According to the Administration, this four phase initiative will unilaterally end the War on Terror and convince the international community that the American lifestyle is superior to al-Qaeda, and also end the need for any future conflict.

1n5hx0,3,2013-09-25,I don't know what I can do from here.,[deleted],PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1n5hx0/i_dont_know_what_i_can_do_from_here/,"I am currently an undergraduate physics student in my third year, and while I am not presently struggling with the subject, aside from the constant tear inducing stress that I can't seem to get away from, I feel like my options for my future in physics are exceedingly dim.

Let me explain.

When I started undergraduate school freshman year I had not yet decided whether or not I was really serious about physics, so I signed up for the entry level course and a calculus class, and filled the remainder of my schedule with required general education classes.  Now, I'm not entirely sure if it was the new environment, the stress, or something entirely different, but it would be an understatement to say that I didn't handle myself entirely too well.  Within the first three weeks of the semester I was depressed, suicidal, and developing a dependence on alcohol (typical college stuff right guys!?), and I was failing every one of my courses (except lab, because how can you fail lab).  My parents eventually found out, drove down to my university for the weekend and helped me get my priorities straight.  They also made me go to therapy, which helped a great deal.

So I ended up pulling out of the semester, and barely passing all of my classes, except for the physics course, which I failed miserably.  Funnily enough, my highest grade was in calculus, which I got a C in.  From there I decided maybe physics wasn't for me and picked up a communications major (thankfully I am not a communications major still, but at the time it seemed just about my speed).  I took nothing but general education the following semester and worked on fixing my abysmal GPA, but I still didn't perform to the best of my abilities and got straight B's in all of those classes.  However, things were looking up, and one night when I was feeling especially manic, I realized that if I didn't do this physics thing I would never be able to forgive myself.  So the next semester I retook the physics course with the same professor, along with a with even more general education (I swear to god I hate those fucking things, if I didn't have those on my transcript I would have a near perfect GPA right now, fuck).  I aced the physics course. I was going to be a physics major, and I was suddenly extremely passionate about the whole subject.

The semester after that I took every course I could pertaining to the major and I got on the dean's list, in addition to acing vector calculus and tutoring quite a few of my peers in my E&amp;M course.  I couldn't believe how much of a change I had made between then and just a year before.  Never in my life had I made such a huge transformation in such a short period of time.  

Now I'm in my first semester of Junior year, and while I feel really stressed at the workload I have ahead, I feel that I am capable of turning out an acceptable GPA, an amazing major GPA, and hopefully a pretty swell GRE score.  This isn't the problem though.

At this point, I do have time to finish the major, however I'll be taking classes senior year that I should have taken junior year to compensate for the classes I'm taking now that I should have taken last year.  I won't have time to take the electives I want, and I'm starting research and looking for fellowships a year after everyone else in my university.  I'm taking career/school advice from peers who are a year younger than me, and I feel like I barely know and don't have sufficient time to build strong relationships with any of my professors.  I keep reading that I need to get published, do REUs, do internships, and get a LOT of research in to be taken seriously by grad schools, but I can't even find enough hours in the day to study for all my classes and keep up in the research lab I'm currently working in.  Also, the prospect of getting published in the research I'm working in seem equally dim, as we're just testing PMTs and I wouldn't even consider it research.

Basically, I don't know what to do.  I come close to breaking down fromt the amount of stress on a weekly basis, and sometimes it's so unbearable that I just feel tired and sluggish.  I know I'm not alone, and I am not complaining, because I know this is all just part of the journey, but I seriously need some help from someone, anyone.

I just need some advice on where I can go from here.  I know my resume has some bumps in it already, but I still thing I can sell myself pretty solidly to grad schools.  I'm intelligent enough, and I have the drive now more than ever, but I can't help but feeling like I'm already screwed."

I just started working in Medford a few weeks ago on Wednesday Thursdays and Fridays. I've been to Boston multiple times, but only for sports games. Now that I'm 21, I'd like to adventure the city before I'm done with my internship and head back to school in January. What are some fun areas or things you guys like to do? What bars should I definitely check out? I work right next to the Wellington Station on the Orange Line, so I'd be taking the T everywhere. I went to Boston Beer Works before the Bruins game last week and that was awesome. Also, would anyone be down for meeting up and getting beers sometime? I have a few friends in the area, but they aren't always around. Also what areas should I avoid? I'm not a very intimidating person as a 5'1 female. I've always felt safe in Boston but I've stayed around the Garden and Fanueil Hall area. 

Thanks guys, and if you have any other tips let me know!"

I am currently a senior in high school looking to become a network engineer. I plan to attend USF for a bachelors in computer networking then get my masters at CSU East Bay. I'm currently taking AP Computer Science where we are learning how to program in java. This summer I am interning at my uncles networking company to build my resume and ""get a feel"" of the the job. 

**Actual Questions**

* Would you say there are sufficient opportunities in the Tampa Bay area to get an internship at a company like IBM or a bank to further my knowledge of computer networking? 

* What certification would you recommend I pursue this school year? I was told cisco certifications are very helpful.

* Is getting a masters degree in computer networking a good idea, or should I settle for a certificate or a bachelors degree?

* Is there a college that you would recommend for a masters degree in computer networking? I currently have a 3.5 GPA, 1870 SAT, and haven't taken the ACT yet.

* About how much can I expect to make a year? I don't like debt and would like to know how fast I will be out of it. "

Problem is, around the time of Spring races, I'm not sure where I'm going to be. I'm going to school in Pittsburgh, so I could sign up for the Pittsburgh half/marathon, but I also might be getting an internship, which would take me elsewhere in the country. 

So, my question is, is it an issue to sign up for races closer to the date? I'm particularly afraid of the Pittsburgh half filling up and then, if I am able to run, not being able to get a spot. Or, if I do end up moving for the summer for an internship, I'm worried about potentially getting a spot in the half/marathon around there, too, if there is one."

1na3r0,2,2013-09-27,"How do I ask this foreign exchange student out to a concert. Direct or Indirect? Also, some other concerns.",Fatalfable,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1na3r0/how_do_i_ask_this_foreign_exchange_student_out_to/,"So here is what happened yesterday. I'm in an internship in the medical field where I work along side an exchange student. She basically invited me for lunch as we finished with our last patient in the morning segment. She can barely speak English so I have to speak in her language which I am pretty fluent in but I still have some issues. We spoke about our last session, analyzed it, spoke about studying in different countries etc. We joked and laughed a bit but she has to go to another section of the hospital in a different part of the city after lunch. As we were walking towards where we split I simply asked for her number, gave her a kiss on the cheek goodbye, then we had a little awkward moment cause in Europe they do the two cheek things and I only kissed one side. Jokes were said, we split up and that was that.

I think this was a little too friendly/professional and would like to end up showing her sexual interest. 

Shes from Barcelona and I'm going on a whim here that she likes electronic music and assume that its popular there considering Ibiza is right around the corner. I want to take her to a venue tomorrow to see a great DJ at Webster Hall. 

Now do I text her and ask her if she wants to go? (And if she likes electronic music) Or should I go along the lines of ""I'm going to Webster Hall tomorrow. Coming?"" Or some variation like that. This would also be my first text to her other than confirming it was me. 

Last concern. I go to A LOT of these concert/raves whatever you wanna call them. I go with friends but usually enjoy splitting up and getting lost into the crowd dancing, jumping, shuffling, offering cigs, whatever. I go mainly for the music and could care less about girls which is what my brother and friends are concerned about. Now, if she ends up coming with me I don't know how I would approach trying to give her attention when where we will be will be about giving the attention to the dj. any ideas? "

1n96e6,29,2013-09-27,Me [25 F] formerly abusive father [51 M] is insisting I work with him and I don't know what to do. Help!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1n96e6/me_25_f_formerly_abusive_father_51_m_is_insisting/,"Growing up, my father was horribly abusive.  Not sexually, but physically and emotionally.  He eventually moved out as I was graduating high school and going into college.  It's safe to say that I really, really don't like him.  

In fact, I've often contemplated moving away so that I would never have to see him again.

I graduated recently and have been trying desperately to find work.  I finally found a job that only pays about $12/hr, but I was just happy to find something in the field (marketing) that I would like to get into.  

On the side, I do an unpaid internship that is also in the marketing field.  The job itself is one that I actually have a pretty good time doing, too.

My father thinks my job is a piece of crap and doesn't pay well for my qualifications (he's not wrong).  He has been asking around at his work to see if there's any position available there and yesterday his boss told him I should apply for a newly available property management specialist position they have.

My dad is now insisting I apply for this job.  The job would pay a *minimum* of $22.60/hr and has great benefits.  But I would be working in the same building as my father and our interactions would go from once every few months to likely every day.

I've suffered from clinical depression for years and battled an eating disorder as a teen because of what he put me through growing up.  He is also the type who would use the fact that he got me this well-paying job as a way of extorting favors or guilt tripping me.  

He refuses to acknowledge that he was ever abusive, even when my mother, brother, and I have all confronted him about it.  Just the notion that I should owe him anything makes my skin crawl.

But I have bills and student loans to pay.  And it wouldn't just be a well-paying job, it would potentially be a career.  Granted, it's not the career I want.  It's not something I actually have any interest in doing at all.

I feel like accepting would be to sell my soul to the devil and resign myself to working a job I hate with a person I loathe.  But the money is/would be amazing.

Should I refuse?  Should I go for it, knowing I'd be miserable?  If I do refuse, how can I do so in such a way as to not provoke his wrath?  I feel so... lost.

**tl;dr**: My formerly abusive father wants me to come work with him and while the job would be a crazy step up in pay for me, I'm afraid I'd lose myself in the process. What should I do?"
1n92g5,2,2013-09-27,I don't know if I can go on anymore.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n92g5/i_dont_know_if_i_can_go_on_anymore/,"I'm 17 and I live in Wisconsin. I've been depressed for years but lately I've been almost constantly contemplating suicide. 

It all started with my my alcoholic mother stabbing me this summer, then calling the cops on me for ""beating her"" (which I didn't), then getting detained by those cops when they found me bleeding. She then lied to my extended family and told them that I was responsible for putting her in jail. Several of my family openly threatened my life if I didn't lie in court and get her out. My father was among them, and he, in an attempt to discredit me, told the court that I was a blatant liar and thief (neither of which is true by any means), and they dismissed her charges when she promised to go to rehab, because ""she isn't the bad guy here"". So now she's coming home. And I'm worried that she's coming for me, as she's indicated in the past.

Also, because of her lying to my family, I don't have anyone to talk to anymore. I don't trust any of my friends enough to tell them this stuff that's going on, and the one friend I trusted enough to talk to about this basically hates me now. I had feelings for her and I tried to act upon them, and it led to the end of our friendship. My sister, who is the only family member who doesn't blame me, has been blowing me off and is now on my mother's side following a ""heartfelt letter"" that also falsely accused me of hurting my mom and putting her in prison. 

I've also feel like no one really wants to be around me. My friends kind of blow me off, I can't ever get a date with a girl, and everyone I meet insults me for being fat.

On top of that, I had a prestigious internship this summer that I was super excited for, but it went south when the workload was far too difficult for me to understand and I couldn't complete the work. I screwed up the chance to set myself up with a summer job in the future, the chance to get a decent letter of recommendation, and ever since then I've felt like I was average, like I'm stupid and I'm not going anywhere in this world. I've been having a hard time motivating myself because of that, and I'm now failing several classes in high school. It's basically killing my chances of going to a decent school, especially my dream school, and that's making me even more depressed.

Football was helping for a while, but I stink at it, I never get playing time, and it's not really helping me feel better about myself or doing anything for me anymore. 

There's even more personal things putting me down on top of this that I don't really want to talk about. But overall, I'm feeling so overwhelmingly depressed that I feel like I'm at the point where I want to end it. "

I had this friend, lets call her ""Jen"", i've known her since kindergarten and after her parents divorced didnt see her for quite a while

Now we reconnected again through mutual friends when i was 16 and she was 14, i was stunned at how pretty she looked and got a massive crush on her, when we were together with friends playing TimeSplitters and stuff, she would always make sure that she got to sit on my lap, which i didnt think anything about, i just figured she found comfort in me

fast forward a year, a mutual friend of Jen and i has kind of trouble in her relationship, she comes over to my place and we fuck, i regret it to this day that i did it, during a random conversation with Jen i tell her what happened, she is mad (rightly so) but forgives me, as our mutual friend has kind of a promecious life

in november of that same year, Jen and i are at her place watching some tvseries, we are pretty close together since it was kinda cold, she doesnt mind me holding her hand, as the night progresses she lays down and i jokingly lay on top of her, we kinda giggle about it and we sit back normally again

Now comes,a few months later, late february, i got off internship a bit early so i asked her if i could come over for a movie, she says yes. When i go there we are kind of fooling around, watching stuff on her laptop, and watching a movie, we are kinda toying around at the time, after a while she lays on top of me and directs my hand at her upper leg, after a while, i shift my hand from her leg, around her middle, on her shirt, under her shirt, and finally on her boob, touching it lightly with my fingers, im kinda sweating at this point ""should i continue, how does she think about this??!"", so i pulled away, didnt do anything for the remainder of the night, realizing now i fucked up a chance of getting her

fast forward to september last year, she gets a boyfriend, alright, that ship has sailed, dont care, will still be best friends,

untill march this year, she kinda became silent towards me not responding to calls or chat messages, about a week after we last had contact, (this is going to sound pretty wierd) my cat get run over by a car, my closest friend of almost 7 years, dead, it teared me up, but thanks to music,games and school, i got over it

Also, over the past few years, my parents periodically have these fights, horrible fight, not so much physically horrible (smashing the door shut is the worst thing), but rather emotionally, screaming awful stuff at one another, berating me for bieng ""just like your father/mother."" belittling me, saying i will never succeed in life, bieng irrationally mad about stuff, not listening to other peoples's opinions, The constant fighting, bitching and general cuntery during these fights in this seemingly perfect marriage makes me doubt my ability to find a girlfriend/soulmate, im not going to attach myself to someone with the possibility of something like that happening, i dont want to put someone through a shitmill like that, i'd rather just piss off and be alone then to inter/disrupt somebodys future, as that 

so with my 2 best friends gone and my parents fighting, im not going to get attached to someone/thing again, its seems like a waste of time effort and money to pour it all on something and it just falls apart, im NOT doing that again
---

**tl;dr**: Parents bitch against eachother, crush/best friend goes to another guy, ignores me from then on, cat dies, not going to attach myself to someone/thing ever again

EDIT: added a paragraph about my parents."

As the title says, I just graduated from TCC with my Associates in Networking and Cyber Security in August. I've been looking for IT jobs like crazy (most of them are up in Seattle) or anything similar, but I'm having trouble landing one. Before going to school for IT, I did a lot of warehouse work so I've been applying for those as well. I've noticed my degree gets me a lot more interviews than before I had one, but my lack of recent warehouse experience hasn't gotten me past the interviews that I get.

I've been applying for IT jobs but the only calls I've been getting in relations to that is from recruiters from job agencies. This isn't a bad thing, but here's the kicker: I have a felony from 2007. When I let employers/recruiters know this, they seem satisfied that it had nothing to do with robbery/theft or anything sexual in nature. Some of them have been gracious enough to let me explain that my wife at the time lied to the cops, to get me out of the house, and said that I beat her up. I was charged with a felony, served 2 months in jail and a year of probation. I realize it's hard for anyone with a felony to get a job, but that's one of the main reasons I went to college: to show people that I'm serious about my life and my passion to do well. 

I serve as the supervisor for my church's A/V department (volunteer/unpaid) and have done this since 2007. I also completed a 2-month internship at a local tech company earlier this year. I am now attending Western Governors University, which is a fully-online school that I will be obtaining my Bachelors in IT from. I'll also be obtaining my CCNA, several MTAs, an MCSA and an MCSE from the WGU program. 

Anyway, does anyone know of ANYTHING local that I can get my foot in the door in? Thanks for your help!



**TL;DR** Recent college graduate in IT with a felony from 2007 needs a job!

1nbr39,5,2013-09-28,[FI] Finances are in decent order but obsessed and unhappy with salary. Afraid I'll make rash decisions.,i_eat_cabbage,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nbr39/fi_finances_are_in_decent_order_but_obsessed_and/,"Hi guys.

My overall financial situation is not a complete catastrophe, as explained in the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m19xq/saving_aggressively_do_i_need_a_budget/), but the one thing I'm very unhappy about is my salary, which is 2000 euros monthly after taxes and mandatory social/pension payments.

The thing is, I'm a grad student in engineering, from the top engineering university in Finland. While I'm grinding away with 2000 eur, I see my friends and classmates have well-paying jobs in industry, finance and consulting. Some of the early adopters already got rich by working for Angry Birds and Clash of Clans very early, or by selling their tech startups to big U.S. players. At the same time I get a constant stream of ""recruiting evening"" invitations via various networks (I don't know if that is a common concept in the US, but basically it consists of inviting 100 or so students, drowning them in vodka and trying to get them to sign up for an internship), which makes it impossible to forget how close that world is.

I love my research project, I'm very good at what I do, and the project has a real chance of being useful to a very large amount of people in the future (but it's probably not going to be commercially viable during the next few decades, possibly not during my lifetime). However, I can't seem to have any control of fact that I'm very very jealous of most of my classmates, knowing that I could very likely do what they are doing and earning what they are earning. This is made even worse by Facebook et al., where people portray an untrue image of how good their life is.

It will take me at least 2, more likely 3 or 4 more years until I can graduate, if ever. There might not be a viable academic career path on my field, so I'm afraid I'll end up like [this dude](https://chronicle.com/blogs/phd/2013/09/19/the-ph-d-industry-gap/) almost did.

I'm having my end-of-year review in around 2 months. The way my mental state is fluctuating nowadays and how unhappy I feel, I'm seriously afraid that in the heat of the moment I will tell my professor that I quit. This would leave him, the project and some of my colleagues and friends in a serious trouble. However, I'm getting to the age where I feel I can't play around any more and need to start making (financially) smart choices about my career.

I am thinking about my salary and my future literally almost every day, and it causes me sleepless nights and a deep and constant feeling of desperation. I keep having fantasies of how much easier my life would be with a better salary, how it would somehow earn me some respect and how I wouldn't have to be ashamed of my job title.

I wrote this piece mainly to clarify my thoughts, but I welcome any comments."
1nbq19,1,2013-09-28,"I'm becoming very depressed and angry. I'm very successful for my age yet no one will hire me. My friends who have less credentials are finding work, yet they aren't even finished with their associate degree.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nbq19/im_becoming_very_depressed_and_angry_im_very/,"I'm 20 years old, as of now I am a junior in college. I'm attending one of the top business schools in the U.S., and is internationally as well. My degree program, information systems is almost number one in faculty productivity. 

I'm currently in the honors program. I transferred here from my previous institution where I got an associate in computer networking. I graduated there with high honors. I went on to obtain a Cisco certification (CCNA). 

Now I can't find part time work anywhere. I really want to start getting experience in the field so I can start working toward my future aspirations. My certification expires in three years before I have to renew it, so I need to get my foot in the door before college is over. I plan on working full time right when I finish my degree and then I want to pursue my masters. But If I can't find entry level work, it'll put my education on hold.

The other day, I got a call about an internship I applied. It was for students only, and ones that are pursuing a related bachelor program. I was asked about my expected graduation date and then the guy on the phone forwarded my resume to his boss. I get an email the next day saying the 'position has been filled'. 

Seriously? Not even an interview? I really doubt many were going to be more qualified than me for this internship. Computer networking doesn't have a bachelor of science degree. So many people my age have absolutely no experience in it, nor have a certification proving they can troubleshoot/manage/maintain medium-large sized networks. It's not easy to get either. I took 4 courses, 5 credit hours each (Cisco Networking Academy), and then studied for about 5 hours every night for a month and a half to pass my exam.

I really am sick of all of this. I have worked so hard the past two years yet nothing has come out of it.


TL;DR I'm a very hardworking individual with a good background who can't find experience, yet those who are much less qualified are finding work.

1nbmkw,1,2013-09-28,Less social + more anxious since starting nofap a year ago.. Self-esteem demolished after every relapse. Anyone else?,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1nbmkw/less_social_more_anxious_since_starting_nofap_a/,"So I started nofap a year ago, but if anything my life has gotten shittier.  I'm much harder on myself now then I was then, which is a good thing in some respect I suppose. Being hard on myself is becoming part of the problem though - it's destroying any self esteem I had for myself before starting this journey. Hopefully its just ""brining me down to earth"" and re-normalizing my expectations of who I am and what I can accomplish, chipping away at my ego until I cant just live life for the sake of living.

I've gotten pretty cut and put on a good 10 pounds of muscle. Realized my grades were shit (3rd year of college now) and that I needed to get my GPA up if I wanted to secure a good internship this summer. And I've become more diligent with my responsibilities and striving to be a better, less egotistical person.

But I feel like this quest has consumed me.  Relapses are becoming more and more depressing.  I've started crying every time I fail now, I learn a lot each time I do, but its always a ""wow I'm wasting my college experience, not living up to what I believe I'm capable of, I will always be suffering"" kind of experience afterwards.

It might be a coincidence, but I'm much more self conscious now then I was before starting this.  Social anxiety has been a struggle for me since I was teased for being gay in high school (I'm straight, but I always obsess about my outwards appearance/behavior and how masculine I'm coming off since then.) I feel like I've become much more ""square-ish,"" for lack of a better word, over the past few months.  I don't know if this is my ""ideal self"" but I feel much more pious and serious - almost inappropriately so when it comes to ""hanging out"" with friends.

Probably the most positive aspect is that this whole ""self control"" quest has made me much more introspective about who I am as a person and the darkness inside of me.  I've been reading into a lot of philosophy, Buddhism specifically, and trying to strive for a sort of subjective perfection of what I consider to be the ideal Self.

I guess that's why most of us are here.

If anything nofap is becoming an artificial crutch for facing my real problems.  I expect things to get better solely from abstaining from fapping. 

If anything the real challenge, ""ultimate hard mode,"" would be returning to fapping, and dealing with whatever slight increase in anxiety is associated with that + whatever demons you have in real life. In other words, having everything be on me - no bullshit counter to fall back on to reassure myself.  Plenty of other guys do it and pull the hottest girls every night - and they're killing life.  If anything the fact that I'm doing nofap is just reinforcing the idea that I'm inferior to other guys that do it and can still ""win at life"" so to speak.

Anyone with a similar experience? The only hope I have now is that I can't get much more depressed/anxious from here. I feel like soon I will hit a point where everything will start being signs of improvement - namely because ANYTHING positive would be an improvement at this point. Guess this is what is meant by ""dark night of the soul"" before becoming closer to God/enlightenment etc.


tl;dr: Been a year since I started this.  Average streak ~20 days, maxed at 55 this past summer. More anxious and depressed than ever - only two years of college left and I'm close to saying ""fuck it"" and adopting a more hedonistic outlook on life. If anything the fact that I'm doing **nofap is just reinforcing the idea that I'm inferior.**

1nb6kf,2,2013-09-28,"I really, really, REALLY hate my father.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nb6kf/i_really_really_really_hate_my_father/,"I always feel like an idiot complaining or telling anybody about my situation because so many people have it SO much worse, but I just really need to get some shit out. I'm afraid of putting too much detail because I really don't want anybody I know to find this.

Since I was born my father has been incredibly absent in addition to being a gigantic asshole. He's always been INCREDIBLY selfish. He literally cannot think of anybody but himself. He put my mom into crazy amounts of debt by buying computer things and then left her when I was in elementary school. He got remarried to the trashy, classless bitch who is now his wife only a couple years later... she was already trying to steal him from my mom when they were still married. Despite all this, he surprised me occasionally growing up by showing that he still had some amount of good or kindness left inside of him. He helped support me and helped put me through school.

His wife has ALWAYS been jealous of me. He's told me this himself. Despite a history of depression and anorexia (my dad pinched my fat on my body constantly when I was like 11 and told me I was getting fat) I can admit now that I am incredibly intelligent, caring, and pretty. She is the opposite of all these things. She's also an alcoholic. Shit hit the fan when I was over at his house one day and she began insulting my mother (while drunk). It ended up with her trying to attack me and my (now) husband. My dad had to hold her back and tackle her to the ground. She ended up laying on the ground with her shirt around her neck, with my dad apologizing as we ran out of his house. That is the night when any remaining good in my father disappeared. The next day I try to talk to my father. I'm hoping maybe he FINALLY realizes how awful she is and is going to leave her (he doesn't love her, he's miserable in his life, everybody knows this). Nope. He tells me she passed out and he called an ambulance and it's not her fault she attacked us because she's ""sick."" He continually defends her and her behavior toward us. After this event I couldn't sleep for like 3 months. The event just kept replaying in my head over and over and over.

Despite this, I tried to continue to have a relationship with my father. He's always said he's wanted a relationship with me. I knew deep down that he loved me, he's just completely clueless and selfish. I graduated college and got an amazingly prestigious (unpaid) internship. Everybody I knew was congratulating me, excited for me, etc. I told him and he immediately just said ""No, you need to get a job now."" and that is the last thing he said to me. No congratulations, no happiness for me. He was originally going to help my mother support me until I found a paying job. He immediately emails my mother and tells her he's cutting me off. I tried to explain to him that this amazing internship would allow me to find a job more quickly than if I were just looking for something based off my current experience. He seems to think finding a job post-college is as easy as wanting one. I emailed him telling him how much it hurt that he wasn't proud of me, how I didn't care about the money but at least wanted him to be happy for me. No response. He continues to be an asshole to my mother, claiming he just ""can't afford"" to support me anymore. He has a very good, very well paying job. I finally sent him an email telling him he's a selfish dick head if his money is more important to him than a relationship with his daughter. The next day he posts pictures of his extravagant vacation on Facebook.. so he can't support his daughter through an internship but has money for crazy vacations, eating out every night, and going on shopping sprees every month? I decided to cut him off completely.

There's a lot more to it, but I don't want to give out more details. I can't stop thinking about the whole situation. I feel incredibly stupid because I constantly have bad dreams about him and his wife, the time she tried to attack me, him just being a dick to me, etc. I guess I don't really need advice... just to know this is all out somewhere. Thank you for listening."

**91,511** Enthusiasts for **5 years!**

/r/cars is a subreddit about cars, unsurprisingly. 

When I first thought about /r/cars, I was expecting a subreddit full of [pictures of cool looking cars that I will never have](http://imgur.com/a/qbRkJ). I was pleasantly surprised (and a little intimidated, honestly) with the content I saw. While I definitely saw ""pictures of cool cars which I will never have""™, I also saw people asking for advice on what to fix up and what to buy, as well as people sharing experiences and moments with each other.

/r/cars has to have one of the coolest communities I've ever seen. Strangers bonding over 2 ton hunks of metal that have a machine that makes explosions inside them, *and look really good doing it*.

/r/cars is great for everyone. With a community ranging from your average Joe who likes to see souped up rides, to hardcore racing enthusiasts, it's no wonder the subreddit is a favorite of many. Personally, I sometimes can't go near /r/cars out of jealousy, and the knowledge that I will never own such magnificent feats of engineering.

I am the type of guy who just likes to look at cars. [This kind of stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1n9u6u/does_modifying_intake_or_exhaust_increase_power/) is not what I'm about.

    Title: Does modifying intake or exhaust increase power on modern cars that use a torque demand based engine management system?

    Words I understood: *cars*

So if any of you gearheads want to explain to me what the heck that all means, please please do.


**Now...all this talk of cars makes me wonder, what kind of car do you own, SRotD?**

^^Subaru ^^Master ^^Race

--------

Here is what the moderators of /r/cars had to say:

--------

&gt;##1. Tell me about yourself 

&gt;&gt; **/u/mikasaur**: Mikasaur, reddit user for 4 years, 10 months. Came here after I got a bit tired of digg.

&gt;&gt; **/u/verdegrrl**: I'm a gearhead from my first memories. Have worked in the auto industry for many years and have been part of internet mailing lists and forums since the early days.

&gt;##2. How did you find /r/cars?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur:** I don't really remember. I've always been interested in cars so /r/cars was one of the first subreddits I probably subscribed to. It had ~12k subscribers or so back then. If even.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl:** Trolling for a client.

&gt;##3. What is your favorite post?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur:** My favorite post? I probably don't have one. I have a favorite type of post. I like posts that are about industry news. I love finding out about a new model or new technology. It's even better when there's good discussion in the comments.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl:** There are so many great posts. It's impossible to mention a specific one. But I like posts that give insights into how and why certain engineering choices have been made.

&gt;##4. What car(s) do you own?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur** I own a 1999 BMW M3 Convertible.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl**  Do I have to list them all? A gaggle of V6 Alfa Romeos - both rwd and fwd. Some Ferraris, a Maserati, an Audi S4, VW R32, and random other stuff. And yes, we work on most of them.

&gt;##5. What is your IRL connection to cars?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur**  IRL I'm a member of the BMW Car Club of America. I try to participate in as many autocrosses as I can throughout the season, as well as track days and driving tours. I'm trying to get into LeMons racing as well and help out a local team on occasion.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl** We're long time members of the Alfa Club of Southern California. They hold track events and a very affordable driving school. Wonderful people. We also do private track days with various small groups (basically folks who keep their egos in check and are just there to have fun).

&gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur** Come check out /r/cars. It's a community that has grown a TON in the past several years. That growth has come with some challenges but we've kept it an entertaining, informative, and civil place.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl** /r/cars has a great blend of experienced car experts and new drivers. The challenge is to not stifle input while encouraging a wide range of expression.

So come and check it out :)

1nabp4,0,2013-09-27,"[FR] + Question on how to move forward on an HB8 I met at a bar, who happens to work at the same advertising agency as me.",[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1nabp4/fr_question_on_how_to_move_forward_on_an_hb8_i/,"I'm a creative intern at one of the best advertising agencies in my city. One day I had nothing to do and was directed to help create some concepts for an employee birthday post that would go on Facebook in the next few days.

I was given the employee's name. She was an HB8 with a nerdy side. Big Star Wars and Harry Potter fan which to me made her even hotter (I have a thing for unconventional women). Surprisingly youthful (everyone at this agency is 30+). I created an awesome concept and it was a hit with her and everyone who saw the post. The agency's big enough that I never see her in person, never had, and no one cares enough to tell someone ""yea the intern thought of that, go thank him."" But whatever, I just thought she was cute and was done with it. 

Until last night.

There was a networking event by my city's advertising organization for young professionals being held at a local bar. I attended. Surprisingly, so did she. I was working the room pretty damn well, mainly networking with important job prospects and what not. Even won a raffle for a free dinner at any restaurant in town, $100 max (possible date idea if my advances succeed).

Initially, I didn't think much of seeing her as I had bigger fish to fry (networking wise). Plus it looked like she was with some other dude. The bar had cleared out and I was still there, having drinks at the bar with one of the main speakers of the event, whom I had just met. I looked up, and there she was, also at the bar, with that same dude and one more. 

She was in the middle of them, ass sticking out as she leaned against the bar. The event speaker I was drinking with looked over and made that ""DAYUM"" face. Her body language suggested she wasn't romantically involved with either dude she was with. I kept chatting with the speaker for networking purposes (important guy in my field), another dude by the bar was drawn into our convo, and before I knew it I had a set of two men in front of me, with HB8 in my direct view. 

I look over and made direct, extremely intimate, eye contact with HB8. In fact, she was the one looking at me. As her friend was talking to her she was looking straight past him into my eyes. Having just got out of a long term relationship, I'm still just getting back out there. But I'm seasoned enough to know in these situations, being the one to break eye contact is out of the question. I stared firmly back until she broke eye contact, in the most coy and flirty way I've seen a girl do a long time.

I knew I had to go for it. My challenge was how to excuse myself from the speaker in front of me, without potentially burning that bridge. It wasn't as if she was alone. I knew I would have to open the entire set, and it would look kind of fucked up if I left the speaker for another group. Also, I knew I didn't want to bring the speaker with me to open the set. He's a good looking guy, also charismatic, and quite the talker. I didn't want him cockblocking me without even knowing he was doing so.

Next thing I know, ""I need a smoke break."" I said cool, I'm gonna hang around maybe try and talk to that girl. He walked off. And I went for it. I opened the set calmly, smile on my face, in more of a networking mode than anything else. One of the guys immediately walked off. The other, the guy she was with all night, remained. 

I looked her straight in her eyes and said, firmly:

Me: ""Is your name Jane?""


Her: Makes the creeped out face. Just as I wanted. ""Um, Yea."" Chuckles.


Me: ""I feel like I know you."" Waited for her reaction (I love fucking with people idk initially, especially women.)


Her: ""How do you know my name?"" Smiling.


Me: I laugh. ""I'm an intern at (advertising agency). Remember that awesome Star Wars themed birthday photo of you? My idea.""


Her: ""hahaha, are you serious? That was epic."" 


Me: ""Yea, I feel like I know you now since then. haha.  I saw you, wasn't sure if it was you. Had to come by and find out. And finally meet you in person.""

Small talk continued. Turns out, even though she's an employee and I'm an intern in his last semester of school, I'm a year older than her. The speaker left, and shook my hand in approval of my pursuit. Full-force into this set. It was going well, and yet not as well as I like. I'm a control freak, I wanted her all over me by now. Her guy friend was basically quiet for the next 10-15 minutes as we chatted. I was asking the questions, pausing to see if she'd ask any back (IOI me please). Not much luck. And I figured it was because of her friend. So I brought him into the mix. Shifted the convo from her to him. He was only happy to oblige. Turns out they went to middle school together back home. And decided to meet up. Not sure if there's some backstory there between them. But after bringing him into the convo, she became more engaged.

You're probably wondering why I remained in the set with such weak IOIS? Well, beyond eye contact, she would play with her necklace when engaging me, and remember she's unconventional, the type to be more self-aware, so I didn't expect her to be too flirty upfront. But still, there was one other huge indicator. Something she said. 

Me talking to her guy friend: ""Yea, I don't normally go up to people randomly like this. I'm more of an intimate relationships kind of guy. I like to have good positive people in my life and enjoy my time with them. (I said this because I haven't been out in the field in a while and needed a fucking excuse for myself, also, I've seen this thought work on a lot of weird-centric girls. So I was adjusting for her. Or so I tell myself.) 

Guy Friend: ""You did pretty well with us. So you're telling me if this wasn't a networking event and you saw her here alone, you wouldn't approach her?""

I was questioning his angle on this question. Was he trying to make me show my cards, as if to nudge her into thinking I was just there to hit on her?

Me: ""Honestly, probably not. But I'm working on that sort of thing.""


Guy Friend: ""She's really good at it, should've seen her working the room tonight."" 


Her: ""It's kind of in my job description, I have to go up to people. I went up to a ton of people I didn't know tonight.""


Me: ""You didn't come up to me!""


Her: ""I didn't seeeee you!""


Me: ""Oh so now I'm unnoticable?""


Her: Laughs hysterically, Sarcastically, rolling here eyes, says, ""Maybe I saw you and was waiting for you to come up to me."" (obviously referring to our prior staring contest)


Boom.

Before I could come back on that the other guy who had left originally interrupted with his return. Fuck. Adding more penis to the set. 

I chatted a bit longer, and felt I needed to exit the set before they decided to leave before me. So I asked for the guy friend's card. But I didn't want to ask for her number. I didn't know the right way to do that in this dynamic, with all the factors involved. So I asked for her card, as well. Got it. Left.

Her card has only her work info from the agency on it. Work phone number, extension and email. Failure? Maybe-- depends on your definition.

Now my question is, how do I move forward? I was thinking I'd email her Monday out of the blue and say something like ""You should have lunch with the intern today. Heard he's a solid guy."" And wait to see her reply? Should I just call her extension from mine and say that? Should I just call her extension and strike up random conversation, to add to the mystic of the situation? Should I actually go to her department and say hi?! I really want this one, bad. 

Help me out seddit. Give me a solid game plan. Help me become a true Mad Man.

1neg3o,3,2013-09-29,Oddly vivid dream,commonCentss,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1neg3o/oddly_vivid_dream/,"Last night I had the oddest nightmare.  It was so vivid that it has been burned into my mind since I awoke.  It started out as being a passenger on a small airplane possibly a Cessna.  There were only two people on this flight, the pilot and I.  While on this flight I took a nap, only to wake up to see that the pilot was gone.  When I realized the pilot was gone I began to freak.  In the last couple of seconds I remember seeing the plane flying into an overpass.  At the moment when the plane struck the concrete pylons and the plane continued on, the plane was virtually indestructible.

The month of September has been a real shitty one for me.  I’ve been stressed about school, particularly in my Accounting class.  I’ve been struggling to keep up with work, and just got let go yesterday night after the shift was over.  On the bright side, I have recently asked for an internship in IT working with the company that my father is currently with.  This internship should be a sure bet, but I have been nervous about it lately.  What do you think reddit?

1neea7,26,2013-09-29,I would like for someone who's pro-Obamacare to come in here and answer a few questions I have.,stiffy2005,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1neea7/i_would_like_for_someone_whos_proobamacare_to/,"Hello, /r/libertarian. Thank you for being one of the few places that won’t downvote this post into oblivion. I am hoping that a proponent of Obamacare can honestly answer the questions I’ve come up with. Perhaps by doing so, libertarians can gain more insight into the rationale behind this law. 

My philosophy: My flair says pragmatist, which about sums it up. Unlike some people of libertarian or right-wing persuasion, I don’t consider myself to be down-the-line anti-government. I believe that policies should be analyzed one-by-one and the best course of action should be pursued. This does not put me at immediate odds with Democrats or even Obamacare. I do identify as a libertarian, though, since I believe that more often than not, one-by-one policy analyses lead to the conclusion that a more hands-off approach to whatever policy in question is the best way to go. 

With that said, can someone please answer the questions found below and explain how Obamacare will benefit myself or society as a whole? 

I’m a graduate student, 26 years old, married, no children. I quit my job (and by extension lost my group health insurance coverage) last year to go back to school, and upon doing so, purchased an individual insurance policy for $54 per month. The rates have since gone to $86 per month because I went into a higher age bracket. I am healthy and have no recurring need for medical care. I haven’t been to a doctor for at least three years. The only reason I have insurance at all is in the off chance that I get cancer or some other horrible disease, my assets will be protected. My plan has a $3,500 deductible with no up-front benefits, which means that I have to pay for everything until I reach $3,500 within a calendar year. I prefer it this way, since this makes the plan affordable and covers me for what I’m concerned about: A catastrophic illness. 

My insurance company just told me that I cannot keep this plan. I will have to switch to something that offers “more benefits.” The most affordable plan they offer will be $188 per month. 

I don’t want more benefits.  **Why am I being forced to purchase something with more benefits that will cost me more and make me worse off?** 

I can’t think of any other consumer product where this is in line with mainstream American thought, irrespective of political philosophy. We all agree that products at different price points and levels of quality make sense. A couple dining out can spend $10 on a meal, $500, or anywhere in between. As Americans, we like and want these choices. Right? 

I have read a lot of news stories that said many young people will be better off because they will get better coverage while paying less out of pocket because of the subsidies. What young people are we talking about here? I went to a subsidy calculator and put in $40,000 as an estimate of income for my wife and I. This was my guess as to how much we will earn this year working part-time jobs and internships. We are not eligible for subsidies. 

According to the calculator at the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, the $40,000 we will make as students is 258% of the poverty line. We are not eligible for a subsidy on the health insurance I’m going to need to buy. **Are people who only earn $20,000 per year really so well off that they should be forced to pay for all of these “better benefits” under Obamacare? Benefits that they will never use?**

At this point, I have to decide if I want to buy a plan with “more benefits,” that I don’t want, or go without coverage. I’ve been told that if I go without insurance, it’s OK since insurance companies can no longer “discriminate” against me for having pre-existing conditions and that the tax penalty is only $95 or 1% of my income.

OK, but what if I get in a traumatic car wreck? The ambulance comes to pick me up, I’m barely conscious, and I incur $30,000 in hospital bills as I’m stitched back up and my broken bones are mended. This is the health event I’m most worried about. 

My knowledge of insurance is that you can’t enroll in coverage until the start of the next month. My $30,000 hospital bill happened when I didn’t have coverage. Insurance companies can’t turn me away for my pre-existing conditions, but I don’t think they have to pay for medical expenses that were incurred before you ever enrolled do they?

I guess if I got cancer or some other disease, I would have time to get a policy in place before I needed the medical treatment. But that’s not very likely at my age, is it? I’m more likely to get into a traumatic car accident.

So we’re back to square one. I have to take this risk, or have less money for other things, such as spending on consumer goods at a time when our economy desperately needs it.  

Supposedly Obamacare provides for exchanges, where I can shop for policies side-by-side, comparing benefits and premiums. I was doing this for years through a website called eHealthInsurance.com. **What’s wrong with the solution the free-market has already provided?**

People under 65 with pre-existing conditions had lots of options under the old system, although now they have one more. Their choices before were group coverage, Medicaid for the poor, or “High-risk Insurance” offered by many states. The problem with the old system was that high risk plans were really expensive. As with many things in life, people with individual incomes of $30,000 - $100,000 really had it the worst, since they weren’t eligible for Medicaid, but the expensive high-risk insurance really took up a lot of their income. Now these people can enroll in individual health insurance policies without being denied, but the plans are more expensive since they’re required to have more benefits. 

**Why has Obamacare left a hole in the only group that really needed help?** I’m talking about sick people under 65 in the individual income range of $30-100K who don’t have group coverage. 

Now that we’re thinking about it, were there really so many people in that income range that didn’t have access to an employer plan? Self-employed, business owners, and the like? It seems like when you really think about the holes in our old system, you find a group of people who can’t get coverage to be a really tiny minority. **Shouldn’t this have been solved with a small reform instead of a massive overhaul of our entire system? **

But there was a fundamental flaw with our entire system, wasn’t there? Was that really insurance companies turning away sick people who tried to buy individual policies? I don’t think it was, since people over 65 (the people who have the most health problems) already had access to a fully governmental health care system called Medicare, people under 65 who were sick and poor had Medicaid, and all of the other sick people had group coverage or high-risk coverage. So that’s not the problem, is it? 

**Isn’t the problem costs?** Providers of health care are charging a lot of money. **Why doesn’t Obamacare focus on reforming increasing costs instead of “increasing access”?**

Never mind, I think I know: Slowing the growth of health care costs isn’t as sensational and doesn’t feel as good, does it? 

To conclude, we’ve looked at whether or not there was really that big of a hole when it came to “access” to health insurance. A lot of critics of the access argument pointed out that a lot of the people who didn’t have coverage were either eligible and didn’t bother to enroll, or were just young idiots who didn’t care. I still haven’t seen anything compelling that leads me to believe otherwise. 

So who is Obamacare helping? It hasn’t helped me. I’m going to be much worse off next year. I’ll need to either take my chances and go without, or pay about $100 more per month for insurance. But I’m willing to make a sacrifice like this if more people benefit. But I’m not seeing it. It seems like I’m worse off and nobody I can think of is better off. **So who’s better off?** "

1nduo7,568,2013-09-29,What happened with Hamber you ask?,[deleted],fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1nduo7/what_happened_with_hamber_you_ask/,"What’s up you little piggies? So, a few of you landwhales have been asking what happened with Hamber (link to the removed story in comments)…oh, you want to know, do ya? I guess I’ve got some time before I go off to brunch to cure this hangover. Lick your lips, cause shit’s about to get salty.


So when we left off, Hamber was running out of the office we shared and I was left there with a mouth full of carrots trying not to laugh.  The trying part didn’t really work out too well, and some orange bits came flying out.  Fuck it, people come in every night to clean these offices, so those little bits are just job security in my opinion.  So after I’m done chewing and shit, I get back to work. 15 minutes later, my phone rings.


“This is Paul_el.”


“Hey, Paul, this is HR Dude.  Can you come down to my office?”


“Yeah man, no doubt.  I’ll be there in a couple of minutes.”


As I’m walking down the hallway to go see HR Dude, my mind starts racing about how I’m going to defend myself.  I’ve known this office rhino for less than 24 hours, and I’m already assuming she’s going to say I accosted her with carrots or some stupid shit like that.  Fuck her. Then I have one of those eureka moments.  I got it!


“Have a seat, Paul.  So I guess you already know what this is about.”


“Not really.”


“When you left my office before, did you run to the fridge, get some carrots and hummus and shove them into your mouth while looking at Hamber?”


“No.”


“So you didn’t eat any carrots in front of Hamber?”


I’m in HR defending my healthy eating habits.  This is my life.


“No, that parts true, but there was no hummus on any of ‘em.”


HR Dude sighs.  “So how are we going to handle this?”


“I’m not sure what you mean.”


“Well you two obviously can’t work near each other.”


“I don’t think that’s true. I can work with anyone.  It’s just a matter of sticking to work related business when necessary.” 


“Well I appreciate hearing that, but Paul, you and I both know this won’t be our last meeting if you stay in that office.”


“I understand where you’re coming from HR Dude, but you realize the only reason I’m here in the first place is because I choose to eat healthy, right?”


HR Dude tries to hold back a smile.  “Listen Paul, I know this is funny to you, but it’s a pain in the ass to me.”


“I totally get that, HR Dude, but honestly, if I went out and bought McNuggets, we both know I wouldn’t be sitting here.”


“So what are we going to do?”


“Start eating unhealthy?”


HR Dude’s smile comes out. “Paul, seriously.”


“I’m being serious! What do you want me to say here, man?! Help me help you!”


The guy’s chuckling. “Jesus…”


I look over at the clock on his wall.  “Listen HR Dude, I don’t mean to cut this short, but I have a conference call in 15 minutes with (Client) regarding the project I was actually hired for.  This is some pretty important stuff and I’d like to review my notes before jumping in on the call.”


“Okay man. Get outta here.”


“Okay, let me know how you want to proceed with this and I’ll accommodate anyway I can.  But seriously, if I have to start eating fast food, I’m gonna break out.”


“GO!”  We’re both smiling as I leave the office and my awesome defense didn’t even need to be brought out. 
I get back to my office and Hamber’s sitting at her desk.  I walk ~~past~~ around her and get to mine and take out my notes.  

“Why’d yuh do that?”


I don’t even look up. “What?”


“Eat those carruts like that in frunt uh meh.”


“Listen, Hamber, I’ve got an important call with (Client) in like 10 minutes, I don’t have time for this right now.  When I’m done, I’d be than happy to discuss my healthy eating habits with you. Now please…”


The coming shit storm would be justified if I threw a piece of shit at her, spit on her, or even took away her candy bar.  If anyone would have walked past that minute, they wouldn’t know what the fuck just happened.  “HAY! WUR TALKIN ABUT IT NAW!”


I still don’t look up.  “I don’t know if you heard me or not, but I have a call I need to get ready for. I’m at work and I am working. Now please control yourself.”


Oh no. Ohhhh no.  I should’ve known better than tell a woman of this stature to calm  down.  “WHUT DID YA SAY!?!?!”


She proceeds to get up, waddle over to my desk, rip my notes off, and throw them to the floor. Not drop, throw. Oh bitch. You just don’t know when to stop.  “Pick those up right now.”


“NAW! YUH OWE ME A APOLUHGEE, ASSHOLE!!”


“No I don’t, but what you need to do is pick those up right now and I need to prepare.”


“SAY YUH SORRY!”


“You are embarrassing yourself, look at the way you’re behaving.  You’ve got a better chance of making a slam dunk in the NBA finals than getting an apology out of me.” I see where this is going, so I relent; I pick up my notes and try to get back to studying, even with this she-beast breathing her hot fumes down my back.  See, work is work and it’s one of the only things I take seriously.  I’m good at what I do, and this is an awesome project to be working on and it’s one of those assignments that could result in some ridiculous opportunities if I impress the right people.  This bitch just won’t let it go though.


“NUH APOLUHGIZE!”


I raise my voice for the first time with this urban manatee. “HAMBER! YOU NEED TO LET ME WORK! IF NOT FOR ME, THAN FOR THE GOOD OF THIS AGENCY.  I WAS BROUGHT IN SPECIALY BECAUSE I HAVE A HISTORY AND REPORE WITH THIS CLIENT AND THEY ARE USED TO GETTING GOOD WORK FROM ME. YOU WILL NOT COMPROMISE MY WORK OR MY REPUTATION.”  No one has spoken to her like that since the first time her mom said she couldn’t have candy with dinner, except unlike mommy, I don’t back down when it counts.  She goes back to her desk and I go back to studying, but I can’t concentrate now. It’s rare I raise my voice and get into heated confrontations.  If you’ve been reading my posts, you know I just don’t give a shit but I sure as hell don’t take shit either.  For the most part, I’m laid back.  I don’t argue, I just know how to put people in their place.  


It’s at the point where I’m so flustered I’m actually nervous getting in on this call.  Fuck you fatty. My mind is all over the place.  My alarm is going off, time to dial in on the conference line. Fuck. 


The call lasts about 45 minutes and the last words I heard were “Awesome ideas, Paul, we can’t wait to see what you and the graphic designers mock up.”  Phew. Your boy came through.  I remember actually letting out a sigh of relief when I hung up the phone. 


Not a second later. “Yuh ready tuh apoluhgize?”


“Oh, did you win us the championship with that dunk?”


She was staring at me the entire time while I was on that call.  Not taking notes. (Not that she would need to, she’s not working on the same account. Thank Christ.) Not working. Not even snacking.  Not. Even. Snacking.


“Yuh owe muh an apoluhgee.”


I finally look at her “No I don’t. I’ve been here for less than two full days and I’ve done nothing that warrants an apology. Listen, it’s obvious healthy eating habits offend you, and for that, I’m sorry, because I think that’s sad, but like I said Hamber, you will not get an apology out of me.  However, you definitely owe me one, but unlike you, I’m not naïve enough to think I’m actually going to get one, and I can get past that.  So I’m getting back to work.  You know, the reason why I’m here.”


“Yuhr an asshole.” 


“So I’ve heard.”


“Say yuhr sorry.”


Whoa. “Listen, Hamber, you don’t tell me what to do. Ever. You will not dictate what I say or what I do. You have no authority over me at this agency. You are not my boss or my supervisor, just another coworker.  Now, why don’t you get back to work, you know, what you’re here to do, too.”


At that, she gets up and walks out.  It’s not lunchtime.  Wonder where she’s going? A few minutes later my phone rings. “I’m on my way.”


This is my second day at this agency and I’ve been in the HR Office 3 times.  I’ve gotta be some fucking record breaker. I walk in, see Hamber sitting in a chair and look over at HR Dude.  He looks pissed.  I gotta take this seriously.  


Yeah fucking right.


“How are we going to resolve this?”


“He needs tuh apologize.” They both look at me.


“I told you already, Hamber, I’ve done nothing that warrants an apology.”


“Nuh, you said  uh’ve got a betta chance making a slam dunk in the NBA finals then getting an apology from you.”


“Well I said that too, but again, I also said I’ve done nothing that warrants an apology.”


She looks at HR Dude.  “SEE!!! FAT SHAMING! HE DOESN’T LIKE ME BECAUSE UHM FAT!!!”


God, to hear a fat person actually use the words “fat shaming”…it was magic.


“Fat shaming? I simply said that because she’s a woman and women don’t play in the NBA, if I said WNBA, that’d be a different story. You on the other hand definitely owe me an apology.”


HR Dude looks puzzled.  Hamber looks like she realized she didn’t think shit through.  


“What do you mean, Paul?”


“Well, you know that after I left here I went to study my notes for that (Client) call.  She wouldn’t let me.  She was demanding I apologize and when I wouldn’t she walked over to my desk, picked up my notes, and then threw them to the ground while still demanding I say sorry.”


HR Dude’s eyes widen. He looks at her. “Explain.”


“But..he..no, he owes me an apolugee!!”


“Oh, I forgot to mention she called me an asshole, too.”


“Is all this true?”


“NUH-UH!! He’s lying!!”


HR Dude’s attention focuses to me and looks like he wants an answer.  “Listen, HR Dude, as far as I’m concerned, she’s lost all credibility when she said I had hummus on my carrots this morning when there clearly wasn’t any.  She simply can’t get her facts straight.”


“STUHP IT!”


“Okay, you two can’t work in the same office anymore. I know what I’m going to do.” 


Now, the resulting outcome of this has cemented HR Dude a spot in my heart forever.  This dude could call me up at 5am on a Sunday morning looking for bail and I’d have him.  This dude is the shit. 


“Paul, we have a private office that we were saving for a position we’re looking to fill.  Based on your qualifications and your previous work, it’s obvious you can fill that role as well and we’ll just disperse that work among you and the other guys, it’s nothing crazy. The office is yours.”  I almost started jerking off when he said that. 


“WHUT?!?!? TIM’S OLD OFFICE!?!?!? I SHUD GET THAT!!!  HE’S THA JERK!”


“You see what I’ve been dealing with?”


“No, it’s Paul’s. And he’s right, you do owe him and apology. You compromised a very important phone call with a new client.  I’m shocked that you could be so petty. Plus this childish name calling, it’s all unnecessary.” Fuck yeah HR Dude.  I’m buying you a beer.  


I look over at her and smile.  My mouth starts watering. Let me here it bitch.  Tell daddy you’re sorry.


She looks down in defeat.  She knows she’s been beaten. I run this motherfucker.


“Uhm sorry.”  


Everything inside me was screaming “TELL HER TO SPEAK UP! TELL HER YOU COULDN’T HEAR HER!!! DO IT YOU FUCKING PUSSY!! OWN HER!!!!” but I’m sorry to say, I let the lying dog lie.   All I said was “Thank you.”  It makes me sick just thinking about it.  I’m fucking worthless.


“But what about that work you said you’ll be dispersing? The last thing I want to do is make more work for other people. That’s not what I’m about.”


“Don’t worry about it, Paul, you guys are actually already handling it.  That position has been vacant for a couple of months now. Bringing you on lightened the load for everyone and it’s been going well.”  Looks like my freelance gig just got upgraded to a fulltime spot while still on a freelancer’s pay scale. God damn right healthy eating habits pay off.


At that, HR Dude called over his intern and dismissed me.  He told him to show me my new office.  That’s right, my new office. We walk back to that hovel I had to share with Hamber and collect my things.  Then we go to my new office.  My. New. Office.  God damn that sounds hot.


Holy. Fuck.  This shit is insane. Surround sound. 27” computer screen. Projector. All the presentation planning tools an ad guy could ever want. Enough gadgets to make a tech guys pants tight.  Mine. All mine.  A couple of guys I had lunch with the day before are looking confused, so they come in.  I explain what happened.  Fist bumps were shared.  Lunch that day was on me.


The best part? Hamber has to walk past my new office every time she goes to the bathroom or kitchen.  I heard her request to bring in a mini fridge into her office was denied on Thursday.  


You’re god damn right I keep my door open.

1ndsjr,6,2013-09-29,Me [24F] with my long distance boyfriend [25 M] of almost 2 years (in November) finally discussing an end date to our Canada-US situation. Can't meet in the middle.,danslacorbeille,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ndsjr/me_24f_with_my_long_distance_boyfriend_25_m_of/,"The other day, my boyfriend and I re-entered the discussion about when we mgiht be able to see an end date to all this. He will be 26 in November, I will be 25 in January. We met while I was in his country for 3 months, became friends, and started dating before I moved home. We continued our relationship. Now here we are. I have graduated university (December 2012), and he is working a full-time paid internship (contract up in March 2014), and I am doing temporary work in my hometown.

Basically I feel like we are at a bit of an impasse. He is not ready to get married (or talk about it, apparently), though he does see himself getting married to me one day. The issue is, our options for me moving to him are slim without marriage. We have discussed 4 options vaguely. He is dead-set on me going to school there, thoguh. I already have a BA.

----------------

2. My boyfriend wants me to go to school there. The problem is, it is 10k for tuition a year (for a diploma), and you have to have 10k of disposable income on top of tuition to be considered for a Student Visa.

2. I move there and don't work while we live together for 1 year to get common-law status. Part of me says, ""Well, it's just a year. If it's meant to be, it will work out!"" 

3. Get married.

4. Go over as a skilled worker.

------------------------

Obviously #3 is the quickest option. I am not ready to get married right now, but I feel like it should be on the table for discussion. I could TRY to go over as a skilled worker, but I only know how to speak French, and I have office experience. That's it. You also have to have 11k to support yourself, **and it can't be borrowed.** My boyfriend is deadset on me going to school there, though. I am almost 25. I don't want to go to a 2 year program that might not even be something I want to do. 

**My boyfriend has about 15k in savings.** He wants to use this for school for me. I think this is a dumb idea. I think that 15k can be used elsewhere, and once I have permenant residence, we can discuss school for me. It is just so expensive as an international student.

**On the other hand,** boyfriend says, ""I don't know if I can do 2-3 more years of long distance."" But he also says, ""The option of it not working out is basically not a topic of conversation."" (Paraphrase. He probably said it nicer than that.) I feel like he is just kind of *hoping* the school thing will work out, but he doesn't really understand the Canadian Immigration process. He doesn't understand how much it costs, how much time it takes, etc. I am just ready to get the ball rolling on this discussion but I feel like my boyfriend is putting all his eggs in one basket with the school thing. I wonder if I am the only one who is looking at all the options available to us, and I feel like that's almost more of a gamble than us simply getting married, and a money suck, when that 15k could go toward anything else!

I am not the type to want a huge fancy wedding. We could go to the courthouse for all I care. What I (we?) want is to be together, we just have different ideas on how to achieve that. I guess my opinion is, if you don't want to consider it ever ending, why is marriage so scary right now or in the near-ish future? I definitely don't want to end it, **so if that's your advice, I'm sorry.** I just want some insight on how to approach this, and I guess I would like someone to tell me I am not insane.

My family is fully supportive of me in what I decide to do. They desperately want us to get married. (I want that too, but not until I'm 26 or so?) The only reason their opinion matters is because I want them to be on our side, no matter what we decide to do. And they are.

---

**tl;dr**: I feel like my boyfriend and I are not able to flesh out an idea for an end date. Boyfriend not ready to discuss marriage but is okay with me studying in his country or moving there to work. The problem is this costs money. My boyfriend has over 15k in savings, wants to use it to pay for 1 year of a diploma program for me in his country to ""solve"" the distance issue.

**EDIT**: And yes, I know about /r/longdistance and have used it in the past for advice. But I figured I would try the /r/relationships sub as well."
1ndgmk,232,2013-09-29,Who is at fault when sarcasm is lost?,warrenseth,TrueAskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1ndgmk/who_is_at_fault_when_sarcasm_is_lost/,"This is a question that has been bothering me for quite a while. I'm studying to become a journalist, and lately I've been doing my internship, and been getting comments on articles.
 
As I'm reading the comments I get on my own writing, and also those comments I read on other people's articles, I realize this a lot: sarcasm is really lost on some people. There might be a sentence I put in as maybe a joke, or something that did not need to be taken seriously, and they did. I might have put in a picture that was really a bad attempt at propaganda (from the politician who made the picture), exactly for the reason to show how lame the propaganda is, and the commenter says I'm just part of the propaganda itself.

And I've been thinking: whose fault is it that sarcasm is lost? Is it the people who don't understand it? Should they become more aware of the facts and context, and realize that it should not have been taken seriously? Or is it me? Should I have utilized this tool more efficiently, so it was still subtle, but also noticeable?

I really see nowadays that people think, that they 'speak sarcasm as a second language', and how they have such linguistic prowess, when in reality a lot of the jokes go well over their heads, or they can't truly express themselves with sarcasm so that it is clear to everyone. Is there a measure for how subtle the sarcasm is? What can journalists, and what can readers do to improve themselves?"

Here's the thing: I graduate in May and will very, very likely secure a job with the same company I'm interning for. I'm trying to hold onto this car as long as I can since it has been paid off and will probably last forever, but the MPG is really hurting my wallet. 

I have about $8,000 sitting in my savings account (non-emergency fund) that I could use to put towards a car. 

Moving isn't an option right now. 

I would appreciate some advice."

I think /r/BTFC is such a cool idea and I thought it was finely time to participate.

I've been trying to gain weight off an on for the past 3 years, and have consistently hovered around 145lbs. Usually during the summers I'm too active to concentrate on gaining weight. The highest I've gotten was 165lbs over a fall internship but quickly lost it once school started back up. I hope to reach at least that. I've done it before, let's see if I can do it again! I'm going to do this by (the best way there is)... eating a lot and drinking a lot of milk, that also means a lot of trips to the grocery store. I bike about 5 miles to the grocery store about 4-7 days a week and fill up however much I can in my backpack. But that won't last much longer due to weather. By the end of the year my goal is to look good and feel better and hopefully create a habit that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Good luck to everyone else in /r/BTFC!

Current lift numbers:

* Bench 3x5s: 135lbs
* Squats 3x5s: 155lbs
* Deadlift 3x5s: 185lbs

 I met this girl back late may, thought she was really cool so we started hanging out,
Her parents liked me at first, invited me over just about everyday to do something, then we got closer, and I asked her out, the next day I'm ordered to talk to her dad and ask for permission to date her... a bit odd since its just dating I didn't ask her to marry me but whatever (she's 20 and I'm 21 btw) 

So we dated for a week, within that there was a party at their place I'm not a very social person so I'm chilling by some older people just on my phone, she's off being social and active, she sits next to me and asks if I wanna go inside with her for a few to cool off, we go inside and I guess her parents think its my idea and tell her the next day that ""im holding her back because I am a indoor person "" bullshit. 

So she sits me down we talk and decide to break it off till we get to know each other better, a few days go by and I'm at her house, her mom pulls her downstairs and yells at her because I'm here and she doesn't like me, so her mom banned me from her house I'm not allowed there anymore, she constantly threatens her about taking her phone away because she talks to me on it, sounds stupid right? 

So fast forward to the next thing, I jokingly call my friend a bitch because  of some school stuff (we went to different high schools she wouldn't recommend my school because they dont teach you right. Or something) so the outcome of that her mom banned me from ever being in her car again. Sooooo more bs. 

Now we are pretty close and I'm very proud to say that, so we hold each other sometimes its very comforting, she messed up and accidentally sent a text to her mom about holding me, mom of course is freaking out on her and thinks we dating again, says shes not allowed to park at my house anymore (the hell for real) also if I'm the only person she texts she'll have to get a job for her phone.. she can't handle that, she already interns and struggles with her school work getting done a job would make things 10x worse. She told her mom a secret of mine which is ok (I was molested by my friend when I was young, I don't like being touched and I only let people I trust touch me, my friend is also asexual meaning she doesn't like physical things to a point) so I thought that would calm her mom down but actually no it didn't. 

So now that you know the story I need some advice, I feel like should step in, my friend said not too for fear id get hurt. beat up/maybe shot idk. Thing is they can only get away with that if I'm on their property, they can do it someplace else but that would be assault, I wouldn't press charges either I don't wanna hurt my friend in any way I love her. Should I step in over the internet? Tell them what's up and that we're only friends? Or maybe ask to meet one of them in person and explain things, this has gone on far enough, next thing you know I'll start be followed when I leave my house (they have done that once btw) help guys!

It's not super exciting or full of puns, but it may just give you the hope that you need. Or so I hope.

Living in today's world isn't easy, but we are granted so many freedoms. While many of us may prefer a world with fewer obligations and more simplicity, we must take what we are given and make the best of it. Giving up is easy, and the easy way in life is never the most rewarding.

I went into university with good grades from high school, a decent SAT score, and a positive attitude, but my work ethic was as solid as Gumby. I had learned to work the system in high school, managing to complete (most) of my homework 2 seconds before it was due and learning how to remember information for the 60 minutes it was needed before I forgot it all. I looked like a genius on paper, and in my defense I was relatively intelligent, but I knew my work ethic would catch up to me.

I managed to hang on to my hope of succeeding long enough to achieve a 3.4 GPA my first semester of college, but I eventually let Call of Duty, online poker, alcohol, lots of recreational drugs (which eventually turned into an opioid addiction), and a bad relationship wreck havoc on my work ethic, leading to a second semester GPA of .7 (yes, the number before the .7 is 0). I lost all my scholarships, was put on academic watch (I'm lucky it wasn't worse), and lost the faith of my family and some friends. I had become a burnout with no hope and little support.

As easy as it would have been to give up, get a shitty job, and live the rest of my life getting by, I chose to fight. I'm not sure if it was because the thought of working 40 hours a week at a shitty job scared me more than fighting through school, but I knew what I had to do, and did it.

First, I had to figure out how the hell to pay for school since I had lost so many scholarships. I contacted every private loan agency possible, every person in my life that could potentially cosign for me, and eventually figured it out with some help. Every year of school from there on my GPA got better. I finished with a 2.72 GPA and 75k of debt and though I thought my GPA was too low to succeed, I put a lot of time looking into my options and found a good path.

I was able to enroll in the MBA program at at my undergrad university if I got a 620 or better on the GMAT and I could finish my MBA in a year and a half. I studied my ass off for the GMAT and got a 700. I then looked into internships and graduate assistantships (GAs) and found that there were 4 available GAs at my school that paid full tuition. I thought I had no chance at the GA with such a low GPA, but I researched every aspect of the job, scrutinized the application process and spent countless hours practicing for the interview. I got the GA. I spent a year and a half BUSTING my ass and finished my MBA, for free, with a 3.87 GPA, while simultaneously learning how to be a professional at my job. I had some rough times, as I was constantly overloaded with work, but those rough times were some of the best learning lessons I've ever received. Things were looking up.

I spent the last 3 months looking for a job. I worked with the Career Planning Center at my school to build my resume, interview skills, and overall demeanor. I sent out 74 applications. Within 2 months, I heard back from 11 companies, 8 of which said ""we don't need you at this time."" But of those 3 companies that responded with a positive, one worked out after 67 days, 7 interviews, 24 surveys, a business plan, assessment, and lots of pleading. I start my job as a Financial Analyst October 6th.

I'm still working on many things, including my opioid addiction (I'm off drugs but it's still a daily fight), temper control, occasional feelings of depression, and yes, even my work ethic, but my attitude is much more positive.

Either way, no matter how shitty things look, feel, or seem to be, don't ever give up, for they will get better with the right attitude. Life is a fickle thing, and it's easy for the scale to tip in the wrong direction, but it's up to you to give it everything you've got to push it back the right way. I know that I'm lucky to have everything work out the way it did, but I would have never got lucky if I didn't try. And most importantly, never be afraid to ask for help. I can't credit my successes to myself alone, as I received help from family, friends (the few that I had left), teachers, school staff, therapists, and comedy. Even if you're not lucky enough to have some of those resources, there is always someone who wants to help you. It is your duty to find them, and things will work themselves out from there.

I'm going to go back to studying financial options. Go do whatever you should be doing. Cheers.

I'm looking at my options here and can't really decide what the best value is. open minded on price, willing to buy brand new if need be, but want the best value...

i had a late '09 unibody MPB and honestly it ran everything i wanted (photoshop, illustrator, downloading media, etc) at the speeds i needed.. at least for the first few years. so i can't understand if it's worth a couple extra hundred to go from a refurbished '11 model to a brand new one.

not considering craigslist and etc because i'd like an extended warranty and such

what would you buy? options i've considered:

new [student pricing, if i'm lucky// as i actually just graduated]
http://store.apple.com/us-hed/mac/family/macbook-pro

refurbished from apple
http://store.apple.com/us-hed/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/macbook_pro/15

refurbished from 3rd party

1ngdr9,7,2013-09-30,Slipping again.,JJtheThrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ngdr9/slipping_again/,"Using a throwaway because the last time I posted here, a couple of my friends found out and one of them still doesn't treat me the same way because of it.

Sorry if this comes off as ranty. I'm at school, typing on my phone, and I've got a shitload of emotions going on right now, so I'm just gonna go ahead and unload it here.

16/M. Turning 17 next month. Last time I posted here was in April, after I almost killed myself and I needed guidance afterwards. You guys helped me a lot at the time. Since then, I've been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, which I'm medicated for now, and episodic depression, which is inconsistent enough that I haven't gotten a prescription for it, and frankly, I don't want to. History of ADHD on my dad's side with bipolar also in my grandpa, and depression on my mom's side. Looks like I got the best of both worlds here.

I honestly thought I was done with depression. After all the shit I went through last year -- my cross country teammate killing himself, my mom slipping into alcoholism and depression (she's sober and happy now, by the way), and a lot of self loathing -- I thought I was okay now. Summer was boring, but I had an internship I really enjoyed, and while I didn't get out much (never have, really), I was happy.

Now I'm a junior in high school and I feel like shit is going down the toilet again (no pun intended). My dad is the president of an advertising agency so we've always been doing well, but they suddenly lost their two biggest clients and he had to lay a lot of employees off. His agency is where my internship was, actually. I was friends with some of those people. Now he's stressed 24/7 and I don't see him as much since he spends all of his time at the office now or working on his computer at home. He tries to hide it, but I can tell he's getting depressed, too, and I feel horrible that I can't find some way to make things easier for him.

On the plus side, I've been able to focus in school more this year than before, probably because of the meds. But I'm still not where I want to be. I wanted to get all A's and B's, which I haven't been able to get since 7th grade. But right now, I've got two C's and mostly low B's in everything else. I'm doing better than I was last year, but it's not good enough for me.

I dropped cross country this year. Getting up so early every morning and getting migraines from hard workouts just to remind myself that I'm a mediocre athlete who won't ever make varsity wasn't worth it. I'm really glad I did, actually; I'm still friends with a lot of my teammates, and in its place, I got into a cappella (varsity choir) with no experience -- more because they needed more guys than because I have any actual talent -- and a yell leading team.

Thing is, I'm more insecure than ever now. Everyone around me has a niche, some talent or a lot of talents that they excel at, and I have nothing. All I do is do my homework, browse Facebook or Reddit, jerk off, and go to bed, day in and day out. I've tried taking up guitar, or getting better at piano, or working on being a better singer, but none of those have clicked with me. The only thing I've got is writing, and I'm not even very good at that. I have no talents and no drive to develop any, and I hate myself for it.

Back to the yell leading team, since I have a bit to say about that. First of all, I love it. It's the first thing that's really resonated with me in a while, and I look forward to going to football games every Friday because of it. But the thing is, whenever I'm with the other guys (who are awesome, by the way), I feel worthless. Again, they're all talented, or funny, or just all around cool, and then there's me. It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to say anything when I'm around them because I feel like I'll make a fool of myself. That's weird for me, since I've always been really talkative and outgoing. I've always been confident, but now I'm just... not.

Specifically, there's one guy who I'll call Shaun. Shaun is hilarious, energetic, is pretty much a virtuoso with any instrument I can think of... Really, he's everything I want to be. I hang out with him a lot, both on and off the team, but every time I do, I get jealous. I hate that about myself. I'm an extremely jealous person, even though I never express it. Every time I see someone do something I can't, I hate them for being better than me, and hate myself for feeling that way. No one notices; I just laugh along and roll with it. But the entire time, I have this ugly feeling inside, and I can't get it to go away.

So. Shaun. Little backstory, all of last year I had a massive crush on a friend of mine, we'll call her Kelly. Kelly is amazing. She's actually one of the two friends I came to when I was having suicidal thoughts last year (not referring to the other two who found out against my will), and she's been one of the best friends I've ever had. The feelings I have for her have turned into more of a brotherly love, since I think that's how she feels about me, but there's still a part of me that wants to be with her. This year, I said fuck it and ignored those feelings since I knew they'd never amount to anything. I decided it was time to move on.

Well, Shaun and I were driving one day and we were joking around about homecoming. He brought up Kelly, and I told him I didn't think I was going to ask her, but that I still kind of like her. He said he wouldn't say anything and we didn't really talk about it again.

Last Friday, we were driving again and I asked him if he was going to ask anyone to homecoming. He said that the girl he wanted to ask had already gotten a date, so he probably wasn't going to. We didn't talk about it after that.

Well, when I looked at Facebook during second period today, lo and behold, there was a fucking picture of Shaun and Kelly together. He asked her this morning. I saw him this weekend and this morning, and he said nothing to me.

Now I feel a mix of anger, betrayal, and burning, burning jealousy, and it fucking hurts. But what scares me is the emptiness I feel, too. Angry as I am, a part of me feels nothing. It's a familiar feeling, and it scares the shit out of me.

Enough about Shaun and Kelly and the goddamn yell leaders who make me feel like less of a person, though. I'm getting off topic here.

I've been thinking about a lot suicide lately. Not necessarily committing it, but I've just been going about my days, thinking constantly, ""How would things be different if I killed myself? Would anyone be sad? Would anyone even care? Would people even remember a few years from now?"" They were just a few scattered thoughts before, but now it's verging on obsession. I can't stop thinking about standing on the ledge of that warehouse like I planned out in April, and taking that step, and it scares me. But a part of me still just feels empty.

So that's that up to this point. I feel like in slipping again, but I'm doing nothing to stop it. I just put on the fucking lighthearted, cheerful mask like I always have and pretend nothing is wrong. I don't want to tell my parents again; last time they threw me in therapy and worried about it for weeks, and I really don't want to do that to them now, what with my dad with his work and my mom recovering from surgery until November. Hell, I almost got partial hospitalization just because I planned it out. I don't want to go through all of that shit again.

Sorry this is all over the place, I wrote this over the course of several hours and emotionally I'm all over the place. How can I deal with all of this without going to a therapist again?"
1ng63d,25,2013-09-30,My (23M) SO (20F) has vastly lower libido than I do and it's frustrating me,decorusanimus,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1ng63d/my_23m_so_20f_has_vastly_lower_libido_than_i_do/,"Hey everyone. I'm a 23M who's been with his current SO (20F) for about 6 months now.

When we first got together back in April/May, we would have oral sex together at least once a week, almost always more. I love eating her out and almost always pleasured her more than she pleasured me (which was my doing because I enjoy giving oral so much). At the end of May, I left the country for 3 months to do an internship abroad. We did the LDR thing and I came back to the US at the end of August. The first two weeks back were phenomenal; we fooled around frequently, she let me eat her out or finger her multiple times in a night; it was a completely ideal setup. She really enjoyed oral and fingering.

About two weeks after getting back, we tried to do PIV. Come to find out it was painful for her (despite generous foreplay and fingering). As she told me, her previous boyfriend, who she'd lost her virginity to, had been focused on getting himself off and as a result, she only knew PIV sex as painful. It was apparently a ""normal"" occurrence for her to bleed and it almost always hurt. When she tells me this, I immediately stop and tell her we'll try with toys before we try with my penis again.

Since that night, I started having ED issues, both with her and while masturbating (Currently getting tested for it). I think it was because the idea of hurting someone physically through sex really bothered me. Additionally, the frequency we have sex TANKED. I asked her this weekend about it and she tells me that she just doesn't really ""need"" sex (oral included) and while she'll sometimes be in the mood, it's infrequent. She also said she doesn't particularly enjoy giving blowjobs because of the ED issue.

My SO and I are complete opposites on the sexual spectrum. She's only had bad experiences with sex and doesn't need/want it frequently (PIV and/or oral). In my last relationship, we'd have sex 2-3 times a day, 3-4 times a week. I'm frustrated and not sure what to do: most of the advice I've seen tends to say ""talk about it"" but what if we've talked about it and she just isn't particularly sexual?

TL;DR: Mismatched libidos, mine is higher than my SOs. She's not really sexual and says she doesn't really need sex. What do I do?"

In the last four years I have worked a steady job the whole time, had my own apartment and never been late on bills, finished my undergraduate, and am now in Graduate school!  I work at a substance abuse treatment center, I intern at a juvenile detention center, and am happier and more responsible than I could ever imagine.  4 years ago I could never imagine having the life that I have today.  I am so grateful!
This was one of the hardest years of my life, I lost two friends to overdoses, lost my grandfather and sisters boyfriend died within two days of each other, and on Friday my car got stolen from the parking lot of my internship in the inner city.  It has been a rough year and difficult one to maintain sobriety in, it would have been easy this year to say ""fuck it I'm just gonna get drunk"", but I did it all sober and wouldn't have it any other way.  I was able to be there for my family and my sister in such a difficult time, and while I have no car and no clue how I will be getting from school, to work, to internship at the moment, I am still grateful that I am sober and know that I will get through this too.  I have friends in sobriety that are there for me unlike my friends when I was using ever were.  So while life still happens and bad things happen, I can still get through it all sober and am so grateful for that today.  And I know that somehow things will work out."
1nfj5t,9,2013-09-30,What do you guys do when your suicidal thoughts start to get out of hand?,[deleted],bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1nfj5t/what_do_you_guys_do_when_your_suicidal_thoughts/,"I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, hospitalized twice in the past year and a half for suicide attempts.

It's three in the morning and all I can think about is how much I don't want to be alive. I haven't felt this way since I was last hospitalized exactly a year ago. The thoughts have resurfaced in the past month, and I don't really know who to talk to. I dumped my boyfriend of almost three years last week because I feel like I've been looking to him too much for affirmation and that I need to learn to provide that for myself, on my own. I've also lost hope that being in a relationship will ever work out for me. We're still on speaking terms, but my mind keeps telling me that he won't care enough to help me after everything I put him through. I don't have very many friends and I'm too embarrassed to approach the few that I do have.

Everyone thinks that I've improved, but I don't feel any different, and I don't want to let them know that. I have building anxiety about how I'm going to handle my current internship and college, which I've dropped out of about three semesters already, I think. I've lost count.

I have a constant sinking feeling in my chest. I randomly break down and it lasts for hours or days on end. I feel really worn out, and the ideations are getting worse. I""m also off my meds, which I know, bad move.The only positive is that I've been going to group and individual therapy for the past year, so I think it's taught me to have a better hold on not being impulsive and binging on alcohol or drugs like I used to. Instead, I'm here on r/bipolar.

Although in the meantime, I've been smoking joints/spliffs to relieve myself. But of course, it doesn't always help or last.

1neusr,27,2013-09-29,[CthulhuTech] ALSG 1-2: In which everybody puts feet in mouths,nerdyogre254,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1neusr/cthulhutech_alsg_12_in_which_everybody_puts_feet/,"**[Part 1-1 is HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1neu5d/cthulhutech_alsg_11_in_which_the_group_comes/)**

Cyril walked around the conference room, putting each suitcase in front of each chair, making sure that the clipboard was chained to the handle, and that the sign verification tools were attached to the biometric locks. No point having a sign-on bonus if someone else took them. 

The first one to enter was Doctor McMahon, with a furious look on his face. Before he could open his mouth in protest, Cyril silenced him and directed him to one of the chairs. Next up was Doctor Hofstadter and Steven Penley, followed by Marcy, Vreta, Joseph and finally Faust, flanked by two large men in OIS field gear.

""If everyone would like to take a seat, we can get started, thankyou.""

Doctor Hofstadter looked around, disapprovingly assessing the people arrayed around the room.

""And why would I have been taken away from my important research to 'hang around' with sycophants, wretches and the mentally infirm?"" he inquired angrily.

""That's not what your budget allocation for the last quarter says, Arthur,"" retorted McMahon acidly. Startled, he turned to face McMahon, and with one finger pushed his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose.

""Hmm, well, I didn't see the esteemed Doctor Geoffrey McMahon enter the room, my apologies.""

Cyril waited as they talked amongst themselves to settle down. It only took thirty-five seconds, oddly enough.

""Good morning, everyone. My name is Cyril Taylor, and you've all been invited here for the purpose of hopefully engaging in gainful employment with-""

""But I already have gainful employment,"" Doctor McMahon chimed in effortlessly.

""-with a new initiative being headed by myself. Before I continue, I'll need signatures from everyone on the form on the briefcase there.""
The assembled group simultaneously flicked through the contract laid out in front of them. Marcy and Faust signed immediately, while the rest dallied.

""This looks like a bigger version of the standard nondisclosure agreement I took when I signed on - why the extra contract?"" Steven asked aloud of Cyril.

Cyril shrugged, wearing a weak smile. ""Sadly, mister penley, I can't even disclose the details of the job offer until you sign that. If you're looking for any extra information, you can simply rest assured that any breach of the NDA will end up with you being sued to an inch of your life. And then shot.""

Several members of the group looked up from signing for a moment. Once everyone had signed, he smiled.

""Alright, now we may as well do some introductions. Not for my sake, of course, but for everyone else's. For the sake of completeness, you may as well be honest with who you are and what you do.""

Doctor McMahon piped up immediately, chest puffed out like a game rooster. ""Hi, my name is Doctor Geoffrey McMahon, you might know me as one of the Engel designers, I designed the Hamshall aquatic assault Engel.""

Doctor Hofstadter cleared his throat with a loud 'harrumph', ""My name is Doctor Arthur Hofstadter and this is Steven Penley. We are scientists.""

""More like glorified fact-checkers,"" grunted Doctor McMahon.

""That's funny, coming from the coward who toes the line with the big boys,"" Faust spat in.

""Anyway, I'm Ivan Faust. Misunderstood genius,"" Faust commented, lying back in his chair.

""Joseph Wretton, and I have no idea what I'm doing here.""

Cyril sighed, ""What I'm offering to all of you is a position in a new taskforce known as the Ashcroft Lateral Solution Group. You'll be paid handsomely in addition to your regular employment compensation, and you'll be called upon to provide support to a number of organisations in a number of positions. For this, we need a varied team. I could have pulled out a goon squad from the NEG military, but I'm a firm believer in crowdsourcing a solution.""

""Anyway, since people seem to be content with letting me talk uninterrupted, how about I provide some introductions as well. To my left, we have one Vreta Smith. He's a parapsychic, as you may have guessed courtesy of that Star of David analogy on his arm there.""

Vreta looked down at the parapsychic identification tag on his arm and rubbed it sheepishly - as a parapsychic that could manifest Class Two powers, identification was required on him at all times by law. He smiled nervously and put his hands on his lap, rubbing them together.

""This young fellow here,"" pointing to McMahon, ""Is one Doctor Geoffrey McMahon, PhD in Xenogenetics. As he already mentioned, he recently finished work on a subset of the Engel Project, and his work can be most prominently seen on the Hamshall Engel shown on the news.""

McMahon bowed as much as was possible from the seating position, with a slight smile, as if being called to the podium for a keynote speech.

""This young man here is mister Joseph Wretton, and-""

""I'd rather not talk about what I can do, Cyril."" Joseph replied meekly.

""If it's a matter of secrecy, mister Wretton, then you can consider myself and anyone else here complicit in our affairs, and some of us here have far more to lose than you do.""

There was a tense moment of silence as the two locked eyes for a moment, and then Joseph relaxed.

""Fine, whatever. Speak your piece.""

Cyril smiled, somewhat smugly, ""Joseph is what we classify as a metaterrestrial - someone who exhibits superhuman abilities. Joseph is capable of storing things in extradimensional space, and also 'teleportation'"" as he made a quotation mark gesture with his fingers.

""Well that's quite impressive, have you subjected it to some experimentation?"" Steven piped up.

""Some."" Joseph replied tersely.

""Moving on, we have Doctor Arthur Hofstadter and Steven Penley, two researchers from our Combined Engineering department. Doctor Hofstadter specialises in Applied Arcanotechnology, and Steven is currently doing his doctoral internship with us. Next, we have Mister Ivan Faust, most recently of the Office of Internal Security's Alpha Four Detention Facility, released to us on group recognisance.""

""You mean the bioterrorist Ivan Faust?"" Joseph raised his voice.

""I'll have you know that none of the pathogens I created in the past were anything more than test subjects. If they had escaped - a situation that would not have come about in any situation where I was in control - the lifespan of those virii would not have and could not have spread with enough speed to threaten any major population centre. I could have loaded a canister of it into the air vents at Central and the virus would have completely died by the time it got to Maybourne, and the most you would have felt was a slight tickle in your throat.""

""At which point it would have killed everyone?"" Joseph bit back.
Faust chose to respond by sticking his middle finger up at Wretton.

""As it stands, I believe that the scientific and medical benefits gained by mister Faust far outweigh any potential dangers posed by his scientific or magical curiosity,"" Cyril calmly stated.

""Last, but not least, we have one Marcy Rocket. Now I'd like you all to remain aware of the NDA you signed, as Marcy comes to us through an old friend of mine. She has certain unique talents that combine to make her, shall we say, your heavy hitter, if the need arises. Marcy, could you please show everyone your talent?""

Marcy stood up, and pushed the chair back. Taking a step back, she focussed her mind, and began to change. Appearing from her pores, as if sweated out of some gland that humankind never had, her skin became darker, redder, like the blood oozing from a vein. She grew taller, much taller, from a six foot tall human, to an eight foot tall creature of alien origin. Her hair disappeared, subsumed into her dark, calloused hide. Her mouth and nose disappeared, shielded and covered by a thick, bony plating extending from where her nose was to her chin, and swept back and wide like some sort of strange mane. Two large leathery bat-like wings swept back, unfurling to their full length, before it all disappeared and in an instant was replaced by the young woman that everyone knew as Marcy.

Silence fell on the room, punctuated only by the message tone of Marcy's phone. She got it out of her pocket, took a look at it, and absentmindedly put it back in her pocket.

Everyone except Cyril, Hofstadter and Penley scrambled back as fast as they could, rapidly opening up a distance between themselves and Marcy.

""What the fuck was that!?"" Shouted several members of the assembled party.

""What she is,"" Cyril remarked, emphasising gender, ""is your defence in the off chance that something that's immune to bullets won't give you the pleasure of laying down and dying. But in any case, now that I've told you what you could be doing, should you say yes, I'd like you to open that case in front of you.""

There was the muted clacking sounds of a number of briefcases being opened.

""Well now,"" commented Doctor Hofstadter greedily. In each of the briefcases, there were rows of banknotes.

""Consider that a sign-on bonus, or at the very least a thankyou for coming, should you choose not to take the job offered to you. Know that that's only a six month advance on your paycheck, by the way.""

""How much is in here?"" Vreta asked.

""Two hundred and fifty thousand terranote,"" Cyril remarked off-handedly.
There was a moment of silence as everyone in the conference room took in just how much money that was sitting in front of them.

""How can you afford all this?"" Joseph asked incredulously.

Cyril smiled warmly as he leaned back in his chair.
""This is the Ashcroft Foundation. We own the world.""

NEXT UP IN THE ADVENTURES OF THE ALSG: ""They're hippies. How dangerous could they be?"""
1neu5d,24,2013-09-29,[CthulhuTech] ALSG 1-1: In which the group comes together,nerdyogre254,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1neu5d/cthulhutech_alsg_11_in_which_the_group_comes/,"**Apologies in advance for breaking this up, the first hour of game time is 5000+ words. This is the story of my CthulhuTech group, and their complex-as-fuck adventures. The game takes inspiration from shows like X-files, Fringe and Warehouse 13.**

Fourteenth July, 2086. The analogue clock sitting on Cyril's desk ticked over to nine AM, and he made one final check on his peek as to the people he would be hiring today. Times were unusual, and so, unusual approaches were required. Hence, the Ashcroft Lateral Solution Group. In his younger years, he would have hoped for an assignment like this - but he would have preferred to be on the other side, not managing people. Only because everyone else was dead or mad did he take the job. 

""Beggars can't be choosers,"" he told himself as he skimmed through the names. He chuckled slightly at the silliness of that statement - he was hardly a beggar by any material definition of the word. But if only to keep his mind busy, he scanned through the names one more time.

A jail cell door slammed open, jolting one Ivan Faust to wakefulness. He turned over, removing the scratchy wool blanket and stood up as several prison guards in body armor and shock-sticks moved into the cell, along with someone else - another bureaucratic type, here to try and beg some kind of information out of him. He stood at ease, unwashed blond hair lying flat as his blue eyes narrowed. A sneer covered his face as the trumped-up little bitch in front of him handed him a piece of paper. That sneer disappeared instantly as he saw what the paper contained was.

The doorbell buzzed for the small brownstone apartment, totally unheeded by the Nazzadi boy upstairs apart from a surly groan. He dimly heard the door open, and an unfamiliar voice talking to his adoptive mother.

""Vreta, honey?"" His mother called out from downstairs.

""Yeah?"" the boy groaned drowsily.

""Some men from the Ashcroft Foundation would like to talk to you, can you come down?""

""Sure, give me a tick."" He replied, rolling out of bed. He fumbled around in his drawers for his papers - being a registered parapsychic meant carrying identification at all times, and he'd already been caught out once. Rapidly throwing on some clean clothes, he hustled down the stairs to find several law-enforcement types and one short lawyer-type standing in the hallway. 

""Before you say anything,"" Vreta mentioned aloud, ""The cops already asked me about the fire on 91st street last week and they know I wasn't even in the area, so don't bother.""

""I'm sorry, mister Smith, that's not what we're here for,"" said the lawyer-type, ""In fact, we were here about a job offer for you.""

Vreta, being a Nazzadi White, normally looked like the kind of person you could lose in a snowstorm, but the unusual nature of this event made him even whiter than before. ""A job, you say?""

""Indeed. If you'd like to come with us, we have a job offer that we'd like you to consider. We promise it won't take very long, and we'll drop you home when you're done.""

Vreta looked at the men, and to his somewhat pensive mother, and shrugged.
""Sure, let's go.""

The training room was silent save for the inhales and exhales of its single occupant. Marcy Rocket, more commonly known as 'Chiro', remained focussed on a tiny speck on the opposite wall as she did her pull-up bar exercises for the morning. Sweat ran down her forehead - part exertion, part nerves - as she passed into the thousands. Truth be told, she had lost count a while ago and was simply going until she could either stop worrying about it or wasn't capable of lifting herself anymore. As she pondered adding more weight to her legs, the door to the training room were pushed open, and her pack leader, a devilishly enticing Nazzadi woman by the name of Yan-Yu Shi, strolled in. Yan-Yu looked slightly concerned, and the folder in her hands had the marking of a reassignment.

Realising that the time had come, and in fact she would not be exercising to exhaustion, Marcy dropped from the raised bar and took the folder with a resigned sigh.
""Don't be worried, hanma,"" said Yan-Yu, using a term of endearment that could only mean rough times ahead, ""We all have to step outside our comfort zones once in a while.""

Marcy didn't respond, knowing that Yan-Yu believed in the old platitude as much as she did - which was to say very little.
""First sign of trouble and I'll be carving a path straight back here and taking Lorekeeper Praan's head for myself,"" promised Marcy.

""I wouldn't blame you - I've never known the man to owe or request favors, but apparently he did, once upon a time,"" Yan-Yu said consolingly.

Marcy grumbled irritably as she hit the showers. Just because she didn't have a comfort zone anymore didn't mean she didn't hate this plan.

Doctor Geoffrey McMahon strolled out of the psychiatrist's office with a smile on his face, until he rounded the corner at which point it left him faster than the cheerleader he had his eye on in senior year of highschool. He didn't see the point of doing these constant psychiatric evaluations. His mind was like the Hoover Dam, and even the pressure at the height of the Engel Project was barely enough to cause any kind of problems. Two hours with that effeminate fool Withers had left a bad taste in his mouth. Pausing by the oversized motivational picture on the wall, he turned his phone back on. Almost immediately, an email popped up on his screen, with an attachment. His PA had sent along a calendar change and some kind of form for him to peruse. Opening it up on his screen, he mumbled absentmindedly as he read the attachment.

""Dear sir, blah blah blah, formal writing, blah blah blah, project completed, blah blah blah, lateral solutions group, blah blah blah, urgent meeting, blah blah blah, REASSIGNMENT?""

Lightning quick, he phoned his secretary, oblivious to the fact that several nearby office workers were now staring at the somewhat agitated scientist as he put the phone to his ear.

""Where, what and why, Judy? What do you mean they didn't say? As in they didn't say or they used really long words you didn't understand? Well now I know. Thankyou.""

He hung up and put the phone in his pocket, and started off towards the administrative offices. Whatever this was, it had better be important, because science wasn't going to be revolutionised all by itself.

Gulping down his morning tea of brandy-laced coffee and a plain bagel, Doctor Arthur Hofstadter reviewed the calculations provided to him by other researchers. He grumbled and cleared his throat as he realised that yet again, he was correcting the stupid mistakes that people too big for their own boots missed because they thought they were thinking about the 'big picture' and instead were pretending that they lived in a fantasy universe where engineering and physics were merely second opinions on their glorious master plans.
He scrumpled up a leftover piece of paper and tried to throw it in the bin under his desk, however his damned sausage fingers caused the paper to slip out of his hands at the wrong time and instead rolled to a stop near the wastepaper basket. Grunting in frustration, he rose his corpulent weight out of his chair and knelt down to get under the desk to fix it.

""Doctor?"" a familiar voice called out from the entrance to his office.
Doctor Hofstadter yanked his head up in reflex, only to find that his desk was still in the way. Newton's Third Law rapidly resolved this situation, leaving Doctor Hofstadter with a sore head.

""Bloody bastard! Yes, m'boy, what is it?"" He said as he climbed back up to a standing position. At his door was Steven Penley, his intern.

""We've been rescheduled and reassigned, sir, and we have a meeting with the new project head in an hour.""

""Are you serious?"" Arthur asked incredulously.

""Completely, sir.""

""Well then,"" he said, sighing exasperatedly, ""Let's pack up our things and get moving.""

Joseph Wretton stood outside in the morning light, looking up at the building before him, emblazoned with the Ashcroft Foundation Logo. He wondered how these people had known about him and his unique - truly unique - skillset. Not that it particularly mattered after all. What really mattered, was how to find the damn room that he was supposed to be meeting this job offering person in. He mentally shrugged, and wandered on into the building.

**This might seem like an odd place to stop it but the rest goes well over that pesky 10,000 character limit.**
