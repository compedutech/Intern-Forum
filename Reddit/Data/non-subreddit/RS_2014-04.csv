I'm a couple semesters away from graduating college, this summer I'll be applying to medical schools. This has been my dream for as long as I can remember, unfortunately my grades are not where I want them to be and my chances are very very very slim if they even exist at all.

On top of this I am trying to better my odds at getting accepted to any medical school by finding related work. A few months ago I managed to convince a lab researcher to take me on for a few months as an intern. I applied for funding two months ago and today I was informed that my application was unsuccessful and that I will not be getting funding. I screwed up by letting my grades get so low when I was 18 and 19 and now that I'm almost 22 and trying to rectify the matter, things just seems to keep getting screwed up for me.

This has been bumming me out more than anything else has ever before. I wake up in a funk, I spend my entire day in a funk and I end it in a funk and I don't really know how to shake this feeling. I'm used to waking up the next morning and forgetting whatever's bothering me from the night before but this has been ongoing for a while and I don't really know what to do.

I still have work ahead of me and this is seriously affecting me ability to get anything done, I just sort of feel hopeless. I need to get my head on straight and cheer my self up so I can get back into the swing of things and at least finish my degree on a high note but I just don't know how to. On top of that, i'm seeing everyone around me and their successes and it just makes me feel like a failure.

I feel like I've fucked up my whole life and the goals I had set for myself because  I wanted to party and enjoy myself and not do a single productive thing when I was 18. Now I'm worried that I'll never reach my goal. 


There's even this girl back home who I really like and  I think she likes me but I've been lying to her about how things in my life are going especially about the potential for medical school. I thought I was going to have this internship, but even that's been shot down. She really prides herself on success and looks for it in other people, and I know I can be successful, I just need the chance, but I can't seem to get it.

Any advice on how to get out of this?"

I'm a junior undergraduate student.  My grades are good, I have a lot of scholarships and am not worried about money whatsoever, I applied for some competitive summer internships and should be hearing back from them soon.  


But I'm so unhappy.  Four months ago, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend of three years.  I didn't really care at all at first, probably helped by the fact that I went straight into another relationship.  That relationship did not end up working, and now I'm dating someone else.  But now I miss my ex so much.  I can't even masturbate without crying I miss him so much.  I think it's something to do with the spring weather, it reminds me of him and our happy times so much.  In total I""ve dated three guys and all of them ended with the guy not really caring about me very much.  The guy I'm dating now keeps making little comments that makes me so sad, like what really arouses him in women, traits that I don't have (dyed hair, piercings).  He never wants to hold my hand and sexually the relationship has been moving slowly.  I ended up giving him a blowjob the other night but we've never even made out.  I feel so hopeless and sad.  Everything makes me cry.  I want to reach out to my ex but I feel like a loser because as far as I know he already has another girlfriend.  I was pretty crazy in the relationship too so I'm sure know that he's away from he realizes what an absolute psycho I am.  I""m starting to be unable to concentrate on any of my work.  I don't know how to connect with people, I went on a trip over spring break and everyone made friends with each other really quick but I was just unable to interact like a normal person.  I isolated myself by being silent.  I never know what to say.  "
21w38t,8,2014-03-31,Need help choosing between a CPD and DPD,aspiringdietitian,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/21w38t/need_help_choosing_between_a_cpd_and_dpd/,"I'm very torn between the two and I would really appreciate some outside input.

DPD
$15,785
Internship high estimate $12,000
Apartment ~$21,600 for 3 years
Total: $49,385

CPD
$48,378
Apartment ~$15,600 for 2 years
Total: $63,978

Difference: $14,385

As you can see, cost is a really important factor for me.  However, my main question is whether it would be more worthwhile to spend an extra year on an internship (or possibly longer if I do not get matched the first time around) and save ~14,000 or finish the CPD in just two years.

I am 23 years old and I am quite anxious to start my career.  The CPD greatly appeals to me if only because of the guaranteed length of time but I would like to avoid as much debt as possible.  Obviously my calculations do not take into account supplies, transportation, living costs etc. but $14,000 even as a rough estimate is a significant amount of money to me.

I am also worried about the course load of the CPD.  I would like to work/volunteer/participate in extracurricular activities but I don't know if I'll be able to put much time in if I'm busy keeping up with the school work.  For those who have completed a CPD, how did you manage your time?  Did you ever wish you had gone with the DPD route?  Is GPA as crucial in a CPD as opposed to a DPD since you don't have to go through the matching program?

I've been thinking myself in circles and I only have a few weeks left to make a decision and reserve my spot.  Any advice would be helpful!"

21w89p,23,2014-04-01,Ellen Pompeo and the current state of the show.,bothanspy1337,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/21w89p/ellen_pompeo_and_the_current_state_of_the_show/,"Is it just me or has Meridith's screen time been greatly reduced since season nine?  I hardly feel like we see her now.  The show seems to have moved from following the life of Meredith Grey to an ensemble  cast with Ellen Pompeo serving as the narrator.  I got me thinking about the current state of the show and I think I have an answer to that popular question of ""how long is the show going to last?""

First, let me discuss something I found rather interesting.  Some people may or may not have noticed the importance of a small detail in season nine.  But I think it actually has a large significance:  The name change of Seattle Grace Mercy West to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.

Obviously, the way the show went about announcing it made it seem like a ""fresh start"" kind of deal.  It was a welcome change of the hospital was nearly shutdown and we lost so many main characters.  But why exactly?  Well SGMW is a mouthful and quite frankly an awful name.  So that was probably one of the reasons.  But consider this:  With Ellen Pompeo's fading screen time, is it possible that the entire name change was a move to ensure they can still call the show ""Grey's Anatomy"" without Meredith?  I suppose that they could always use the medical textbook ""Gray's Anatomy"" as an excuse for the name, but the spelling is different.

The show isn't about her anymore.  She gets the same amount of screen time, if not less than every other cast member.  We see far more of Callie and Arizona, Jackson and Avery, Owen and Christina, and pretty much every other cast member but Meredith.  She maybe is getting like two to five scenes an episode now.  It shouldn't be a surprise or a treat when the supposed star of the show finally has a scene...

The leaving of Meredith would be like a domino effect.  If Meredith leaves, she likely wouldn't die.  That would just be a tragic and depressing ending for her character which wouldn't make a lot of sense, especially when you consider that the show is kind of like her own memoirs.  So if she leaves, that means Derek leaves.  So now we're missing the two stars of the show.  This means the writers have to make a crucial decision:  Liquidate the rest of the cast  à la Scrubs, meaning you reboot the show and start from square one.  Or, you attempt to go full ensemble (which they're already kind of doing) with the shell of the cast.  Now I know I said earlier that Meredith isn't already a major character anymore, but the story is still centered around her at the end of the day.  How much of an impact would that have on the show?

I really feel like season nine was pushing in this direction with all of the new interns.  Parts of their internship felt just like Seasons one and two, except a lot shorter and not nearly as interesting.  In fact it felt so similar to the beginning of the show, I have a feeling some of their plot lines were taken directly or at least inspired by some of the original scripts.  We even had an intern die unexpectedly!  But the reason the show backed down so quickly was because no one really liked the interns.  They weren't really interesting and just seemed to argue and complain.  The only one whose gotten an positive feedback is Jo, which explains why she's the only one who won't be getting the axe next season.

Either way, I can picture (just like Scrubs) Grey's Anatomy getting one or two seasons at best after Pompeo's departure.  The show will try to pick up the broken pieces and make something fresh, but it will ultimately fail because after countless deaths and departures of so many cast members, the main start leaving is like the final nail on the coffin.

I feel like we're moving closer and closer in this direction.  It's very important we pay attention to all of the released information for the show that's coming out; especially contract renewals.  Most TV shows sign main cast members for at least two seasons.  And I think it's very obvious at this point Pompeo doesn't want as much to do with the show as she used to.  Same with Dempsey.  In fact, I think it's public knowledge that Dempsey had to be convinced to renew his contract again.  So let's keep our eyes and ears open the next few months and see how long the contract renewals are.  I think it's safe to say anyone who is signed on for only one season will be departing at some point during season eleven.

So what do you guys think?  I know this is way too much text, but this has been on my mind for a few months now."
21wbmx,4,2014-04-01,Could someone help me out / offer advice?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/21wbmx/could_someone_help_me_out_offer_advice/,"Hi all, 

I thought I would post here and get peoples opinions / thoughts. 

I think I have struggled with depressive thoughts since I was 15. I am 23 now. I used to live abroad, I moved back to the UK when I was 16 after eight years. Since living in the UK except for study, a few very good friendships and some internships. I have lived a very isolated life. Some aspects of my life are healthy. I'm a funny, caring and empathetic person. Have some great friends. I would like to think handsome and intelligent. When around people I trust in an environment I know, I seem to be the life of the party.

I graduated from University last Summer at the top of my class. Straight out of University I was offered an internship with a very well known established brand in Zurich. I declined it due my very insecure thoughts. The same happened with a shoe brand for a job in another country. 

I have had some more interviews for work since then, locally. Nothing has worked out though. Due to not being offered the position. It really brings my depressive thoughts to the forefront. 

At the beginning of this year I moved half way across the country with my parents. I don't know anyone here, having trouble securing a job, very lonely. 

Some days I wish I just didn't exist. On the job front, silly things worry me. Traveling alone, trains, people seeing how depressed / insecure I am, not living up to expectations. 

It's not the job front. I am a deeply, deeply unhappy person but due to this I feel as though I am also wasting my potential.  

I never open up about all of this to anyone but the thoughts are getting so dark, I need to. 

A side note I should mention. I don't think about the incident a lot but when I was 18. I was attacked by 12 people walking home after a night out. My cheek and nose broken. Some minor injuries to my back. Went to court. My depressive / anxious thoughts occurred before the incident but can't help think it plays some part.

21wfv0,1,2014-04-01,I [19/f] really like a very awkward and inexperienced man [24/m],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/21wfv0/i_19f_really_like_a_very_awkward_and/,"We met because he is in the same program in college as me. He is in his second and final year and I am in my first. He was my assigned mentored throughout the beginning of the program and helped me a lot. After his duties were fulfilled, he would still regularly check in on me to see how everything was going. As time went on and regular conversations began in which we realized we had a lot in common, we became good friends.

It didn't take long for me to start falling for him. Another girl [28/f] in the second year of the program is good friends with both of us, so I asked her what my chances are. She informed me that he is very closed off. He is very into his religion and she's not sure if he will marry outside of it (he's Jewish, I'm Catholic but not practicing) and she is pretty sure he has never had a girlfriend. She warned me that he is very bashful and easily intimidated so I should not go ""hard and fast.""

I liked him enough that I agreed to these terms but that was about two months ago. I have slowly began to flirt with him more and I get very mixed signals. Sometimes he will flirt back and sometimes not.

The second-years have an internship which they go on part way through the year. On their last day of class which was about a month ago, he stopped by to post up a poster on the wall of our classroom for me to see the next time I was in class; it was a bit of an inside joke between us and it actually belonged to him and was something he treasured. When I texted him about it the next day, he said he knew I would take care of it and felt he had to leave something behind.

Since they've been on internship, I've heard from him less, but I figure it is because they are busy. I invited him to my birthday and he didn't show up, texting me in the morning to apologize and say that he accidentally passed out after the exhaustion of his first week of internship (he starts at 5 a.m. and only leaves when he's finished). He told me he'd make it up to me though by hanging out sometime. He also came to visit last week, staying to chat for two hours.

Do I bug him about hanging out? Do I tell him I like him? Do I leave him alone and give up? Any input is welcome. :)

21wo0y,2,2014-04-01,Extremely confused and in a dark place over a break.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/21wo0y/extremely_confused_and_in_a_dark_place_over_a/,"My ex GF(23/F) decided that we needed to take take a break. I'm assuming it's a break up now, and not just time apart for a while, due to all the stuff I've seen and read from her online. I understand I shouldn't contact her, or look at her Facebook or Instagram since it'll hurt me more. I just can't help it since I still truly love her and care about her. Sure she's my first true GF, but I've never had a connection with anyone else like I have with her. She made it seem like she did too. I know that since I have no friends, I've attached all myself worth and happiness to her. I just can't seem to stop wanting her, while it seems like she's over me. Like someone told me, I need to stop obsessing over her, but I can't. There's some stuff I haven't posted or included in here since I don't know where to put it. If need be, I can include it.

The night before she decided we needed to take a break, she seemed to love me, but when we were driving back, she started talking of how she hates that my parents control me, and I'm to afraid to stand up to them. I've talked to them since, and realize that I was under the impression that I had to ask them to do things. I just had to let them know I was going to do something. They might of gotten mad, but that's probably it. It also didn't help that I lied to them about a lot of things, which led them to assume things themselves, which caused a lot of tension between myself, my parents, and my ex.

I have one friend, but we don't hang out much since I don't know how to ask him how to hang out besides when we have classes at campus. I haven't attempted to make new friends since I don't go anywhere or really have much to do besides classes. Even then, I don't have much motivation to go to classes. I just feel down. Even before this, I never wanted to go. Why? I'm not sure. Not to go off on a tangent, but when I do go, I'm fine. It's the motivation to get up, get ready, and go that I lack. I don't go anywhere since I used to do it all with her. I've tried, but I just can't bring myself to. I start, then I start to ask myself, ""do I really need to go?"" I've been really close to ending everything. From dropping out of school and just getting a job, to wanting to die. 

I'll be honest since I didn't put it in my previous posts when I needed some advice. (Here's the previous post I made if you want to see some of the backstory: http://redd.it/200bds and http://redd.it/204c2x) I've looked at her texts and messages before because I felt that's the only way I could know things since she usually never told me or only told me when she remembered or someone else asked and I was there to hear. I stopped for a while, then I started again, but not as bad as I used to. A lot of it was just stupid stuff, but some of it made me think she had either thought about cheating on me, or did. I confronted her about some of it a long time ago when I saw it, and she said it was just out of context how I was reading it, or it was so that her friend who was cheating, would know she wouldn't say anything.

Well I think a month or a few weeks before we took the ""break"", she showed me how some guy she used to have lunch with when she was completing her internship started messaging her after she added him, well I think she added him. He was what seemed like flirting with her. That raised red flags to me, but I brushed them off because I wanted to trust her. She made it seem like she was in love me with me no matter what. Now I don't remember fully, I just remember parts, but later I saw he told her if they could hang out. Now I'm no prude and I could careless if they hung out. What upset me was she never told me about it and I didn't tell her that I saw. He also asked if she was, I think bad? She said no, but that she wasn't boring. Then later a friend asked if she wanted to go out to some bars. I told her go since she complained that she didn't have friends and I was leaving since I had class early the next day. I don't know why, but I went in her facebook and saw she messaged him to go out with her. Again, it didn't bother me until I saw he said, ""I want to see you"". And she said to meet her at her car. That just freaked me out bad. Again I never told her I saw and knew and she just acted like it never happened. She's since deleted the messages. 

Also, she told me that some of her co-workers at her new job, which was a non-profit, told her that it seemed like she was single since I was only there on the weekends. It never bothered her before, but I'm assuming it is now since she's done with school and can do things with not much worry. 

Then the first week after we took the ""break"", I freaked out and looked at her facebook, her emails, and looked where she went on icloud. I know it sounds like I turned into a stalker, and I realize I pretty much did. That's when I found out she went to the bars, ordered new furniture, and she got a new job. I shouldn't have done that because it just led me to feeling more hurt. I thought she was with someone else or already moved on from me. Maybe she has, maybe not. Seeing her posts also made me feel bad. Her post of a picture of herself saying temporarily alone made me think there was a chance still. Then her out with her roommate made feel bad because I, for some reason wanted to be there with her. 

I couldn't help but I kept looking at her page and saw her post a picture of her with a baby and she looked happy and said she wanted one. Again it brought me down because she seemed happy without me. The next post that brought me down again was a picture of a bracelet she has that says love. She captioned it, ""All I need is love!"" It just hurt so much because I still love her and haven't stopped. I wanted to say that she still had my love. It made me think she stopped loving me. Next seeing her post that picture of getting hurt in a relationship is like a toothache made me lose it and pretty much breakdown and want to end everything. The latest post that I saw and probably shouldn't have is a picture of herself saying how she's going out and going to have fun. It didn't hurt really, but just made me start thinking she moved on. Sure I'm probably over thinking things like I usually do, but I can't just help it. I love her so much. I hate to admit it, but I have from time to time, logged into her facebook and instagram to see what she posts or says. 

I mean I know I have let her down before because I've said I would change, and I did, but not fully. Also, because I'm still in school. She told me before she had this plan where I had graduated when I was supposed to, and we'd probably be married by now. Then she said she might want to have kids, but wants to do things like travel and whatnot before that. But I can't since I have school and I was under the impression that I had to ask my parents. I mean, I could now since I know that I don't have to ask them, just let them know. Then I had just been going through the motions of the relationship lately, instead of trying like I used to. I don't know why I stopped. I guess I took it for granted that she was still with me even though I've fucked up instead of getting better. 

She's given me chances to change but I never fully did. I'm pretty sure she wanted to take our relationship to the next level, but I couldn't because of school and I was too afraid to stand up to my parents. I also realize that I never really wanted to do anything because I was scared to ask my parents and I didn't want to spend money since I would have to ask my parents for it and felt I needed their permission. That and I was always tired for some reason, even though I slept more than enough. I had started to think that I could move over there with her and just commute to classes. But that idea is gone since we're on the ""break"". Like I said, I'm probably over thinking things. I still have stuff at her apartment, and I would like to go get somethings, but I don't know how to go about it. I was thinking I could go and not tell her, but I don't want to seem like a creeper or anything. 

I hate to admit this now, but I recently logged into her facebook after about a little over a week of not being tempted. I looked at her messages and saw that she talked with an old co-worker from her internship. The lady told my ex ""I asked Curtis if he was talking to you heart heart :)"" and my ex replied ""Omg lol"". That led me to how I felt before again but worse. Like I want to end everything and die. Not quit school and just give up like before, but to end everything. I can't help but think they flirted while she was at the internship and now they're talking and she might move on from me to be with him when she had told me ""You haven't lost me"". I don't know what to think now and I can't focus or think of anything else now. I'm just really really lost. If I don't feel any better in a few days. I'm going to go see the therapist on campus about this.

Sorry for this wall of text and if any of this is confusing or what not. I'll explain anything as best as I can if need be.

**TL;DR- My ex made it seem like this would just be time apart and I could later try again at the relationship. Saw her posting things making me think otherwise. Fucked up and logged into her Facebook and saw she might be talking to another guy. No I'm really confused and want to end everything.**"
21wpum,3,2014-04-01,I [22 M] am just about to start a relationship [22 F] with a girl who was fairly severely emotionally abused by her parents. This is her first dating relationship. What do I have to watch out for?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21wpum/i_22_m_am_just_about_to_start_a_relationship_22_f/,"I'm asking because the psychology of abuse is kind of freaking me out. I have the ability to really control this relationship if I want to (I don't) and her stunted relationships with people in general, and men in particular means she has no idea how I should be acting. What specifically can I do to begin to help foster a right understanding in her of a healthy relationship?

A quick background on her: deeply religious parents, and while I have deepy religious parents as well, her mother is clearly unstable. Would lock her in her room on weeknights in highschool, steal her keys so she couldn't leave the house, and yell at her for long periods of time while she would lay unresponsive on her bed. They had complete access to her phone and Facebook, leaving no room for privacy of any kind, and tell her things like ""God will never love you"", ""Why can't you just be happy"", ""You're ruining everything"" etc. There's more, but that should give you a picture.
 
(The following is the very brief version of the story)

So about a year ago we started talking, and then when I found out how her parents treated her, I challenged her to understand that their response was not normal. She was struggling with anxiety and depression and a compulsive disorder (pulling hair) and so I implored her to seek counseling. Through counseling she has dealt with all of these issues and has become a much happier person. But she has not yet challenged or separated herself from her parents. She is going to soon, with the help a guidance of her counselor. Once that issue is dealt with, we are going to officially ""start"" our relationship (we live about 5 hours apart right now, but I'll be moving into her town, by coincidence, starting in the summer).

I really care about this girl. She's beautiful, incredibly intelligent, and the most compassionate person I have ever met. But this relationship has deeply affected her ability to relate to people. She has never dated, or had any kind of intimate relationship with a man before. 

As far as I'm concerned, I'm very well equipped to deal with these issues. I've worked as a student intern in hospital and prison counseling centers. I've read a lot of material on abuse and trauma because of this (like books worth) so I have a solid grasp of the situation and how to counsel her through it. But being a counselor is not being a boyfriend. 

TL;DR Does anyone who has been in a relationship with someone who was abused have any words of advice/warning? "

21x90i,18,2014-04-01,Going through a tough storm. Prayers/advice appreciated.,[deleted],TrueChristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/21x90i/going_through_a_tough_storm_prayersadvice/,"Hey guys, first off I'd like to say God is good. I've been battling with a lot of things here in the past few months, but I want to give you guys a bit of backstory first.

If you ever heard of Passion it's basically one of the biggest christian conferences known for their annual spiritual awakenings of young adults. Anyway it was there that I felt God calling me to ministry. If you want I can give you the story on how that went down via message, but that's not the reason I'm posting this.

No, I'm posting this because after Passion I decided to get more involved in church. I intern for my church's youth pastor and help with teaching, organizing lessons, leading youth events, and the like. On  top of that I'm finishing up school, so at times it can be a bit overwhelming. For the longest I've been battling my addiction with drugs and it's a battle I feel like I'm losing. Satan knows this and is constantly giving me temptations that lead me away from the church. 

I want to be clean for God, for my church, and for the kids that look up to me. But it's just so hard. I'm not the best when it comes to dealing with stress so I sometimes find ways to just, ""Get away"". And sure I can find better things to do with my time, but one of the reasons I do drugs in the first place is for recreational purposes with my friends. I don't want to lose them either and I don't see them getting clean anytime soon. Now I don't necessarily condemn drugs like weed and stuff like that, but it's something that I can't be doing with the line of work I want to get in to.

Basically what I'm asking for is some solid advice, and prayers are always a good thing. What do you guys think would be the best thing for me to do?"

I don't have the creative freedom here, and I'm not certain that it's the place for me to succeed.

One of the issues I'm running into is my workload.  I've been here a year, and I've been on over 40 projects with anywhere from 3-100 different elements in the project (we do custom signage and architectural elements) and ranging in price from $5k-$4mil.  Each element requires site drawings and engineering, and I'll do upwards of 15-20 pages of engineering drawings for a single complex design complete with product research/BOM, electrical diagrams, finishes, etc.  I'll often be working on drawing 2-3 projects at once, while working production support for another 2 or 3, and aiding installation for another job.  Recently I've been added to the business development team and helping out on estimating as well. Deadlines usually range from 2-3 days (small projects) to 2-3 months (large projects).

I'm still pretty new (1yr), so I haven't gotten entirely into the groove, and am noticing that my design training isn't the best for translating into drafting/design engineering.

I guess I'm looking for some perspective.

21xvgy,3,2014-04-01,My [28/m] fiancee [29/f] has been lying to me about a past relationship. How do I approach this situation?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/21xvgy/my_28m_fiancee_29f_has_been_lying_to_me_about_a/,"X-post from r/advice...

My fiancee and I have been together for two years. Before we started dating and before she and I even started hanging out, she would talk fondly of a certain friend from her school (we met during a summer internship.) I asked if they had ever dated, and she said no. No big deal, as I didn't care at the time. We weren't interested in each other at this point, so I took her statement as honest.

We start dating about a month later, and about two weeks after we start dating she sat me down and told me that she and this guy actually had hooked up...and emphasizes they hooked up once. I was upset that she lied, and I also felt the normal amount of jealousy that anyone feels when they hear stories about their sig-o's ex. As time went by and our relationship progressed, I became okay with the idea that she had an ex-lover of sorts, but still uneasy about her lying.

Flash forward about a year. She gets all nervous all of the sudden one night while we're about to go to sleep, and then tells me that she lied to me, she actually slept with this guy on more than one occasion. It hurt...again hearing about her ex-whatever, but more this time because she had lied to me. Her excuse was, ""I didn't want to upset you, that's why I didn't tell you."" So, I ask more questions, and get what I think is the whole story. But after that, I couldn't shake this feeling that she was still holding something back from me. I tried to talk about my hurt feelings several times, but she would yell at me, telling me I need to forgive her and not hold on to it. The real problem, she said, was that I wasn't forgiving her.

I should add at this point, this is the ONLY thing I've ever not trusted her. She's always honest with me and is usually very straightforward with me. I know she loves me dearly. She's very good at showing it and telling me daily. I feel very secure in our relationship, with this issue being the one thing that gave me even the slightest pause. But, she told me what happened and kept insisting that I knew the extent of it. It was the end of that saga (or so I thought...)

For the most part, I have remained relatively forgiving and forgetful about the incident. I haven't let it bother me at all, and it's been nice moving to the same city and building our lives together.
But yesterday, I'm taking a nap after she and I practice our wedding dance (we're getting married in June.) I have a really weird dream that involves my fiancee and her ex-whatever. In my dream, the two of them are working at the same place where I work.

After I wake up, and get that weird feeling again that I used to get...that she wasn't being very honest with me. So, while she's in the shower, I do something really dumb---I look through her phone. I find 1) a grouptext with her friends where they ask her about it and she says straight up ""He doesn't know the whole story."" 2) An email between her and this guy from the summer when we met, after we started dating, telling him ""sorry for not being there to accept your call. I was out drinking with my friends."" That day, however, was a day that she and I left a work thing early and went back to watch a movie at her place. There was no drinking. No party. No bar. 3) An email to this guy at the end of the summer saying that she didn't want to be with him because his temper was just too much. No mention of the fact that she was already telling me she wanted to be with me long-term. No mention of me at all. Very weird.

So now I'm left with this issue. She lied to me, but the only reason I know is because I looked through her phone, which was a stupid thing to do and a breach of privacy. I know that's stupid. But I want to know what to do! How do I talk with her about this.

I don't care about their past relationship, really, as long as she didn't cheat on me. My problem is the trust. All of the sudden, I'm calling into question my trust I have for this person who, up until yesterday, I thought was very honest with me. It turns out she was lying about something we've talked about A LOT, and that makes me question how honest she is about other things as well. It wasn't like she forgot, and it wasn't like this topic wasn't something we've talked about several times (mostly right after she told me.)
What do I do?

21yu5t,2,2014-04-01,Student Loan Question + PF question: graduated pmt plan actually costs more in interest than a straight pmt plan?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/21yu5t/student_loan_question_pf_question_graduated_pmt/,"Will be graduating in May from a CSU school. I transferred from a junior college, which saved me some money on loans. These are UNsubsidized Stafford loans @ 6.8% interest. My principle is $15,000 and the interest accrued (I have not made a single pmt towards it) is currently $1819.05 for a total of $16,819.05

I was watching the required video that explains that basically I will have to be paying back this loan, loan officers' roles in the collection process, and a few of the different methods of paying. A couple questions:

1) Why does is it that the graduated repayment, which increases the monthly fee every two years, [actually costs more in the long run with interest](http://imgur.com/kpHky7m)? 

2) Is there anyway I can try to get a lower interest rate? 

 I plan on paying at least double the monthly bill amount to try to knock this out as soon as possible. I have had a good job all throughout college, but I have blown all my money essentially (couple trips, owned a motorcycle, bought a car) except the money I have in my retirement plan at my job. Even with all these expenditures honestly I should still have like $20,000 saved but I digress. Thankfully, my car is a 2002 I bought used outright, and I have no bills other than this loan + my rent and stuff when i move out. I have a job lined up making a little over 50k- so I'm planning on turning a full 180 and becoming extremely financially responsible.

At the beginning of this year I started an internship at a financial firm, and have since been absolutely enlightened and hate myself for wasting money. The internship plus this sub has helped me and I plan on saving (already started) an emergency fund of about $5000 (for now), saving a few grand to move out, pay the loan, and invest in some indexed MFs every month. 

Can you guys answer my loan question and give me your thoughts on my financial position now as well?

Last summer I had an internship with the company ranked as the highest paying internship in the country. I was one of the few interns to not receive a return offer because my internship position no longer existed as a full time position due to a restructuring in hiring. I go to one of the top schools in the country and I've been rigorously applying to jobs since September. I've had many interviews but have not received a single job offer. All of my friends now have offers and I'm going to be graduating in 4 weeks- possibly without a job lined up.
I'm still waiting to hear from one company where I thought I did very well interviewing but since it's been a week since my final interview and I haven't heard anything I'm afraid they are going to reject me too. I'm not sure if I'll be able to pick myself back up again after this rejection. I've been fighting for the past few months to keep trying but looking at the deadline for graduation fast approaching I don't know if I can get anywhere with any other company in that time.
I'm quickly losing faith in my ability to do things and am struggling to finish up my last month of school. I can't even be excited for graduation because all I see waiting for me afterward is failure and I honestly don't think I could live with myself if I reached that point. The only feeling I have felt in the past 3 months is stress and the anxiety and depression that it brings. I have fought my whole life coming from one of the poorest counties in the country to get to this point and now I feel like I've worked so hard for nothing. I'm so tired. I just can't fight anymore..."

21zdyy,1,2014-04-01,[Rant] Just tired of constant worrying and self-loathing,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/21zdyy/rant_just_tired_of_constant_worrying_and/,"Hi everyone. First a little about me, I guess. I'm a junior in college, have a part-time gig on work-study and have a little over a 3.5 GPA as of now. I'm introverted, mainly keep to myself and have a tremendous knack for bottling my emotions and leaving myself exhausted from thinking and worrying. The past couple years (i.e. since I've started college) I've struggled with my self-esteem and have been in and out of counseling. I have contemplated suicide on more than one occasion. I am slightly-to-moderately overweight and really consider myself unattractive. I've had a couple relationships but nothing serious at all. I drink more than I should, don't really exercise and don't eat right. I know that these actions lead to me feeling so shitty in the long-run, but the short-run dopamine release is what keeps me coming back to it. Anything to calm me down.


I've had the toughest time in college and with life overall as of late. I shouldn't complain, I truly have a great life and some great people in it. I'm just extremely scared of the future is all. I'm in a major which I'm not sure I want to be in, but it's too late to change it my junior year is over in 2 months. I'm 21 years old, I don't know where the hell I'm going, and it scares the ever-loving shit out of me. I'm afraid of more advanced classes because they typically involve group-work and hefty papers, both of which I struggle with. I've always had friends, but always preferred to be alone. I also suck at writing. School takes up a majority of my stress because, my mother in particular, always instilled the necessity for academic success. This is both a blessing and a curse because if I don't do well in EVERYTHING school-related, I immediately feel inadequate and inferior, yet I've done great thus far (knock on wood). However, I'm unsure if my particular course of study is what I like, but I'm too far in and need about 4 classes over the next two semesters to graduate. My adviser seems disinterested in me, and I haven't spoken with him since my late freshman/early sophomore year.


I'm living with my father, and things were great initially, but now his fiancee moved into our little apartment and I cannot stand it. She's from another town and does not drive, so she just louses around our apartment all day. She takes walks to smoke cigarettes, but tries to be all secret about it, as if I give a fuck. My parents divorced when I was 19 and now my dad is already engaged, and I bitterly despise it deep down. I can't say it though because I feel like he'd say I'm ""being selfish"" or how he ""does everything"" just like I've been hearing for years now. I would love to move out but I only have $1000 to my name. I wish I could stop feeling bitter, but I just wish my home could have my own personal space, just like how it was when I was growing up. They went to Washington to get her stuff to bring back and I noticed they brought real estate books, so I feel like they're ready to move and I'm holding them back.


My mom lives on the other side of the state and I don't talk to her as much as I probably should. She often tells me to not worry so much, as well as how she's so proud of me for how I've turned out. I'm an only child so I know that talking to me means a lot to her. I was given the option of living with either my mother or father when they split up in 2012, and, in hindsight, I wish I would have moved in with my mother. It seems her and my soul are tied together, as corny as it sounds. We are so much alike and I regret that I didn't appreciate her as much before she moved.


What I want is just some security. To know I'm doing the right thing. I've always been in control, but I feel like I'm just going through the motions even though it's something I'm not entirely sure of in uncharted territory. I've heard so much about how I'm still young and it'll all work out but I'm not sure how much to trust it. All of my friends are doing study abroad, or taking vacations, or doing internships. Then there's me, stuck in idle. A dull hum. I just have heard about the glory days of college; but these years have drained me, and still continue to do so. I'm just scared about what's next.

Thanks for listening."

As much of an introverted, self-centered asshole I am, I love you little guy.

You're ten months old and you can't help it. But I can't be your part time parent anymore.

You see, I'm 19 and I'm my third year of college. I am hardly on campus because I have to take care of you while mom and dad work. 

I was against you being conceived in the first place. I told mom and dad not to do it. That we couldn't afford you. And truth be told, we have even less money now because of you. 

I never knew how much you would affect my life until now. I never knew...now I have a taste of how hard some young parents have it. 

I love you but the fact that we're poor has made me desperately selfish. 

I have to graduate from college. I have to do internships and join clubs and get experience. I have to get a career and rise above this lower-middle-class bullshit. 

I can't do it when I'm playing daddy for you. I can't do it when I have you for most of the day. I can't do it when you want me to hold you while I have to look for jobs and internship positions.

And yet, you're so sweet. You're so tender and innocent. Your smiles and your giggles are beautiful. Your clumsiness and the way your quickly crawl away when I'm about to catch you is utterly cute. 

I love the moments when I have you all to myself when I get all my work done. I love it when you fall asleep on my chest while I rock you on the hammock. 

And I feel guilty for sometimes wishing you were never born. I feel guilty when your endless, piercing cries drill into my skull and make me want to strangle you. 

I still can't get over how irresponsible mom and dad were when they had you. Their own financial problems are now their own fault and their children have to suffer for it. You, like both your brothers, were an accident. We were all accidents. 

Maybe it was youthful ignorance? Maybe it was unhindered, curious passion? Maybe it was desperation? Maybe it was foolish love? Our parents made the mistake of having me when they were just starting their lives. They threw away their chances of getting an education and moving up.

Then they had your older brother. What could have motivated them? What made them think another child would made things any easier? 

Then they had you. And you know what?? What they did to themselves 19 years ago, they're doing to their own son. They're holding me back.

Yes, baby brother, this is selfishness. 

I don't want to be like my parents, I don't want this middle-class helplessness. I envy the rich. I envy those who have the means to control their lives and *by god* I will have it.

Good-bye. Sleep well. "
220cq2,7,2014-04-02,"To all you introverts with ambitions to go to college, *do extra curricular activities*",Wromo,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/220cq2/to_all_you_introverts_with_ambitions_to_go_to/,"Extracurriculars are a hell of a lot more important than you think. 

I'm an introvert. When I was in high school, I rarely stepped outside my comfort zone and I did not value how much getting involved with groups, clubs, and activities would affect my future. 

Sure, people say extracurriculars and things like that are important but what has pissed me off about my experience is how much they didn't emphasize its *sheer fucking importance*. The adults in my life weren't as frantic about it as say ""don't drink and drive!"", ""don't do drugs!"", ""have safe sex!"". 

And even when they did talk about it, their voice tones and pretty much the way they talked about getting involved wasn't really all that concerned. Hence, I didn't take it seriously, not as seriously as high GPA's and SAT's. 

What's happening I me now is that whenever I look at my resume I have to bullshit some parts so so that it looks like I have some experience in...whatever the hell I'm applying for. 

It pains me to bullshit my way through scholarship applications, leaving blanks for ""leadership"" positions. And although I have some volunteering experience under my belt, seriously, what I've done has nothing to do with job experience and having helped out at a book-fair once or twice doesn't count as customer service. 

I underestimated how much extracurricular and leadership positions were important not just in college admissions offices and scholarship committees but also in internship applications and on-campus jobs.

Hence, the mistake I did was this: I did the bare minimum. I got excellent grades overall but 0 extracurriculars. Why? I liked my free time. Plus it would have required that I step out of my comfort zone a little.

If you fill out a college or scholarship application and you leave a blank where it says ""leadership or extracurricular activities"", you're doing yourself a HUGE FUCKING DISFAVOR.

If you're still in high school and you're not doing anything besides school-get out of the house. NOW.

Do something at school besides class. Student gov, key club, reading club, doesn't matter get involved. 

Volunteer and shit, that shows altruism and that you care (or at least appear that you care) about your ""community"". That impresses people. 

Just do more than what's required of you and your resume, your applications for college, and pretty much everything else about you that ought to impress people will look all the more better.

I know it's easier said than done but *get out* or you're gonna regret your lack of any experience in anything. "

I'm a student at an engineering school in Michigan, and my curriculum is set up so that 6 months out of the year (3 months on, 3 months off) I will be working at a paid internship at the company I choose (and get offered to work at, obviously). I recieved an offer from a company in San Diego that is willing to pay me 15/hr. I just have a few questions, because I really want to take the offer, but I also want to make sure I'm not moving back to school broke.

1) Is $15/hr, 40 hours a week enough money to sustain yourself in a place like San Diego? Will I be able to put money away to live off of while I'm at school?

2) How is transportation? I would love to be able to bike to work every day, and I currently don't own a car.

3) Are there a lot of places for temporary housing? What are typical rent prices? My work is near Montgomery Field, so living somewhat close to there would be nice, although I'm not against living close to the beach.

4) Any other good advice from people that have moved there or lived there their whole life? I just want to learn as much as possible about the city before I decide to commit.

I'm not happy and I'm scared of everything so all this pain I'm going through, there won't really be any pay out. I will always hurt because I am a failure at everything and because I can't progress. Pretty shitty future. And I woke up feeling practically the same way.

Okay, so I don't know how to kill myself quite yet. I just want to do some research before I do it on the off chance that it doesn't work and to make sure that my cat is taken care of after I'm gone. But instead of killing myself, I opened up the site of the college that I can attend practically for free because of my father's military benefits and started glancing through majors.

But what I don't think anyone in my life gets is that I'm not lazy when it comes to schooling. I'm just terrified, of every little thing and every detail. I have trouble motivating myself because I don't see any worth in the future when I know I'm not cut out for anything, I'm worthless at everything, I meaning nothing to everyone.

How do I choose a major when I hate everything about myself? I love to learn, sure. But then I get into the specifics and panic when I see I have to apply for other programs, do internships, figure out a living situation. It is so much at once... how do I do it all? And on my own! Because I'm twenty and, having parents who do not 'believe' in depression, I should be able to do anything and everything.

It's not true and I feel like such a failure because of it. I just keep feeling like I'm not supposed to be here because... what can I do? I can't even choose a major because I can't concentrate my thoughts enough to know what I'm interested in and I think I am fucking terrible at everything!

Ugh just... why am I here?"

So im kinda stuck right now, and im not sure what to do.

See to explain the situation a little better, I currently have an internship with a company, i am working on designing a arduino shield that will be controlling a water pump basically. Im doing everything with it, Software and hardware with the assistance of some hardware and software people, but im essentially doing it on my own.

We want to make it into a shield so when they go into production they're easy to assemble (only talking about 100 unites or so) This company is only more recently gotten into the electronics side of things and therefore does not use a lot of the ""professional"" tools available. By that i mean, what they normally use for schematics and PCB design is expressPCB. I personally know eagle quite well and i have been given the ok to use it. IF i can get boards manufactured.

Here is were i am stuck. I have never had a board manufactured from an eagle .brd, ive done some of my own but mainly those were breakout boards. What i am afraid of is that, if i say use eagle, then send the board out for prototyping, how do i know i am making the traces the right size, the holes, the vias, spacing, general alignment  etc all the right size? I assume there is even other things involved with getting your boards made too. 

What i am worried about is that i am not going to be able to actually send my boards out for printing, or when i do i will make a major mistake in something. With their PCBexpress software i dont have to worry about that because well it does it for you..i think. But i dont really know how to use that software and from what i have used of it, its a big big downgrade from eagle.

So i guess im just looking for some advice, Should i go with eagle? Or do you think i am risking it to much? Maybe some tutorials or something i could follow to learn more and become more confident? What do you guys things?

Thanks!"

I've recently been given the opportunity to take a 4 month internship position with the Hong Kong Standards and Testing Centre at their office in Dalang, Dongguan. Does anybody have any experience with the company or any info on the area? What I know so far is I will be living in one of the staff dormitories on site, and will be fed meals in their canteen, with the option of purchasing my own meals off site as well. 

I've read that Dongguan is big on the sex trade, but the government seems to be cracking down on that recently. How safe of an area is it for foreigners to live in (I'm Canadian)?

221r4e,0,2014-04-02,Investing &amp; Financial Journalism,bgritzut,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/221r4e/investing_financial_journalism/,"For new investors, understanding the entire investing ecosystem can be a daunting task. This can be attributed to the fact that there is no step-by-step instructions booklet to help investors make the correct decisions throughout the process (because arguably, there is no such thing as the correct decision; each person has their own unique situation).


This is complicated by the fact that for new investors, their first exposure to investments is likely some form of (free) financial journalism. It is exponentially harder for those with little to no background in economics, accounting, personal finance to question the advice given which can be filled with holes and sometimes, even outright wrong.


Take the following article for example - [How Warren Buffett blew it with Exxon Mobil by Barry Ritholtz](http://business.financialpost.com/2013/11/20/how-warren-buffet-blew-it-with-exxon-mobil/?__lsa=ea0b-cad9)


In the article, the author's thesis is that Buffett had sold his holdings of Exxon too early (in the 80's), and he would have made a better investment decision had he held onto it (this article was spurred by the news that Buffett had recently took a position in Exxon). He notes that, 


&gt; Buffett had previously owned Exxon, back in 1984. And he blew that trade in the same way many rookie traders ruin a good investment — by taking profits too early.


By his own calculations, he figures that,


&gt; In 1985, Buffett sold Exxon at $6.75 — it was a fast 44 percent gain in less than two years. Seems pretty hard to argue with that.


and that,


&gt; ...original ~$173 million dollar purchase would be worth about $3 billion today. That’s a back of the envelope return of 1,946 percent. And while a 44 percent return is good, a 1,946 percent is better.


Hopefully you can see the flaw in the last statement. The 44% return and the 1,946% return is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The 44% return was for 2 years (beginning of 1983 to end of 1984) and the 1,946% return is for 31 years (beginning of 1983 to end of 2013).


An apples-to-apples comparison would require you to annualize the returns giving you 20%, the annualized return during the 2 years that Buffett held Exxon, and 9.4% for the hypothetical holding period of 29 years (from when he sold Exxon, beginning of 1985 to the end of 2013). In other words, that 9.4% needs to satisfy x in the following equation.


(1.20)^2 * (1+x)^29 = 19.46


But now the question remains, did Buffett sell too early?


Near the end of the article, the author notes that,


&gt; There is, of course, one last caveat to consider: Opportunity cost...He certainly did better with the reinvested dollars than most of us would have done.


After selling Exxon, was Buffett able to invest in something else that yielded an annualized return higher than 9.4%? Clearly this contradicts the author's original thesis that Buffett sold Exxon too early. Buffett was able to use the proceeds from the sale of Exxon and invested for a return higher than 9.4% per year.


A good reporter would have used the annualized number to arrive at the correct conclusion. A better reporter would have taken it a step further and identified other possible investments Buffett could have made at the time and showing us the range of possible returns (and risk-adjusted returns) had he bought those stocks instead (although I concede that may be going overboard for a simple article). Another potential question would be what the returns would look like had he held on for an additional year or two.


[Barry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Ritholtz) apparently has quite the resume:


&gt; Prior to founding Ritholtz Wealth Management, Ritholtz was CEO of Fusion IQ, prior to that chief market strategist at Maxim Group in New York, an investment bank with about $5 billion under management


I would hope that a chief market strategist at a hedge fund knew how to annualize returns and the concept of opportunity cost.


This is an example of poor financial journalism. It almost feels as if it was written by a first year financial journalism intern paid to write the article for Barry in order to get the later more coverage in the press.


If you are investing based on articles you read online, you really should question the merits of the thesis and learn to research (or at the very least fact check) for yourself. Always assume that nobody is out to help you earn money for free. Articles can be click-bait, self-serving, pump-and-dumps, [politically driven](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/the-will-to-believe/), fails to adequately cover risks, poorly researched, and even completely wrong."

Also...potential long distance?",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/221taz/f25_multiple_dates_w_m36_i_think_what_is_going_on/,"First off, I have around ZERO romantic experience! 

The down-low is, despite the slight age gap (not bothersome), he and I get along great. We have a lot in common, are both non-traditional undergrads here at this university, he is a good human being and I genuinely enjoy his company, I believe he enjoys mine, etc.. The general chemistry is there. We've known each other for a little over a year, but have only really started interacting as much as we do presently within the past couple of months...the last few weeks especially. I do know he recently came out of another relationship. Unsure how long he has been single, though.

We've been on a couple of outings together, alone. Drinks/food, for which he has always demanded on paying all or most of my portion (I want to mention I do aid with tipping and insisted on splitting the bill once). The first time, he told me he was paying me back for doing some photography for him, and mentioned he is aware of my financial issues -- which, as he explained, was why he was so willing to do this for me. But, what about the other times following this one? It always comes in the form of us being together somehow, and him randomly asking me what I am doing and ""would you like to get a bite somewhere?"" I say yes, because...well, I like spending time with the guy. Sounds like we've been dating, right? Are these dates? We also have spent a lot of time together in non-pub/restaurant settings, just hanging, sometimes with mutual friends. It's all been very agreeable. I reciprocate by baking him things, buying him coffee when I can, that sort of stuff.

We've hugged, twice...one time he initiated it while slightly drunk, and the second time I basically ambushed him in congrats after his recital. Both were of the warm, enveloping, full-body kind. No other physical contact between us is had except for when he's had a little to drink, and might try to touch me on my shoulder. I'm aware this is all considered flirty behaviour. During sober times, however, he seems hesitant to touch me, and I am an awkward person as well, so I become hesitant and second guess everything...and...yeah. We'll sit close to one another, at least.

Do you think he's in to me? Sounds like it, right? Time spent with one another has really escalated in the past three or four weeks, but not once has the word ""date"" or the uttering of ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" ever emerged, though my friends say it is a little obvious. Honestly, I would say yes in a heartbeat if he ever asked me to be his girlfriend, even on a casual basis, but I think he may be afraid of rejection, or of our age gap (his ex was closer to his age), or...something?

Reddit, how do I proceed? I believe it should be my turn to ask him ""out"", maybe like a hike or something. Do you think he is in to me, or simply being friendly? Should I just outright ask if we are dating? I want to let things flow naturally, but at the same time, I feel like there is *something* holding him back from *something*, unless I am not reading him correctly...and at the same time, my own inexperience is certainly not helping.

Also, though I think I may be developing feelings for him, I wonder if anything of this sort would even be a good idea at all. I will be quite gone for a summer internship in a few short months, and then abroad for half a year following that...so, does that mean we shouldn't try to be ""in a relationship"" even if he really IS in to me? Because of the whole distance thing? He is aware I'll be gone, and seemed introspective about the fact...and yet, still the ambiguous dating(?) continues. I just have no idea what the appropriate next step should be, if there is one to be had at all.

* **Bridal Shower** - It's your special day, you're in your dream gown, you've given your vows, cut the cake, had the first dance, and then you left your new husband behind for a bit. You said you just needed to take care of something, but now you're in the dressing room getting hot and sweaty with -- who? The best man? Your ex? The groom's father? Your own father? Any/all of the above plus more? You decide.

* **I've got what you need** - Maybe I can decide who gets that promotion, that new position with the corner office, that internship, tickets to the show, maybe I can help your son/daughter make the team, or make sure your husband gets hired, maybe I've got a quick way for you to make a month's worth of rent plus extra... Whatever it is, you may not like it, but you're just desperate enough to try.

* **No sex in the Champagne Room!** - You've got a reputation, deserved or otherwise, for going the extra mile for clients who can afford your time. You're a goddess and you know it, with no end of potential clients who want to take you upstairs. You pick me out of the crowd, maybe 'cuz I'm just like every cocky ass-hole you dated in high school, maybe because I actually act like a gentleman. Either way, we go upstairs and decide to see how deep my pocketbook is.

I'm open to plenty of other ideas or suggestions, so if you've got a craving let me know. Worst case scenario I'll say no, but I'll probably at least try and work something out with you.

And as always I'm also up for just chatting in general. Of course, if I had my way I would want to hear about every time you decided to stop being faithful and get yourself a real man for the night, or maybe that time you decided your asshole boyfriend/husband deserved a little payback. Or maybe those times when they just weren't around and you needed a good fuck. Wild spring break stories are also awesome. Let me hear it all, even if you would rather chat about something else."

Looking for advice.",Zerbo,ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/2222b0/failed_my_internship_trying_to_pick_up_the_pieces/,"Wall of text incoming, title says it all. Started medic school in January '13, finished didactic with a 96%, breezed through graded simulations and the oral board final. Had a blast in clinicals, got very good reviews from the nurses and MDs. Then I got assigned to a preceptor who has a reputation for having never passed an intern. It was okay in the beginning... I have never worked in the 911 system, my only experience being two years at an IFT company and around 250 hours of ALS ride-alongs. So I knew I was going into my internship with an experience deficit, and tried my best to overcome. Preceptor was of the mindset that the field internship isn't a time to learn, it's a time to show that I know exactly what I'm doing in every situation. Needless to say, I did not. I went on many calls I had never encountered before, so I felt consistently behind the curve. On a personal level, my preceptor and I were about as polar opposites as could be. He was very much the alpha type personality, wants everyone to know that he's in charge and his way of doing things is the only way he finds acceptable. I, on the other hand, have been an introvert most my life but will step up when I need to. My scene presence wasn't to his liking, and I never received feedback other than ""quit fucking up.""

 At station he would have me eat standing up in the app bay because I ""hadn't earned the right to sit down"" yet. He would refer to me as ""intern fuckhead"" in front of the fire crew, ER staff, and even patients. While I didn't take these types of things personally, it wore on me to the point where I dreaded each shift and hated being there. My preceptor was also disposed to saying things like, ""Are you sure you're not Jewish? Because you run calls like a fucking Jew."" I'm not Jewish so I wasn't necessarily offended, but I had no idea how to even take that. He would call out for entire shift cycles at a time, but not telling me until I had already shown up to each shift and called him to see if he was coming in. On the whole our interaction was just bizarrely and exclusively negative. I assumed these things were a normal part of the internship and tried my best to suck it up, and it wasn't until I talked with some of my classmates about their internships that I realized my experience was far from normal. Everything got under my skin and I began frequently making mistakes. No med errors or anything critical, just not calling for equipment quickly enough or verbalizing every step of my thought process. My preceptor began telling me on shift 10 of 22 that he was deciding to fail me or keep me going on a call-to-call basis. With that hanging over my head, I made even more mistakes. Finally on shift 20, he failed me. I was the eighth intern that he had failed... out of eight.

I accept responsibility for my failure, since it was my fault that I let my preceptor get under my skin and it affected my ability to adequately care for my patients. But he failed me the day before my class graduation. I attended to support my classmates and sat in the back, and it was the hardest experience of my life. I was the only one in my class to fail internship.

My school's policy is that I cannot repeat my internship (with a different preceptor, it goes without saying) until the next class has begun their field internships. In nine months. I'll also have to repeat graded simulations and oral board examinations. Until then I'm going to go back to my old, crooked IFT company (who was recently raided by the FBI for Medicare fraud) because I know they'll work around my schedule of ride-alongs and bring me back at my old pay. In the meantime, I've been in a heavy depression. I don't leave the house unless I need to go get food or something else vital. I lost my girlfriend of four years and nearly all of my friends during the didactic portion of class since I had no time for anything else, and I'm almost entirely alone. I'm trying hard to keep it all in perspective, but it's been rough.

I still want to be a paramedic more than anything else, but trying to summon up the drive to go through this long haul again is proving difficult. 15 months and my life savings culminated in being failed after 20 shifts.

So with the backstory aside, any advice from those who have failed or repeated internships? How did you manage it? Did it get easier the second time around? Is there a stigma against those who have to repeat their internships to pass? Any advice or encouragement would really be appreciated."

Ok, so it's 10.20am on the East coast of Australia as I begin to write this. Thanks to time differences and a lack of sleep, I've managed to somehow keep myself drunk, yet awake and lucid enough to type this beauty out for you story munchers. 

Now, my husband and I, in our newly minted marriage, unfortunately don't get to spend a lot of time with one another anymore. Either I'm travelling from site to site to fix fuck ups usually caused by someone tripping voer cords and ripping them out, and my one true drinking partner is travelling all over the world as an engineer, usually for fortnightly stints. So when we have the opportunity to be with one another, we make a nice day/night/2am out of it, with some nice food, drink, and romping. 

Now, my husband was/is (I don't fucking know anymroe) in Melbourne. To my delight, yesterday (I actually don't know now. Days are over rated) I had to fly down there due to a ""catastrophic"" IT server failure (whoever managed to call me down there is now getting a stern talking to). So yay! 2 nights in Melbourne with my husband, and a good scotch. Scotchy scotch stochh...

I fly down, fix the ""complete and utter"" failure of a few unplugged ethernet cords, and skip happily over to my husbands temporary apartment for and early dinner. We meet, do the do, and wash off our shame as we prepare to go to some swanky place with expensive fish n' shit to eat on our company's dollar (gotta love that daily food allowance).

And how lovely we felt and looked! We had not been able to eat dinner with each other for a full month, only being able to scrape a half day together every now and then. We were prepared for a nice, peaceful dinner and drinks.

But no.

Fuck this. Fuck everything. Fuck.

I can not believe how angry I'm getting over what is probably a mild FPS. Sorry folks. I mean, I'm tired, hungry, and sans husband. Warpath is my name, and currently my interns will be in my way today. Sorry to any of you if you're reading.

We elegantly float down to the restaurant in the city, and are taken to our seats by a beautiful spanish woman whose hair I wish I could scalp off and wear.

Seated and with wine on the way out, we examine our menus, making a bit of small talk, enjoying each others company, when lo and fucking behold, my husbands client hobbles into the restaurant entrance.

I only noticed this, because my husband managed to get a glance at him at the front, and immediately hid behind his menu. 

Now, this man... he was fat. Oh yes. Not your normal ""An extra few pounds from workin in an office"" fat... this was ""My keyboard wont work because my fupa is on it"" fat.

From our table, we hear the fairly one sided conversation go as so...

&gt; Well, I want a damn table then! I see plenty are free!

&gt; Of course I don't have to make a reservation, do you know who I am?!

&gt; I need some food, I want to give your restaurant money! Why won't you let me in?

I catch a glance of him poking his head into the main eating area, trying to find someone he knew. And lo and fucking behold...

&gt; See! I'm with those two! Hey [husbands name]! I knew you had a table waiting for me!

Oh christ oh fuck oh arrrrghhhHHHH.

The spanish lady, clearly just wanting to pass him off to someone else and get more people seated, brings him over, gives me an apologetic look, and speedily rushes away, leaving our waiter to deal with this fucking monstrosity of a man.

&gt; [Husband], so glad to see you here! I really needed something to eat, and these stingy fuckers don't seem to understand that my money is as good as the people who decided to make a reservation.

&gt; Yes... sure... well, this dinner was only really between myself and my wife...

&gt; Don't be silly! I'll just get an extra chair and we can all enjoy some food!

Now, I try to be civil. I mean, sure, this was meant to only be for us, and I had one more night in Melbourne. If this dude is a client for my husband, I'm willing to put up with him to ensure contracts are kept, and peace is held. Doesn't mean that I don't get to be stern as fuck though.

&gt; Haw haw, well, may as well get to ordering then! Lets see...

He proceeds to call over our server, and ask detailed questions about all the the food, from where the steak was from (ITS WRITTEN ON THE FUCKING MENU), to the freshness of ingredients, and various other inappropriate questions for such an establishment. This was the kind of place we indulged in because we KNEW it was fresh and good.

&gt; Well, I do like [most expensive menu item]...

He looks over at us expectingly. My husband just looks straight at the waiter and says:

&gt; We'll be splitting cheques, if thats ok.

And with a nod and a quick scribble of his pen, the server/waiter/whatever took down this fat fucks oder, which kind of just happened to be one of the cheapest items on the menu.

My husband and I then proceed to make our order, a couple of the more medium priced items on the menu, as the abomination accross from us gave us a slightly evil eye.

&gt; You know, if we had pooled our money, we could have all gotten something nice...

I just looked at him. Unblinking. My paitience for this dude was waring from ""put up with him because he is a clietn"" to ""I'm two sentences away from curb stomping you"".

So we try and make small talk together, and while it was akward, it sort of worked. Sort of. I didn't talk much, and apparently this confused the ham.

&gt; Why are you so quiet? Are you frigid or something? Haha, I bet your work doesn't like you chatting too much in the oiffce!

wat

wat

wat

&gt; Excuse me?!

&gt; No need to get all offended! I just thought all women enjoyed some gossip.

&gt; Well no, I don't. Silence is golden.

And with that, I downed every last bit of that $40 a glass wine I had sitting on my table, and proceeded to ask for another one. And another. Anything to stop me from having to talk.

And that's where it began to really go down hill.

&gt; Haw haw, how do you deal with this untamed one [husband]? I bet she must be a menace at home!

&gt; Look, can you please stop making such remarks so loudly? 

&gt; Come on, we're paying enough for this place, we can do waht we want!

&gt; It doesn't really work like that, *mate*

As the last vowel passed over my husbands lips, the waiter/server/fuckyou brang over our meals, smelling incredibly tasty. As it's getting into the ""colder"" months (holy shit, it's getting down to 10C! Fuckin freexing!), the Autum/winter menus had been released, and we silently ate our roast meat, soups, and myself, a rissoto, because fuck the system. I eat summer food in the winter, like a rebel.

At least he was a quiet eater.

Figuring that the food may have clamed down the beetus monster, I pipe up, asking my husband how his soup was.

&gt; Oh yes, quite lovely. I haven't had pumpkin in ages, and this is probably the best soup I've ever had

&gt; HA. Why don't you eat something with some more protein? You need to make sure you don't get used to your wife's rabbit food cooking and deciding to order it as swanky resturants

I just looked at him

Unblinking

Unthil he shut the fuck up. 

As we finish, the server/waiter/slave came and brought us our desert menues. Deciding to switch to a desert wine as well, I order the incredibly rich and delicious chocolate death cake, and my husband orders two fruit/custard tart thingies that looked fucking amazing. And they were.

&gt; Ugh, why would you order a desert with FRUIT? I mean, it's desert... be like your wife, and order something *naughty*

His words came out like a fucking creeper, and then he slyly winked in my direction... as sly as a man who needed to wiggle his entire face to blink could.

Ignoring him, my husband and I go full bogan, and begin to look at our phones at the table. We usually have a rule against this together, but fucking hell, we needed to break the rule to make sure we didn't talk to this guy anymore. Ending up texting each other, and deciding to bale out ASAP to the nearest bottle-o.

&gt; You guys are so rude...

More ignoring.

So, as desert came out, ham/monster/wittyname decided to actually ask us some reasonable questions.

&gt; So [me], what are you doing down here in Melbourne?

&gt; Fixing up IT fuck ups by people who didn't pass the ""Round block, square hole"" test

&gt; So when are you leaving?

And here is where drunk me decided to fail sober me, in telling him that I was staying one more day for R&amp;R at a local spa, before flying back to Brisbane the morning after.

&gt; Why do that? Here, I've got a ticket back to brisbane for tomorrow morning. I would love to swap.

&gt; No, I would rather stay in Melbourne for now

&gt; I insist

&gt; I refuse

&gt; Please! I really need to stay for one more night!

&gt; NO!

I was loud enough to turn a few heads. But it's not like they hadn't noticed this fucker beforehand.

I calm myself, looking at my husband, ready to pay and leave before our deserts came. But we stayed. For the cake.

&gt; I know where you work... look I'll call your boss now, and tell him you're coming back tomrrow morning! It will be fine!

&gt; No! Do not call my work. This is an invasion of my privacy.

(Husband at this point is apologizing profusely for telling people about my job. Usually, it doesn't result in this sort of cluster fuck)

He had already rung, and as it was 5pm in Melbourne, it was 4pm in QLD, so my boss was there. As we were in a swanky restaurant, and I was fairly inebriated, I had no capacity to stop this guy.


He manged to call my boss, get him to be happy I was coming back the next day (today, this morning), and due to this, I had to pass over details so we could swap tickets. Oh ever so luckily, we are both QANTAS members, so it made the process *that* much easier! Yay!

222bxd,22,2014-04-02,Do I need a degree?,chekmarks,ruby,https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/222bxd/do_i_need_a_degree/,"Some background - I have a masters degree in education (teaching social studies).  I started a degree in CS (12 credit hours remaining), had a great internship last summer, with another set for this summer.  I have contracted with a local business and built them an online ordering system (iOS mobile app), which they are very happy with.

I am completely burned out on school, but I am loving working with Ruby/Rails.  I have two personal project ideas that are both data-intensive, and that I'll be able to get onto the interwebs with some users.  

Let's assume that those two projects turn out well.  I feel like I've learned the foundational CS material, none of my remaining classes are related to web-development.  My goal is to get a JOB (I have a degree in Political Science, Sociology and a the aforementioned masters...none have done shit for me).  

2 questions:  How will a lack of a degree impact any future career?  Am I hire-able without a degree, given my experience and previous degrees?

I have a little experience with JavaScript but I'm not confident with my skillset quite yet. I'm currently the teaching assistant for the web design class at the university I go to and I'm in the process of getting an internship for the summer. 

My question for you is this; what should I focus on learning between now and then that will give me the best chance at landing a job as a front-end dev? I appreciate any help. I would really love to take full advantage of the time I have left in school before I have to find a job.

All you average Joes. If you are disproportionately alpha compared to your average 18-22 year old **or** look like [this](http://fitfatboys.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/six-pack-abs1.jpg), skip over this.   
___  
  
Let's jump right into it!  
___  
So you made it through the terrors of high school. [Congrats](http://spikeeskin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/great-job.jpg). Now you're ready to be [the pussy slayer](http://images.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_3800/3814_stubble-5-things-men-should-know-1045618-flash-1045618-flash.jpg) on campus, right? Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but that isn't going to happen.  
  
As the fresh meat on campus, and as a guy, you are literally the lowest form of life on campus. As an average Joe, you're probably undecided major, taking gen eds, and probably can't even [grow a full beard](https://static.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/51ce6099e4b0d911b4489b79/51ce61f5e4b0d911b44a7916/1320252194767/1000w/paimai.jpeg) yet. There are many reasons you are constantly looked down upon. You are probably scrawnier than upper classmen, you stick out like a white tourist in Mexico, and there's a [30% chance you won't even make it through your first year](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-colleges-west/freshmen-least-most-likely-return): you are unproven. Now you know what kind of hole you're in, so here's the shit you'll have to do to get out of it.  
  
1) Stay in school. By lasting even until sophomore year, you've proven yourself to be a better person than 30% of other fresh meat hopefuls.  
  
2) Lift weights. The TRP mantra. I don't know about you, average Joe, but when I got into college I was a scrawny [foot fairy fuck](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KjIvI-JRAZY/TgjKqfZs0zI/AAAAAAAAABM/2BelsC6oFxw/s1600/petercrouchskinny.jpeg).  
  
3) [fix your posture](http://www.computer-posture.co.uk/images/PC-posture.jpg). If you're an average Joe, you're around 5 foot 9 inches. That means you'll be competing in the dating marketplace with people taller than you, older than you, bigger than you, and taller than you. One of the telltale signs of an insecure beta who is out of his depth is the hunched shoulders, always leaning forward, looking like they want to crawl into a corner and disappear. As a short, average looking person, use every inch you have to your full advantage.  
___  
That's a good starting worklist for your average Joe freshman. Now here's where things will get interesting for you, average Joe. Let's assume you've made it this far, survived your first two years of college, started working out. Not quite where you want to be yet, but you're [getting there](http://imgur.com/RUH4wrM).  
  
Here's what you'll need to do next.  
  
Start looking at interning. Make a resume. Do community service, run some marathons, save some cats. just **do something** to make yourself stick out from the rest of the average Joes.  
  
Landing an internship will [basically coat your resume in gold](http://business.time.com/2013/11/10/the-real-reason-new-college-grads-cant-get-hired/).  
  
&gt;One thing that does appear to make a difference is internships, according to a Harris Interactive survey of more than 2,000 college students and 1,000 hiring managers on behalf of textbook company Chegg: more than 80% of employers want new grads they hire to have completed a formal internship, but only 8% of students say interning in a field related to their major is something they spend a lot of time doing.  
  
Get a fucking internship. It will put you above 90% of people in your field.  
  
Keep your grades up. If you've made it through your first two years, you've already found your discipline and self motivation, so this advice should be a given.  
  
Develop other skills outside your major. Become experienced with [Microsoft Office](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/mos-expert-certification.aspx).  
___  
You've finished/are finishing your internship now, you're now a senior. Grades are still okay, could be better, could be worse. Start sending out your gilded resume to everywhere and everyone. I would do this going into the final semester of your senior year. You will want to line up a job that will be a warm and ready seat reserved for you the moment you graduate. Don't dick around completely your final semester. I know a few too many people who just floundered around for 2, 3, 4 months after they graduated, ""Weee, I made it!"" Now what? Now you hop into the workforce.  
  
Congratulations, average Joe. If you made it this far, following the bread crumbs to success, give yourself a pat on the back. Now go take your new car and your new wardrobe, funded by that great new job you got, and go drive on down to your bar and grab a drink. You deserve it.  
  
___  
  
##B-but you said there'd be women? Where are the womens?!?  
___  
All in good time, young grasshopper. Women come last, your success is more important than getting your dick wet.  
___  
[This is how the SMP plays out for college guys and girls.](http://imgur.com/6NuHgfp) This is a bit exaggerated, but you get the point. Senior guys are able to pull from a 22-18 age pool, senior girls do not have that luxury. Girls in general are going to start off much above your average Joe as a freshman. The reasons for this are that average freshman girl at 18 is going to have a very low partner count (maybe even still a virgin.) This is attractive to guys of all ages. Low partner count, less chance of cheating, less chance of STDs, fresh meat. [Girls on average grow 2-3 years sooner than guys do.](http://www.tusculum.edu/faculty/home/tharlow/Gateway%20Development/images/0608.jpg) This is why it is 'normal' in society for guys to date down, not up.  
Unrelated to growth, but college girls love getting free drinks. If you're capable of acquiring alcohol, your 5 on the SMV just went up to a 7.  
  
But how does this all tie together? While you were busy setting up your future, your average Jane was busy getting shitfaced 4 nights a week while 'working' towards her Theater major, with a minor in Women's studies. Congratulations to her on her good grades, but then reality is going to hit her harder than the wall will hit in 5-10 years. This chick is going to look to get a job, and there will be nothing. Absolutely nothing. The hamster is in free fall. At this point, her ego is going to automatically deflate a few points. She's going to be looking to latch on to somebody. You can be a beta and keep this parasite forever, or spin it around your dick for a few weeks before you get bored, and then get rid of it, and let her free fall continue. The girls are going to marry up. That's life. Their sex becomes less of a trade in to your commitment. It becomes your market.  
  
___  
In closing... Build your status to be successful. Your status and success will attract the women. Spin the women around, stick it in, kick them out.  
As a college student, get an internship.  
Lift weights.  
At 18, your SMV will only go up. For girls at 18, it will only go down."

I guess, it's not just me, but I find it so difficult to get a nice internship!
I am a German citizen with Vietnamese roots, and through my whole time at school I used to be glad, that corruption isn't a big deal in such a developed country as Germany. How little did I know !
I study electrical engineering, and I have sent some applications, but yet never got closer to an internship or a job in my field of study. My fellow students also discusse the job market a lot, and it seems like vitamin b is more important than I suggested. I don't know, how to make these connections, my parents aren't able to simply introduce me someone; and I am a little to shy to build connections not based on affection but something else.
I don't know, maybe, it's just me growing up, or me with my lack of luck, or me with my little tiny hopelessness. 
I am really passionate about my studies, from the very beginning, though I did struggle sometimes.
But what is it with this vitamin b ?

Almost immediately after finishing, I did my co-op internship, found another internship to start immediately afterwards to hold me over until I found a paying job which I did. I managed to get a temporary contract position within a month of graduation and spent the majority of the next few months there. But it was hell. The work was good, the learning experiences from the research I had to delve into and the content of the project were fascinating. It taught me a lot about people and how cold, cruel, and uncaring they could be. 

Myself and the other new hires spent 9 hour days sifting through information that would stick with us forever. Stories of rapes, murders, deaths and worse situations, all of which occurred without penalty. We all felt morally disturbed by it, and though I was warned when I started, I didn't realize how difficult it would be. But it was still a good learning experience that left me with a new understanding of what some people have to go through in their lives and despite what I'm about to say, I've had a much better life than that and I'm thankful. However, the working environment was like working in a sweatshop and my stress levels sky rocketed as did everyone else's. Even with a healthy diet I (and everyone else) managed to gain at least 10 pounds each. I got up at 6am, made the two hour commute to work, sometimes worked at my internship and didn't get home until 10 at night. I became unable to stay awake for even a few hours in the day. I'd routinely have to hold my eyes open at work just to keep myself up. I started losing my memory enough to the point where I had trouble just having basic conversations. It became a struggle to get my point across during a conversation - I'd forget the word 'book' or 'pen' or anything else. My brain just stopped functioning. I'd thought about quitting often but didn't for the money and the experience. When the job was finally over, I pretty much crashed and haven't been the same since. 

My memory has come back, I still have trouble with my speech sometimes but it isn't nearly as bad. Since last summer I've been searching for a new job and I've found nothing. I've been offered the chance to start a partnership business with a colleague and the only reason I might even consider it (if they'll actually be willing to think I'm serious this time) is because I can't seem to find anything else. 
Within a few months of being unemployed, due to my general dissatisfaction with life, I've often contemplated just ending it all. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I'm 29 now...I think the last genuinely happy moment may have been in high school. 

Part of it is my appearance...maybe that's shallow. I'm athletic and always have been, but I'm lucky enough to be one of those girls that can't ever lose a pound. So since I have no job to go to, barely get any interviews, I've been sinking my time into working out. In the course of four months of cycling, jogging, and boxing, I've lost a whopping grand total of five pounds though I'm aware I likely put on more muscle.
Another part of it is I'm realizing I just don't know who I am anymore. I thought my life would be different by now. I have high aspirations and I want to achieve them but I have no way of getting there. At this point the only reason I haven't actually killed myself is simply because I'm used to living. I do it out of habit, not because I want to. If I didn't have parents that would suffer from it, it would be much easier. But right now I pretty much feel like I'm stuck living and I don't want to be. 

I do have a few close friends but none that I can really talk to like this. I tend to be that typical INTJ that bottles it all up and seems all happy on the outside but really I'm just a mess. When I do try and talk to friends somehow it just feels like whatever I say isn't that big of a deal. 

So at the end of the day, I can't get a job in my field, I feel like a failure, I've been trying like hell to at least work on getting into shape so I can say I've accomplished something...but frankly, there's just nothing. I've never posted here before so I apologize if I just wrote this all wrong."

I'm 22. Took some time to travel after high school and have just now gotten into continuing my education. I am going for an AA Database Analyst degree at the moment at my community college. I have some background with MySQL, not much. Back in high school I ran my own WoW private server using MySQL, the core files were provided so I didn't create much but I did learn how to use queries and the jist of databases. I loved it and so I decided to study it. I have some experience with linux as I ran a cli operated web server for a bit just to get the hang of the OS. 

Now for the questions.
 
* What is the average day of the db analyst like?
* Do you enjoy what you do?
* Does the salary match the workload?
* What can I do to look good as an intern and an employee? (Obviously be knowledgeable, but any specific aspects?)
* I have a choice between programming electives: Visual Basic for Business Applications, Java Programming, HTML &amp; CSS, Development Fundamentals, Javascript Programming. Which of these would be most useful for me? 
* Do you guys work in Unix or Windows?

I thought I had more questions but it seems they've slipped my mind. I'll post more when I remember, if that's ok with you guys.

I'm very anxious to see what this community has to say as you're the only people I can turn to for questions in my current position.

Thank you very much.

I'm a freshman student in California looking to transfer in the fall, and right now I'm looking between Portland State and Oregon State. Being a Computer Science major, I want to go to a school that is going to offer me plenty of resources and opportunities to get some good experience in the field.

That being said, I wanted to ask you how your prospects have been. Are there plenty of internships waiting to be filled? Have you found jobs (or even postings) that require things that you've pretty much been taught at PSU? The decision is incredibly hard right now and I really love both schools, but I want to make sure that I choose a school that will also be good for the long-term."

Go ahead, call me a whiny little bitch, I don't give a fuck at this point. I have worked hard in everything my whole life, work, albeit a part time job I hate, is no exception. Every shift I go to work knowing what will happen, I will start off just dandy, then by the third hour or so I'll get pissed off at some fucker and it will keep me pissed off (internally, I don't show my displeasure with others) the whole night.

Example 1: Every closing shift these guys will whine and complain if they stay a minute past the time we are scheduled, but they text, snapchat and generally do fuck all the whole night. I don't get it, you complain that you get out late after you do *nothing* the whole shift.

Example 2: 2 fuckers walked around for an hour to kill time before they left and I got the shaft and had to play catchup the whole night and ended up leaving late. 

Example 3 (this is the best): When we close on thursdays we have the truck for the next day. Last thursday the people I had to work with decided they would sit for an hour, on the clock, in the office and do nothing. The best part is that the closing manager (of a different department) was with them the whole time and didn't tell them to get to work. Instead, I picked up the slack. One of those shits even left early and consequently we got out late. They give me shit for breaking down the truck (doing my job) and call me and over achiever and a piece of shit. Yea, I'm just doing my job, fuck me right?

The closing manager totally plays favorites and asks me to do more shit while the three fuck-a-teers do nothing. 

I've told management (of my department) about all of this and they just don't give a fuck. I'm tired of this. I'm a highly trained emergency responder and nationally certified professional firefighter who turned down jobs to go to school and continue working with my current employer. I have sacrificed so much and worked so hard only to be ridiculed by my co'workers' (because lets face it, this one asshole decided to take a half hour on the clock because he was 'tired' and kept on his phone the whole time). 

Management tells me they appreciate my hard work but all I feel is used. Used because I have the skill and work ethic to get the job done right and quickly. 

Every fucking shift it's the same thing. I tried the psychological approach to anger through high school and it worked up until last semester. I'm seeing a Psychiatrist next week and hopefully I can get something to help me because as it stands, I am on the verge of quitting every fucking shift. None of these people have any ambition or work ethic and I don't think they will ever advance in life, yet I work my fucking hardest and get shit about it. 

I've got less than two months left before I move to DC for the summer for school and an internship and then to the school I'm transferring to.

I'm just at a total loss with these people, they're older than me and nothing more than a common fucking bully. I've been bullied since middle school and I can't fucking stand it. I'd be surprised if these shits aren't on welfare in 5 years and in crippling debt. Some of these assholes  don't even pay rent, their parents do! My professors and parents have told me that all of the sacrifice and anguish will be worth it in a few years when I have the degree, no debt, and a job. But I don't believe them.

I've got friends who have graduated and gotten jobs and they say it's the same shitty people with different names. It seems as if people don't grow up but rather grow older. I don't know what to do, what to feel, or what I can do. I can suck it up for two months and risk losing my shit and just yelling at these assholes only to transfer to a new location in the fall and what, deal with more of the same type of assholes? 

I just want to stop being pissed off at these fucks and letting them ruin my mood but I just can't because every day it's the same shit. 

TL;DR: I'm fucking pissed off with my co'workers' who do fucking nothing but ridicule me for working hard. I have doubts about the grass being greener on the other side. I'm going to see a psychiatrist. Read the post, please. I'm literally losing myself to this shit."

**10,672** challengers for **7 months!**

Tired of posting oh-so-clever comments and receiving only a [reddit silver award in response?](http://gfycat.com/IdleCheerfulBuck) Do you have dreams of getting into /r/lounge to [party with the big boys,](http://gfycat.com/DisastrousConcreteErmine) but haven't yet made a post worthy enough to deserve reddit gold? Do you have time on your hands, and need a fun, rewarding avenue to challenge yourself and perhaps help out another redditor at the same time? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions then /r/goforgold is the [subreddit for you!](http://gfycat.com/DirectDimwittedCockerspaniel)

In this subreddit you can post a challenge (most often with a month of reddit gold as the reward for the top response) and redditors will try their very best to help you out, make a fool of themselves, or create incredible things for you in response. Even one reddit admin, /u/yishan, got in on the action with his post - [""Eat nothing but burritos for at least 2 weeks.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5t5r/eat_nothing_but_burritos_for_at_least_2_weeks/) 

Others get extraordinarily specific like /u/alasknfiredrgn who was giving out a year of reddit gold to [someone who could create-](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1vchcy/1_yr_of_gold_for_top_voted1_month_for_2nd_and_3rd/)

Or maybe you just want to post a weird challenge like /u/tomtomglove did when he asked redditors to [""Go to the bank, try to deposit 100 hot dogs.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/) ...And /u/Ice-Z actually did it, and [videotapped himself for your pleasure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/cbr2k8h)

I mean really, this sub has everything! If drawing or depositing hot dogs isn't your thing, then why not help /u/Garm_Bel_Iblis and his wife [choose which carpet to put in their new house](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/21kdch/carpet_my_living_room_virtually/), or sing a song [Shatner style and post it to youtube for two months of gold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/21sq31/sing_a_song_of_your_choice_shatner_style_2_months/) The possibilities are certainly endless, and so if you're waiting to get [your golden ticket](http://i.imgflip.com/r8l0.gif) then this sub is definitely one you should check out. Now, let's hear more about the sub from the mods themselves. 


&gt;##1. Tell us about yourselves! (interests, hopes and dreams, the kind of person you are, anything!)

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I'm an American female communications student at a Texas university. I'm not sure what I want to do, but I'm pretty sure that professional beer drinker is not going to happen.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:**  I am a 19 year old American (NJ) male computer science enthusiast. I don't plan on doing college - but consulting and attempting to start companies is going well so far as I live right next to an amazing budding startup community. I also like photography and taro coconut bubble tea. :3 If you, for some weird reason, want more info - I have an internet majig [here.](http://nick.sahler.co/)

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** I'm currently a student who is working hard to learn and gain experience with 3DCG. I aspire to eventually get a job working with 3d Art, preferably within video games.

&gt;##2. How did you get involved with /r/goforgold?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** /r/GoForGold originated from a thread on /r/CrazyIdeas which is another sub that I frequent. The thread took off and /u/reduced-fat-milk launched it and began asking about mods. So I asked if he needed help and that was that.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:**  Like /u/19thconservatory said - the idea originated in a thread on /r/CrazyIdeas. I liked the idea so much that I decided to start the sub and see where it went. I modded a few people who asked, and we started going. I'm extremely happy that the mods I picked ended up being pretty smart, reasonable and awesome :D

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** When /u/reduced-fat-milk made it , I sent a mod mail to him offering to help him as a mod on the subreddit, and he sent me a mod invite.

&gt;##3. What has been your favourite challenge so far? Your favourite reply to a challenge?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I don't know why, but I like the challenges that are ""eat/chug this [food] in [timeframe]."" The videos are pretty amusing.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** My favourite is either the [hotdog banker](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/) challenge or the [morning wood](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/20v6zi/challenge_gold_for_the_first_to_complete_the/) challenge. I also like the [""buy a hobo breakfast""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k68bl/invite_a_homeless_person_for_breakfast/) challenge, because there's nothing like the smell of philanthropy in the morning.

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1ydodj/gold_for_sharing_a_porno_to_your_facebook_wall/) is probably my favorite challenge so far. The top response is also obviously my favorite reply.

&gt;##4. Has modding for /r/goforgold for the past 7 months changed your own mindset in anyway?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I now read all of the rules in sidebars before posting to unfamiliar subreddits. (""Flair your posts!"" reminders happened way too often in the beginning.)

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** I don't think so. My mindset has changed from other things which changed how I moderate and look at/r/goforgold, but I don't think /r/goforgold has changed it itself.

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** Not really no. The way I moderate hasn't really changed and the way I use reddit has been unaffected by it.

&gt;##5. Is there anything else you want to add about /r/goforgold or the community there?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** Our subreddit relies on the honor system for rewarding users with gold, and I'm really pleased with how much our subscribers come through with sending gold.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** One is that I like the silly, ""challengy"" challenges more than the ""do me a favor/job"" challenges. They are more fun and creative and warrant more reward. If you make challenges like that, I'll try to gold you and/or give you special custom flair. Also what I said before - Fantastic mods :D



Thank you to the /r/goforgold mods for answering these questions! As one of the new /r/SubredditoftheDay interns, this has been the first subreddit that I have ever featured, so let me know what you think, and if you have any suggestions for the future.

226esh,0,2014-04-04,Is a Master's in Applied Math worth it?,elementaryeel,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/226esh/is_a_masters_in_applied_math_worth_it/,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text

Context: Will graduate this spring from a top 25 US university with a degree in Applied Math (has a top 10 grad program). Had poor performance/indecision earlier on studying other (non-math related) subjects, switched to math. Expected cumulative GPA ~3.4 and major GPA of ~3.7/3.8. Pretty much have received A/A-'s in all upper division coursework (real/complex analysis, numerical analysis, probability, ODEs, linear algebra, etc. NO abstract algebra) . No research experience, though I do have experience working with an academic in a quantitative field as an internship. Will be working in a quantitatively heavy field next year full-time at a great company.

Questions:

1. Given my background (no ""honors"" coursework, no research) are ""top 30"" (as  subjective as this may be) within reach? I feel that I've just scratched the ""tip of the iceberg"" in learning math and hope to continue.

2. If so, how much ""value-added"" do employers find an M.S. in Applied Math (versus just a Bachelor's) to be for someone interested in working in any of the following: data science, information theory related fields, quantum computing (realize this needs compsci), or quant finance? 

Thank you in advance for all your input and insight, it's greatly appreciated!

After over a year of searching, the best I had been able to do was finding part-time work and volunteering the rest of my time at unpaid internships to try and make sure I was still gaining relevant experience.

After searching for a long time, I finally found a job position that I would be perfect for and would be perfect for me.  I interviewed twice over the course of two weeks and have been waiting all week to hear back from them.  Every day that passes, my heart gets a little more sad.

So, today when I came in, my co-worker that I (was) friendly with sent me this via email:

*""So, I need to tell ya something, I wanna be honest abut it and hope there won't be any hard feelings. But, when you told me about [the job] I went and applied also. I have an interview with them next week also. I just thought I should tell you so it wouldn't look like something under-handed or anything sneaky since we were talking about among one another.""*

...

Don't fucking do something underhanded and then tell me about it as if that somehow makes everything ""above board.""  It *doesn't* and I'm really fucking pissed off. 

More than that, I'm really fucking sad.  I know it was my fault for telling her about it in the first place, but the whole things just makes me really depressed.  Also, and I'm not just saying this, she is the **WORST** employee I have ever encountered.  They really want to fire her here, but they keep her around because her mother also works here and she actually does a good job.  And that's the only reason she's still here.

I'm feeling a lot like shit at the moment and I have no one to talk to about it.  My boyfriend is out of town for work and I can't really bother him at the moment.  I also know telling him about it would just put more stress on him because he can't really do anything to comfort him (so it would just be frustration for him that he doesn't need)."

As a freshman undergrad, I am looking for some advice on whether I should continue to take actuarial classes.
 
My primary major is computer science, and I absolutely love programming. I sometimes spend eight hours being entirely immersed in it, I really enjoy it, and I have a fantastic internship lined up for this summer in software development for a prominent Fortune 500 software company. I want to write software/manage software creation, and actuarial knowledge is something that I would like to have in my mathematical/financial toolbox.

I also really love probability theory, discrete math, number theory, and stochastic processes. I have taken and passed the P exam, after studying the material for three weeks during the summer before university, and I really enjoyed the material.

My problem is that I am currently taking a class that is supposed to prepare me for the FM exam, and while I do have high marks in class and understand the material, sometimes the material feels painfully repetitive, and it irritates me to do problems. I do not want to continue to take classes if the rest of what I learn will be like the FM material.

My question is whether I should expect the material to improve in terms of theoretical rigor and variation of content. Specifically, I am asking about the material for the MLC, MFE, and C exams.

Thank you much"
227bse,7,2014-04-04,[Pics]My Ketogains journey begins. Am I doing this right?,Bainge,ketogains,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/227bse/picsmy_ketogains_journey_begins_am_i_doing_this/,"So I just spent the last three months at an internship in a desk job where I sat on excel for approximately 13-14 hours a day, had two big takeout meals a day and was right next to the snack corner. After never really having to worry about my weight before I suddenly found myself fatter than I had ever been in my life, most noticeable that my 32"" waist pants no longer fit, bleh.

So I researched just what kind of diet and exercise I wanted to do when I returned home and settled on a ketogenic diet, because it seemed like the most intriguing to me. I wanted a simple gym routine that I could do after not going for 3 months and continue during the school year, so I settled on a modified starting strength routine. I finally had the excess funds to make a purchase I've been eying for a while, and bought a brand new Specialized Allez Race road bike and love it. http://i.imgur.com/5iY4yJF.jpg Here is the beauty.

Anyway, this is me at my starting place on Monday: 
http://i.imgur.com/B9tiP9b.jpg 
5'""10, 183 pounds and what I would estimate at 15%ish body fat. My goal is to get down to 11 or 12% BF so I can have abs for the first time in my life. 

I followed the FAQ, got up Monday and ate nothing than did my exercise routine. The next day I ate breakfast and rode my bike a little and then peed on the Keto test stick and it was purple, so I'm in right? 

Here is my current routine, any insight or advice would be super appreciated:

M, W, F:
Modified Starting strength that adds dips or pullups depending on the day and weighted incline situps as well as hyperextensions.

T, Th:
Take that fresh new bike out for a spin, anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Probably average about 10 miles.

Sat, Sun
Rest from my labors

Now, I have been keeping my carbs at or below 28 grams since Monday, but I have only been consuming about 1500-1800 calories when all the calculators I do seem to suggest consuming about 2100. But I want accelerated results and its really hard to eat that much without carbs, so am I making the right decision by undercutting that amount and staying around 1500? I won't care if there is a little bit of muscle loss, because the second I get my bodyfat down I will start eating carbs again and start lifting more, careful to keep my abs in check.

Any suggestions? Is my plan viable and can I see measurable results in a month? Thanks for your help, I am very new to dieting as you can see.

I just started talking to a young girl living in another state, in the mid-upper side of the U.S.A. She is living with her family, who is very religious, forceful, abusive in almost every way, and she is stuck. She obviously does not have the same beliefs and the life-style of her family, but she is forced to follow their orders. She is depressed and sees no hope in life. There is way more to the story, but I hope you get the idea.


Now, no one deserves to live a life in force, abuse, and torment. Everyone deserves to live a happy life and everyone should have the right to live with their beliefs. 


So, how many of you have been contacting via online or in any way with some individuals like this? Maybe from a different state or a country? 


After talking to this one girl recently, I was thinking to myself. Is there any way we can support these individuals? I mean it's not easy for all of us to take in all these individuals and provide them housing, etc. I know the ex-Muslim community is trying to find legal ways to help some of these people, since I saw a post about it on reddit. But, my idea is more like **how can we help these people help themselves?** 


Let's say, there is a person in--maybe Connecticut, who is in a situation and is struggling. Is there a way we can find other ex-Muslims in Connecticut who have found their freedom or anyone else who is willing to help talk to them? And I mean **in person.** Can they meet up with these people somehow and just inspire them, motivate them--kind of give them a push, and make them believe in themselves. Because, some of these individuals I talk to, CAN help themselves. Some are in college, all we have to do is push them to maybe get a dorm, even if it is expensive because **nothing is more expensive than YOUR LIFE.** Some are way too scared to stand up for themselves in front of their families and that is why we need individuals to give them a push to do so. Some, do not even know how the world works. For example, there was this one young teenager in high school, her parents expect her to get married after high school and not go to further education. I got contact with that girl **in the mosque** and I helped her fill out college applications. I told her about SAT's/ACT's that she had no idea about. We did this only in the mosque because that is the only place her family would take her and I would act like a ""Muslim,"" so her family would let her talk to me. There are just simple things that some individuals do not know because they are from very sheltered families, that if we just told them, they can use it to help themselves. We have to seek out to help them, even if it means that we have to act like a ""Muslim"" at the mosque to help them out. We have to find more and many different ways of  to help them. Even if it means, we pick one girl from our meet-up or one guy from our meet-up to go to a mosque or anywhere to a Muslim family's house and act like their daughter/sons friend.

See, I personally was in a very abusive home in every way. I was very close to suicide and giving up on life. But, one day this person just gave me a push and told me I can do it myself, mostly via online. I was stuck in this horrible living situation for my whole life, and my inner spirit was dying. But since I came to college, I became proactive and looked for help because the person I was talking to enlightened me about all the resources out there that I can use to help myself. I told my counselors in school my family problems, even the police started keeping an eye on our home without any one of us knowing because the counselors told them my situation. Then one day my senior year of college (which I wished was earlier, but I am staying another year in college, so it’s okay), my counselor made room in our college apartments to give me free housing and I fled for sure. Since then my life has changed IMMENSELY, and I realized how much more growing I have to do. It was easier to work in school and get good grades, now I have been getting about 5 offers for internships and yet so much still to come. This all happened in a span of less than a year. 


So, my point is, if someone can meet up with these ""stuck"" people in person and just be there friend, motivate them, show them they have so much potential--maybe one day, they will have the will power and strength to stand up for themselves. Some of these individuals have no idea about how the world functions out there because some of them are made to believe that the world is a horrible place and no one will help you, that is what they have been hearing their whole life as a child, so they think they have no hope. But, if someone can just show them that they have good support, so many resources, and there are good people out there, maybe they would be more motivated in trying hard to help themselves. I was given the push via online, but sometimes some people need a real person in front of them rather than just words online. Sometimes, that's all a person needs, someone to talk to and give them a little push, and from there they can help themselves. I really believe this can happen because some of the young girls I talk to have SO much potential, their only problem is that they care too much about hurting their parent’s feelings and they are way too scared of almost everything. That's it. They just need someone to make them realize and show them another perspective of life. Show them that they matter. I know that's how it worked for me. I used to care too much, but once I realized **I** matter, I fled, I helped myself and my situation.


At the end of the day if you realize, most of us are not stuck in 3rd world countries, which gives us a HUGE HUGE HUGE advantage and we should take advantage of that big time, and take advantage of the resources around us. It might be a struggle at first, but trust me at the end you will be happy.


As its said, *""The mind is a powerful force. It can enslave us or empower us. It can plunge us into the depths of misery or take us to the heights of ecstasy. Learn to use the power wisely.""* 


So, only if we can motivate these ""stuck"" individuals and enlighten them on how they are way stronger than they know.


For the meet ups, I was thinking rather than all the ex-Muslims just chilling, maybe each one of us should find an individual online who is stuck and bring them to the table at the meet-up. We do not have to tell any personal information without their permission, but we can simply tell them where that person might live and if someone from the ex-Muslim community or anyone who is also in that area can maybe meet up with them somewhere, even if it's in their school or the library or **even the mosque** and just let them know, they are not alone and they have hope, give them advise, enlighten them with another perspective to life, just be a friend. Maybe that will give them a push to help themselves because some of us were there in their position and we know how they feel, this will help them relate to us and motivate them. Sometimes these people in such situations do not come out themselves or are too depressed to talk to anyone, so people like us have to seek for them to help them before it is too late for them. 


All we simply have to do is help them *realize* how strong they are and how they can help themselves. "
227j72,10,2014-04-04,"Me [25 M] with my GF [23 F] of 3.5 years, she is coming home from internship (3 months) on monday - problem arising",motivationalthrowawa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/227j72/me_25_m_with_my_gf_23_f_of_35_years_she_is_coming/,"So me and my girlfriend has been doing the LDR thing for 3 months now (before that we've lived together for 2.5 years, and pretty much been with each other for every day). She's been on an internship in an other country. This has been a hell for me - especially now under the last part since she have been flaky with communications. Sure, she is writing her exam work at the same time but it could go _5_ days without her calling. Just a few messages on facebook.

Safe to say that I haven't felt that I was being loved.

So she is finally coming home on monday evening! She asked me 1 month ago if I could pick her up (we live rather far from the airport).

That would be so romantic - standing there with a rose and everything. Seeing each other for the first time since 2 months (I visited her for a weekend).

So her cousin(and friend) messaged me on facebook - asking if she could tag along picking her up. My initial reaction was ""uh no? thats a moment for me and my girlfriend"". But I told the cousin that ""oh that's not really what I expected but sure!"".

After an hour had passed I realized that I'm not actually 100% okay with that. Her being away is not only about her, it's about us - and about our first moment together for a very long time. At the same time her sister messages me and asks if she can tag along as well. I messaged the cousin and told her that ""I'm not sure if it's a good idea, I think me and my girlfriend should have some time for ourselves before we hang out with other people"". She answers ""Yeah I understand. It's just that both her sisters would want to give her a warm welcome.""

Now the situation changed from me and my GF -&gt; +cousin -&gt; +her two sisters.

So I called my GF up on skype, explained the situation. That I would like some alone time with her - you know describing the romantic feeling on the airport with the rose and everything.

She completely blew up. Her shouting/screaming: ""You have no exclusivity right of me!"" ""I want them coming as well!"" ""Don't you understand that it makes me happy that they are coming??"" ""Why don't you understand me!?!?"" ""Do you have a control issue over me?""

Turns out she and her cousin had talked about this and she said to the cousin ""ask OP!"". Turns out my opinion only mattered when I had it right. Plus, why wouldnt my GF ask me instead of the cousin?

I hinted that if her moment with them are so special, why wouldn't she ask them to pick her up instead of me from the beginning?

The fight ended up with her saying something in the lines of ""I want them to come, you can come only if you want, they can pick me up instead"". Basically she said ""you are optional"".

Then the conversation ended because she ""had to get ready for a resturant dinner with her collegues, we'll talk about this later..."" I asked her when 'later' means. She basically said ""when we're face to face, because I don't wanna talk about this over skype"". Which is rather weird cause this issue is about her coming home.

Am I being wrong? I don't know what to think. This is so confusing. Im shaking and I'm so sad.

---   
**tl;dr**: GF away on internship for 3 months. Picking up the gf from the airport on monday and it completely blew up. Her sisters and cousin want to join. I want that moment to be for us. Verbal fight started.

Edit: I just wanna explain that my comments are for trying to understand - not to argue and prove my point against you all.

Edit 2: Sent her a text, waiting for answer. Text is saying that: 

""I just wanted the first moment to be for us, and thought that would be romantic after two months apart. It was not my intention that it would be like this, and Im sorry/apologizing for that. Im sad that you interpreted my attempt at being romantic as a controlling gesture. I guess I was just  swept by surprise by the request from cousin and that just more and more people we added.

I want you to be happy, so I'm notifiyng the others that I will pick them up on monday.

Maybe this is just an issue of lack of communications, and that I have a feeling of lonliness.

Love you.""

227kk2,51,2014-04-04,Had sex with a roommate last night. What should I know/consider?,pennakyp,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/227kk2/had_sex_with_a_roommate_last_night_what_should_i/,"I just moved into a new place.  There's a woman living here (she's 27, I'm 28) and we're both new to the place.  She's just doing an internship and will be here for 7 weeks.

I could tell there was some attraction on both sides but I was always one to think ""That's a roommate and therefor off limits.  No matter how cute"".

We went to a party and danced a little bit with each other here and there but nothing too serious.  I saw other guys hitting on her and was curious if she'd go home with one of them.  I was flirting with many other girls at the party.

Finally, time came to leave the party.  Walked the short walk back home.  Were chilling in the kitchen.  Both pretty drunk.  Just chilling for a while, having water.  Then she comes up quickly to make out with me.  Didn't really expect it but I happily obliged.  It was excellent.

After much making out, we go to her room.  I'm not going to pretend it was all her leading.  I was definitely trying to get to that bedroom.

Finally, after much excellent fooling around, she's basically like ""go get that condom in your room"".  

We proceed to have excellent sex.  Some of the best I've had in a while.  She's Mexican and I'm American (this is in Mexico) and it was a sexy mix of Spanish and English spoken.  It's awesome to hear ""estas increíble"".  I've been in a pretty long dry spell and it was so so nice to have great sex.

Finally, both exhausted, I go back to my room.  She texts me in the morning.  It's all good.  We're both beat.  I make us a nice breakfast.  We chat about whether people heard or not.  We didn't touch or kiss or anything more.

But, whatever.  It was a great night.  Seems like there's no drama or expectations between us.  Perhaps it was just a one night thing or perhaps it'll be one of many (hope so).

So, curious to get others' perspectives.  Anything to look out for or manage?  Any advice with a situation like this?

I'm guessing it's the ol ""open communication + no expectations"" but I'm just curious if anyone else had other points/thoughts."
227n4w,28,2014-04-04,My better storyline for the end of Season 3 and Season 4 (S03E15 Spoilers).,Psyc3,suits,https://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/227n4w/my_better_storyline_for_the_end_of_season_3_and/,"Given how suits is becoming rather repetitive with Mike getting caught but never actually getting caught at the last minute and Harvey not being able to tell anyone about Mikes shit I thought I would write a better solution to how the end of S03E15 and further on should have gone (maybe it should have actually be the last in the season in my storyline). Fuck this whole Mike and Harvey are going to get jailed BS episode, spoiler alert, they aren't, Harvey can't be the go to advert for Tom Ford suits if he has to wear a boiler suit in prison, well unless they are bring out a new range, that really would be quite the twist. 

My storyline goes something like this:

Mike leaves and joins the Investment Bank (a la the end of S03E15 doesn't happen), Harvey is sad, however considering Harvey is supposed to be a closer of situations, Mike working at an Investment Bank means he is brought in as an outside consultant to work with Mike and their company, Harvey as a closer, and Louis as a Financial law expert, rather than his current role as a whining baby (no offence to Rick Hoffman he does a great job acting, just his character acts like a little bitch half the time). However, he still gets to be his whiney self because he doesn't want to work with Mike as he believes him to be unworthy and disloyal for leaving the Law and Pearson Specter, but Jessica makes him because of the money for the firm. Several episodes involve cases working with the investment bank fleshing out characters there and the such in the classic suits style, with banter between the Investment Bankers and the Lawyers who while they have mutual respect for each other they both believe theirs is the better profession all while Louis gives Mike shit for leaving at any chance he gets. 

Louis then finds out the investment banking company is embezzling money from its clients (or some other dodgy dealings such as working with drug barons, people trafficking, blood diamonds, purposing crashing pension funds etc.) over the course of season 4 and thinks Mike is in on it with the rest of the investment bankers (due to him no longer trusting his loyalty and not respecting him), he at some point confronts Mike (maybe he finds out at the mid-season finale and confronts Mike the first episode of the second half), at first he doesn't believe he isn't in on it but then he comes around when Mike, due to his inside connections, finds they have made Pearson Specter complicit in the crimes and agrees to help take them down, which would link in to one of the story line from the start of season 4.

Harvey (with his experience in the Justice department), Louis (as a financial law expert) and Mike (as the inside man) then take down the Investment Banking company due to their dodgy deals and trying to make Pearson Specter complicit in the crimes, this leads Mike to go back to the law with Harvey at the end of season 4 and to get his name hacked into the Bar Database which is how the season ends with Mike placing his bar certificate on Harveys desk and walking out of his office all cool and collected, with a cheeky little smile on Harveys face.

Added extra include shitty temp interns Harvey can't stand throughout the season, or maybe taking some of the better known associates and having them work with him for an episode, each of whom aren't up to his standards, this leads to him making a trade with Louis for Katrina for a couple of episodes like Harvey did with Mike. Rachel is either at University or just helping out in the background on cases as well as being Mikes girl friend, this could include having to work for Louis as a summer associate while Katrina works with Harvey leading to tension between Rachel and Mike due to her working with Louis, all while some attractive associate at the Investment bank tries to steal Mike away. Donna and Scotty just stand around looking good like always but Harvey still can't tell Scotty his secret or why Mike really left which bugs him. Jessica is also just around doing what she does, running the place and getting pissed when people fuck with her company. 

This of course would include having a more protracted storyline than 2 episodes in a row and they couldn't write the ""Mike is about to get caught"" storyline in every other episode as there is nothing for Mike to get caught for, other than being complicit in the Investment Banking crimes (Hooray! Mike can still get caught but never actually get caught!). All the people are present and accounted for and it would actually make for something interesting to watch as Mike would have left Pearson Specter and it wouldn't be obvious he was coming back till the second half of the season as they might just be taking the show into another area of the city ""suits"" culture. Though it might be hard to make Mike seem like the bad guy or at least enough to make anyone believe he is in on it with the Investment Bankers, but adding his distancing from Rachel and friendliness to ""Investment Banker Girl"" might help this, also it isn't necessarily a problem as that is the purpose of making Louis so obviously bias against Mike for leaving Pearson Specter.

I am 21 year old guy in college &amp; I've been out for around 3 years now. 
My parents are super Christian &amp; when I came out, they said 'it was one of the worst things a parent could hear'. They found out I was gay when they saw me kissing my boyfriend at the time &amp; then they wouldn't let me spend any time with him, wouldn't let me ride in the same car with him, &amp; decided to set up counseling to 'fix the problem'. We eventually broke up because he couldn't deal with my parents any longer after we had tried to hide our relationship.

Fast forward to today -
I'm in college &amp; I've been with my boyfriend for a year or so. We met when I lost my iPod &amp; he returned it. He's the greatest thing that's happened to me &amp; he just makes life good. I plan on getting married to this kid someday &amp; we've even talked about it once or twice. He graduated college this year &amp; is currently looking for work in my home city. In the summers, I usually go back home to work internships &amp; this year I landed another fairly decent internship. I was planning on getting an apartment with him for the summer &amp; living together. After a long time, I found an apartment that would work, so I called home to see if this would work. Then they told me if he was to move in with me for the summer, they would take away my car &amp; sell it, therefore eliminating transportation to the job. They said to either live on your own &amp; keep the car or come back &amp; live with them for the summer. I don't know what to do. I don't think I could live with them for summer knowing that they don't support us &amp; are basically trying to split us apart. And living on my own can get quite expensive, as well as being away from my other half. If you have any ideas or suggestions please let me know, because I'm simply all out of ideas.

While this can be a good thing in that it motivates me to do better in school, it's also very stressful at the same time. For example, whenever I see one of my classmates studying for a quiz or an exam I have coming up, I will start studying myself to make sure that nobody does better than I do. Another example would be me trying to one-up my roommate by trying to get a summer internship before he does.

I hate this. I hate this because I always want to be the best, and when I'm not, I feel like shit. I wish I were able to feel happy for those that achieve something good in their lives; instead I just feel jealously and dissapointed that I didn't do better. I don't consider myself a jerk, because I do ""congratulate"" people on their accomplishments but deep down inside I feel terrible.

I would say I'm at advanced level, but I don't think I'll find Python related work here in Eastern Europe easily so I'm not getting my hopes high.  
 
However I did a bit of research and Python freelancing seems to be a thing, I don't really expect it to pay the bills at the beginning, but it seems like it would be a good place to develop skills and get some money on the side.

So far I haven't dabbled in scientific Python, which is apparently what all of the fuss is about. Though during the past few years on my spare time I did play around with:  
**Qt**(via PySide), which I do enjoy despite people saying it's not the best thing for gui development .  
**Django**, which is a bit complicated but I can see the use for it and it does look like a really awesome tool, but I've never bothered invest time in html/css so my results were bare-bones to say the least.  
**Regex** - I was always avoiding it because it looks scary, but recently I gave it a go and it was surprisingly fun. Still can't form complicated expressions but I try to incorporate them whenever I can.  
**Scrapping** - my newest activity, which I do enjoy quite a bit and was thinking to buy ""[Getting started with Beautiful Soup](http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-beautiful-soup/book)"" though the price seems to be rather steep for an e-book(12gbp), so I'm on the edge.

Now I have a lot of free time, so I would like to develop my Python further. I know that the best way to learn would be actually making something and I do, but some guidance definitely makes things go smother and faster. So I am looking some books or other resources that would help me develop Python skills that would help me get out there into the real world. Finding an **unpaid** IT/programming internship is extremely hard, finding python related internship is completely impossible.

I've been lurking this subreddit for quite a while now and it looks like we have a lot of skilled and smart people here so any suggestions, comments and feedback would be highly appreciated!

We're renting an apartment right now, but are hoping to transition to ownership. The chief problem we're running into right now is dealing with mortgage underwriters and figuring out whether or not we can realistically get approved. Let me run down some of the details in a nutshell:

-
-my wife works full-time and is salaried
-I currently work one part time job paid hourly (averaging about 16 hours a week) and one full-time salaried internship
-my internship is ending at the end of July. I am seeking full-time employment after the internship period is over.
-I have a certified offer of full-time employment from my current part-time employer, effective as of the end date of my internship.

We've gotten different responses from a couple different mortgage companies and we're really struggling to figure out how we can make this work. The chief obstacle is our debt-to-income ratio. I have student loans that are going to kick in in November, which is adding significantly to our monthly debt load. However, by the time the student debt kicks in, I will be working full-time. Either I will find a position related to my study field, or I will work full-time at my current job. This would approximately double my current monthly income. 

One underwriter has said that the full-time employment offer is good for approval provided we close no more than 60 days before the start date. Another has said that it's not good until I am actually working the job. On top of that, I keep getting different opinions on whether my internship income can even count as part of our income or not.

I'm kinda frustrated because my student debt counts against us, but the fact that my income will  be higher by the time the student debt kicks in doesn't matter. They're combining future debts with present income, despite the fact that our situation will be significantly different once I am able to work full-time. 

Do we have a hope of getting approved anywhere, or is this just a pipe dream? Can anyone recommend a lender who might be more able/willing to take our situation into account? Our current lease runs out in July, and we were hoping to be able to close in June so we could move without having to go month-to-month, which would cost us an extra $600 a month or so. Any perspective or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Over the past several years, I've suffered through periods of moderate to severe depression while attending college.  The past year has been the most painful and debilitating stretch of depression I've experienced.  I checked out halfway through my final semester (Spring 2013) when I became overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts.  Up to that point, no one in any of my classes had any idea of what shape I was in.  I met with a doctor off campus to seek help.  I had become so used to feeling hopeless that I thought it was normal.

After skipping classes for two weeks and seeing a doctor, I met with the dean of students to request a medical leave of absence.  With the help of my instructors, I put together a schedule by which to complete my coursework (and receive my diploma).  By the end of the Summer 2013 session, I finished all of my remaining coursework and earned my degree.  The Summer wasn't easy and there were several instances where I gave serious consideration to killing myself.

Fast forward to today and I'm sitting here in my old bedroom at my parents' house.  It's been nearly three weeks since I spoke with my now-ex-girlfriend who I'd been with for 6 years.  She has suffered through depression as well.

Looking at my life as objectively as possible, I have very little to feel down about.  I graduated with honors, I had several internships with prestigious companies in my field, I received recognition and awards for the work I did while in college but I feel overwhelmingly worthless most days.  I know that being employed would help to curb this feeling but I have had a hard time interviewing when I feel so undeserving of any of my past accomplishments.  Confidence is important but I worry that if I can't be confident in what I've done, what could possibly help?

Have any of you had similar experiences?  Have you found ways to build yourself up enough to grab the next rung?"

Nowadays, I'm a programmer for 3 years, currently working as internship in web development.
I created a blog as a way to show my ideas and mostly, my developed games.
You can see them here: http://viniciusdevelops.azurewebsites.net/vinicius-develops-games

Some of those games were developed at Ludum Dare (Noir Game &amp; Slices of Life), Gamedev.net contest (Dinorace) and GameJolt competition as well. Also discovered that contests are a great motivation factor for starting and finishing your projects.

Currently I'm interested in C# and Unity development, gathering as much framework specific and agnostic knowledge on game development. So right know, what probably lacks me more is time and discipline.

So cheers to everyone and I hope that we can grow together in this learning path! :)"

* Me: 24M
* Her: 24F
* Let me start at the beginning. March 5 2008. I start dating a wonderful girl in high school. The most popular one. I was the loser. Stereotypical high school romance, we kissed, we hung out a lot, we talked about sex but said we wanted to save it for when we were ready. We were happy. We loved each other.
* September 2008, we start university. Things are fine and dandy until the end of December when my parents start saying they don't approve of my girlfriend. I leave. I move in with a friend for a few months. I get a great job and blow it because I don't get up in the morning, and I feel depressed. Because of this I also fail my first year, putting me on probation.
* September 2009. Things are great, I'm finally taking classes I want (computer science). My relationship with my girlfriend is great, we're talking all the time, chatting, etc.
* November 2009. I join the naval reserve. My parents hate it, and the stress it puts on us forces me to move out. Again. I move to a bachelor suite apartment. Life is crap.
* January 2010. I start becoming violent towards my girlfriend. Things are shaky, and then, one day, after a fight we had, I walk out to go and calm down. She starts to head home. It's 10 at night. She has to walk a couple blocks downtown. She gets to the bus station and pulled to the parking lot and gets raped.
* I can't believe it. I feel like it was all my fault. Like I should have been better to her, should have been there for her. I don't know what to do. I talk to her and she tells me about it, and I help her heal.
* April 2010. I move my things back to my parents' house because I'm leaving for Basic Training. I let my girlfriend use my laptop while I'm gone because hers is crap. First week, she finds some pictures I had on there that I didn't want her to find (I know, shouldn't have been looking at them in the first place. I learned). I give her a call when I can, and she lights me up. Just furious.
* She says I have until the end of basic to show that I've changed. Until then, she thinks it's okay to hang out with and go to dinner with random guys she meets that ask her out. She never goes home with them, just gets free suppers from them.
* August 2010. I come home for three days. We stay in a hotel in my home town since it's the first time we've seen each other for two months. I get a tattoo with her name in it (in Vietnamese characters (like Chinese). Her idea). I go away again for a month.
* September 2010. I'm away for more military training. She's home. She tells me she cheated on me in February with one of our ""friends"". I don't even know how to feel. I take a few moments and feel that I deserved it and tell her I'll take her back. She's surprised and says she'll show me that she'll never do that again.
* So things seem great at this point. Sure a bit shaky since the whole cheating thing, but yeah.
* 2011 to 2013 are pretty much a blur. She moved away because she failed University and her parents wouldn't understand, so she tells them she's in an internship program. I'm thinking ""Okay, we've been doing the long distance thing for a while since I've been away on ships, this'll be fine.""
* November 2013. She has some male friends over to her apartment that she's showing the city to. I don't really worry about it, don't care. I come there in early December to be with her, and she's distant as hell. I can't figure out what's wrong. Turns out one of her friends had fingered her while she was asleep, so she felt numb to any affection. 
* During my time there (until early January) we try and have sex a few times (initiated by her), but it always ends in her tears because it hurts her too much. I'm worried as hell about her, but she says she'll be ok.
* March 21 2014. She leaves to go to Disneyland with a few of her friends she made on League of Legends. I think ""Great. A nice vacation for her.""
* March 30 2014. She returns. Every time I landed from my plane trips, I'd call her. I'd let her know I landed. Her? No. I text ""Hey make sure to call me when you land!""
* Her: ""Oh I'm in customs, I'll call you on my way home""
* Me: ""Ok.""
* 3 hours later
* Me: ""Hey I hope you're okay...""
* Her: ""Yeah I'm just playing league.""
* Me: ""...oh. Well I just feel kind of pushed aside right now.""
* And I explain my feelings. She says she wants to take a break from our relationship so she can have some time to think. At this point I'm thinking ""Oh no did something happen."" so I ask one of her friends that went with her to Disneyland if I should be worried about my relationship with her. He says ""I hate to bear bad news, but maybe.""
* March 31 2014. I confront her about it. She says she doesn't have any romantic feelings for me anymore. That she has started to have feelings for one of the guys that she went to Disneyland with. I'm crushed. I basically say ""If you loved me there wouldn't be a second.""
* We break up.
* It's April 1 2014. 
* It's not an April Fool's joke. However much I wish to God it was.
* I've been trying to get over her since but it's so hard. I see her friends uploading pictures of their trip and I can't help but feel this painful pit in my stomach whenever I see her. Knowing she'll never look at me with love in her eyes again.
* She was my life.
* And now she's gone.
* I don't know what to do, what to think. I've tried breaking contact with her but every time I do I just get sucked back into the feelings I have for her.
* It's so hard.
* **tl;dr: My life is a trainwreck at this point and I don't have any motivation to continue. The love of my life isn't there anymore, I can't think straight, I feel like an empty shell.**"
228kqj,42,2014-04-04,Work attire for a casual tech company?,ringabell,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/228kqj/work_attire_for_a_casual_tech_company/,"Hi everyone! I'm a freshman computer science undergrad and I recently accepted an offer to intern at a top Silicon Valley company (pretty big, has a couple thousand employees in this particular office) this summer. I've talked to my recruiter about what type of attire would be appropriate and she said that casual attire like jeans and a t-shirt would be fine and if anything encouraged. Which seems easy enough, but ""casual"" is pretty vague.

Some information about my body type: I'm 5'6 and 135 lbs, bust-waist-hips is 36-27-37.

For reference, here's what my male CS peers typically wear: jeans (ranging from holey to nice dark denim), an American Apparel tee branded with a tech company (like Dropbox or MongoDB) they got for free, a free shirt branded with some hackathon (like MHacks or PennApps), a flannel/plaid shirt, ""nicer"" athletic shoes, casual sneakers like vans/converse. It wouldn't be too hard to mirror what my male peers wear--so long as the temperature is under 70ish degrees. I have plenty of jeans and non-boob tees.

I'm mostly concerned about what to wear when it gets warmer. Are shorts appropriate? Obviously not denim cutoffs, but what about [athletic shorts](http://media.volleyballcentral.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/a/d/adi.9835.049.jpg)? Or [athletic leggings](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=74029764)? Also, are [sleeveless shirts](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/600685118/2012-summer-popular-women-s-slim-all-match-pleated-sleeveless-shirt-women-s-fashion-ladies-Blouses.jpg) appropriate? What about [tank tops](http://listdose.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Tank-Top1.jpg)? What about [spaghetti strap tops](http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-22562677185084/women-s-spaghetti-strap-tank-top-1.jpg)? What about dresses/skirts?

I've also gotten some (ostensibly sarcastic) flak from my CS classmates for ""dressing up too much"" when wearing dresses and jewelry. And one time I wore a casual  dress like [this](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=78499240) (attire was ""casual"") to a career event and when I approached the recruiter he told me that they're only hiring computer science majors. Is it ridiculous that I'm paranoid about dressing too nice/feminine in fear that people won't take me seriously? Given my age I'm already going to be one of the most inexperienced interns on the company's site."

(This a throw-away account because I sister knows my real one)
(Forgive any grammatical errors, I wrote this on my phone.)

My now ex-boyfriend and I have one of those friendships were you just kind of fall into a relationship. It was inevitable for us to be together eventually, I remember clearly 4 years ago after his sister’s wedding reception when he was completely wasted he told me he was going to marry me, and I accepted that statement as fact; because at the time IT WAS LIKE FREAKING PROPHECY, written in stone and shit. After knowing someone and loving someone as long as we loved each other...I figured it was inevitable. 

We lasted for almost 2 whole years and it was amazing, I loved that man; I still love that man and I know you all are wondering where the raptor action is, but it’s here and it’s coming but I need you guys to see the entire story first. 

My ex took over his mom’s company about a year into our relationship and had to start traveling a lot, it wasn’t that bad because we were never the clingy type. We were always friends first, even after we became official it seemed to stay that way. About two month into his traveling I started an internship with small clothing line and that is where I met her. She was the owner’s little sister who helped out. She is amazing, and we hit it off immediately. After a month we were practically inseparable, we texted non-stop, fell asleep with each other on the phone, we went everywhere together, even grocery shopping. Overtime this tension started to built between us and it just kept building. It was confusing at first cause I’m bi and in a awesome relationship with an awesome guy and SHE IS STRAIGHT! So I just figured it was one sided, I was just sexually frustrated, and she’s a pretty girl. But after a while she wasn’t just pretty to me she became the most gorgeous thing I have ever laid my eyes on. Overtime I began getting jealous when she went on dates. I started catch her staring at me. After a while I realized all we did was flirt. Basically I was falling for a straight girl and I panicked. because I’m totally in love my freaking boyfriend right? And also ABORT THE FUCKING MISSION SHE IS YOUR STRAIGHT BEST FRIEND…..not again. 

So I put some space between us for a while, and started making my boyfriend spend more time at home, but I got really sad and my sweet, caring, attentive boyfriend realized how sad I was and because I basically talk about this girl non-stop and he knows what a great “friend” she is, he invited her over for dinner two days ago. It was hella awkward, there just so much tension between the three of us. Despite the awkwardness, the chemistry I have with her overcame the tension and despite me blowing her off for a while I lit up light the freaking sun around her. My ex became the third wheel over dinner and after she left everything just kind of shifted between my ex and I.

Yesterday he sat me down and broke up with me, not because he’s not in love with me, but because I’m not in love with him. He said watching me and her interact was like watching his sister and her husband interact( the perfect relationship). He said I was basically glowing around her. He asked me if I noticed the way she looks at me, he said her eyes “do the things that people describe in romance novels”. He said that she makes me happy in a way that he doesn't anymore, and as much as it hurts him he rather see me happy with someone else than be miserable with him, and then he left to go away to work and we haven’t spoken since.

I feel like complete shit because I do love that man; he is my soulmate but I’m not in love with him. I’m helplessly in love with her. How do I even pursue something with her? Should i even pursue something with her? I don’t even know for sure how she feels……

I just really need to talk to people who won’t judge me because everyone in my life thinks my ex and I are perfect together….but that’s all shit now.

What do I do?

229e2y,7,2014-04-05,Don't know what to do about negative EC experiences,doubtingitall,ECEProfessionals,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECEProfessionals/comments/229e2y/dont_know_what_to_do_about_negative_ec_experiences/,"Hey there, ECEC.

I am 24  years old, and I'm a university educated teacher, Primary school and EC. I have a bit of an conundrum. I only ask that you read my story with an open mind and try not to be too judgmental. I'm pretty thin skinned, and I already feel atrocious. Please try to talk to me as you would a friend or a colleague, not as someone who you can safely condescend and belittle in anonymity. I know that this sub isn't like that, but a lot of reddit is, sadly ... once bitten, twice shy.

During my internship I had a few experiences that were pretty confusing and confronting. One of the places I went to was an extremely hostile workplace - among the things that happened there, I was told: not to ever listen to one staff member who I was often rostered on with (and the third person would sometimes be a casual), to ALWAYS ask what I should do about any situation (and then criticized and when I interrupted a staff member's lunch break to ask if I should put a baby to sleep in another room since the first cot room was occupied by a screaming child); told to leave a 2 yr old girl to scream because she did not want to sleep, found the same girl wrapped so tightly in sheets she could not free her arms, covered in tears and snot, extremely red in the face; asked the group leader in my room if I was doing well on my internship, and got told ""What do you mean?"" - offered no feedback at all and the group leader acted as if I was an idiot for asking; got taken into a meeting with the district head of the preschool and told ""not to make any messes, because we will not be cleaning them up"", got a bit distressed and asked what I had done wrong, and the reply was ""Well you'd have to ask the director about that"" (so, intimidated for no reason, she didn't even know if I'd done anything wrong or not).

I don't think I did anything wrong on that internship, as six months later, I was given very good reviews at a better center.

I was pretty willing to write that experience off, as I later learned they had just had their director quit on them with no notice (and that director had been the one who had accepted an intern). I had a pretty good internship six months later and graduated.

I recently was working 3 days a week as a group leader, my first ever job. However, conditions at my job were really awkward. Although I was told the job was for 3 days, it was really only for 2 in the room I was assigned, and 1 day in another room. The other group leader very aggressively told me that I was mistaken about my contracted hours and should only work 2 days a week. She also seemed threatened by me being there at all and was very rude to me.

I was never given an induction, never told how things worked, I had to work it out on my own. The director never showed me anything, the only person who helped me was the 2IC of the room, and it wasn't her job, so I don't think she understood I got NO other support in learning how the center operated. The ""rules"" were never clear - the old group leader who I was replacing told me (she continued to work for 2 weeks during the ""transition"") that it was okay to let the 4-5 yr olds through to their room alone, but I considered that a supervision risk. So I would keep the door to the connecting bathroom closed while we were outdoors (imagine, room where I worked, connected to a bathroom, connected to the preschool room) - and I would walk the children through the room where I worked, to the bathroom, open the door for them, to check they were not walking through.

However, one day, the Other group leader told me this was not allowed since we were limiting access to the toilets. Fair enough. She did this in a very aggressive way, however. But when I told her about children walking through (which I had seen happen, they would tell the staff they were going to the toilet and then walk through to their rooms), she became very upset and walked outside to yell at the kids. 

As you can see, the ""rules"" were not consistent between staff (no one knew what the ""right"" thing to do was) and after this the situation was just left as-is, children going through to the other room unescorted. My idea of putting a latch on the preschool side was ignored.

My main problem, however, is much more than that. I could dismiss everything above as bad management - even when I sent an email to my director with my concerns and was basically ignored.

However, it seemed to me I have some more basic problems with ECEC than that. 

We had 3 people in a room of 16-20 three and four year olds. We were supposed to run indoor-outdoor play - however the outdoor space was huge. Google Earth says 40 x 28, cut into half as a triangle, which somehow comes out as 560 square meters, which seems large? We shared it with 2 other rooms, but one of those rooms went inside during the middle of the day, 9-3, and of the other room, often one person was outside. Similarly, often in the room I worked in, because of 10 min and lunch breaks, cleaning up, etc. there was only one person from our room outside. So, often, two or three people were supervising ~30 2-3 yr olds (the children in my room were turning 4 this year, but this was January). I found the supervision to be lacking (there was always a water tray, which technically takes one person to supervise per regulations - also climbing frames and a cubby house). Multiple times, I was serving lunch alone to half of the room while the other half could be 40m away on climbing frames, while the other person was inside cleaning. I eventually decided to suspend indoor/outdoor against the directors wishes, and I still wasn't secure with 1 person doing lunch while the other person supervised the entire playground with the other half or two thirds of the children. Really, that meant that the person doing lunch was occupied, and the other person was occupied dealing with ""spotfires"" (children who were fighting/needed to be directed to stop throwing blocks/tipping sand out of the sandpit/whatever), and no one was really engaging with any children.

Another thing I felt was that in the midst of sunscreen every two hours, morning tea/afternoon tea/lunch, vacuuming/mopping/bathroom cleaning/taking the food into the kitchen and putting it through the dishwasher, I didn't feel like I had any time to observe play, relationship build or help scaffold conflicts. One day I counted half an hour of actual working with children (sitting down to having sustained shared thinking, or social problem solving), rather than ""spotfire management"" or cleaning or routines *in my entire shift*. 

Often, there would be two crying children and only one of me. That was the state things were in. And even then, I was missing things, like a child hiding behind the cubby and crying, or not being able to hand out notes to parents (which the director slammed us pretty hard for).

I think a lot of this was because of the indoor/outdoor thing, too big a space available for only 3 people to manage, esp. since we didn't get any floaters for 10 min breaks or 1/2 hr lunch breaks. My last week there, I was literally unable to get free of crying children and necessary supervision to vacuum/clean the room as must be done on Tuesdays. (The main reason being that the nursery was the ""combine after 4.30pm"" space, but told us not to come over there. And myself and the other person on lates were both needed to supervise the very energetic children in the combined 3-5 group.)

But even when I ditched indoor/outdoor, I was still finding that it was an absolute mess, with no time to do what I consider the ""real work"" of an ECEC professional - scaffolding social success (teaching children how to enter play successfully, how to solve when a child won't move off the climbing frame, teaching how to take turns, talking about why saying ""You're not my best friend"" can hurt feelings and what we can do about the feelings they are having, etc.); scaffolding dramatic play; making plans for children who need more help with language or emotional regulation and enacting those plans (during internships I did instrumental language programs; I once helped a child who would have a meltdown any time she could not immediately access a toy she wanted, to be able to tolerate that situation; these are the things I find rewarding and important in ECEC); exploring the world in depth with children and having meaningful conversations about what they're thinking and feeling and doing. 

Was the place I was working just an awfully managed nightmare with too much space for too little staff? Or is this how it is in the ""real world""? How much of your day to you spend doing ""meaningful teaching"" (I mean this in a way that includes understanding free play is absolutely paramount for ECEC) rather than routines (seriously think I spent 1/2 my shift on food and sunscreen)/managing spotfire problems/running from crying child to crying child?

PS. Another reason this might have been an overwhelming situation - we had a very high needs child who had no aide or other support, so even when there was a third person in the room, they were often occupied with this particular child. "
229h5e,0,2014-04-05,She doesn't feel what she used to feel about me anymore.,GottaDoBanana,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/229h5e/she_doesnt_feel_what_she_used_to_feel_about_me/,"**Background**: 400km away. We've known each other online since August 2013. Each weekend we'd watch movies/anime/ together. I met her in real-life in October 2013 as friends. In January 2014 I said I'm developing feelings for her. I told her this just exactly a week before her trip to China for a one month internship. 

During the week before her trip, we talked so much about how we like each other, flirted a lot, about how she wanted to kiss and hug me and how I wanted to hold her close to me... etc. 

In the month, she was of course too busy and not to mention, she had crappy internet. So rarely did we ever talk and when we did, its all kisses and happy stuff.

She came back. She joined a program and that made her busy. Not once has she told me that she missed me. All my attempts to flirt or express how I like her would get shut down. I felt I was forcing it. I stopped what I was doing. I told myself perhaps she's way too busy to think of such emotions and I should give her time or let her express herself when she feels like it.

It never happened.

87 days later since she told me that she likes me, she tells me that she doesn't feel it anymore. That she right now appreciates me as her best-friend, her closest friend and that she values me more than her close 2 friends and whenever something happens, its me who she wants to tell first. I just sighed. She knew I hate the 'best friend' bullshit. She said it that she knows but that's how it is for now.

I ended it at 'Okay. Yes. Both of us have our exams coming, and life to lead. A relationship should be the final touches to a one's life, right?'. I was kind of satisfied. Thinking perhaps after she was done with her program, she'd perhaps try like me again.

A week after being like this, I started questioning myself whether she is thinking that after her program finishes, we'd get together again or she really doesn't know if, ever, we'd get together again.

I couldn't bear it. I had to ask her. Lots of silence. I had to be direct. '*Are you taking a break or are we breaking this up?*'. It was the latter. I was heartbroken because I was led to believe it was the former for almost a week, or so what I've tried to convince myself it was that case.

Supposedly, she wanted me badly to come to this festival in her city that runs from 25-26th April. I thought I would be able to hold her hands. I don't think I can this way. I told her that I don't think I can meet her this way in real-life again, and most likely never. It's too hard. 

She's someone that came into my life when I needed someone so badly to fill a gap. I didn't realize what I was doing and so I've filled it with her. Realizing I might lose her makes it extra hard.

Due to that, I thought that I must take a break from her and I need to fill that gap with different things other than her and so I have told her. She said she will respect whatever decision I make. 

My exams will finish in 21st of May. That's about 45 days from now. After my exams, I will speak to her. I don't know what to expect or to do by then. I'm really afraid I will be saying '*I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore*'. It's either that, or messaging her on WhatsApp '*9pm?*' to get online at that time to watch anime or a movie with me and we go back to how it was before I told her my feelings.

I'm torn. I don't want to lose her. I want her to be mine. FUCK. I DONT KNOW WHAT BEING 'FRIENDS' WITH HER IS. I will always have the fucking 'I like you' on the tip of my tongue. 

Should I go to that festival? It's only 400km away and I kind of want to go myself too. By the way, when we met, it was with her other 2 friends. It was really fun time. This festival, her friends will come and her friends REALLY like me and excited to see me and I'm sure it will be fun time for everyone but, deep in my heart, *it will be a living hell*. 

Should I meet her in the summer vacation? I really want to try with her again.

I think I don't mind being her friend if she will acknowledge the fact I will always like her. I told that and she said she does acknowledge it. I guess its fine? But if one day she'd tell me that there is this dude she got into a relationship with.. well, I guess that will just crush me to bits.


**TL;DR**. Met online for 3 months, met in real life for a day with her 2 girl friends (both of us, including her friends had the fun of our year that night), 3 months later or so, I confess having developed feelings for her, she says she's been feeling the same way. She goes on a trip for a month, comes back a total different person. 1 month later, she tells me that she no longer have feelings for me but she values me more than her best friends and would give anyone to have me as her friend. I'm disorientated. I tell her this is really hard on me and I want to take a break because I need to figure out how my life is without her. She says okay. I don't know what to expect nor what to do. **Any of you guys had similar situations? Taking a break? What was the outcome?**"

My sister Jan found her soul mate in Brad. Brad is forty and works a really good job, makes $100,000+ a year. Jan thinks this makes her hot shit. 

She has no formal education, but talks down to people who do. ""Oh, you had to waste years cultivating your mind? Look, I went to Italy."" 

The rest of us have been working our assess of to pay for our education. 

My sister and I used to be close, but we are now almost no contact. This was because Brad admitted that he thought I was prettier than Jan, because I am ten years younger. She has since made comments about my weight, my looks, etc. 

It has gotten to the point where I no longer care and have just responded with, ""But Brad doesn't think so."" Not the best line, but it shuts her up. 

Recently, my grandfather turned 98. Grandpa John is the best man I know. But he is not likely to make it past the next year or so. He has sold his home, given away anything he does not want to keep, and given the money to the ""younglings"" to pay off their debts. 

He paid off my $40,000 college and medical debt. I am now literally free to live my life. I was working long hours and going to school to pay for everything, but now I can focus on school. He also gave me some money to live off of. 

He paid almost $200,000 in debts for my cousins, myself, and my aunt who is very sick. When my sister heard about this, she went into a rage and drove to my grandpa's house. 

I am not sure what was said, but my grandpa told her she is no longer welcome in his presence, she is not to think she will inherit anything, and he wants to live out his last years without her around. Or so my Mother told me, though she was too upset to say more than the jist of it. 

Grandpa John refuses to answer any of her phone calls and has told my mother not to invite Jan to his 98th birthday party. 

When my grandmother was sick, Jan came to see her once. During that time she ""called dibs"" on some of my grandmother's jewelry. She said the words, ""When you die can I have..."" My grandfather asked her to leave. 

My sister has been taking out her attitude on myself and the cousins, because she feels it is unfair we are being helped and she is not. She is not in debt, she had scholarships to pay for her school and our parents helped her out. She has her ""rich and amazing"" husband. But she can't stand that someone might want to help us plebeians out when she needs a new car (her car is brand new, but she wants a better one.) 

Grandpa John has told me he wants to see me happy. Which is great, because Jan (and sometimes my parents) don't seem to give a crap. 

Sierra (my cousin) and I were invited to intern in Japan with a friend of mine. I speak almost fluent Japanese, along with most of my cousins, because we are 3rd generation. Jan is the only one who refused to learn and is furious that we sometimes speak in our native tongue just so we can have some time to ourself because she storms out. She thinks being Japanese is tacky and says she is Chinese, though she speaks only English. 

My grandfather has offered to cover all the costs of the move. I have always wanted to live in Japan for longer than the three months during the summers when I was a child. He has said he will give me my inheritance now and if I can manage to move there, he will help all he can. Sierra also got the same offer. He boyfriend is Japanese, so she wants to move there, work, and then marry him. 

My sister found out, pounded on my door at 7am, and pushed her way inside. She then yelled at me so loudly my neighbors pounded on the wall. I told her to leave. She would not. I got 20 minutes of her calling me a worthless traitor. 

I am so sick of this shit. I have been in tears. She *always* does this. My parents agreed with her and said she is the eldest, she deserves the best. I am just too sensitive. 

I am going, and this is likely going to be my last post onto reddit. I am leaving my life here behind in two weeks, with my cousin. 

I just wanted to share."

I think we've got a lot to work with. I'm gonna put this up as a list, and then place the ideas again as comments.

1st thing I wanna lay out there, I'd like to bring in more Mods to help delegate tasks. Ideally each of these subsets of ideas could have one or 2 dedicated mods (in the case of daily discussions, each one could have a mod) 

Reddit's message system is not the best, so I went ahead and set up a gmail account - redditjournalists@gmail.com - to help organize contacts. I'll give access to this account for all mods. We can also use this account to request AMAs and generally track any work done outside of reddit. 

I know some of you reached out about becoming mods, if you are still interested, PLEASE EMAIL redditjournalists@gmail.com and put your reddit account name in the body of the email. 

Please realize this is a real commitment. We are all busy as hell I'm sure, but if we all take on small parts of this project it might be a lot easier. 

Ok, here's the notes I got from comments: 


**Update side bar:**
	link to FAQ:
		how to get into journalism
		advice for new journalists
	resources for current journalists ?
	Journalism jobs thread - one thread to post all jobs and rule them all


**Whats trending?** - I’m hesitant to use this idea because i’m guessing it would be a lot of work and we already have a number of tools (twitter, Facebook, etc) which give us this info, but i’m open to debate if someone wants to take it on themselves 

	
**Allowing memes/jokes**
	journalism related, not “news” jokes
	“over heard in the news room” style stories 
	Headline discussions - “I’m really proud of this one” or “Anyone got ideas for…”
 


**Weekly discussions:**
	Student journalists - ""What's Happening On Campus Wednesdays” brofession
	staying organized - tech/lingo
	""Theory Thursdays"" 
	Self-post day for critique 
	favorite story of the week
	Data journalism discussions 


**Self posts/links about the state of journalism** 
Help a Journalist with (HaJ) - source requests 


**Limiting link posts!** 
I got some flack for this, but i think it might be interesting to at least try out for a week - it does stop any of us from gaining karma from posts, which could also nix some of the “this is why journalism sucks!” posts. I’ve seen other subs that don’t allow link posts and you’d be amazed at how much more goes into an individual post because of it. This might seem weird to some people, but I really think giving it a shot wouldn’t be a bad idea  


**AMAs from pros?** - both requests (can anyone get us XYZ?) and suggestions (Would anyone like an AMA from XYZ?)

**Custom theme and shoo** -  
adding flair - Freelance, Copy Editor, Producer, Associate Producer, Anchor, Photographer, Photojournalist, Intern, Magazine, Broadcast, Online Editor.
(This is a no brainer, and will probably be a 2 mod task for the first week and then get cut down to one just for long-term upkeep )


**Tagging posts as print, broadcast, web** - I can check with mods of other subs and see how we can make this a thing, not sure if totally relevant, but it might not be hard to make happen 

———
There are a lot of good ideas here and someone of them could be enforced with a heavy hand. Lets make sure we don’t do that! Lets keep this sub fun (Especially for the mods cause we’ve got other shit to stress us out) 

I’m gonna put all of these ideas in the comments below so up vote what you link and down vote what you don’t. 

I’ll leave this up over the weekend and i’ll check the redditjournalists gmail monday and start sending out mod invites "

Got an internship in SW DC this summer, so I feel like now would be the time if ever to do it (especially since this is my last year in maryland :( *i think...*)

But I was looking at the season ticket plans, and I think it was Abe's plan that had a lot of weeknight games that i would really like, 19 games and it was $931 for the LF/RF reserved, which are pretty awesome seats.

Even though I would **love** to go to baseball games alone all the time (my friends heckle me for keeping a scorecard), every now and then its fun to go with friends. If I had one of the partial plans how hard would it be to:

1. Sell my tickets if theres a game I couldn't make it to
1. Switch my ticket for one that I bought with friends so I could sit with them?

Also is it a good deal? Looks like a good deal. Thanks in advance, **GO NATS!**

PS who should I change my flair to? I might have to retire Clipboard from the honor :("
22aktw,12,2014-04-05,Me [26M] with my GF [27F] of 2 years living continents apart: Her patience is running out and she wants me there NOW which I cannot afford. Help! :(,longfaraway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22aktw/me_26m_with_my_gf_27f_of_2_years_living/,"Both of us are of different nationalities and we met when I was in her city for a business trip. I was there for 10 months and we got really close during this time which led to us moving in together within 5 months of meeting each other. 

Apart from the usual arguments on who gets to do the dishes (usually it's my fault), the 5 months flew past us without any major arguments or disturbances. In short, it was a true honeymoon period of 5 months. 

After this I had to return to my home and we had the ever popular long distance routine of skype calls for about 4 months after this. During this period, my debts piled up and I lost my job within a couple of months.

Things started looking good when she landed herself an internship in my hometown along with a work Visa that would allow her to stay in my country for a year. I also managed to nail a decent paying job in a mid-sized organization that would allow me to pay off my debts little by little every month. All was well when she was here but the trouble slowly started when she had to leave last November because she wanted to be closer to her niece who has some weird-ass genetic condition.

I couldn't accompany her as there is no way I could have afforded such a trip at that point of time (I was new to the job and just settling in). It's been 6 months since she left and we miss each other a lot. However, I can sense that she is getting depressed(?) since our skype sessions over the last 3-4 weeks are ending with bitter arguments over the silliest of things. Part of this is also due to the fact that she is finding it hard to land a job there in her country and the environment in her home (she had to move in with her parents) is really negative. I can understand that I have become an outlet for her frustrations and I even had a long 3 hour chat with her which ended in her feeling sorry for being too harsh on me.

She is expecting me to move in with her in her hometown. But I cannot afford the inter-continental trip right now either. She knows it but just can't seem to get this into her head. I'd totally love to move in with her but all I need is a little bit of patience from her side as I had already talked to my bosses about telecommuting from her place. They are pretty cool with it taking into account my performance over the last year. However, it would take atleast 4-5 months more for the legal stuff to be sorted out (Visas and all). Her argument is something along the lines of me loving my job here more than her and she wants me to quit and search for a job there (The job market there is bollocks and I won't be able to pay off my debts). I am finding it really hard to convince her otherwise.

I just am not able to pass the message of 'Just hang in there, girl' no matter how hard I try. She hangs up if I tell her this and just disappears for the next 36 hours. This routine is sapping each others energy and I am noticing that our skype sessions are getting shorter and shorter every day. How do I make her understand?


TL;DR: Long distance relationship where neither of us can afford to see each other for the next 4-5 months. She is frustrated and I want to give her a bear hug and say, ""Hang in there, I am coming"" :(

22arut,1,2014-04-05,"After some terrible financial decisions, I'm ready to dig myself out",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/22arut/after_some_terrible_financial_decisions_im_ready/,"Hey PF, long time lurker. Throwaway, for anonymity. I'm looking for some advice on my plan to dig myself out of some earlier poor financial choices. Quick background story might be useful.

After my second year in college, I went on a co-op that quickly turned into a full time job offer. Being young and incredibly foolish, I ended up with one car loan at $13k and a second car loan at $7k. I never missed any payments and had a credit score of 800+, but it seemed like there'd never be an end to the payments. I lived paycheck-to-paycheck for two years, and when I grew tired of it, I realized I had to go back to school to really have a chance of digging myself out of this mess.

I buckled down and saved every possible penny for a year, but the week classes started, I was laid off from my job. I had counted on a continued part time income when saving and budgeting, so the loss hit me hard. I wasn't able to find part-time work at anywhere near the same pay rate; my savings quickly ran dry, and I racked up $6k in credit card debt.

Fortunately, my dad loaned me $10k over the course of two years to cover my rent/school needs. The $13k car was repossessed, the other loan went into default, and the credit card account was eventually closed. I sold/pawned every single thing I owned (EVERY. THING.) to have enough for food. With a summer internship, I was able to save up enough to buy a beat-up old camaro for $1.5k. 

Since I graduated last June, I've held a full-time position making $60k salary, with $5k in bonuses last year. I'm expecting a $15k raise this June, and $10k in bonuses this year. I paid off the credit card debt and the remaining repo debt as of last December, while making minimum payments on everything else. My remaining debts:

* $7k owed to my dad, no interest
* $4k owed to different bank for older car loan (for a car I no longer had) , 0% 
*  ~$47k in 10 federal student loans, ranging from $1.2k to $9k, mostly at 6.8% 
* $4.5k perkins loans
* ~$2k in various collections for hospital bills and such
* $11k for a car that was SUPPOSED to be more reliable, bought last October, 3.5%

I wanted to be further along by now, but a lot of costly emergencies came up (e.g. $4k needed for a new engine for my car when the engine threw a rod the day after the warranty expired). 

As I currently stand, I have $486 in my checking account, and roughly bi-weekly paychecks. My expenses are:

* $550/month rent
* $45/month vet bill (dog gets a lot of ear infections)
* $65/month garage fee at work
* $100/month car insurance.
* $360/month savings
* $8/month netflix
* $150/week ""allowance"" (buy groceries, haircuts, drinks)

My top priority is repaying my dad - I'm committed to paying him $500/month, but want to squeeze in as much more as possible. My minimum payments for my debts come out to $700/month (excluding dad); I'd like to start with a snowball of an extra $1k put towards payments to my dad, and at least another $360/month to savings. After that loan's repaid, I want to quickly drop the balance of my car loan to at least $8k, as this car is incredibly high risk for throwing another rod. I'd like to trade it in for something comparable ASAP. From there, I think I may want to tackle the smallest student loans first - most of them are at 6.8%, including a $10k one.

I currently have no 401k, but want to starting making contributions (even if they're only 1%). I have no real assets, aside from my old camaro (not going to part with it - at 170,000 miles, she's only needed $500 in parts in 2 years and I do the labor).

Does this sound like a feasible/sustainable plan? Between graduation and now, I've been throwing money at things without fully planning it out. I sometimes go 3, almost 4 weeks without a paycheck (but I always receive two each month), so budgeting is incredibly difficult. I'm finally starting to see money left over at the end of the pay period, and I want to make sure I'm using it wisely.

TL;DR: Car dealership screwed me over. Lots of debt resulted. Hopefully not drowning in it?

22au8h,0,2014-04-05,Comprehensive introduction to networking,[deleted],networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/22au8h/comprehensive_introduction_to_networking/,"I always liked computers, loved video games etc. I like managing software and tweaking all options to suit me. In college I studied IT and I loved programming. My only experiences with networking were when I needed home router configured or connecting notebook to WiFi. I had some classes in college, but honestly I didn't pay to much attention. It didn't interest me then and I was focused on programming. Now I program some small projects but I got day job as a helpdesk-kinda-thing. It's internship and they give me a lot of slack, but most of the work is with configuring routers etc. They don't expect me to do anything with it if I don't want to, but I really would like to know something about everything that is going on there.

So my question is: where can I find some really thorough guide or something that would explain the basics and more advanced stuff. I'm really having problems even with basic stuff like what are bridges and masks (the only thing that I do understand is converting decimal addresses to binary and vice versa, but it's simple mathematics)."

I'm the devoted family man with a hot, loyal wife and 4 gorgeous daughters aged 19 to 13. I've never dreamed of hurting you or the girls. I've done everything in my power to please you, to dote on our bright, vivacious girls But men are weak.

Then that girl, a young college intern, started at my office and I fell victim to her flirtation and my own male urges. One night I lied to you, a first, and said I was staying late to work. Ever my devoted wife, you came to bring me dinner. A full sirloin steak and baked potato. Arriving at the office you catch me redhanded nailing that slut on the conference room table.

She tearfully retreated and I stopped the encounter, realizing I'd made a colossal mistake. You pack me a bag and told me to stay at my brother's house until further instructed. Knowing it's my only chance, I agree.

A week later you send me a message for me to return home where you'll give me one chance to make amends.

(Without giving away the whole plot: this would involve my being shamed by my family of women, then being ""forced"" to have sex with our daughters as you prove that I was a fool for seeking Sex outside of our family)

22bb3z,1,2014-04-05,"My ex [22 F] left me [21 M] after 4 years because she ""wanted to find herself"". Having a hard time getting over her.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22bb3z/my_ex_22_f_left_me_21_m_after_4_years_because_she/,"Hi. After having a bad dream last night about my ex hooking up with another guy, I've been having a rough time.

We started dating in high school, and everything was fine. But she wanted to go college out of state (she was already accepted). We talked about it and decided we wanted to try and make long distance work out as opposed to ending the relationship there. This was after about two years.

At first, it was hard to trust her because I am a jealous type and the long distance idea was scary. But over time I got used to the idea and trusted her fully. 

I would only see her during major holidays, sometimes not all of them. But I trusted her because I thought all of the waiting, all of the longing would eventually pay off when we could finally be reunited for good.

I figured that since I was working on an engineering degree, eventually I'd be able to follow her with an internship or a job. Up until recently that was a goal that I was striving for. Today I still strive to do well, but I won't go anywhere near that state.

She had just come in for Christmas and our four year anniversary, and we were happy to be together again. Everything seemed normal, there were no signs that she had made a decision in her mind to leave me (and for all I know she didn't yet). I drove her to the airport and she left for what I didn't realize was going to be the last time I'd see her (as my girlfriend).

Then early the next month, she called me and told me she wanted to take a break, and when I asked for clarification, she confirmed that it was a breakup. I asked why, and she said she wanted to find herself. I questioned her further and she said that she wanted to be able to go out and not have to worry about what I would think.

I was devastated. I was thinking about her 24/7 and even called her once simply because I wanted to hear her voice. When I went to my friends and family for counsel, they told me to do the best I could to forget about her, keep busy, and time will heal it eventually.

I got better, but I still think about her every night and when my brain is otherwise idle. I've thought about other girls because that is another option my family mentioned, but every time I imagine trying to be with somebody else, I imagine her with somebody else and I shutter. I imagine that if I date somebody, then it is ""fair game"" for her to date somebody too.

So flash forward three months from the breakup and here I am. I had a bad dream about her being with another guy, which sparked this recent emotional burst. I thought about calling her and asking for clarification about why she left me, but my friends and family advise against it, saying it is pointless to look for that answer because it won't fix anything.

But I really want to know. I want peace of mind. I don't know if asking her will give that to me. What should I do?


---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 4 years (2 long distance) left me to ""find herself"". Was unclear about why she left. Should I call her for clarification about why 3 months later?

**EDIT**
For better or worse, I've sent her a message trying to get clarification. We'll see how that goes.

**EDIT 2**
She called me immature for contacting her through a facebook message. Honestly I was just trying to give her the option to read what I had to say in a well-thought out form and to give her the option to ignore it, like Lollipop77 suggested. She called me and then she acted more civil. She told me that about 6 months before she left, guys had started to ask her out and she felt trapped. She wanted to date them, but didn't want to hurt me. She said she was lonely. She eventually decided that rather than wait for me, which to be fair was an undefined period of time before I could move out to her, she gave in and wanted to be single and date other men so she didn't have to be lonely anymore.

I feel better now. The truth she revealed is one of many scenarios that I had speculated, but it feels good to finally have heard it from her mouth. I know now that beyond a shadow of a doubt that she really has chosen other men over me. No debate. Truthfully, it did create more questions, just like toshibathetv said it would. But now I don't feel the need to ask those questions because now I can see, and really believe, that they are pointless now. But I think I made the right decision. I can compare it to learning to ride a bike. You have to fall, even though it hurts, before you learn. In this case, I had to hear her say the truth before I could accept it, even though it hurts.

Thanks for all of the help everyone. I'm not healed yet, but I think this whole set of actions ended up helping me a whole lot."
22bxea,0,2014-04-06,It's been a rough week,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/22bxea/its_been_a_rough_week/,"My SO and I have been in an LDR for most of our relationship. We met at our summer job, but we didn't start dating until after the summer. We went to different schools, but a 2 hour drive was all that separated us. The next semester I transferred to her school, and I was so happy to finally close the distance for a little while. A semester before she graduates, she lands the internship of her dreams and has to go all the way to Florida for a semester, which puts 1100 miles between us. I knew it would be hard being that far apart, but I didn't mind because it was temporary and I'd get to be with her again for the summer and fall. Well earlier this week, she got an offer for a full time position. I honestly couldn't be happier for her. She's the first one in her class to get a job and she loves the company she works for. But the hard part is that I won't graduate for another 2 years. That may not be a long time in the grand scheme of things, but not seeing her for 2 months was already so hard. I feel pretty lonely without her, and that news has made it so much worse. I could never break up with her. I don't click with anyone else the way I do with her. I guess I just don't know how to deal with it for now. I'm happy for her success, but I'm sad that I won't get to see her often for a couple years. And I feel so selfish for feeling sad."

(Undergraduate college/uni student here - trying to get my bachelor's as an architecture major this month of May)



**(my story):**

I was an idiot &amp; I never scheduled my classes well, so I took 21 credit hours this semester to graduate on time... which is the maximum amount of credits I could take w/o paying extra tuition fees.

**(Before everything got shitty):**

The 1st 3 months into my semester went ok w/ just few academic mishaps (few missing assignments/late attendance/absence). But I still kept my body healthy, and my hobbies (piano) in tune.

**(How everything is shitty now):**

And then starting couple of weeks ago (right around spring break), I've been crashing &amp; burning... I stopped turning things in on time... i became regularly late to my 1st classes of the day... then it got to a point where I just decide to not leave my apartment for some days. 

It's been a month now since I've worked out or played basketball, and piano has been the only thing that I looked forward to... but now i just recently have stopped going into the piano practice room too. 
Only thing I'm doing more is drinking.

**(Some of the shit that happened to me to make me feel so shitty):**

* Family issues

Learned over my spring break that my dad's leaving my mom this summer (worrying how my non-english-speaking Korean mother of mine will have to live by herself for indefinite years??) [*not exactly divorce apparently, but details on another section if you're interested enough to read about it]

* 21 credit-hour semester sucks ass. 

I have no time to relax. But when I do decide to relax, something inevitably doesn't get done on time.

* The post-college life scares the shit out of me. 

Couple of architecture firms are interested in me to work for them, but I still don't know if I'll get a well-paying job after graduation

* This one awesome girl doesn't like me back

Don't want to get into details here- it's just my own selfish relationship bullshit - I'm hurting b/c I desired someone. I've dealt with this before.

* Got a ""F"" in a class

Just read an e-mail from my prof &amp; learned that I failed a fucking class today, b/c I never turned anything on time which is my own damn fault.

* I really fucked myself over b/c I can barely afford to pay another tuition fee for another semester.

B/c of ^ failing that class, I won't be able to get my degree for another few months... i guess if you put it in that perspective, it's not the worst thing in the world... but fuck. I really don't have anymore money for another semester.

**(My current Rx + my history with depression):**

I've been medicated for depression for a few years now, i'm currently on Bupropion HC XL 150mg (taking 1 tablet whenever i wake up). I think I'm going to ask my psychiatrist about this in 2 days from now, so she may prescribe me heavier dosage (or prescribe me with different meds). 

I have resorted to self-harm in the past. But with counseling and sessions with my psychiatrists, I've managed fairly well to avoid doing that for a couple of years now.


______________________________________________________________________



**(Some details about my situation, ranting, &amp; venting - don't really have to read this):**

1. I don't think meds will solve everything, and I think the biggest thing is to break my awful habits (mostly consisting of being online for at least 5 hours/day &amp; lateness), &amp; to change my course of thought and stop berating myself so much... b/c i feel so damn incompetent on a lot of days now.

2. I really don't like myself right now (I can tell from not being confident next to people anymore),  I don't know what my mom will have to go through when my dad leaves her sometime this summer, and I just got an e-mail today that I will not be able to pass one of the courses to get my degree this May (it's my own damn fault; The course is called WPP393 ""Writing Proficiency Course"" - didn't turn anything on time). 

3. I had a crush on my friend and I recently learned this week that the feelings weren't mutual... I guess this event did hurt a lot at the time, but I've managed to cope with it - although... it's just that just seeing her name flattens my mood instantly.

*My dad wants to try his hand at real estate career. I respect my stereotypical, golf-loving-high-expectation-asian dad (I'd be such a better person if I had his mental fortitude, discipline, and toughness), and I know this would be good for him b/c owning &amp; working at a dry cleaning business for 12 hours a day for 6 days a week has been depressing, hot/muggy, dull, and depressing enough for so many years now.

My relationship with my reticent father is now estranged ... I know he loves me - I think - it's been years since I've uttered those sentimental words to him ... idk it'll be awkward as fuck if I say it - I think we're implying that we share a common love shared among a family. But the thing is that ... dammit... i feel as though I disappoint him so much... it got to a point where I don't talk to him anymore, b/c I just feel bad that I have not accomplished anything major in my life yet.

Apparently, the fact that my dad is leaving my mom this summer is not a divorce, but it doesn't sound like an example of a healthy relationship within a family.

One thing that I really hate is that I can't communicate with my mom &amp; dad effectively with any details and eloquence anymore; b/c my native language, Korean, has degraded into a cave-talk version of Korean... ever since I decided to assimilate myself into the American life and completely learn a new language (English, obviously) more than a decade ago.

Oh other thing... I am so ashamed to say this, but it's taken me 6 years so far just to finish my undergrad... I've failed some classes... tried to switch majors in the past... it became a mess in the end as now I am crawling my way out of an undergraduate program within 6 years.

I eventually want to be a licensed architect in U.S.... which means: 

1 // finish this goddamn bachelor's program that I'm fucking up so much. 
2 // get another degree by getting a master's degree in architecture... but i don't even know if i can get into a graduate school with my awful academic history &amp; grades for my undergrad years. 
3 // log in 5000 hours of internship (that will probably take 4 years of internship). 
4 // Pass the Architecture Registration Exam (equivalent to bar exam for lawyers)

Basically, I still have a long way to go before I can finally achieve one of my primary goals in life.

______________________________________________________________________

**TL;DR - Recently doing really shitty in college. I'm showing some obvious signs of depression. Meds will not solve everything, so I just need help to change my perspective on things before I self-destruct any further**

Thank you... just wanted to vent &amp; reflect on my life through some writing. So I honestly won't mind too much if I don't get any responses, but of course... any form support will be greatly appreciated... but you obviously don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it. &amp; I didn't realize it til i finished writing, but sorry for the excessive cursing - kind of ridiculous how many times i used the word ""shit."""

I know some of you are stuck in abusive families that are controlling and basically ruining your life. But, you have to **realize**, if you truly really want to be happy, you have to make it happen for yourself. You **cannot** sit there and just dream about this or that or keep wishing or being jealous of other people's lives. You **cannot** just accept that this is my life and reality, it is just too bad. 


I know it is not that easy as I make it sound, but let me tell you I was in your position. I was tracked on every device I had, I was blackmailed, and I was mentally/physically/verbally abused. I was told that I should be dead every single day. I was locked up in one room and my sister would escort me to class and from class, then home, making sure I do not interact with anyone. My mother even followed me to all my classes one day, just because I came home about 20 minutes late and she just thought I was up to no good flirting with boys, and etc. I was forced to wear the headscarf. The clothes I would buy that my family would not like, my parents would rip them apart in front of my face and I was constantly called a slut, rat, snake, dog, and many other words I cannot repeat. I was forced to pray and fast. I had no self-esteem and confidence. I could not even give anyone eye contact. I was thrown out of my home multiple times in the middle of the night, I was demeaned, and disrespected in every way. There was a time where one of my family members choked me and I was not able breathe for a while. There is so much more that I just cannot simply write everything here. To this day, even though I am living freely and independently, I have bad dreams about it, moments of anxiety and emotional break downs, but it is only a **phase**. The point is, yeah I was in your shoes, I wanted to kill myself, I gave up in life, but I pushed through and so can **YOU**. I promise.


Yes, it is going to suck the first time and yes I felt like shit most of the time. But, **it is all temporary**, remember that. All the emotions you are feeling right now, you have to look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself, *this is all temporary and I will pass this stage very soon*. Just keep repeating that to yourself. Then you have to find a plan to reach your dreams. For example, if you are in high school, make sure you do good on exams, study for SAT/ACT, apply to colleges, talk to school counselors, take advantage of your resources, you cannot be lazy! If you want to go to technical/vocational schools then go there after college, if it seems like college is not for you. After high school, most college/schools provide housing, so even if it’s on loans, get it for your own life’s sake. There are a lot of scholarships/money that go to waste because people do not even apply and that is free money being thrown away. Find those opportunities and use it! **This is the only 1 life you get, do not waste it.** There is so much others can do for you by helping you, yes use the help, but also **help yourself** as well, respect yourself and respect your life. Keep researching and keep looking for opportunities for yourself, just go looking and searching. That is what I did and found myself many opportunities. **The opportunities don't come to you itself, you have to keep looking and searching, then eventually you will find them--and then take advantage of them.**  


It took me about two years to leave my home, I went through so much crap, but it happened right? So why do some of you want to kill yourself soon? Why do you want to give up on life? Just remind yourself, right now is temporary and I will find a way to get out of this. IF it is important to you, you will find a way, so put everything aside and start developing a plan right now because life is way too short. If you need help with anything, do not hesitate to message me. 


And, yes after I moved out, it sucked, I was alone, I had no family, no friends, and no one I knew. I went through emotional phases, but this is all part of growth. **You cannot simply become into a strong, independent, happy person without going through horrible and rough times.** Also, many people are very scared to be alone, do not be scared, and take that opportunity to reflect, think, read, and learn more about yourself once you are out. I had very hard times, for example, one time, I had to go get groceries in the rain, I had no transportation, and I would sometimes collapse on the ground from walking way too much with a lot of heavy groceries. It sucked, and it was painful. There was NO one there to help me. But you do not get anything in life that easily. I worked hard, very hard, I found jobs, worked 2 jobs on campus and studied too. I applied to scholarships, got help from my counselor to give me free pass for food on campus, and much more. **Take advantage of your resources and opportunities**, I cannot emphasize that enough. So, do not be afraid to be hurt at first, do not be afraid to feel alone, do not be afraid to cry, do not be afraid to collapse if you have to because after all this pain and hard times, trust me you *will* find happiness. **It is a process and let that process happen.** Sooner you realize, the more optimistic you will become. I started to realize this and whenever I had a difficult moment in my life or someone hurt me, I think to myself, this is only temporary and it will only make me better, stronger, wiser. So, I let it go, I experienced it and soon enough it was just a memory. After all this I am now living on my own, independently, working 1 highest student paying job on campus because I got a lot of experience from my ""tough"" times. I am also getting 5 internship offers for the summer, where one of them even provides housing, so I do not have to pay anything for housing. I will be able to chill, make lots of money, and have fun. There is more to come because I will never stop working hard. **If you work hard, I guarantee you, it will pay off, even if it does not seem like it currently.** I used to work like a maniac, and I would feel stupid because I would think to myself, this is going no where, but soon I realized, it went somewhere, and it happened. You have to be **patient**, I would work and study the first time I moved out because I have to support myself, I would miss out on campus activities or fun nights, but I had to work hard right now to enjoy all that soon. I did not get this all easily, I worked my ass off and now I am getting the time to enjoy myself, college life, and my life. So, I promise you, **it will happen to you that is if you let it happen**. You have to **stand up for yourself** first.  


I know it is not that easy, but the point is, just keep fighting, keep pushing through, and find yourself options. You all are way stronger than you guys will ever know. Our bodies, our minds, our inner spirit is amazingly strong, it does anything for survival and adaption, so do not be afraid to take a step in your life that you think you would never be able to. Trust me, you can, I did. I was probably the weakest person, I had a very caring type of personality, I put everyone else first, not myself. I had no idea how the world worked, but I made it happen for me. I packed my bags and I left, my family grabbed me from both of my arms, not letting me go, I was crying like I have never did before, I had mixed feelings, where I knew I loved my family so much, but THIS had to happen for my own good, even their own good. I even had to call the cops. I felt guilty, I felt horrible, I felt disgusting, but remember you only do feel some things that can be false because of the way you were raised and brainwashed. Some things just have to be done, even it seems/sounds so extreme and scary. Also, do not worry, nothing will happen to your parents if you call the cops, some people are way too scared to do that. The cops will only help you, and follow your orders. Also, please **ERASE** the brainwashed culture views that are in your head about reputation, everyone is bad, a girl is not capable of living alone, and etc. After you move out, your parents might realize, open their eyes to why this all had happened, they will realize their mistakes. There are some parents, who end up disowning their children, but that is *their loss*, they are **mistaken**. Trust me, your parents are adults, they can take care of themselves, do not worry so much about them, they will do **ANYTHING TO CONTROL YOU** even if it’s blackmailing through by saying “if you go, I will die, kill myself” etc, etc, trust me they will not do anything. **You do what you have to.** This life is way too short to be wasted. Some say, “Well, they are my parents still,” I know they are, but wait…are they really? I mean they might just be your landlord or something, providing you a home because a real parent gives love, protection, advice, and support to their child. They are there for their child and lets them grow. They see them as an individual with their own mind, desires, beliefs, interests, but some of these parents are broken people themselves and take their frustrations out on their innocent children, and these parents do not deserve to have you as their child. They do anything to control you because they might only care about their own reputation, and life, not **YOU**, **YOU as a person**. You might think, “oh, I do not want to be selfish”…but, hey look, you are not selfish, you are a normal human being with your own mind, beliefs, questions, interests, etc **THEY are selfish**. How come they do not feel bad for their actions and the way they make you feel? Why don't they ever think about you and what you are going through? Why don't they try to understand you? They are the parents, they do not deserve to have you as a child, if they can't even let you live and grow, and have your input in life, and if they can't see you as a human being with your own emotions, interests, and etc. It is wrong. They are wrong, not you. So before, you get so absorbed in this whole parents trap, think thoroughly before you do anything to yourself or think you are the problem because reality might be way different than you think. 


Like, they say *“If you ever want your soul to dance in the clouds, you will at some point have to juggle lightning and taste the thunder”*

So, be patient, but let the process begin, let it happen, and let it pass.

Also, do not forget to **love yourself**"

22czkm,19,2014-04-06,"[RANT] Took ayahuasca, converted to Buddhism",[deleted],Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/22czkm/rant_took_ayahuasca_converted_to_buddhism/,"I figured it would be an unwise idea to either rant about an illegal activity to any of the straight-laced people I know or under any name affiliated with my real identity. However, while it’s unlike me to even go on diatribes, there’s a nagging feeling that explaining yesterday’s events will provide some surrogate for the catharsis I sought out, so bear with me.

Yesterday, at the location where I first took LSD out in the forest, I drank a single dose of ayahuasca alone. I didn’t follow the dieta, but have tripped often enough to be confident about my ability to handle psychedelics without being arrogant and believing I possess total control. This was, in a sense, my drug endgame; I had already tried, over a span of years, most everything that struck my curiosity. My experimentation began early in order to attain a level of understanding about the nature of reality, identical to the reason why I wound up an undergraduate physics and mathematics major; I dove into psychedelics independently and, despite my share of bad trips, find them to be delightful. They offer temporary treatment to the occasionally dysfunctional states of mind affiliated with my schizoid personality: the “anxious Buddha” or self-in-exile personality, a sort of maladaptive, extreme introversion. As bizarre as it sounds, they keep my head on straight until I regress into the old patterns. In addition, despite my agnosticism and disregard for creationism, I consider myself a spiritual person, more so than the fire-and-brimstone folk in my family.

The time was opportune. Late into my senior year, I’ve cut back on my tripping and independently developed a stronger spiritual crisis associated with absolutes in thought: binging/fasting cycles, total avolition, acting out with marijuana use (and a bit of ketamine and amphetamines), and such. Yet I’m still as outwardly functional and unassuming as ever. Of course, I thought the trip would offer a renewed perspective and guide me, but what caught me unawares was the order of magnitude of the spirit molecule. If messing around with booze and Mary Jane is an order of magnitude separated from sobriety, and routine psychedelics are an order of magnitude above that, then ayahuasca is yet another order of magnitude up the scale.

I underwent the usual: nausea, an impression that gravity strengthened, and dehydration. As with all psychedelics, and especially empethogens (ecstasy and 2C-B, both of which I stopped taking after long due to the melancholy of returning to normal), my own body captivated me, which I regard as an unreal monkey-manifestation distant from my existence, depersonalized. I began to feel violently ill, and managed to stagger my way to a bathroom and lie down as my spirit detached itself from my body and mind. The next three hours were an unreal span. At first, I dry heaved for a while and felt all my negative sentiments and unconscious schizoid emotions—anger I never express or consider, a sense of great loss turn over in my viscera, but the purge didn’t pass. I spent most of the time in the fetal position, regressing to a state of infancy from which I only intellectually and physically developed. The true cure for the schizoid condition arrived, at least insofar as its effects last: that old Freudian battle scars are figments of my own emotions. “The conditions to which I had been exposed for my entire childhood—intense abuse at the hands of family who were themselves abused in a continual cycle of suffering, compounded by my sensitive nature-were not my fault. Things are ultimately okay.”

I stared into the wall at the other end of the bathroom, rocked back and forth intermittently, and made mouthing motions for a great length of time as I perceived my spirit witness the majesty of being. The cycle of life and death repeated endlessly, emergence from the womb and decay into the void, ectoplasm frothing about a throbbing ball of my spiritual energy and spreading into fractal representations of open sets and the infinite void beyond. Alternate timelines where I would rant about these visions. The best analogy I can procure is to the Fullmetal Alchemist canon of the door of alchemy, and the truth within the truth; I saw the state before life and after death. It was physically unpleasant but euphoric. The euphoria is a simple one, possibly the simplest one—the innocent joy of observing, of knowing, of understanding, of being one with the universe.

But reality called. I needed to pretend whenever anyone came to access the restroom that I was just finishing up. A child in the distance refused to stop singing “The Star-Spangled Banner,” often repeating stanzas. I remembered an errand to run at my discretion. I managed to walk a couple miles home once I could journey and spent the rest of the day occupied with the straightforward.

I decided without agency about an hour into the trip that a form of Zen Buddhism would suit me best. I don’t believe I can attain enlightenment; my attachment to self-sufficiency is far too great. I’m ultimately never going to change such an engrained pattern of thought and action, and I’m not capable of the compassion required for Tibetan Buddhism. Nevertheless, I can tame the dragon of negativity yet-unpurged and acquire purpose by taking the leap of faith and practicing Buddhism instead of pontificating on the philosophy as usual.

I’m not prepared for another psychedelic experience just yet. After my internship this summer, I’ll need to sublimate my simmering negativity. During the trip, I came up with the idea of maybe caring for a bonsai or potted plant to channel my energy and keep myself in check. Once that lasts for a while, I would love to ingest ayahuasca after a dieta somewhere I can undergo total isolation. Then, I hope to purge and be reborn. Until that moment, I’ll focus on mindfulness and the middle path.

Thank you very much for reading this. I’m happy to answer any questions below.

TL;DR: did ayahuasca in the forest, underwent a powerful spiritual experience, resolved to incorporate mindfulness as much as I can in daily life. Learned again to accept things as they are."

It has been since Sunday the 31st of March since I last ""fapped."" My goal is to finish April without doing it anymore, and I hope to break the habit. The key piece in this for me has been the strength of my resolve not to do it. When I feel my resolve is weak, it kind of scares me. Today, I really, really wanted to just when I woke up from my afternoon nap but I just laid like a stone on my bed and wouldn't budge out of fear of going back to where I was. 

From what I understand, the second and third weeks are a different stage in the process, in terms of the brain's adjustments. Should I anticipate a lot of depression or anxiety? I just want to be ready. For those of you who are past the 14 day mark, what can you tell me about this next week? Should I consider keeping my laptop out of my bedroom or doing my homework in the library?

This is really important to me because I've come at a point in my life where I have to choose if I'm in or out of the future I can have: next year will be my senior year of college and I will be taking out loans for it, and I'm looking into an internship as well. There's a lot riding on the next few months.

So, advice going into this next period?"

22dv4e,26,2014-04-06,Does anyone else have a bad relationship with their father?,AmericanGardensBldg,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/22dv4e/does_anyone_else_have_a_bad_relationship_with/,"I'm a junior in college right now. My dad has always wanted me to go to Medical School even though I was horrible in and didn't like chemistry and biology (nearly failed my bio class in high school). Whenever I told him that I wasn't going to be happy as a doctor he always shrugged it off and told me that you don't get a job to be happy.

By some luck I ended up getting into Med School this year and planned to graduate a year early. However, I did an internship with a dermatologist this winter break and know for certain that I don't want to go to medicine. In fact, I really like computer science and am minoring in that right now. 

At the end of winter break I told my parents that I'm not going into medicine and plan on becoming a programmer. I renegaded on my Med School offer and got a summer internship in a mid-sized tech company.

My father has never agreed on anything I did be it my friends, the college i went to (top-20 school), or my passions. He thinks anything in engineering is a bad career option and anything in medicine is the holy grail because all of his engineering friends are average joes and all of his doctor friends are rich and successful. I try to tell him that it's not the career you choose that makes you successful, but the person you are. 

We don't talk anymore. When I go home once a month (live 30 mins away) it's complete silence. He also makes passive agressive remarks to my younger brothers and sisters about how I choose not to go to Med School. Is this a normal father-son relationship?

I have been fapping since the past 4-5 years. I realized that it was becoming a problem in the past two years. Since then I have tired to quit. My longest streak was of 22 days. That too was a long time ago. Anyway I just relapsed and broke my 16 days streak. Now the good thing about that is attained 16 days after a long-long time. I wasnt able to make it a week before. The bad thing is that the prime reason I relapse is because I am lonely and if get a break from internship the loneliness overwhelms me and I give in. The ugly side of this is no matter how long my streak is I would always be vulnerable. 

Now why am I lonely ?
Well, ironically the reason behind that is fapping as well. Primarily because it induces acne in me.which than kills my confidence and therefore makes me anti-social.

What can be done now ?
Well I haven't slept tonight ever since I relapsed. It's 6 38 am and I dont even feel sleepy. I am waiting for the acne to arrive and preparing myself for it. I have again made a schedule and will try to stick to it.

Do any of you guys get acne after fapping ? If yes, how do you guys tackle it? Any innovate means to counter loneliness ? 

Besides that I wish all of you guys luck, I was thinking of posting here daily from now on , just to gain a little more accountability. 
I hope I make it the 90 days this time :) "

I'm a high school senior who is interested in becoming an actuary. Usually, I spend my summer with a math related internship, but I didn't feel any sense of accomplishment after my second one. I wanted to try something fulfilling, like passing Exam 1/p. 

My background: I've taken AP Calculus AB and BC in my sophomore and junior year, and have gotten 5s on each. I know that getting a 5 isn't noteworthy, but I do have some level of comprehension when it comes to calculus. The few areas I would need to brush up on are probably just theorems and series. This year, I'm taking AP Statistics and feel on track for another 5. I'm also taking AP Economics (Macro+micro), but I don't think that would help me with Exam P. 

After consulting with one of the math teachers in my school, I was recommended to take Exam P. Based on the classes I have taken or am taking currently, would it be a better idea to study for Exam P or Exam FM? If I dedicate myself to consistently studying for an actuarial exam, is there a decent chance of passing? 

Thanks in advance!"
22emvn,2,2014-04-07,Me [28 M] doing a LDR [25 F] who I have only been with for 5 days in person,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22emvn/me_28_m_doing_a_ldr_25_f_who_i_have_only_been/,"Title is probably confusing or misleading, so let me just explain the story and sorry if its TL;DR

I'm a 28 year old male and I'm fairly experienced in relationships, I've had a couple LTRs (2 year and a 7 year), a lot of short term flings, and a whole lot of promiscuous fooling around. Right now I am in law school so I don't really have a career rolling yet, and my financial situation is crap (living off student loans).

Recently I met a girl off of okcupid who lived a few states away (1200 mile split) - I found her by responding to a reddit posting she made, and I liked what I saw on her profile so we just did some chit chat, I don't think either of us expected anything since we were so far away but we both thought we would have been a great match if we were closer. She is in the same year of law school as me so we had a lot in common.

Well it turned out that she ended up coming to my city on a trip out with some of her friends who were from my city. We decided to meet up and spend a day together, and we ended up getting along really well. Nothing really happened between us since we both knew she would simply be going home, but it was still fun. After she went home we sort of started confessing that we each really had a good time with each other and we wished we could have extended the visit. We sort of got the idea that she might be able to come out for another visit to my city during spring break, and while both of us kind of thought there might be some potential there, we just wanted to wait and see what happened.

Her visit on spring break was barely only one day, but fuck if it wasn't one of the most enjoyable days I've ever had with a girl. Prior to her visit, we had been chatting back and forth the whole time onlibe, mostly talking about our online dating woes, and we just really seemed to naturally click. We ended up hooking up that one night she was there and it was awesome.

I was sad to see her go, and she confessed that the rest of her spring break she couldn't stop thinking about me and she absolutely had to come back to my city to see if there was anything real between us - she said she needed some kind of ""closure"" and she had never felt that way about someone before.

So she ended up booking a real expensive flight only two weekends later for a few days and just like the one day, it was literally the most enjoyable weekend I've ever had with any girl (and I've been with quite a few girls). I can't quite pin why everything felt so right, it just seemed like almost every single thing about this person was what I wanted out of a relationship. And seeing her go at the end was one of the hardest things I've done. And I feel like a total fucking vagina for feeling that way because of how short of a time period that is. There was a lot of talk during the weekend about the possibility of being in an exclusive LDR and how we would do it - and it basically would boil down to another year and few months for us to finish school, and then one of us uprooting and moving whatever career aspirations we had to the others' location.

At the moment, she is much more financially stable than I am (I am doing unpaid criminal law internships while she is doing lucrative patent law which allows her to afford these plane tickets).

This entire idea scares the shit out of me though and I am not quite sure why. I have a good deal of experience with women and have never felt this way before and I am not sure if this means it is the real deal or if it is just a severe case of infatuation. I don't trust my instinct to evaluate relationship potential after only 5 days together. One of my worst fears is also going through the hardship of a LDR and then basically dictating my career choices for a girl - only to have the relationship flounder in the end and be left in a city where I have no networking contacts and no friends or family. I also absolutely hate the idea of relying on technology for communication - I am skeptical of the idea of a relationship developing without that personal contact.

On the flip side, I would hate to throw away something that I have never felt before. I feel like a stupid high school girl saying stuff like that - if I were looking at my situation through the eyes of the third person I would think I am crazy and I would say that real love takes a long time to develop. I would also say that LDRs are generally a bad idea, but perhaps the fact that we are both emotionally mature and we both have significant relationship experience means that we might be actually on to something when we evaluate how we feel about each other.

Our plan for seeing each other in the interim is really up to her ability to fly one of us to the other periodically throughout. Possibility of me landing an internship somewhere close to her for this summer.

So am I just insane for even considering? How does this look from an outsiders perspective?

tl;dr

-Met girl through weird circumstances online

-Girl lives 1200 miles away

-Girl has flown to meet me twice - total of 5 days

-Both of us feel strongly about each other

-Considering pursuing LDR with one of us eventually moving to the other after both of us graduate law school"

I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, I'm sorry if it's not.

Me (24M) and my fiancée (24F) are thinking about living abroad as soon as we get married, so we don't have to spend with housing. Ireland seems like a good idea since we need to improve our english, we like the culture and we have friends there. Also, international experience is highly valued in our home country - I'm brazilian-portuguese but I lived all my life in Brazil - so if we decide to come back, it will add up a lot for us professionally.

Our main concerns are regarding education and employment. I'm getting my bachelor's in Economic Sciences in the middle of year. I have 1 1/2 years of work experience and almost 2 years of internships. I wonder if getting a job would be too hard. Another option would be to focus on my education - taking short courses or maybe starting a Master's. What do you think? How those things work regarding research sponsoring? Money will be tight (we are taking ~10.000 euros as an emergency fund and money to get us settled there) so we can't let things be.

My fiancée (who will be my wife by then) is still studying for her bachelor's (Computer Science) and would like to finish it in there. Since she's not an EU citizen (Portugal only grants citizenship to spouses after 3 years of marriage), will she have a harder time studying there? She will have a work and temporary residence visa, but I don't know how it works regarding her studies. She has some experience working in international companies like HSBC and AT&amp;T and her english is way better than mine. I also understand that IT workers are employed easier than other areas in Europe- am I right?

We are also amateur/semi-pro musicians (trad jazz, me: tenor guitar, banjo and ukulele she: drums and washboard) and busking and playing in pubs are an option, but we can't rely exclusively on that since our main qualifications are others.

It's a huge decision in our life, but we feel if we don't do it today, we won't do it later. Your opinions and experiencies would be very valuable for us in this moment!

Yes, it was lonely. When you came in as a new intern that day in the cubicle next to me, sure I was happy at the notion of being able to actually interact with someone near me.

You were nice to me and weren't afraid to be kind to me. That was something very rare for me as a woman in engineering in the defense industry considering I was outnumbered, on average, about 40 to 1 by men. We soon became friends and I was happy to have someone I could eat lunch with or carpool to training with.

I just nodded when you told me that you were joining our boss's church. I was a closet atheist at the time but could appreciate that you were finding something that would make you happy. He became your religious mentor as well as professional mentor. It's not a relationship I would've taken on myself with a boss, but whatever makes you happy.

I gave you the benefit of the doubt when projects you were working on would end up going south. That happens a lot in our industry.

I celebrated with you when our boss gave you a full time offer and you became a salaried employee.

But I remember the walks that we would take to get some fresh air and sunshine during breaks sometimes and what you would say.

I remember the way that you pigeonholed your own mother into a role of weakness and dependence. Maybe she was just that type of woman, I thought.

I remember when you would show me every time you found a cockroach in your cube, despite the fact that you knew I was deathly afraid of them. I remember how stunned you would be when I would get angry at you for it.

I remember the way that you said that slaves in the US were ""treated like family"" and that black people made it seem worse than it was. That one stunned me, but in a way, I was used to that sort of backwards opinion in the south. I just didn't expect it from someone with your level of education. We are engineers after all. We're supposed to be educated.

I remember when you told me you used to shoot people's pet cats for fun if they annoyed you. I found this disturbing and avoided the topic. You knew that I rescued animals as a hobby, so I was puzzled as to why you would bring this up with me.

I remember when I told you about me helping to start a new animal rescue where we try to lower the killing in a shelter that kills anywhere from 50 to 100 animals every day by finding them new homes, and your response was, ""Aren't we just shooting ourselves in the foot if we don't kill them all?""

I remember when you had formal disciplinary action for disrespecting a female coworker and I pretended to support you but deep down I knew that she was probably telling the truth. I had managed to earn your respect but I saw how you treated other women.

I remember when we were at lunch one day and you told me you didn't think gay people should be allowed to get married. I remained calm that day and we agreed to disagree.

I remember when you brought Chick-Fil-A in on the day that the senator asked you to, to support ""traditional marriage"" and then bragging about it. I remember getting so angry with you that another coworker had to interject to tell you to drop the subject. Twice.

I remember when you grew closer to our boss through church and I realized that the only reason you still had that job was because you guys had a personal relationship. Everything you worked on failed, was late, or abandoned.

**This is the memory of you that stands out the most to me though:**

Since we worked in an airport managed by defense, we often had fallen soldiers come home through our airport from war. Their funeral processions started in our parking lot. The company would ask us to optionally take time off to go and pay our respects to them.

Our company had thousands of people yet no more than 100 were out there every time. I was **always** there. These men died for me. I hated those wars, but they deserved better than to be ignored by the industry profiting from their deaths.

After going several times alone, I asked you to join me. We stood out there for 30 minutes and were told they were running late. You did nothing but complain. You said you were going to have to stay late for it, and you wanted to go back inside.

I was the most liberal person in our area but I was always there. You went once and did nothing but complain.

You say you're a conservative that supports the wars but you're a damn hypocrite. You support killing but you don't care when our own men are killed. You can't even be bothered to stand on the side of the road to offer respect to the soldiers' families, soldiers from our own area that went off to fight in your wars and died.

You're a bigot and a hypocrite and when I left that job to escape that industry, I had no intention of being your friend anymore. I was your friend out of necessity and that necessity is now gone. You're exactly the type of person that embodies everything wrong with this country. Every single employee at that company that couldn't be bothered to stand there as the funeral went by was a hypocrite.

Thank you for the invitation to your wedding but I will not be attending."

*Narrative Point-of-View: The perspective from which a story is told.*

The latest chapters provide a great deal of context for ambiguities surrounding the Sage and his sons. The story of the Sage had always been told from the third person perspective by characters with limited levels of insight. With these chapters I think we can scratch off most of the supposed ""retcons"" in the series:

- [Sharigan comes from the Byakugan](http://i.imgur.com/4Lg2Msp.png)

 Kinda true; Kaguya has both, so in a sense one can be said to come from the other. Also, narrative perspective; how the hell would Kakashi know better?

- [Uzumaki are close relatives of the Senju](http://i.imgur.com/DEO3HUn.png)
 
 True-ish; I presume the Sage's brother is the progenitor of the Uzumaki &amp; Hyuuga.

- [Madara and Izuna are first to unlock the Mangekyo Sharigan.](http://i.imgur.com/msbQanK.png) 

 Debunked; the Sage says for generations, Indra's descendants have been adding to the tablet; the things Madara reads on the tablet are already insribed, presumably by someone who attains the Mangekyo before him.

- Power creep from part 1 to part 2
 
 Chilllllllll bro; part 1 focuses on ninja interns; part 2's focuses on high-flying/zombie/pedo-snake/masochistic/Kage fights.
(Just turns out the giant Madara-Hashirama statues are more literal than we initially thought).

**2.The Case for Sasuke's Rinnegan**

|The Madara Method
----
As Hagoromo explains, the Madara method involves combining Indra's and Ashura's chakra in the same vessel to bring out the Sages chakra and awaken the Rinnegan. 

Like Madara before him, Sasuke not only attains the EMS, but he's also receives a plethora of DNA/chakra from others, most notably Naruto, Ashura's current vessel. His recent interaction with Kabuto also resembles Madara's method, so it appears Sasuke is well on his way to achieving this power of the Sage:

 - [Hashirama's chakra](http://i.imgur.com/5mqJAYg.png)
 - [Hashirama's cells](http://i.imgur.com/uBYHsG9.png)
 - [Karin's chakra](http://i.imgur.com/bYkyBew.png)
 - [Karin does something to him](http://i.imgur.com/LtMU80w.jpg)
 - [Jugo's DNA](http://i.imgur.com/xD8MjNs.jpg) (which helps Kabuto gather natural energy)
 - [9tails yang chakra/Naruto's chakra](http://i.imgur.com/2zeNUjj.png)

↑ Those are all the ingredients, but there is no confirmation on the catalyst. (Near-death experience?)

**3.The Case for Naruto's Rinnegan**

|The Sage
----
Black Zetsu claims only the Sage and Madara have been able to [awaken the Rinnegan;](http://i.imgur.com/Vu5fRMh.png) the keyword being “awaken.”  Considering Naruto's close relation to the Sage's blood line, he should also have this potential. 

When Naruto houses 7/9th's of the tailed beast chakra, he’s surrounded by 9 orbs reminiscent of what we see from [Juudara/Juubito/So6P.](http://i.imgur.com/Gsk1kZF.png) Furthermore, as the Juubi senses the tailed beasts in Naruto, the scene is represented by a [Rinnegan aura](http://i.imgur.com/wmGeouA.png) that surrounds Naruto, which the [Juubi reacts to;](http://i.imgur.com/D5owr6d.png)  the strong imagery and Madara's comment suggests that on some level the Juubi is aware of the chakra Naruto possesses, and recognizes it as part of the Sage's power. 

Notice the Sage’s spirit is summoned only after Naruto gets chakra from the Yin-half 9tails, 8tails, and 1tail. The Sage opines this meeting occurs because Naruto is the reincarnation of Ashura, but if that’s the case, then Hashirama should also be able to meet the Sage, but he doesn’t [(as far as we know).](http://i.imgur.com/lOHTLzR.png) The Sage’s statement can also be interpreted as “Naruto can summon the Sage only because he’s Ashura’s reincarnation **and** he’s brought out the Sage’s chakra by combining his own with all the tailed beasts.” (For the sake of this argument, I subscribe to the latter explanation ).

[↑ Hagoromo could be hinting at an off-panel conversation he has with Madara.](http://i.imgur.com/ytEJHnu.png)


|Chakra and the Eyes
----

Like Hagoromo says, it's the combination of Indra/Ashura's chakra that awakens his own in Madara; Tobirama states that a special chakra is released in Uchiha's brains that awakens the Sharigan, but this isn't the only case where special chakra influences the user's eyes.

- [When Naruto uses Sage Mode, his eyes change.](http://i.imgur.com/o8nuuJr.png)

- [When Naruto is under the influence of the 9tails chakra.](http://i.imgur.com/09oQuEl.png) 

- [↑ Slightly using 9tails chakra](http://i.imgur.com/yAFhFc9.gif)

- [Under the influence of both.](http://i.imgur.com/JNVnSP1.png) 

- [When he subjugates the 9tails only his eye color changes.](http://i.imgur.com/bBBJ3qO.jpg) 

It just so happens that everytime Naruto's eyes undergo any change, he's using a type physical/yang energy (SM, KCM) as opposed to a mental/yin energy. It should come as no surprise if a change occurs after Naruto has the 9tails yin/spiritual energy along with chakra from the other tailed beasts.


|Physical + Spiritual Energies
----
For Naruto to awaken the Rinnegan, I believe he'll need a combination of strong physical and spiritual energies; he already has the former, and with the addition of chakra from the 9yin/8/1 tailed beast, he'll soon have the latter. The Madara method requires the user combine Indra's chakra with Ashura's to achieve the Sage's power, but if the root of Hagoromo's spiritual energy is the Juubi, then Naruto can circumvent Indra's chakra and go straight to the original source.

|Correlation Isn't Causation.
----
I'll admit this theory works on the supposition that the Sage isn't born with the Rinnegan, but awakens it after sealing the Juubi. Many believe the Sharigan is a requisite to awaken the Rinnegan, which is a perfectly logical step to infer based on the what we've seen. But the only person shown unlocking the Rinnegan since the Sage is an Uchiha; so everything we know about this phenomenon is biased toward Madara's method. What if it's not the Sharigan itself that's necessary (for Naruto/non-Uchiha), but the strong spiritual energies associated with awakening the EMS? Could the spiritual energy of the tailed beast equate to the Sharigan? Couldn't Obito seal the [Kamui'd Gedo arm](http://i.imgur.com/XM68OaN.jpg) in Naruto to achieve the [Sage’s chakra?]( http://i.imgur.com/3KJvwpw.png)  

----
**Notes &amp; Takeaways**

- I take issue with those that suggest Kishi doesn't know what he's doing and is just bullshitting as he goes along. I joke sometimes about asspulls, but that's all those are, jokes. It's far more likely that this story was complete (at least in broad strokes) before the first chapter was ever released.

 ↑ [From ch.462, a little Indra/Ashura foreshadowing](http://i.imgur.com/6o5eebD.png)

 ↑ I could find a dozen more, but I'm sure you get the point.

- I wanna see something about the poor bastard who knocks up the Sage's mother.

- I'll take a wild guess and say Naruto and Sasuke don't have the same answer for the Sage; I'll take it further to say they'll both think they're right and it will lead to a [new conflict.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/1rjqr6/cause_of_conflict_narutos_plan_vs_sasukes_plan/) You know what they say, 2 Rinnegans don't make a right.

- When the tailed beast die, their chakra's revived years later; Hagoromo and his sons undergo a similar process, in which their chakra transmigrates.

**Religious Undertones**

I'm sure most of you have picked up on some religious undertones/themes throughout the series. For instance the parallels between the 3 natural antagonist as they originally appear (Uchiha, Pain, Juubi), juxtaposed with the 3 major Japanese religions as they appear in Japanese culture (Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity). 

It's no coincidence that Uchiha powers are named after gods of the Shintoist [creation myth;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mythology#Sun.2C_moon_and_sea) and their clan is reminiscent of Shinto relative to its [post-war decline.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#Post-war) I'm guessing the irony is intentional when Kishi uses the creation gods as the embodiment's of death and destruction. 

Even the Paths of Pain are named after Buddhism's [6 realms of rebirth.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Rebirth) You can also draw parallels to Christianity through the Juubi's origin and the 3 iterations of the 1 person that will save the world; the term ""savior"" and the messianic allegory are introduced in Shippuden around the Pain arc. 

[Here's a translator note that lightly touches on the Buddhist aspects.](http://i.imgur.com/eLC8urU.png)

22frbs,1,2014-04-07,The Issues with PS2 as I see them.,TheEviltane,Planetside,https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/22frbs/the_issues_with_ps2_as_i_see_them/,"edit: Correcting  my statement of armor.
 
TL;DR: The game is a shallow as a really pretty toddler pool.

Before I go into my criticism let me mention I have spend about 60 dollars on this game so I feel justified in being able to do this. I do enjoy playing the game for maybe 4-5 hours a week. 


The question I asked myself: 

Why is PS2 not doing as good as it could be doing?

The reasons are I feel are rooted very deeply in the game. 
Most of the comparisons I will draw will be to Planetside 1 pre mech warriors expansion. I think it was a far better in all but one aspect
which is that Planetside 2 is really pretty.

On every other issue you can really tell that the developers of PS 1 spend  a lot more time and effort then the Devs of PS2.
So here is my list of issues please criticize them as you see fit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



-1. Lore. There are some rough wiki articles and there are supposed to be some posts to the main site. The story is very shallow and looks to me like an intern with a good English grade got told to cobble something together,and he didn't even get a full week to do it because he had to keep the cofee maker going too.
Compare this to  PS1 where lore was a big part, I remember going to the main site for the game and it had a big ""lore"" button witch led you to an official page where you could read for hours and hours and hours.


Why Lore? Lore is important to an MMO. Most don't realize it but there is a core group of players out there who study the Lore and spread it ingame. They join the outfits or guilds or corps and bring massive enthusiasm with them. They talk to their friends in game and out of it. They are walking and talking advertising machines. 
Of course they get yelled at by others that lore doesn't matter and go play Dungeons and Dragons. Or that this is an FPS not a Role Playing game.  

When lore doesn't exist then these people have no incentive to invest they time and money in this game. 

Also I need to point out here that one of the main complaints later in the development of PS1 was that the Lore was not moving on.  This tells you that the lore was very IMPORTANT. To just ignore the lore is very dangerous and makes your game weak. Its like the Immune system is missing that helps the game through tough times.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-2. The continents are square all square and look the same.  Of course the problem with the map goes a lot deeper then this but its the biggest symptom of the shallowness in design.

It makes me angry because it really shows that who ever was in charge didn't give a shit and just wanted to put as much stuff as possible into an 8km x 8km grid.  Then they added some fringy bits and were done. 

Lets compare the PS1 map to PS2.   PS1 17 (13 at launch) total  land masses 3 of which are home continents.  VS PS2   with 3 (continents).

For those who didn't play PS1:  In PS1 each faction had its home continent that was connected through  3 warp gates to 3 other continents.  The home continent was important as this is where you logged in and gathered your forces.
All the continents were interconnected in specific order so each faction
would have to start from home and then crawl with its way across the continents (there is one exception to this mechanic which i will get into later).  Factions would have battle lines where they clashed and it was possible to push other factions completely off of every continent but their home.

This gave PS1 a feel where yes you could loose lots of progress but you could achive something that was visible for more then a couple of hours.  Outfits would march and war on battlefronts and their achievements would sometimes be visible for days on the map.  Back then there used to be complains that somewhat tied in with the lore as there is very little tangible progress for the effort expended by individuals and groups. There is even less and arguably no measurable progress the way the game is restricting this now.

This whole side of the game is being ignored massively and a big part of why it can not hold on to customers. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------



-3. Terrible tactical design of bases. Again no depth to it. Bases are designed to be pretty and very few of them make sense.

In PS1 there used to be times where single outfits defended and held bases for hours. One of the more famous battles on my server had a single outfit holding a base for 8 hours of heavy assault. Long defenses were common and outfits prided themselves in their ability to hold territory. This was made even harder then the current system because of how resources used to work back then  where you had to truck in or airlift in trucks that supplied the bases with the energy needed to run them and spawn equipment. Every vehicle and weapon spawn took away from this energy supply.  So if you couldn't resupply your base you would loose it and so sieges became possible.  

The bases were designed so that it was possible for a small number of highly skilled players to hold of a large Zerg. Sheer numbers did not guaranty success.

In PS2 I don't remember one battle that I have participated in where bases lasted longer then one hour. Neither have i read of long battles nor seen any on the map.  I am sure some of you will be able to name a battle or two that lasted 2 hours, maybe even one that went longer.
  


-------------------------------------------------------------------



-4. Weak design in vehicles. OK you don't need me to count them all. IN the end ps2 has less vehicles then ps1.  Not only are there less of them there is less that you can do with them.  I remember there was a recent post on reddit here that complained that the Sunderer took the role of 3 vehicles in the original game. 

These things matter. They give players choice. They give you tactical depth and new ways to play the map. 
Here is just one more examples of corners being cut and the game suffers for it. 



I know that I can't expect this game to be as complicated as World of Tanks in hit registration. WoT calculates where you hit the enemy , how thick that individual armor plate hit is, what angle you hit the plate at. If you do penetrate it calculates how the round travels through the tank that was hit and what is damaged and how much its damaged.

I realize all of that is to much work with the amount of things going on in PS2 but jeez at least an attempt  at different hit zones on all the vehicles.


*******************************************************************
Grrr ok there are more symptoms to this but I think I wrote enough to make my point and illustrate why this game is having the issues it has.    I do love the PS franchise still and will continue to play a few hours here and there.

Honestly I think PS2 is a dying horse that will slowly go away.

All I can hope for is that the franchise is not destroyed and it gets picked up again by someone with the Money , patience and skill to make PS3 what this game had the potential to be and go beyond that.

22fsne,1,2014-04-07,I [22M] have been jealous of one of my best friends [20M] for years... [CAW],[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22fsne/i_22m_have_been_jealous_of_one_of_my_best_friends/,"I guess it's normal to be jealous of someone every now and then, but I have been very jealous of my friend, who is two years younger, for years. It's not just a passing thing either, I consciously think about it at least once every few days.

Basically, we met in middle school, both did acting, and became best friends within a few years. What really gets me in what I'm about to say is that I can remember back to a time where we truly were ""equal"" in my mind-- that is, we were so alike that I didn't have anything to be jealous of. But this is how things changed over high school and college:

*  I went to a complete joke of a school for theater, which left me with no discipline or drive to ever pursue it. I became quite average and eventually dropped it altogether. He went to the best school in the area, and that school prepared him so well that he is now working professionally in theater and is in one of the best schools in the country for acting. I know it was my choice to drop my pursuit, but still, I can't help but feel jealous.

* We were both average looking as kids. I grew up and am still pretty average in looks. He did an ""ugly duckling"" 180 and is now a really good looking guy who gets lots of girls all the time. I spend a lot of my time and energy focusing on my gym and diet plan, following them meticulously, with only modest results. He naturally grew up to be ripped while only going to the gym every once in a while.

* I constantly think and analyze everything relating to friends and relationships. Everyone is naturally his friend when he puts forward no effort (including with me). People that used to be friends with both of us equally now only stay in contact with him, even though our relationships with said people were the *same*.

* I used to have two hobbies I was better at than he was: music and writing. I helped get him into those fields and he has since gotten waaay better at them than me, without even trying.

* I had an absolutely miserable college experience, while he is having the best time of his life at his school. (I'm not pessimistic, I truly did just have bad luck with my choice of school. It was a school that was completely not for me but I couldn't afford anywhere else.)

* It took me so long to find a post-grad minimum wage job; finally getting hired was a cause for celebration. I didn't even want to tell him about it knowing that he has been working professionally throughout college for more money. My smallest of career victories pale in comparison to what he achieves all the time. He is also very modest about it and I have to often find out through others just how well he is doing.

* My biggest claim to fame career-wise would be getting an unpaid internship that actually costs me money to travel to. He shared with me how a particular theater wants him back so much that he can demand higher pay and other perks from them and get it.

* I've tried to stay friends with him, asking about his life, recalling past inside jokes, inviting him over when he's back in town, etc, but he is just so busy and ""in demand"" that he is never available, and going through all this effort makes me feel pathetic and desperate. When he does visit, his life is just so full of stories and opportunities that sharing the highlights of my very uneventful days makes me depressed. 

* I have to live with my parents for who knows how much longer while he will most definitely be a working actor traveling the country after graduation. He has already started on it while still in school and undoubtedly will continue.

Basically, we started off on similar paths, but my friend has just seemingly gotten better than me at everything imaginable. For those who think it might be just a ""facade"" hiding an actually not-so-great life, I'm afraid that's not true in this case. He has told me about his ""struggles"" in the past and they are quite few and far between.

And yes, I've heard it all before: **be yourself,** **don't compare your life to others,** **the grass is always greener,** but nothing helps. I can't help but feel jealous of my friend, all the time. I truly don't know what to do.


**TLDR: I have been jealous of my friend for years. He is doing better than I am at seemingly everything. I don't know how to get over it.**

&lt;b&gt;Backstory:&lt;/b&gt;

I'm an Intern at a not for profit. There is a Network Admin and a Sysadmin (just mentioning that for scale). I am here learning from both and it has been an amazing learning experience. I have two more co-ops left and I want them to be here because I get my hands on some pretty awesome systems and a wide variety at that. Perfect for resume/experience building.

&lt;b&gt;The Problem:&lt;/b&gt;

We need to retire a server and migrate it. the server hosts two websites that former interns created. There is no documentation and what seems like 100s of files,some innate that need to be prunned.

I have 2 weeks left, my job is to go through and prune everything, create an administrative map of the website and some documentation.

I have taken a class on IIS and I have tweaked some perl scripts, this website and a couple others in apache... but this.... this is daunting... and I'm going to fucking do it!

&lt;b&gt;Inquiry&lt;/b&gt;

wat do....

aside from going through every file manually (which is what I'll end up doing anyway) is there a script, tool or built in method that can map out every class, method and/or object on a website that is using php through and through? 

Any advice on how to proceed will be welcomed!



EDIT: I should also point out that the sysadmin and the network admin have never touched these websites, its a job that is left to the interns..."

So we talked it out on saturday, both said that we love each other and no hard feelings were left.

I pick up her sisters and her cousin. We drive to the airport. I got roses. Champagne, roses, and two shrimpcocktails at home.

We pick her up. Kisses, hugs, etc.

We drive home... She tells me she got a job offer there. She got no feelings left for me - and she is 100% sure that feelings wont grow back even though we had 3 months apart. She has flirted with some guy there (says she haven't done anything with him).

I did not really see this fucking bomb coming. I'm broken, completely fucking broken.

I threw her out in the middle of the night. Couldn't fucking stand her. Her sister picked her up. I told her ""you ain't staying another hour here""

She is coming by tomorrow so that we can start pack all the stuff up. Im fucking devastated.

Im gonna be so lonely. :(

How do I go on with my life? I need to find my soulmate, which I thought was her. How do people even find anyone new? I guess most people will say: throw friends. Sad thing is I have only a few close friends. Especially now since most are disappearing with / in combination with her. 

Edit: I just want to say that I'm not looking for a new soulmate right away. I don't think I'm looking for anyone. It's just that my life got turned upside down so my first thoughts are ""what am I gonna do? How am I ever gonna find a woman again? Even for a few weeks??"" I don't hang around places were women usually are - and I thought I was way over the dating.

How do I find myself? How do people 'do' being single? Dear god this is so fucking confusing.

**tl;dr**: She dumped me, said she had no feelings left. Had flirted with other guys. Got a job offer at her internship. I'm lonely, crying."

How to become an Oil and gas Accountant and work in Southeast Asian countries such as Bangkok Thailand, KL Malaysia, Singapore, Jakarta Indonesia and many more.

Westhill Consulting Career and Employment gives you the following tips to become a successful accountant in Southeast Asia.

**http://www.westhillconsulting-career.com/blog/2014/04/08/become-oil-gas-accountant/**

**Oil and Gas Accountant Career and Education Requirements**
Accountants review financial records, analyze spending habits and suggests ways to increase revenue. Information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that there are several different types of accountants, including management accountants and certified public accountants (CPAs). Businesses hire management accountants to deal with internal financial decisions and budgeting concerns. Organizations hire CPAs to prepare taxes or other financial documents that must be reported to government agencies.

Oil and gas industries have to submit a lot of paperwork to government authorities, so they may hire management accountants who are also licensed CPAs. Basic career requirements for becoming a CPA include completing a four-year degree program, gaining accounting experience and passing the CPA exam. The following table displays a more detailed list of requirements for becoming an oil and gas CPA:
 
**Step 1: Earn a Dual Degree**
Although the BLS shows that accountants only need a bachelor's degree to find employment, the majority of states have changed their educational requirements for certified public accountants (CPAs). The BLS records from 2012 indicated that most states require CPA applicants to meet the minimum educational requirements of 150 units of postsecondary coursework, whereas a traditional bachelor's degree is only 120 units. Thirty additional post-baccalaureate units are equivalent to a master's degree.


Warning! Dual degree programs allow students to complete bachelor's and master's degree programs in five years instead of six. Before starting graduate level classes, some schools may require students to complete prerequisite courses or pass exams. Course topics in these dual degree programs may include micro and macroeconomics, cost accounting, financial management, auditing, operations management, accounting information systems, marketing, taxation rules and business law.

Success Tip:
Take oil and gas accounting courses. Not every degree program offers courses directly related to the oil and gas industries. Some universities offer elective courses in these fields, and a few colleges even offer related certificate programs. Most oil and gas courses and certificate programs discuss the energy market, global issues, financial management strategies, petroleum accounting and domestic natural gas accounting.

**Step 2: Build Industry Experience**
The BLS recommends that college students complete as many accounting internships as possible to gain the experience needed for CPA licensing requirements. Furthermore, job postings listed in August 2012 onCareerBuilder.com for oil and gas accountants showed that employers preferred applicants with at least 3-5 years of experience in the industry.

Not all colleges require students to complete internships, but many colleges help students find accounting internship opportunities. Universities that have coursework or certificate programs related to oil and gas accounting may have direct contact with industry leaders.


**Success Tip:**
Attend industry lectures. Representatives from some of the largest oil and gas companies are often asked to be guest lecturers in business and accounting classes. During these lectures, students have the opportunity to ask questions about individual companies and industry accounting practices. Many representatives also offer internship opportunities that may lead to full employment.

**Step 3: Become a CPA**
Individuals become licensed CPAs in their state of employment, and each state has slightly different licensing requirements. In most states, license applicants have to meet education and experience requirements to be eligible to take exams. Experience requirements vary, but most states require applicants to have 1-2 years of approved accounting experience.

The BLS stated that, after meeting eligibility requirements, individuals must pass the uniform CPA examination, offered by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). Information from the AICPA website indicated that the exam consists of four parts: financial accounting and reporting (FAR); auditing and attestation (AUD); regulations (REG); and business environment and concepts (BEC).
 

**Step 4: Find Employment as an Oil &amp; Gas Accountant**
CPAs who have enough related experience and training can start applying for oil and gas accountant positions. Complaints can be made to the relevant governing bodies in each country. Predictions from the BLS showed that up through 2020, open positions for accountants and auditors will increase by 16%. Competition for accounting positions is expected to remain high. Accountants who are licensed CPAs will most likely have better job opportunities, per BLS reports.


**Step 5: Maintain CPA License**
Information from the BLS stated that accountants who are CPAs must maintain their licenses by meeting renewal requirements, which often include paying fees and completing approved continued-education courses. Each state has different requirements for what counts as approved coursework. Some states may require CPAs to attend formal classes or conferences, whereas other states may allow individuals to learn from interactive web-based seminars or individual study programs.

22hmu6,2,2014-04-08,Would it be feasible to migrate our site from NationBuilder to Wordpress? Asking for advice and help in this thread.,BrianBoyko,WordpressPlugins,https://www.reddit.com/r/WordpressPlugins/comments/22hmu6/would_it_be_feasible_to_migrate_our_site_from/,"I work for a non-partisan political activist organization dedicated to reforming money in politics.  (And for the record, I'm a Democrat, my supervisor is a moderate Republican.) 

First off, feel free to contact me directly at brian.boyko@gmail.com if you think you can help.  Volunteers would be nice, we're reform activists, which means that the guys with deep pockets aren't the guys who want us to succeed. 

Before I came on, the organization built a website using NationBuilder; which allowed us to get up and running very quickly.  However, we're finding that while the CRM (Customer Relationship manager) tools are good, the CMS is rather lousy, and has caused me, personally, no end of headaches.

It has been suggested that we move to WordPress.  Using WordPress's CMS with NationBuilder's CRM would be an ideal option, but NationBuilder does not offer APIs or integration.  We're trying to find other options. 

*While this post has been crossposted to /r/WordPress and /r/Webdev, I thought I'd post here for recommendations specifically on what plugins to use that would meet these goals.  I've heard about CiviCRM and BuddyPress - would these be the right ones, or would it be better to use other ones?* 

Here's what we need.

* We need to be able to allow people to sign up with the site.
* We need to be able to allow people to sign a petition within the site.
* We need people to be able to donate money
* Because one of our tools is an annual walk, we need to be able to pledge donations per-mile.
* We need people to set up their own donation pages.  
* We need to be able to search our supporter database by criteria such as address, area code, etc. 
    * In fact, we specifically need to be able to create filters based on those searches such as ""within 30 miles of City, State"" or ""with 30 miles of ZIP"" for event invitations. 
* We need to be able to send (non-spam) bulk e-mails to our list of supporters (sometimes based on the above filters) 
* We need to be able to send texts to our supports who sign up for text messages, and to receive texts from supporters asking them to sign up.  
* We are also working on a mobile app that would allow supporters to upload videos automatically.  We'd like to be able to post them to a section of the site for an intern to go through and confirm, with date, time, and if possible, geolocation data. 

Here are some nice-to-haves:

* We'd like tracking codes for e-mail links especially to donation pages. 
* We'd like to process payments using credit cards, paypal, bitcoin and dogecoin. 
* We would like to be able to offer our walkers specific personal blogs where they can embed videos and photos from services such as YouTube, Facebook, and Flickr while they are on the walk. 

We have thought about using CiviCRM, but I don't yet have experience with it.  I'm looking for advice on how to approach this problem from more experienced hands. I'd also know what you think of BuddyPress and whether that would be overkill for our needs.  

How would you approach this problem? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

I had two dips left in my can of Copenhagen, half of a hydrocodone, a waded up bag with a few pieces of good cannabis inside, an almost empty eight ball, and a few sips of whiskey left in a bottle of Donny Donell. I had really over indulged this time. I was trying so hard to numb the pain of my lost loved one. I needed to cope with the sudden overwhelming change, and of course it didn’t help. No matter how many illicit substances I consumed, the pain was still there, slowly consuming me whole like a python does with its prey. Just goes to show the useless role drugs have in my life. Is there even a real way to deal with death? 
Last Friday I got a text message from my aunt telling me I needed to come home for there was a family emergency. Upon my arrival home, I was greeted with a driveway and lawn packed full of cars, I knew something was wrong. Once I parked I put my hands together and prayed, “God please don’t give me the news that I have lost someone else, you have taken so many people away from me, please don’t do this to me again!” I got out of my car nonchalantly trying to keep my nerves calm. I saw Darrel (a close family friend) walking around the yard talking on the phone. I threw my hand up and waved along with my typical greeting to friends. “Hey man!” I yelled. He gave me a quick look then his eyes went back to the ground as he continued talking on his cell phone. I couldn’t help but overhear his conversation. “I don’t know momma I reckon it was someone on dope or they were drunk or something, yeah I know, yeah.” After hearing this I faded away into my own thoughts. “Yeah someone has died.” I thought to myself. I took a deep breath and prepared myself for the worst. I was thinking maybe my father was coming back from one of his little “parities” and one of his friends was most likely over intoxicated as usual, thus causing a car crash in which my father was the fatality.
As soon as I put my hand on the door knob it opened. There stood my dad; face blood red, tears pouring from his eyes like a waterfall, an almost solid white snot drooping down from his nose. He grabbed me and pulled me towards him and held me there. I was almost in shock. Never in my life has my father shown this kind of physical affection towards me. “Your mother died in a car accident this morning son,” he said in an almost nonexistent quivering voice. My whole body went limp, my mind went completely blank. I couldn’t comprehend and process the devastating news he had just gave me. I don’t know how long I was there in front of the door with my dad, but eventually I came to the realization I had to get up. I forced myself up to my feet and then the reality train hit me harder than it ever has before. I jerked my glasses off and burst into tears as I tried to make my way for the comforting sanctuary that is my home.

 The living room was overflowing with people, they were packed in like sardines. All of them were staring at me with faces full of sorrow and pity. I felt so humiliated, I can’t stand it when people see me cry. I tried to maneuver my around obstacles to get  to my room, stepping over people’s feet, tripping over the rug, squeezing past chairs in the dead silence.it was the most awkward situation I had ever been in. Full of rage along with a hateful attitude I locked myself in my room. At the moment I didn’t want to see another person’s face nor deal with any of their bullshit hollow apologizes or their unfaithful promises to help.

A loud knock along with a familiar (and very unsettling) high pitched voice rattled my door. “Hey buddy its Caleb, I just wanted to see if you were ok.” Caleb is the undertaker/mortician at the Green Valley Funeral Home. This ridiculous looking man stands around 5’5, about 170 pounds, long blood red hair that’s usually kept in a ponytail, followed by freckles head to toe, and he has the most insidious laugh a person ever could have. On the outside Caleb seems like a friendly charming guy, but ever since I’ve been working under his supervision, something’s been telling me there is a dark and evil presence lurking around inside him. It may be just a crazy thought from my judgmental human nature, but it’s a thought I can’t seem to shake. Unfortunately Caleb Hatmaker is also my boss. I have an internship at the funeral home as a mortician’s assistant. I unlocked my door and welcomed him in. “I’m so sorry for your loss Jason, this was so unexpected I just couldn’t believe it when I was told. “Listen if there is anything you need just let me know,” he claimed. That’s exactly what I didn’t want to hear. It was the reason why I locked myself in my room, to escape from that untruthful statement. Damn if I had a dollar for every time someone told me that over the past few weeks. “Ok thank you Mr. Hatmaker, I appreciate it.” I said looking down at him, he is a very short man compared to me. “What did I tell you about calling Mr. Hatmaker?” “It’s Caleb to you, ok?” he said with that disgusting grin emerging on his face. “Sorry sir I keep forgetting.” We discussed work for a moment and he told me to take a week off, I thanked him and showed him out. I walked back to my bed to lay down and continue sobbing and wallowing in my own pain.

No one seemed to understand the severity of my situation. I had just lost my wonderful mother. The woman that was looked at by many as a saint, is now gone forever. I felt so hopeless, my whole world had been turned upside down within a 24 hour period. There were two exhausting thoughts that constantly looped through my mind on my week off from work. “I miss my mother so much” was the worst one. It was just a constant reminder that she is now dead. The woman I love more than anyone else in the world will soon merely be another forgotten corpse rotting in the ground. The other nagging thought that will also most likely aid in my downfall to a path of depression and alcoholism was assisting the other in pestering me. “What am I going to do now?” My mother was the person that took care of us all. While dad was at work I would be at school and going to work right after, and there she was at home. She was always working towards making the best damn home anyone could ever come to. All of our clothes were washed, never a trace of dirt could be found inside, and that cooking, my God! You could never ask to come home to a better meal then what came from my mother’s kitchen. There is no doubt in my mind that I lived in every man’s idea of utopia. I never took my mother’s troubles for granted, I always gave her the gratitude she deserved unlike my father who didn’t. I just couldn’t stop thinking how could I ever match up with my mom’s outstanding performance? How can I possible keep up with the cooking and cleaning? Especially being in school and working every day.
 By day two on my week of recovery allowed by Caleb, I knew I couldn’t bear the rest of the week without some type of crutch. I called up my father’s friend Mac, he’s a well-known drug dealer in our town. He answered after just a few rings. As soon as I told him who I was he automatically knew what I was perusing. “What all do you need and how much do you need?” He asked in a professional tone of voice. “15 of those blue speckles, bring me 3 grams of the snow that came from the snow storm a few days ago, a small bag of that special herb from your garden (I was aware of his garden because I have heard my father compliment him on his growing skills), and a bottle of the highest proof whiskey available.” I tried to talk in code the best I could. Usually when he hung out with my dad I would frequently hear his paranoid ramblings of the police tapping his phone. “Ok buddy I’ll be there as fast as I can.” This was the first time I actually detected some real promise in someone’s voice since my mother’s passing. Not even an hour later he was knocking on the door. Opening the door he immediately greeted me with a comforting hug. Mac is probably the most caring drug dealer I have ever encountered. He Knew I didn’t invite him for small talk. I could tell he was trying to get to the point as fast as possible. He handed me a shopping bag containing my supplies with a friendly smile on his face saying, “don’t worry I won’t tell your dad about this I remember what it was like when I lost my mother.” “Mac you have no idea how much I appreciate you doing this man, how much do I owe you?” “Nothing at all, you and your whole family have helped me more times than I can count on my fingers and toes combined, don’t sweat it kid.” I insisted he took my money, but there was no point in trying anymore with the stubborn old man. “Well the least you could do is sit down with me and do a few lines of this blow.” I said smiling while pulling out the white gold. “Well it looks like you got me there, how could I pass that up?” He sat down next to me as I cut out 6 lines, I knew this was going to cheer me up. After a while he announced he had to get home to his old lady before she started calling. We said our goodbyes and he wished me plenty of good luck and then he was out the door before I knew it. My over indulging had started. This is when the drugs started to take hold of my mind, rendering my ability to rationalize. 

It was probably the drugs causing my brain to produce and entertain the insane thought but I was determined to go for it. I wanted to prepare my mother’s body for the funeral. Most of you are probably thinking what the hell is wrong with you? I really don’t know, but now that I look back at it with a sober mind I realize it was fucked up, but please understand it was the best decision I’ve ever made. If I hadn’t wanted this, I would have never been able to stop the sickening and depraved acts that were occurring in the Green Valley Funeral Home. 

I lost count of how many shots of whiskey I had. The onset of the stuff was fast, I could compare its strength to Everclear. I sat and practiced what I was going to say to Caleb for about 10 minutes. I then frantically searched for my phone. I’m sure my mother would have been ashamed to see me stumbling around the house in that manner. Once I found my phone I did a small victory dance to celebrate my accomplishment, afterword’s I called Caleb immediately. I felt like I was stuck listening to his Fur Elise ring back tone for an eternity. Eventually he answered. His scraggly high pitched voice lunged into my ears from the other line. “Hello?” Hearing his voice triggered my gag reflex and caused me to drop my phone and vomit all over the floor. I could hear his voice carrying throughout my room as if he was standing there next to me. “Jason is that you?” “Hey are you alright?” I scooped up my phone from what looked like pure concentrated bile on the floor.  “What the heel took ye so damn long Calerrb?” I screamed slurring every word without any attempt to hide my intoxication. “Is everything ok Jason?” “Do you need help with something?” More screaming and slurring from my end, “Listen dude, listen, I want to prepare my mommas body for the funeral, I’ll be up there tomorrow to do it, kee?” “Umm Jason I don’t think that would be appropriate and I think what you are asking of me will not contribute to your healing process in a positive way.” “Ahhhhh fuck yooooouuu Calerb!” I exclaimed. “Ok well you’re obviously drunk. Jason I understand your frustration, just sleep it off and we will talk tomorrow.” I threw my phone down in a rage without even hanging up. I then proceeded to scream hateful things about him, which I do not know if he herd or not, but I honestly I don’t care and it wouldn’t matter anymore if I did.
The next morning was miserable. To my awakening I found myself lying on the floor accompanied by that well-known “trainwreck” hang over. I’ve had a few hangovers in my days but never like this. I sat myself up against my bed while trying to recall everything that happened in the previous night. I remembered getting shit faced but nothing more, so I decided a relaxing shower would help it come back to me. Standing there it hit me. “That’s right I had called Caleb! Oh shit what all did I say?” I quickly finished up so I could check my cell phone to confirm the thought. I found it behind my bed covered in dried up vomit, “great” I thought. I managed to clean the remaining discharge but I am positive the smell is forever embedded into the inside component’s, just my luck huh? There it was in my call history, a 20 minute ongoing call with the psycho (that’s his contact name). 1 unread message from “the psycho” displayed up in my notification bar. It read, “Jason call me when you get this we need to talk, love Caleb.” I was puzzled. Why the fuck did I call him last night? It’s as if I had blacked out the whole phone conversation. “I guess I need to call and figure all of this out.”

I’m a huge fan of classical music such as; orchestra, aria/opera, famous compositions from Beethoven, Franz Wohlfahrt, etcetera, but son of a bitch do I hate Caleb’s ring back tone of Fur Elise. I used to adore this beautiful masterpiece, but somehow he made me despise every fucking note. After 1 minute and 30 agonizing seconds he answered. “Jason?” Why would he waste my time questioning me with his disgusting voice if he already knew it was me, does he ever check his caller id? “Yes, you wanted to speak with me sir?” I questioned back. “Yeah umm I just wanted to talk about last night. You were a bit intoxicated and forgive me if I upset you. You requested to prepare your mother’s body for her funeral.” “Yeah I’m so sorry I don’t remember that I was very drunk, I apologize for that Mr. Hatmaker.” “Oh its ok we’ve all had those nights before. I’m happy to see you realized it just wasn’t an appropriate thing.” It all came back to me, I remembered parts of the conversation and my demented wish. Then I thought, “the fucking nerve this guy has.” He tells me he’s glad I realized the error of my ways, well fuck him. “What do you mean I realized it was inappropriate” I snapped back at him. “I beg your pardon?” Ugh, his annoying questions, they make me want to barf. “I still want this, I know I may seem like a lunatic to you but to me this is important.” I was improvising at this point. “Jason as your friend and your boss (he put a lot of emphasis on the word boss) I forbid you to do any such thing.” The tone of his voice sounded defensive thus giving me the impression there is some sort of secret involved. Now I’m curious, time to put all the years of reading detective comics to good use. I assumed it would be a good idea to agree and throw him off guard, I guess it’s time to use what I learned in drama club from high school. I burst into tears spontaneously, “God Mr. Hatmaker your right, this is over the line and I can’t do this, what was I thinking? I’m so sorry I put you in this spot and caused an uncomfortable situation for you. I’m such a fool.” I sobbed without shame. “Jason you are not stupid. You are the most brilliant young man I’ve had the pleasure to meet and work with. This kind of thing happens to everyone, God knows I have went through this. Now don’t let me ever catch you talking down about yourself again.” “Sorry sir it won’t happen again, I promise.” I said trying to sound promising. “That’s what I like to hear! Jason just please get some rest and go easy on the booze, it’s not good for you. I will see you at the funeral Saturday.” I kept picturing him saying this with a smile on his face. “Ok Mr. Hatmaker, have a good day.” I was almost ashamed of myself for kissing his ass, but it was necessary. “Oh and Jason its Caleb to you.” “Yes sir, sorry, goodbye.” It was a great success. Now that I threw him off guard he will not be expecting me. This is my chance to get to the bottom of all of my suspicions, I knew for sure I was going to find something out. I knew I would expose him for whatever evil mischief things he was hiding. 

I was like a Special Forces navy seal preparing for his mission. I gathered my trusty 9mm handgun with my shoulder holster, my old timer pocket knife that my dad gave me when I was ten years old, and finally my steel toed boots, just in case I needed to give a powerful kick to something. I was ready to go to the Green Valley Funeral Home, I was ready to uncover the truth, but before I left I needed to request some special help. I got down on my knees for what could possibly be the last time, and prayed. “God I know I’m not the best person in the world but I think I’m doing something good here, please guide me and keep me safe from whatever I might face at the funeral home, and if I do fail and maybe even die, please don’t send me to hell, sincerely with love, Jason.” I now felt more confident than Rambo. 

It didn’t take long to arrive, 10 minutes at the max. Which is unusual. Typically it takes about 20 minutes from my house, I guess I was too busy thinking about what might be in store for me so it must have made the duration of the trip seem quicker. There I was in the parking lot, panicking. I didn’t have much confidence at the time most likely from my anxiety disorders. Staring at the entrance with hundreds of thoughts rushing through my head, all kinds of different scenarios were agitating my nerves and making it worse. I gave myself a quick pep talk and said fuck it, let’s do this!

Palms sweating and shaking I reached for the doorknob of the entrance, trying to make as little sound as possible to avoid alerting Caleb. There are no type of alarms to let him know I was here, also we are the only two people who run the place, besides the janitor that comes after hours. So I knew staying silent was the main goal of my mission. The funeral home was dead silent as usual so it made being stealthy quite difficult, especially with the occasional squeaky floor board. I finally made my way to the entrance of the morgue, the door was already slightly open. “He must be working on someone” I thought.  

I peaked my head into the door and what I saw before me was the beginning of a homicide. My mother’s body was on the table lying in a pool of blood. She had been mangled and dismembered. Her stomach had been torn open in a sloppy savage way, her small intestines along with many other vital organs were lying next to her. On top of her was Caleb, completely nude and thrusting into my mother. My heart skipped a beat. I had expected to find many things but never this. I couldn’t even imagine such a horrible thing. My whole body shook I could feel my face burning my fist squeezing so tight they felt like they were going to bleed, my raw animal instinct was coming. I pushed myself towards him trying to stay quiet I wanted to take him by surprise. I grabbed his red ponytail and jerked back with all my strength sending us both crazing down to the floor. I quickly got myself up and grabbed his hair once again. I spotted a nearby scalpel and put it to his throat. He laughed, the stupid fuck started laughing hissing even. “You want an explanation I’m guessing? I told you not to come down here Jason.” “im going to fucking kill you, you fucking sick son of a bitch.” I screamed and strained so hard my whole head was shaking my face was on fire, I knew my screams could be heard throughout the funeral home. I even startled myself a little, I felt like a monster, I had never raised my voice in such a way before. I didn’t even know I was capable of this. “You don’t have it in you,” he said laughing. This fueled my anger even more, I’m glad he said this it sure helped. I’m punched him in the face and he went straight the ground with a broken and bloody nose. I mounted him and used the scalpel to slash away at his face but controlling myself to not kill him, I wanted keep him alive for a long time, I wanted to play. With each slash more and more blood squirted onto my face, I kept my eyes closed to keep it out of my eyes. This was the first time I enjoyed Caleb’s voice, his screams of pain sounded like music to my ears. “Please stop I’ve had enough, please!” I stopped because I didn’t want to accidently hit any major veins in his neck. I turned him around and slashed both of his Achilles tendons just so he couldn’t run away from me. He was constantly screaming “Jason please stop! I’m sorry!” I ignored every word I had turned into a killing machine. I cut away at both is legs leaving them a mangled mess of meat and bone. I then moved to his dorsal cavity and made small incisions so he would lose more blood to make him weaker, but I didn’t want him to bleed out, not yet. I moved down to his penis and cut it off along with his testicles. Louder high pitch screams came from him. I knew now he would bleed out soon so I should work on torturing him a little more. I cut at all of the sensitive nerve points I knew on his body just to inflict more pain. I propped his head up on my knee and put a hand on his lower jaw and upper. I pulled the opposite way on each hand trying to break his lower jaw, I could feel him resisting, his lower jaw was too strong. I threw his head onto the ground and raised my boot into a kicking position. With full force I kicked his lower jaw and broke it completely free, it has now lost all function. I picked his head up and shoved my fist as hard as I possibly could into his mouth, I could feel my arm making its way down his esophagus. He was chocking and coughing trying to plead for me to stop. I kept going full force. My arm had completely blocked his airway so his chocking ceased. It didn’t take him long to suffocate which disappointed me.

Looking down at his mangled body gave me a great feeling of justice. I looked around the morgue and saw things I didn’t see earlier. There were more bodies. All dismembered and covered in semen and blood. There was a small portable gas stove on the ground with a piece of human flesh sitting in the skillet. How much worse can this get? I thought.  I thought it would be a good idea to leave a note for the police to let them know who he was. So I went to office to fetch a pen and some paper. Searching through his doors I found a key to his safe. I opened and found numerous locks of hair and teeth, it’s like he was keeping them as trophies. I found what looked like a photo album that I believe may be bound in human flesh. Inside were hundreds of pictures of Caleb posing with dead bodies and violating them, but none of them seemed to be in the gory mangled state my mother was in, he went all out on her. Why did he have to worse things to her? Many of the cadavers in the photos were people I knew and worked on a little myself. I couldn’t take anymore. I needed to finish up as soon as possible. I sat down at his desk to write a note for the police letting them know I was a vigilante getting rid of the scum of the earth. I avoided writing my hand writing just in case this was linked back to me.

 I carried to safe and note back to the morgue and lied them beside his body. I then retraced my all my steps with a rag to wipe all my finger prints towards the murder but none in the places I work so it won’t look like I was involved, after all I just work here right? After I cleaned as much blood as I possibly could from myself I left and went straight home. I spend the next three days in bed. I was disgusted with myself for doing all of those horrible things. I kept thinking, “am I a just as much of a monster as Caleb Hatmaker?” I couldn’t be, what I did was a good thing. I just kept telling myself this, I tried to assure myself that this feeling would pass soon.

The incident was all over the news. Later that day sheriff Kacey was knocking on my door as I expected. I opened the door and greeted him. “Hi there, can I help you with something sheriff?” I was trying so hard not to panic, I couldn’t stop my limbs from shaking, it was very obvious. The little voice in my head kept telling me, “oh you’ve done it now Jason he’s going to catch you.” “Your Jason Bozinsky right?” He asked in a stern voice. “Yes sir that is correct, come on in sir and make yourself at home. Now is something wrong?” I could even detect to fear in my own voice, I’m sure he could too. He stepped inside and I closed the door behind him. “Mr. Bozinsky are you aware that your boss Caleb Hatmaker was murdered a few days ago?” My heart started to pound. I tried to sound surprised and frightened. “What? When did this happen? Who did this? Can you give me some details?” “Well we don’t know who did it yet but it turns out that your boss Caleb was a pretty sick person. He has eaten and had sex with hundreds of corpses and we believe he may have been a serial killer also.” I tried to play along and look clueless. I sat down on my couch and put my head into my hands. “I just can’t believe any of this sheriff, I just saw him not long ago, he gave me some time off work because my mother died.” “Yeah I thought so, that’s one thing I wanted to talk to you about, your mother.” He began to tell me about the things he did to my mother, I burst out into tears but they weren’t fake, it just brought back all the pain all over again. Kacey sat down beside me. “Jason we checked Caleb’s phone records and you were the last person to speak with him, we also have a witness saying they saw your car leaving the scene at the time of his death.” His voice wasn’t stern anymore, it was compassionate. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, are you trying to say I did this?” “Jason I know you were the one who killed him, but I want you to know I don’t blame you one damn bit. There is more evidence that points towards you that will eventually lead to your arrest. “Your right I’m not going to hide it, I’m not ashamed of what I did, I did this town a favor and everyone is going to be on my side.” I said defending myself.” Kacey smiled and said, “Jason don’t worry I have an interview with the press at 5:00 and I’m letting them know I’m closing the case, there is no evidence for us to go on and the killer has most likely fled the state, therefore it is out of my hands.” “Are you serious? How can I ever repay you for this?” It was such a generous thing he was doing for me, I wanted to repay him somehow. “You’re joking right? You don’t need to repay me in anyway Jason Bozinsky, you have done more for this town than I have or any other sheriff has. You truly are a hero.” I just couldn’t believe what he was saying to me. I was getting off the hook and now I’m looked at as a hero. Kacey stood up and walked to the door but before leaving he turned around and said, “Now get some rest you’re going to need it to run the funeral home once it gets cleaned up and reopened.” I was a little confused. “What do you mean sheriff?” I’m going to make arrangements with mayor to make sure you gain ownership of the funeral home, you deserve it and plus you’re the only person in this town that can run it.” I smiled at him and thanked him, “thank you sheriff, I really appreciate what you’re doing for me.” “No problem,” he said smiling, he tipped his cowboy hat as a wave goodbye and left. 

The sheriff and I both feel that I have restored this town, I fixed a major flaw. Although the sheriff and myself are the only two people in the whole world that know the secret victory, I’m sure the rest of the town would be proud of me for what I have done. Overall this has been one big cluster fuck of madness. I’ve lost my mom, the most important person in my life, but then again I look at it like she was sacrificed so I could do something great for my life and the other resident’s lives here as well. Caroline Bozinsky died so I could fix this now near perfect town. My mother’s sacrifice gave me the opportunity of a stable job that is now the basic building blocks of starting a family. My mother is still doing things for me from the grave.

For I job I never cared for and showed up late to. I got warned, I thought they somewhat valued me. It was answering phones and drained me completely, and I was unfulfilled, hated every moment of it. Somewhat glad about it. 

My girlfriend was furious. We've been rocky for the past 3 months, she is super stressed with school and an internship. The internship might turn into a job and that's all she seems to care about. We fought a lot about my job performance. 

She is upset that I won't ever change or get it together. She is holding out hope that I get it together. I'm currently in a paralegal program which finishes in 2 months. That is what I was holding my time for at the bullshit job. 

She hasn't broken up with me yet, but texted me today sounding like she wanted to. ""Your habits won't ever change."" I said really over text, at least in person, she responded fine. Then I asked what that meant, she said I'll do it in person. Just got that response now.

I had plans to move in with her, and we had talked about some kind o grand life together. 

I just struggled with depression the past year while getting set to graduate college, suicidal thoughts during a final. and was mostly fine since that episode. 

I want to hate everything and make a fuss but what's the point. She gave me a chance to give a combination that would change her mind which is a losing cause. She might have ended it permanently. Almost 3 years of a relationship. She moved closer to me when transferring for school, spent a year long distance. 

Seems my promise that last year was the worst year wasn't accurate. 

Every year is just getting exponentially worse. What's the point if it will only get worse. I have to change, but whatever changes I make aren't noticed. She is done with me and I am done with myself. "

Quick background - I'm a 2L who accepted an internship with an out-of-state telecomm provider about a month ago. Was really excited about the position until I started going through some financial and auto troubles. Accordingly, I don't think that I will be able to afford the initial expenses involved with moving out-of-state (first months rent, the trek to the new city, auto repair, etc.) and I think I may have to back out. I just have 4 questions that I was hoping I could get some help with.

1. Is it appropriate to send and email of my intent to withdraw my acceptance to the hiring manager, or would it be better to call or send a hand-written letter?
2. Could anyone provide any advice as to what content and language should go in either medium? I'm not sure if I should be specific and talk about the issues of why I can't go, or if I should be more vague and say that I can no longer come due to personal issues.
3. Is there anyway to spin this so that I don't create bad blood? I don't think that I'll want to go and work with the provider someday, but the industry isn't too large and I'm sure they know people. I don't want to get blackballed or something.
4. Has anyone had to go through a similar experience as this? How did you handle it? What was the aftereffect?

Thanks in advance."

I am a 26 year old guy from Norway and have been spending my last five years finishing my Bachelors. There are plenty of excuses to why this is but in the end I was just lazy and unrealistic.

I am currently finishing up and I am getting an accounting degree (no idea how this works in other countries). Here you need to have 3 years of economic school with special subjects and minimum of 2 years of internship to get licensed.

I have spent such a long time finishing school and I also got very bad grades, so I highly doubt I will find a job within the field. But I have a plan and that is to create valueable content online regarding accounting and refer to that when I start applying for jobs this year. I want to ask if this sounds like a good idea so please comment on it.

Another issue is what type of content I should write about. First would be who to aim, business or homes? Taxes? New laws? 
Do you know of any blogs or related that write about accounting?

If you have any good ideas please share! :D"

I'm completing my sophomore coursework in EE this semester and landed an internship with a large power distribution company. Given my interests, they have placed me with their Smart Grid group.

This is not my first job, I've got about a decade in professional IT work, largely in systems, networking and security. Further, from what I understand about this company's intern program, I will have my own project within the group to execute as I am able.

It's fair to say I'm a bit of an over-achiever so I'd like to complete my project. Given the short time-line, this means I need to be up to speed as quickly as possible.

Can anyone recommend materials regarding smart-grid tech and large scale power distribution?

Do your breed research before buying or adopting, even on mixed breeds.",octaffle,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/22iq8t/making_an_informed_decision_could_save_a_life_do/,"In 2011, I lived with an ACD/Aussie mix (a ""texas heeler"") named Echo.  [She's a cutie](http://api.ning.com/files/TwzIpTmSrrNJmJp9amc6WAIxLIRDlHEAn--1M-St1ftwzFbipJD8*tJ5j28xF09Q/PA310245.JPG?width=737&amp;height=552) and was about Waffle's age, maybe up to a year older.  When I first rolled up with Waffle to live in our new apartment with Echo and her owner, Echo postured and attacked Waffle.  Immediately, I knew she needed training.  The first three days in the apartment were a nightmare.  This dog had been with her owner for over a year and she acted like she had been recently adopted.  I couldn't deal.  I didn't get my dog and meticulously spend two months training him so he wouldn't be a nuisance to my roommates only to have Echo stomp all over everything.

My roommate had mild CP and could walk with a shambling gait (she rode horses and worked at a barn, so it isn't like she was totally crippled.)  It was immediately apparent that, even when the dog did go for a walk, the walk was woefully insufficient.  This dog needed to RUN or burn energy somehow.  I walked her sometimes and took her out to play.  I trained her a bit, but training is very time consuming and I was an engineering student with my own new dog to deal with, so I couldn't do it too often.  She was extremely smart and very trainable.  She was so eager to learn.  She wasn't getting what she needed and she was a nuisance at home.  She barked incessantly if dogs were outside and had bad habits in general.  The third day I lived there, I wrote her owner a letter stating my concerns about Echo and how I felt that would affect Waffle (we were both too emotional to discuss it in person).  I mentioned that Echo was a herding dog and she had needs that weren't going fulfilled.  The letter I received back was basically a list of excuses and promises to improve.  We discussed it more since then, including a long talk about rehoming Echo--a topic she brought up.  I explained that she needed to do what's best for the dog and a more active home would probably be best.  There was some more talk and discussion but, ultimately, nothing changed.

It didn't improve.  This dog wasn't getting any meaningful attention.  Echo was living a life of benign neglect.  She had food, water, shelter, and was getting a small walk every day, but she was obviously suffering.  By the end of the semester, tensions were very high and I was just generally pissed.  The dog had bitten my mother and my friend (not a ""dog attack"" bite, more like an uncontrolled nip), to add to my list of grievances.  My landlord ended up speaking to me about my supposed hostility toward the owner and eventually agreed that if Echo were to continue staying in our apartment, she would need to see a professional trainer and keep a log of training and exercise.  The dog went home for Thanksgiving and did not return for the rest of the semester.  The owner ended up doing an internship during spring semester and I did not have to deal with the problem again.

We moved to another apartment in the same complex and saw Echo out and about sometimes.  Her new roommate had nothing but bad things to say about the owner and Echo's behavior.  

Now, 4 years later, Echo is being euthanized due to ""sudden human aggression"".  She went to the vet two weeks ago and received a clean bill of health.  There is no attempt being made to contact a professional about mitigating or reducing the aggressive behavior.  The owner has diagnosed it as a ""neurological problem"" due to its apparently sudden onset.  It's not.  Echo is being killed because of her owner's obstinate ignorance and general laziness toward caring for her dog's mental health.

Let that sink in for a moment.

This dog is being killed because of the benign neglect it suffered for four years.  

Please, when you bring an animal home, know what to expect of the dog and what the dog will expect of you.  The repercussions can be immense.

Edit:  I was just informed that Echo is gone.  Thank you for suggesting to look for a rescue or a foster. My contact with Echo's owner just got back with me and said it was too late."

I graduated college with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems.  Since then, I've left my 2 year internship position because they didn't have an open position for me other than helpdesk.  They actually filled one a couple of months prior after interviewing me and another guy and selecting him.  I went to another helpdesk position that paid a bit more but the management was horrendous.  Being talked at and even yelled at was common and I was hardly given anything to do, despite requesting work.  They really just wanted me to handle the phones, which rarely rang.  I did more self-imposed janitorial work there than computer related things simply because I was bored.  

I quit that one and started at a programming position that paid quite a bit more than the helpdesk one, I thought I had hit gold!  They fired me after a month however.  They only reasons they gave me was that I was not a good fit for the position and my communication was lacking.  I don't understand what that meant because by the time I left I was sending my supervisor 1 email a day with what I did, what I need to do, and what I learned that day.  Also an email a week with the same stuff, except for the week (so 2 on Friday).  Then my supervisor mandated that we talk about each email the following morning.  I still managed to learn a completely new-to-me, completely text based program and complete a project using it, and start learning .NET and SQL programming.  I really don't know what was expected of me at that point.  Coming out I'm glad I'm not there because 3 of us had to share an L shaped ~9 x 6 cubicle and my supervisor had to have her paper piles everywhere.  Additionally I was developing endocrine system problems that went away a few weeks after not being there.  But being fired and that walk of shame sucked.  I never thought I'd have to go through that since I always give my best at work.

Since then I've not had another full time job (about a year now).  I've done some work through a computer support business I'd started, dabbled in starting a restaurant that catered to people with allergies to gluten, corn, soy, etc. because I am affected by them and get frustrated when I eat out.  Nether thing has taken off either because of lack of money (restaurants are expensive to start) or I guess marketing skills on my part.  Maybe there are just too many IT shops in my area and people like going to big box stores for computer help even though they never seem to have a good comment when its brought up.  The few customers I have had always say good things about my service and some are repeats.  I can't seem to take off with it though.  

I've been dishwashing part time to supplement my wife's pretty average income.  I have been able to create a budget that allows us to live in mild comfort off of just her income.  What I earn goes towards extra payments on our student loans.  We were even able to afford a house and renovate it a bit.  That pretty much stretched it out to the max as all extra expenses have been removed and income is all going towards necessities.

She has been great about the entire situation and I feel bad about all that's happened.  She's getting to the point where she wants to have a baby, and would like a vacation as well.  The only way to get the funds for those things is for me to increase my income.  

I'm a very independent person and like to do things on my own, my way.  I put a lot of thought into everything I do and research the crap out of stuff before I do it because I want to make sure it'll work.  So I have a lot of confidence in myself, until I need to work with others, then I lose it all and ""forget"" what I learned.  I really hate the idea of going to work for someone else again because I end up feeling like I have no control over my time, especially when it comes to the unpredictable hours that IT can demand.  It's not so bad when I am earning my rate on jobs I do using ideas I came up with, but when I work for someone else, I can't help but feel taken advantage of.

I love working with people and having a direct impact on the quality of their life, currently through technology.  I love finding ways to use technology to increase the quality of ones life as well.  This is how I believe I am different than a lot of people in IT because pure money and always having/providing the latest tech is not my main motivation.  Do people not want that or do they not know they want that?  I'm not sure.

Back to the main point.  I am at my wits end with my life and have no idea what to do or where to go next.  I have a great mind for problem solving and can learn anything if I have a good enough reason to.  I would think this leaves me with a  world of opportunities, but I can't seem to move forward with anything I try.  As soon as I think, ""This is it"", things completely change or some ""un-overcomeable"" roadblock stops me in my tracks.  This really makes me feel like a failure and hurts to see my wife smile and try to support me when I know she's disappointed too.

TL;DR: Am stuck in life because of who I am and things that have happened.  Don't know where to go next."
22jbm7,2,2014-04-08,I [20M] got a friend request the day after from Her [20F] is she into me? (More Complicated than it sounds),[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22jbm7/i_20m_got_a_friend_request_the_day_after_from_her/,"Sorry if this got a little long :)

**So, a little backstory first:**
I am a 20 Year old guy who have moved to another country, for a one year Internship, the city im living in is a big City in Europe and we are around 55 Interns from my country just in this city. We are, however, spread out in different Companies all around the city but from time to time we all meet and go out together. 

**The night i saw HER[20F]:**
So, i have now been here in this city for 8 months, which means i got 4 months left on my internship. In the past 8 months i have been out celebrating many times with the other interns. However, Last saturday we were going to a big Party, the way this kind of party works is that you sit around a LONG table all night and drink beer, dance on the chairs, tables and so on, so you dont really leave your Seet other than to go to the bathroom. 

So, at the table, i saw this girl, i had not seen her before, but all the others seemed to know her, from a party i did'nt go to. Anyway, this girl, was sitting at the end of the table while i was sitting 4 chairs further down towards the middle on the other side of the table. I instantly noticed her, as she and her 3 girl-friends came 15 min late, and i just could not take my eye of, of her, she was beautiful, long blonde hair, blueish eyes and the sweetest smile -also an intern like me. 

As the night went on, i noticed her looking at me also, and i think she noticed me doing the same, however, for some reason in our Beerdrinking-Dancing-on-the-chairs-partying i dident go over and talk to her. Now the funny thing is that normally i dont have any problem going over to new ppl and speak with them, not girls either, im spontanious when i get drunk.

It got late and everyone got more and more drunk but i could still notice her looking over at me from time to time. 
At the end, the place where we were at, shut down around 1 (we started at 18:00 with eating and there had been live musik all night), and in a split second she was gone, so i went over to two of my palls to find out what she was called, i got her name and then, of cource, i Drunk-friendrequested her of Facebook, however 10 min later, i cancelled the Friendrequest, because, well, i dident want to seem wierd and i was Drunk.

**The next morning:**
The next morning i woke up, really early, like half past 6 and i could'nt sleep, i looked at Facebook and there was nothing. So i watched a movie and around 8'O clock i looked at Facebook again and there was a friend request... Gues who it was?, it was her. 

**Question:**
So now im confused of what to do, was this Friendrequest at 8'O clock in the morning 2 Days ago, a sign of affection from her?, or is it just me who wants it to be?

**tl;dr**: Saw a Beautiful girl, who looked back at me, dident talk all night, got Friendrequest from her in the early morning. What should i do?"
22jpet,26,2014-04-08,"Off to a good start, but could you help critique my plans?",[deleted],financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/22jpet/off_to_a_good_start_but_could_you_help_critique/,"Hi /r/financialindependence,

I am currently 18 and finishing up my first year in university (currently going for a BSc in Computer Science). I am planning on transferring universities (and programs) next year, and because it is much farther away from my current university I am planning on living in the University Residence. I will be working towards a degree in engineering.

Anyways, right now my financial situation looks like this:

**savings and income**

 * Current Savings: **~$35,000** (from part time jobs in highschool)
 * Projected Income for Summer Months (less expenses): **~$5,000** (sadly, I was unable to find an internship for CS this summer, so I will likely be working retail. This number may vary slightly depending on the number of shifts I can get).
 * Monthly income during the school year: **$230 dollars/month** + hopefully some money from a part time job at the school.

**future expenses**

 * Tuition in the fall: **$4000** after scholarships
 * Residence: **$7500-$12500** (depending on the res that I get into. If I choose the cheaper one ($6300 + $150 a month for food), I will live with a roommate).
 * Miscellaneous throughout the year: **$600**

After next year, I plan on moving out of res and into a cheaper place. I have no car, so I have no expenses along with that. I have 3-4 more years in university left until I finish. At some point I also really want to take a trip abroad (Japan) for a year to have the experience.

My plan is to put **~$20,000** split between two ETFs through iShares and set that aside for retirement. I was thinking the S+P 500 or some other index. 

**My questions are as follows:** 

 * would it make more sense financially to stay put where I am and finish my Computer Science degree and then move on to work on the engineering degree? My school has a program worked out with another university where you can do a three year (or a four year) CS, Physics, or Mathematics degree and then take an additional 2 years at the partner school to get an engineering degree. My living expenses would be lower (about 6300 dollars with tuition, food, rent, miscellaneous - I have a good set up with my landlord), but I would take another year to complete it and I would only be working towards a Computer Science degree. I would also have no internship opportunities.

 * Should I invest less/more of my money for retirement?

 * How can you travel abroad frugally?

 * How do you stop worrying about finances when you know that you will be fine?

I am sorry about this post being so long winded. I am just a little bit confused on what I should be doing to help out my situation a little bit more. I am enjoying school (although it is weird not having a job for the first time in forever, and I don't think that I want to be a programmer for the rest of my life), and I think that I am enjoying life - but I feel like I am doing something wrong.

I am in a good position at the moment, but I don't want to screw it up.

Thanks!

Chapter 1- Basic Training
 
Take an azure eyed, platinum haired, dairy farming, Student Body President- a week after graduation- and drop him in Reception Battalion 2000 Miles from home. 

[UNZIP FLY]

Take every belonging he possesses and put it in a single bag that looks just like his new life’s bags. 
Give him shots like a puppy on an assembly line. Give him name-tags any pet shop would be proud to stock. Repeatedly tell him that the tags are not, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, to be called dog tags- for some reason. Shave him bald as the day of his birth and show him how to stand in lines to wait. Feed him. Clothe him like all the other fat, bald, ugly, little pups. Leave him in line for about a week.

[PULL COCK OUT OF TROUSERS]

After the thorough course in 1D geometry, put an M16A2 Rifle in his right hand and a bayonet in his left hand. With a hundred 18-year-old assembly line puppies, who all shaved the first time last week…

[LEANING FORWARD NOW, COCK TWITCHES]

Have your Senior Drill Sergeant say, “Fix Bayonets!” 

When the fumbling is done, the Drill Sergeant will say, 

“This is a preparatory command, ‘What makes the Grass Grow?’ You all will find the most vicious war cries you can muster and thrust your bayonets in the air while screaming, ‘BLOOD, BLOOD MAKES THE GRASS GROW!’”

Then, the Drill Sergeant will continue, “I’ll then say, ‘What makes the Grass Green?’ You all shout, ‘GUTS, GUTS MAKE THE GRASS GREEN!’ While you shove that bayonet into the air. Do you understand?”

The hundred fat, bald recruits will then shout back:

“YES DRILL SERGEANT!”

[COCK GROWING]

At this point the stupid, bumbling dairy farmer will shout:

“That’s Crazy Drill Sergeant- back home, we just use cow shit on grass.”

As a few periphery Drill Instructors are bent over laughing, the Senior Drill Sergeant with a crooked grin will command:

[COCK THROBBING]

“What makes the Grass Grow?”

A hundred puppy dogs howl:

“BLOOD, BLOOD MAKES THE GRASS GROW!”

100 BAYONETS THRUST WILDLY INTO THE SKY!

[HIPS SWAYING, HE SEIZES THE DAIRY FARMER’S EARS] 


“What make the Grass green?”


[THROBBING COCK POSITIONED AT THE BASE OF DAIRY FARMERS SKULL]


“GUTS, GUTS MAKE THE GRASS GREEN!”

100 BAYONETS THRUST IN UNISON! 

[COCK SLAMS INTO SKULL. HYMEN SMASHED! 100 ASSEMBLY LINE PUPPIES DEAD! BLOOD LEFT ON DAIRY FARMERS SHEETS]

[RAPE CONTINUES AN HOUR Or so i can’t remember…}

4 lines marched back to the barracks, 200 eyes didn’t know where to look, so they just sort of stared at the newly emptied holes in front of them.
 
The next few months are pretty fuzzy. I’m sure we all learned something important and eventually we moved on to Advanced 1D Geometry- How to wait in vehicles not in straight lines, but I don’t remember much after the first skull fucking. 

Eventually, my folks rode the Grey Hound to Graduation Day and were so proud to see their youngest of 8 with a good job. We drove to McDonalds. I ate McNuggets and drank Coke. We talked about all the things we had wanted to see 2000 miles from home- Civil War Battle Fields, Beaches, Malls, Museums, Art exhibits. We drove back to their hotel to change. I dozed off and slept until I had to report for Advanced Training instead.

This is a little long, so bear with me. 

I'm now realizing this after seeing basically everyone I know pursuing things they enjoy, while I'm sitting around trying to figure out if I want to nap on my couch or my bed. 

My roommate is always out skating. If he's not, he's watching skate videos. 

A good friend of mine is getting into body building. He's researching and improving his body basically 24/7 and LOVES it.

My girlfriend has an internship that she is very passionate about that is now turning into a career. It's all she ever talks about.

People always tell me: ""You're so smart and good at arguing, you should be an attorney or litigator!"" I feel a lot of people would be motivated by that statement, but I just don't care for it.

""You're really athletic, if you hit the gym more often, you could totally play on your college sports team!"" Again, I feel that many people would take that and run with it. Me, I just don't care. 

""Wow, you really sold me on that! You should go into sales!"" I know many people in sales/ marketing who are very young and make A LOT of money. I understand that I can make a lot of money through it, but I just don't care.

I find myself just going through the motions. Wake up. Think if I should fall back asleep or go to class. Feel bad that I'm going to skip, so I decide to go. Go to the Gym. Go to club meetings. Go back home. Spend time with girlfriend. Sleep. Party with friends on the weekend.

I'm tired of this rut I'm in. I want to be a better person ,take complete control of my life, and find something I truly care about. So I'm asking you, /r/DecidingToBeBetter, what are some steps I can take?"

I need prayer first that I can control and manage my bipolar disorder.

Secondly, even though I rejoined the church in the past few years, I haven't been able to make the leap into fully believing in God again.  I need to be rid of my unbelief.  I need to trust Him.  I desperately want to be filled with the peace that only the Holy Spirit can bring.

Third, I am graduating from my masters program at the end of May.  I need prayer that I may continue applying to jobs and internships and that I may get a job where I'm happy and paid finally.  I've been unemployed (and a part-time student) since 2011 and it's been rough financially.  In addition, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in the second half of 2013.

I'm making about $10.00 an hour here with a degree and I'm quite frankly sick of it. I assumed a State Department internship abroad would *maybe* enough to help me find an OK entry level job here..... but I'm starting to see I was wrong.

Anyways, so I guess I'm just looking for some local opinions on two things. 1) What are the odds of me getting some sort of entry level job with a Poli Sci degree over there? I have to assume the market is saturated with Poli Sci grads, but are there enough jobs to match it?

And 2) What's the best neighborhood for someone who wants to live in the city and be able to walk to places and meet people? I'm planning on having at least 5-6k to keep me on my feet long enough to hopefully land some kind of job to pay the bills until I can actually find something related to my degree, and I'm definitely leaning towards living with roomies because it makes no sense to me financially not to.

I found a sticky, but it seemed to be years old. Any fresh opinions would be awesome though.

I enjoyed going to her because she would push me to go out and socialize, be confident in situations I normally wouldn't feel comfortable in, and help me deal with my dysfunctional family.


Recently found out that it's not possible for me to continue seeing her.  I'm considering looking for a qualified cognitive-behavioral therapist in the area.  Another option that I have is my school offers free counseling services.  For some reason I feel ashamed to go there and have other students see me.  Also, it feels disheartening that I have to start over with a new therapist that doesn't know anything about my life.

I feel alone, have trouble concentrating on school work, feel mentally slow, and have no passion for anything.  Is it worth checking out the counseling services at school?  Are the ""therapists"" there generally students doing an internship, or are they fully qualified licensed professionals?

**tl;dr**

My therapist of eight years who has pushed me to succeed academically and socially in spite of my dysfunctional family no longer accepts my insurance.  Haven't seen her in months.  I'm now doing poorly both socially and academically.

Feel lonely and out of touch with society.  Considering cognitive-behavioral therapy or free therapy at school, but feel ashamed. Is the free counseling offered at universities professional?  Or just students with internships?  How important is it to continue seeing a therapist?

I am graduating from college next month with the aspiration to become a commercial editor, just like many of you experienced editors here! I'm looking for some advice on snagging an entry level job here in New York City. After reading through many of the existing threads here about starting out in this industry, applying as a Runner at a post production house seems to be the way to go. 

So far, I am starting to email post houses [from this list](http://www.aice.org/?section=members/companies/&amp;view_by=city:::new+york) asking for work, and was wondering if you guys had any other advice to help me get my foot in the door? I will be sending them my resume, cover letter, and a link to my portfolio: [jackdavidson.co](http://www.jackdavidson.co/)

I learned Avid in school, and have since worked on FCP7, Premiere Pro, and am currently teaching myself After Effects. I've worked at my college shooting and editing marketing videos, and interned in London at a corporate video production company where I did a lot of the stuff that assistant editors sometimes do (log and ingest rushes, transcoding, make stringouts/selects, backing to LTO tape). I've worked on Avid mostly for short films, and use Premiere for my own personal projects that I shoot by myself.

I am not a stranger to doing runs, in my current internship on CONAN I get coffee and lunch for the post department every day. I don't mind it though, I am just lucky enough to be able to observe the editors work and learn as much as I can from them. I hope to serve a similar role as a Runner.

Anyways, I have to say can't thank this subreddit enough. Reading through many of the posts here has been integral in shaping my future career path. Thank you!"

22lfu8,1,2014-04-09,Maybe I should drop out of uni,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/22lfu8/maybe_i_should_drop_out_of_uni/,"So I just felt like sharing my thoughts/story at the moment. 

Right now I am 20 and in my third and final year at university studying Information Technology, I have only 1 and a half semesters to go. Towards the end of last year I started have spouts of anxiety attacks and depression, at the time I didn't realise this is what was going on and kind of didn't do anything to help myself, just thought there was something wrong with me and let it pass and it did pass. I then had three months off uni and it was pretty good, I felt better I felt like me.

Fast forward to the end of the holidays and I took up a internship that I was required to complete for my degree, everything was going great for the first few days. Then ""BANG!"" it was back with a vengeance, struggling with social anxiety and panic attacks during and after the days was done. This sent me into a hole, dreading going in everyday for my internship and then on top of that uni started back up. So at this time I was managing Uni, internship and part time work with no days off in between. I just felt trapped in a cycle that I just had to wait to get out off, as my internship was only scheduled to continue for 8 weeks. So then almost every week I would have at least one day off and normally I would pull myself back together and feel great again, normally this would involve smoking a whole lot off weed, which usually sent me into a panic attack but I thought it helped at the time for some reason. I have quit smoking now and maybe even drinking so I can pull my life back on track and face these things that have been pulling me down, mostly things I wasn't even aware of.

Anyway I am back to pretty much just 2 days of uni with no commitments in-between. But I have come to big heartbreaking realisation, I do not enjoy what I am studying. I come into uni and see other people passionate towards what we learning, and I see it as something I just want to get out of the way as quick as possible. I choose IT because in high school I really like creating animations, but I thought perusing a job in that would be too hard to find work. So I thought I opted for the next best thing, I was kind of just going to uni because I didn't know what else to do. 

Now I find myself at a crossroads I only have about a semester and a half left until I graduate, but I find myself miserable half the time although there are some days I seem to enjoy. I would enjoy studying something else, but I think I have had enough of studying altogether at the moment. 

My current plan is to complete my degree, travel for a while and then come back and find something that I would like to explore as a job. I just dont know how I am going to get through the rest of the year at the moment. I am starting therapy tomorrow, I really hope I can find the right attitude to just finish my degree, and not make all of those years a waste. I am starting to do better with my anxiety, and hopefully I can push past that sometime soon.

Extra thoughts:
I do enjoy working on things such as websites, but from teaching myself. I was just in a lecture for ""PHP"" and as much as I enjoy writing up the code and figuring things out from home, I was just miserable during the lecture and couldn't stop thinking about my future.

22li1r,3,2014-04-09,Applying for an internship at an IT security consulting company,MusicidalOtaku,techsnap,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsnap/comments/22li1r/applying_for_an_internship_at_an_it_security/,"Hi all!
I would like to know your opinions on what would be a good thing to work on as an intern at a (relatively) well-known security consulting company. The internship is organized by my university, it would last for 4 to 6 weeks and I need to propose a project that I can finish on my own in that time. It needs to be something that makes use of AI/Machine learning/Data Mining techniques and that can be of use to them in analyzing their clients' security infrastructure and providing advice and information services to them. 
For reference: one of the subjects I discussed during my interview that they seem to like is this: they have an internet scraper that gathers information about vulnerabilities and such in software that is used by their clients and I would perform analysis using data mining techniques on the data gathered by this scraper. 
All suggestions are welcome!"
22lvy3,26,2014-04-09,"Me [21 F] with my father [50s], where is the line when it comes to my education and life in general, and is he crossing it?",throwawaymyparents,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22lvy3/me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the_line_when/,"I'm starting to realize my father has control issues, and may even be emotionally abusive towards me. Background: He is married to the devil, and since he got married, he has taken out a lot of his anger and stress from his wife on me. He curses at me and becomes very explosive. He especially gets this way over my education, which he is obsessed with. Yes, I understand his anger issues at this point are not my step mother's fault because he is in charge of his own feelings and that if he's not willing to get help with his marriage or for himself, then that's on him. I'm just saying that she is the catalyst, because he never used to treat me this way before he started to get emotionally abused at home.



Anyway, my issue is him over stepping his boundaries. I'm a college student and I live 4 hours away from him yet I feel smothered. he has been obsessed with me getting into college and having a good career since I was born. My last name was even affected by this so I could get a minority scholarship [I'm half hispanic...but not his half]. He told me, ""you're hispanic on paper, but in real life you're white."" In high school, he made me take SAT prep for a year, rather than 2 months like everyone else. He also sabotaged a school play audition by calling my teachers behind my back to make sure I didn't get a role higher than chorus. When he thought I was going to get a lower grade in an AP class, he viciously tried to get my teacher with 20+ years experience and tenure fired against my will [he failed]. In high school, this made me extremely uncomfortable, but I thought he wasn't overstepping boundaries because he's my father and I lived under his roof and was still a minor. 



Now, I'm in college, and he still thinks doing these things is okay. he pressures me to provide him with my professors' and advisor's contact information...which isn't so bad except he thinks it's okay to call if he doesn't agree with their teaching methods. I can't have this. I am in a great program that treats the atmosphere like a professional studio. 



I don't usually give in to his demands for their information unless I think it will be a harmless conversation. He had questions about my program, so he called my advisor before. I thought it was overstepping his boundaries a little since it's my education and my job to keep tabs on him instead....plus it's not as if i haven't tried explaining my program to him before. However, he would not stop pressuring me and reminding me he pays for my schooling, so I figured what's the harm if he just wants general questions answered.



The harm is that he started asking, or more like demanding, to speak to professors. I'm working on getting an internship and my dad was not comfortable with how my program handles it. He wanted to speak with my professor. He pulled the money card again and wouldn't stop calling me during class until I had to pull her aside and ask if it was okay, apologizing in advance for my dad. I told him she's not just my professor, but my boss, he needs to respect that and not overstep boundaries and be careful with his words. I told him I shouldn't even really be having them speak, but it seemed like the only way he would understand and calm down about my internship. 



They spoke and he left me alone for a while. She didn't seem to mind, but I didn't want to make a habit of this. Now that it's closer to summer break, my dad was pissed at my professor that my internship is still being figured out. He came here to visit to ""spend time with me"" and meet my professors [we are a small nit major] and then threatened to pull my professor aside and talk to her about the internship. He had a nasty tone about it and was cursing her name so I didn't think it was a good idea. I purposely kept them from seeing each other in a setting where he could pull her to the side to discuss me. Again, I told him she's not my professor but my boss in this setting and he needs to respect that. I asked if he thought it was appropriate if his father were to contact his boss and he said no...but completely missed the point and went back to wanting to ""talk to her.""



So yesterday I heard back from HR for the place I plan to intern at and they asked for a letter of recommendation from an employer. I don't have time for a job at my university and the last place I interned at [abroad] has not answered my emails the past year despite me trying to contact them...and to be honest, they said I was over qualified for them and they ended up giving me busy work because they had no idea what to do with someone who already knew the same programs as their actual employees since it was unpaid. Any jobs before that were related to babysitting and were a long time ago. 



My dad was calling me for days for updates about the internship and I told him my concerns and immediately he started cursing at me. ""I told you to FUCKING get your letter of recommendation when you were abroad!!!!"" He told me this several days after my internship had ended and when I tried contacting them they didn't answer, as I said before. He started freaking out and then hung up on me when I told him I am under a lot of pressure right now and I don't need this from him and I need him to be supportive. I can't go back in time and get the letter. He hung up on me, then proceeded to call me all hours of the night which I ignored telling me now he has to get people to lie for me. He just called now as well and keeps emailing me. He even tried pressuring my grandma to find someone to lie for me.



When my grandma called, I told her what he's doing is emotionally abusive and not what a father should do. She said what he's doing is coming out of love and I told her even if it is coming from a good place, it's not healthy for me and I refuse to speak to him if he's going to treat me this way. 



He's also tried to control what major I'd chose before. I wanted to take this major since I got to my college, and he wanted me to go into nursing. He told me the only reason he ""let me"" accept my current major is because I'm ""not good at anything else,"" referring to how I struggled my first year of college because the classes I took weren't subjects I was passionate about like I am about my major.



He also threatened to stop funding me because he didn't approve the guy I'm dating because he has an associates degree and not a Bachelor's at least... but that's a whole different story. We went to therapy about that and how he was overstepping boundaries and acting inappropriately. His therapist said what he's doing to me is emotionally abusive and he needs to back off and stop cursing at me. It worked with the dating situation but he's still a pest when it comes to everything else.



I'm sure someone will suggest I take out loans. I'm already almost done with my degree at this point and doing that will cause more issues with my dad. He's been saving up since I was a baby and even though he treats me this way, I feel stuck because I live off campus and my major required supplies are extremely expensive and I have no time for a job to make up for it. Is there another way to get him to calm the hell down? So far I've been ignoring his 10+ phone calls since last night into this morning. What else can I do?



TL;DR: Father is emotionally abusive about college and is overstepping his boundaries because he thinks he is entitled since he is paying for my education. What is he entitled to exactly and where is the line? How do I get him to back off?"

22mf0e,14,2014-04-09,[update] Going NC with my nMom (happy!),emgwill,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/22mf0e/update_going_nc_with_my_nmom_happy/,"So, I have been trying to be nice, but still say that I don't want to have a relationship with her, but she just wasn't getting the picture. I finally decided that I'm just going to be blunt and send this email

&gt;I'm sorry for the late response. I'm still in lab right now, and I will be for a while, then I'm going to the gym.  I understand that you would prefer to speak in person or at least over the phone, but due to my really hectic schedule lately, I don't have a lot of time in a row to be able to speak. Also, I want to be able to reflect on everything before I answer, so I'd prefer to go through email for now.

&gt;I appreciate that you are trying really hard to work on our relationship, but I'm just not interested for the foreseeable future.

&gt;One of the big issues is the time. For example, this week, I have 1 cs exam, 2 quizzes, 3 large hmwks, 1 cs project worth 15% of my grade, 1 com speech that's worth 20% of my grade, 1 lab report (if I don't get at least a C on just one, they automatically fail the lab portion of the class), and all this is a pretty standard week. I spend all my time in labs studying and doing homework, walking to and from my apartment (it takes almost an hour one way to class), and I try to make it to the gym for an hour everyday. Any extra time is spent maintaining my long distance relationship and planning a wedding. I average maybe 6 hours of sleep at night. Less than two weeks after the semester is over, I get married. The very next Monday I return from my honeymoon, I start my internship. I'm going to have to commute an hour each way during my internship as well as taking two online summer classes. All of this while maintaining my long distance marriage. I'm working right up until classes start again, and I have the same problem as above. I might have had time to maintain a relationship, but I don't have the time to restart one or to work on one. I've been spending so much time trying to figure out what to say to you that it's causing a lot of problems. I just don't have the time to try to figure out what to say to you. I need to be able to sleep, eat, and get good grades. You're just not a priority over my health or my future.

&gt;Even if I did have time, I'm not sure that I want to work on our relationship just yet. I'm glad that you recollect a pleasant past between us, but that's not my opinion of it. I'm surrounded by wonderful people here, and I don't want these bad memories to resurface or to make me anxious. I've actually had more anxiety since you sent me that original email about Andrew's diagnosis than I've had in a long time. It's not healthy for me, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my health, my happiness, or Jim's happiness just so you feel better. If you really are not narcissistic, then you will realize that talking with you so much right now is really damaging to my health, grades, happiness, and relationships, and you'll let me come to you when I'm ready.

&gt;That's right, I'd like you to try to be patient, and I'll come to you when I'm ready. I might be ready in a year. I might be ready in 30 years. I might never be ready. I will most likely see you at family functions, but I'd like to stop emailing for a while. I will most likely not want you to come to my wedding. I want us to go back to not talking for a while, and I don't want to have to be worried about when you'll email me next. I want to come to you when I'm ready. When I'm ready to work on things and move past things. If you decide at that point that it's too late and you don't want to, I can understand that. If I end up regretting this, well, that's my own problem. I really think it's best for me and my life for me to get my own shit together first.

&gt;Alright, well, I've said what I needed to say. I hope all the best for you and yours, and I hope things start turning around for Andrew.

&gt;-Emma


&gt;PS You may want to read the comments at the bottom of the page of that article you sent me. It seems like most people didn't agree with it, and they actually expressed opinions similar to my own.


And in response, she just sent:

&gt;Sorry you're struggling, but I don't believe in the bad mother myths fueled by pop psychology. I do, however, love that you're doing well and wish you only the best in life.

&gt;Reach out anytime you'd like. Otherwise, at your request, I won't call or message again.

I'm currently 2 semester away from graduating from my 5 year accounting program in NY. I will be applying for the Big 4 and top 10 accounting firms this coming Fall semester (September). I've been interning for almost half of my undergraduate life, 2 years and 6 months.

My work experience involves 1 year and 6 month in accounting at a small non profit and 1 year in tax at a BB.


I've been out of work for the past 4 months and am just relaxing and enjoying life. I was hoping to continue this beautiful work free life until I graduate, but I feel like public accounting firms may look at this poorly =(.


I'm deciding on whether I should apply for a summer internship or not. If I do, then it'll be good way to close to gap but if I don't I would have 9 months of no activities on my resume during recruiting season.


What do you guys think? Is it ok for me to continue bumming out like this?

I rented a furnished apartment for $1000/mo and payed $50/mo for a bus pass to get to work.  I also bought a bicycle for about $130 and used that as alternative transit.  Transit was about 45 min by bus and 60 min by bicycle.

I plan to intern at the same place again this upcoming fall.  I am considering renting somewhere that is cheaper, even if that means purchasing my own air/water mattress.  Most of the cheaper places are outside reasonable commuting range.  I am tossing around the idea of leasing a car.  In addition to a shorter commute, it would afford me the ability to explore the city, which is not very pedestrian or mass transit oriented.  I have ~730 FICO, but no auto insurance currently.  How expensive would a 4 month lease be?  Are there any hidden drawbacks to leasing a vehicle other than the price?"
22mmwb,29,2014-04-09,The cautionary life-cycle of a young director.,againsttheatre,Theatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/22mmwb/the_cautionary_lifecycle_of_a_young_director/,"You were a weird kid. You didn’t try to be, you just never cracked the code of fitting in. One day you linger after school to haunt the halls for no reason. A group of other weirdos, you discover, has congregated in the auditorium. You approach... and soon find yourself playing Cassio in the drama club’s forthcoming production of *Othello*.

Thereafter you habitually leave the building for home long after dark, laughing and jumping with an actual bonafide group of friends like the cool kids have. The warmth of *belonging* swells your veins to bursting every time you stride into rehearsal. A crush develops on a girl. Your acting becomes more focused in a complex and relentless campaign to positively impress her.

The pageantry and the rush of opening night, in front of everyone’s parents, the acclaim in the lobby when you emerge out of costume, as you steal glances at your crush, willing her to return them (she doesn’t), the shouted goodbyes to your new lifelong friends in the parking lot, all amount to being hooked, *hooked*, on these feelings.

You are involved in every play thereafter. The seniors get to direct. In sophomore year, you begin to devote serious time to daydreaming about how you’ll do it. And then, impossibly, it arrives. Your shot. And if all that preceded was cocaine, directing is motherfucking heroine.

And colleges, in a tacit implication that there is a profession to be had out there, actually offer drama club as a major. So you better believe that’s what you major in. And then it’s all the glory and belonging and sense of accomplishment of high school theatre plus alcohol and sex. It cannot be beat.

So when you graduate, what the hell else are you going to do but start a theatre company? Then it’s the glory and the belonging and accomplishment and the alcohol and the sex and the import of business and the purposeful devotion to the survival of the company.

And when you really feel like you know what you’re doing, the triumphs, the *narrative* of the company's success well practiced on your lips, what else will you do but seek advanced training? And grad schools, plainly stating that there *must* be a profession to be had out there, actually offer *advanced training* in drama club. Then it’s the glory and belonging and accomplishment and alcohol and sex and dinner parties and the first rich people you’ve ever met and elevated language and truly talented colleagues and two thousand years of history and the inevitability of success and the sense that you were put on this earth to do this.

Then, penniless and suddenly in massive student loan debt, you dutifully report to New York City. This exorbitant rent sounds fine, you tell yourself and your realtor, it’s only a matter of time before your talent will be noticed to the tune of champagne corks popping on the nightly. But it’s not the same here. Everyone takes theatre very seriously but in a strange, impenetrable way. the industry is run by middle-aged-women, gay men and privately-educated trust fund babies and you share, unfortunately, little in common with any of the above. You try to do the network thing but these cool cats smell the eager on you two weeks away. You’ll have to start as an intern at some theatre company among the twenty-two year olds. But you’re thirty. And were a massive success at a pretty well-regarded graduate school. Shouldn't you be a few spaces ahead on the board?

Meanwhile, none of your friends seem as panicked about money as you (later, to your great chagrin, you will discover that they are all either independently wealthy, from New York originally, or just a lot more resourceful than you). For you, New York feels like a port from which every ship sailed before you got there.

Someone advises you never to assistant direct. So you start taking gigs in the provinces. One year, you direct 11 plays, you can now call yourself a full time stage director. You are living the dream... and you make $11,000. Gone are the glory, the belonging, and the accomplishment. Lingering are the alcohol, the elevated language and the debt. Your life is suddenly one big hangover of three years in grad school delaying several inevitable truths.

You (permanently) sublet the New York apartment you barely ever slept in because you were too busy directing two-year-old plays in Boise, and you go home. Now you live with your mom. You are 31. You carry on the fight from your new base of operations for a spell, but then... one morning... you remember (or misremember) a sentence you read sometime in grad school, back when you were on top of the world, when you knew you were born to do this. A sentence that didn’t mean much to you at the time, but now, 30 pounds overweight, watching on-demand on your mother’s couch, the truth of that sentence finally reveals itself to you.

*Are you in this world to participate in the arts? Or are you in the arts to participate in the world?*

You haven’t read a newspaper in years. You now only feel comfortable talking to other theatre people. The Theatre made you feel fulfilled, deeply, because of the belonging and accomplishment you achieved.

You were not participating in the world, you realize. You were participating in yourself.

Everyone you know is proud of you for pursuing this ""passion"" against all odds, but now, in a flash, it all feels like a hollow, deceitful ego trip.

But you are an *artist*, for a *living*, a part of you pipes up to protest. Oh? What art have you made and why did you make it? Why did you direct a play in Florida about golf? Do you have the remotest connection to either Florida or golf? Did you even *like* the play? Have you ever liked *any* play? Be honest.

Holy shit, you think. I haven’t been participating in the world at all, I’ve only been participating in myself. How horrifying. From now on, you resolve, I will only participate in the world through this art form. And you might even get lucky, and find magical seaside towns that are last stands for important theatre. And you might squeeze out a few last beauties with some wonderful people.

But you will not escape the inevitable truth that this is not your art form anymore. It demands deep personal sacrifice. It isolates you from the rest of the world. You must miss funerals and weddings for it. And when you look extremely closely, you realize that, ultimately, it is an art form that is of, by, and for *the initiated*. The moral conundrums presented by the material have outcomes that everyone in attendance already agrees with. And when you look closely at the plays, they are too often written by the wealthy, for the wealthy, about the poor. The whole enterprise, the audience, the artists and the writers, begins to feel like an echo chamber for self-congratulating bourgeois sentimentality.

And just as you start to ask yourself these questions, you see a trailer for a little independent movie called No One Knows About Persian Cats. A fiction/documentary hybrid about rock bands in Tehran having illegal shows under the pretense of shooting this movie (but really just to have rock shows) and actually getting arrested and staying in character to use the footage in the movie. And you are struck by the fact the theatre, meanwhile, is still attempting to be cool with backwards baseball caps, popped collars and sunglasses. This movie is what is *actually* cool.

So that’s it. Now you do film. Penniless, you dutifully report to Los Angeles. You try the network thing again but you really are no good at it (years later, you will finally hear the advice you wish you’d heard prior “don’t network, make friends”). You spend years thinking about directing film. And years *drinking* about it. You go to parties where everyone just talks about “projects,” and experience the acutely fraudulent pang of referring to yourself, when asked, as a ""director"" while having yet to actually direct anything.

You visit a television set where everyone just talks about food, cars and real estate. These may not be your people. You surmise that television procedurals just reinforce xenophobic, gun-loving right-wing ""values"" for a Kansas pancake-eating audience. So features it is. You pick up the knowledge that horror movies always sell. You know it behooves you to just make a $50,000 horror movie, but that’s not you. It still feels wrong. You were a genius in grad school. They have to notice eventually.

They don’t. Finally, by the grace of many benevolent friends, you actually make a short film. Off we go, you think. In the making, you bring to bear your years in theatre, your advanced training in grad school, your awareness of the zeitgeist. You say to yourself, I didn’t come all this way not to take some risks. And you attempt with mixed success to shoot all sorts of moons. Six months of blood later, you submit it to several dozen film festivals at $50 a pop and wait for you career to begin.

And then as the rejections roll in, you have a harder look at film festivals. And suddenly you realize, dear god they’re pyramid schemes. And all the Cinderella stories you heard were deliberately publicized that way. And worse than that, in their programming, they’re the same echo chamber all over again. It’s wealthy people, making stories for the wealthy, about the poor. It’s no better than the theatre.

By now, you had the sense to marry that one woman at the Los Angeles party not talking about projects. And you have a hilarious and adorable baby son who has put all this, by nature of his very existence, into perspective... as the flailings of an egomaniac with no grit.

She makes documentaries, and she too talks of the echo chamber. Documentaries, she confirms, are wealthy people, telling stories to wealthy people, about the poor. And just like in narrative film, and in the theatre, there is a collective fever dream that any of this will make a difference.

That somehow John Boehner will stumble across our Showcase-code production of a Sarah Kane play, or our short film about charming minority pickpockets taking over their elementary school, or our documentary about incarcerated lesbian Eskimo softball teams and he will be forever changed about this issue, and institute policy changes on Capitol Hill starting Monday.

Now you are pushing 40. And you resolve with your wife to lean in to your day jobs, say ""fuck recognition"" forever, refuse to play the echo chamber game, die in obscurity and just make weird art to please yourselves.

If no one is interested in art made outside the foundation-program-director-pleasing, bourgeois, sentimental, toothless echo chambers, you resolve, at least you can leave your truest, most authentic, freak-flag-waving nonsense for your son.

And just like that, you are no longer a ""director,"" you are a citizen of the world who, among other things, happens to know how to direct."

Hi Mom, it's your 24 year old son. I left your place at 16 because we didn't get along. You'd give me shit for staying up late at night (3AM) when I had no school. You'd give me shit because I didn't want to study in the field  that you wanted me to study in. 

You're not the one who raised me. I would only see you every other weekends. From as far as I can remember, my grand-parents and my dad were the ones who raised me; the ones who put me in private school. From what they told me, you skipped town for a year for work when I was under 7. 

As a kid you would be so fucking mean to me. Calling me incompetent when I left something you were cooking to burn when you never asked me to watch it. 
Or cancelling a planned trip to the amusement park because my knife slipped from my greassy hands and hit the plate loudly. 

When I was around 12, you wanted to take my dad to court to have full parental rights over me. In the court papers that either you or my dad left somewhere, I saw that you accused my dad of being part of a cult where the followers would try to enter a ""trance-like state"" to speak to their God. (My dad is a pentecostal (born-again) christian. What my mom refered as trance was something called speaking in tongues.)

Even though saying bullshit about my dad should've been an indicator of how batshit crazy you can be at times, I didn't see it. To reach a middle ground, I proposed that I lived with you a week and with my dad the other week. 

At 16, I got tired of your shit. We would fight about the stupidest things. I'll conceed that some of the fights were entirely my fault. But most of them were yours. During a night like others, we would have one of our last ones. 

I almost hit you. I got tired of the way you wanted everything to be done the way you wanted. I got tired of how you claimed you were paying for the house when it was my step dad who did. When I asked for proof, you said no. I remember you telling me your should have aborted me. I remember calling you a whore. I can't remember much else except us, yelling at each other. Us yelling at each other woke up our step dad. What happened after is a little fuzzy in my head but I clearly remember you pushing him so violently that he fell on his ass. This was the last night I stayed at your place. 


You contacted me sometime later. You apologized, promised that you would become a better person. We both admitted our faults (and I have many) and slowly, we started builing a realationship. 

Over the past 8 years, we had many fights. Fights over the fact that I followed a sound engineering class and that I am only doing my internship now after finishing my final exam 4 years ago. 
Fights over me going back to school. Even if I told you countless times that I will do it, even if I told you countless times to stop talking about it because we always keep fighting over the subject, you fucking kept mentioning it. (One time it made me leave your place on Mother's Day)

Fights over stupid shit like how one time,  during a trip in New York I said something about a story of how mcdonald's coffee is brewed at a higher temperature and you started calling me a liar and that I sometimes invent bullshit in the hopes of recieving attention. 

Fights over what I want to do with my hair; I don't fucking care that you think dreads aren't ""cool anymore"" I wanna get them. 


Everytime we had a huge fight, you bought my love and a way back into my life with gifts and broken promises. For a reason I can't find, I accepted them maybe in the hopes that we would finally get a cool realationship. A realation that I sabotaged a few times as well. I've stolen money that you were supposed to give me from you. I've lied about why I didn't want to comeover to your place. 

Now, we are both looking into driving lessons for me that you said you will pay but that I know you will drop out along the way like so many times in the past. 
Maybe I am stupid to accept another one of your pathetic attempts at love but the way I see it, in a little more of a year of driving lessons, I will be free. I will be able to go back to school in a field that you won't approve of but I don't fucking care, I'll be 3 hours away. I'll be free of the public transit system, and I'll finally be able to apply to most jobs that are related to sound engineering and sound design. 

You can be so fucking hypocritical and manipulative at times but this is who you are and I guess there is nothing I can do to change that. 

I never asked for much. All I care about is your acceptance and your love. 

I'm starting to think it's too much to ask.

22o05b,3,2014-04-09,SFA tips from an alumnus.,elchicodelgado,sfasu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sfasu/comments/22o05b/sfa_tips_from_an_alumnus/,"/u/Snekcip asked me for tips about going to SFA in another post so I figured I'd just make a new thread. Full disclosure, I graduated in 2005 so I haven't been in school for 9 years or half a lifetime for the freshman out there. Given that don't be surprised if my thoughts are dated. Some thoughts are SFA specific and some are general college so, here it goes.

**Stick it out**-If you're from a big city then Nac might be a shock. I'm from Dallas so the town was suffocatingly small at first and I wanted to leave my first semester. Many felt that way but don't do it and don't check out mentally right away. Give it two semesters and you'll love the place. 

**Get outside**-Nac is so freaking beautiful and I squandered my time way too much. Go out, fish, play disc golf, shoot along the Angelina river bottoms (if you live off campus and can have a gun…). Seriously, take up outdoor hobbies. I played a lot of disc golf to get out but I could have done so much more. 

**Food**-Eat at Szechuan. Seriously, it's good. I worked there for four years and I still love it. Get lunch to go. It's cheap and they serve the lunch menu on the weekend. That's a do. Here's a don't… Don't eat four big meals a day. When I was there we had a pizza hut between 14 &amp; 16 that stayed open till midnight. Not sure if that's still there but I didn't need wings every night as a fourth meal and you won't need whatever BS you want to eat at 11 pm on a Tuesday… Do take advantage of your meal plan if you have it. You paid for the meals so why spend a ton eating out? Go now and again but don't throw money away. If they still serve the buttermilk pie in the cafeterias then do eat that. It was soooo good. 

**Entertaining yourself**-(no, not like that perverts). Do use the facilities on campus. When I went to school the facilities were god awful but I still used them. Don't you fools have a lazy river now? Seriously, the doubling of my tuition in 4 years paid for some really cool stuff on campus so don't be too cool to use them. Pro-tip, pick up racquetball. It's easy to play, hard to master, cheap and fun. Also, the freshman 15 doesn't stand a chance if you play that regularly. 

**Sports**-Go to the games now and again. I've been to more SFA Football games since college than when I was there and I regret that. They're fun and cheap. I don't mean stay in Lumberjack Alley and get drunk next to the game either. Go inside. I'm not advocating this but the if you have to drink then put a flask in the old boot. Don't drive though. Speaking of which…

**Housing**-Do enjoy the dorms and don't hate your roommate for no reason. If you can sleep regularly and he or she in't a total slob then you don't have to like them but not liking them doesn't make them a bad roommate. I didn't like my first one so I thought he was a bad roommate. Because of that I move my mattress across the hall and lived underneath a neighbors raised up bunks for a year. That was so effing stupid. Three guys in a shoebox with trash everywhere yet my roomie had his own place. Yeah, I showed him… So, not driving. I think most need to take a swim through Woodforest when they leave the dorms. It's cheap, shitty and close so you can walk to class. What more can you want???

**Maximize value**-Do take classes at Angelina college but not too many and not early. If you can barely get to campus by 8 then you're not driving your ass to Lufkin that early. Definitely take the harder classes there however. I could only muster a D in a class at SFA that was a pre-req for another so a D wouldn't suffice. I took it at Angelina, got a D and it simply transferred as passing so, boom, I moved on. Also, it's cheap cheap cheap down there. Take summer school classes at least one session but take ones that interest you. They are longer so pick something you don't hate but the vibe really is more laid back so it doesn't feel as stressful. Do use career resources on campus. I don't know what SFA has because I didn't use any of it. I landed ass backwards into a great career but it was luck. Now I work with interns at my company and I can't believe the lengths their schools go to in order to help them get jobs. Find out what SFA has and use it!

**Graduate**-I'm a lazy lazy man and I procrastinate but in my mind not graduating simply wasn't an option. I had way too much fun and didn't short change myself one bit but I knew I had to graduate and did it. Don't lose focus of the reason you're there. Have fun, drink too much at times, do dumb college crap, etc but don't forget why you're there. 

**Stick around on weekends**-Being a college town it becomes a ghost town on the weekends. Your first semester you'll go home instinctively on the weekends but don't do it all the time. Kick that habit early. Campus is really cool on a Saturday. It's so open and you can actually appreciate the prettiness of your school when you're wandering around without being stressed about class. Seriously, that's a beautiful school so enjoy it. If you don't think it is then take a swim through Commerce and look at A&amp;M Commerce. You'll be inspired by your school after that…

**Dump your high school girlfriend**-Especially if she's going to another… Nevermind, you're not going to do it. You'll be different for sure. Absolutely, you've got it all figured out like nobody before has. You'll see. Speaking of which, if you actually did figure it out and your buddy didn't then don't be a dick when he's all heartbroken. Trust me, you'll have a buddy that ""didn't see it coming"" so don't be a turd. You'll do something as dumb or dumber. 

**Don't drink underage at bars and take it easy at house parties**-Look, you shouldn't drink either place until 21 but I'm not dumb. That said, they do stings at bars and you will get an MIP, that's not good. SFA was really house party centric when I was there and I know you'll go but take it easy and *don't drive*! College students are 95% good and 5% predators. Don't get too inebriated to know the difference and when in doubt, leave. Just leave right away. There will always be another party but you may lose something you can't get back if you're dumb. 

**Don't drink and drive**-My best friend in college was such a smart guy but he drank, drove and drank while driving. He had big plans to be a firefighter but his junior year he rolled his truck, blew a .11 (that's barely illegal but it doesn't matter!) and now he stocks product at a warehouse. Just don't do it. 

**Don't get the stupid credit card**-Fine, you'll get one but just one please. Also, the $500 limit they give you at first will balloon quickly. Don't max it out. Seriously don't.

**Find scholarships**-That is free friggen money!!!! I got like $2k without trying hard and not being ranked in the top 30% of my class. Had I applied myself who knows what I'd have gotten.



Those are my thoughts for now and I'm speaking to a non-existent audience in this little traveled sub but if anyone stumbles across this post then feel free to PM me if you want to ask questions.

22of95,3,2014-04-10,Redundancy in SCCM 2012 R2,[deleted],SCCM,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/22of95/redundancy_in_sccm_2012_r2/,"Hi

I am documenting a SCCM setup for my internship and I keep on getting questions what kind of redundancy measures are possible in SCCM. Since my knowledge about SCCM is limited to what I've found on the internet and Microsoft course books, I am turning to you guys to provide me with some leads.

My setup consists of a stand-alone primary site with an external SCCM and WSUS database that is hosted on 2 separate SQL Server named instances on a SQL cluster. I have also implemented an extra server in the DMZ that hosts an extra MP and DP on HTTPS (since the company mostly has external consultants that connect to the domain through internet).

I know it is possible to provide an extra SMS provider at the cost of extra network load on the SQL cluster but since I only have 1 CfgMgr site it would be useless.

I have read that the very concept of SCCM does not require redundancy but I have not found meaningful reasons that I can reproduce in my documentation. Can anyone provide me with some insight on this?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks"

I had some happy success testing each of these out today (but that might just be because the decks I faced were quite broken), but I feel some improvements could be made.

My primary concerns are:

* Gabe: The mixture of hardware might be a bit excessive. E3 did work for me with knight and against HB ice, but I could be persuaded that the slot is better spent elsewhere - similarly for Replicator and its influence.
* Jinteki: I am quite enamoured with RP/sundew/encryptiion protocol/ichi working together, the whole deck worked well to create some taxing centrals and a really painful remote. Neural katana is the only piece of ice I don't like (stops being taxing as soon as mimic comes out), but there is precious little else in faction. Power shutdown can be nice, but with only interns to recover agendas I can see it backfiring.

Are there any improvements you guys could make? As a relatively new player, I would also be interested in hearing some overall strategies to go with these decklists - what to mull for, general gameplans and so forth.

I have never really cared for the way my hair looks, up until recently. First I started working out and losing weight (lost about 20kg, or roughly 40 pounds), later I started following MFA. And at last I also thought it would be smart to visit here, and ask you guys for some help. I'll follow the list from the sidebar (if it applies of course), so here it goes:

1. [ My album](http://imgur.com/a/FMAxl) 
1. At the moment i'm busy with my internship (as part of graduating the university of applied science) and I'm not really bound by anything too formal. The way i'd like is nothing too formal or too casual, something in between. The people I work with are mostly IT-folk and well in their 30's or 40's.
1. I prefer my hair shorter side (shorter than I have now at least). With, preferably, having to spend little time on every day (I have to travel about 1 hour and 15 minutes to work by public transit)
1. Examples of styles I like (even if they might not really suit my head-shape) are: [This](http://i.imgur.com/LzrvxlE.jpg) , [this](http://i.imgur.com/gQONmA2.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/6JmweAL.jpg)

22pryh,1,2014-04-10,[Seeking] College student looking for a new opportunity,[deleted],SFBayJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayJobs/comments/22pryh/seeking_college_student_looking_for_a_new/,"Hello all, 

I was actually able to get my current job in retail from /r/SFBayJobs, and I've been working there for over a year now. However, I think it is time for a new opportunity as this job probably will not allow me to gain any more usable experience (I don't want to come off as whiny, I'm very grateful for the job, I just think its time for a new opportunity). The job, also, has gotten very repetitive, almost too repetitive. 


Anyways, I'm a 19 year old guy going to SF state right now (going to be a sophomore next semester) majoring in information systems, but have been thinking about switching to urban planning. Other than that, I have not really explored any possible internships yet as I am considering the major change, but I will explore some internship opportunities over the summer and next semester.


Another reason I need an actual job over an internship is because I live on my own (stupid choice?). Luckily, financial aid has been covering my ass (for now, at least). 

As for work experience, I'm pretty much settled in with the normal job responsibilities in retail (cashiering, merchandising, stocking, customer service), and I've been doing that for over a year. Other than that, I've also had experience working in a Japanese food shop in Honolulu, Hawaii (where I'm from) for about 6 months. I didn't do much cooking, more food preparation and cleaning. 


Like most if not all college students nowadays, I would say I have above average experience with computers and technology, and the introductory courses I've taken so far for ISYS have allowed me to gain some knowledge about networking. I've been really into building PCs, I've build 2 PCs from scratch for my brother and his friend in the past, and I try to help my friends with their PC problems when they arise. 


Talking about my personality now I suppose, I would say I find difficulty creating conversation with others (my customer service skills have kind of sucked in my current job, to be honest), but I try to help others as much as I can, provided I know what I'm doing. I feel like I would flourish in a clerical or office kind of position, but I'm always willing to step out of my boundaries. 

As of now, I'm vigorously searching through Craigslist and the student employment website for SFSU. Ideally, I'd like to have new employment near the end of this semester, so that I can fully devote myself to training over the summer. 

Sorry for the big block of text, I just thought I'd describe my situation in full detail, considering that previous post on this subreddit :P 

Thank you to anyone who reads this entirely! "

If I enlisted in the Marines and did 4 years+, would that hurt my chances of becoming a police officer at all?  I am planning to do an internship as a part of my degree.  Would the fact that I'd have 4 years plus separation from the time of graduation/internship to applying for jobs?

Let me know if I need to be more clear, thanks."

I have an unpaid internship right now at a fairly reputable advertising agency and am currently going in the direction of brand strategy/ account management. 


I haven't applied for any jobs yet and I'm starting to get really nervous about post-graduation plans. 

Can anyone help me out? I have a few questions: 

* What are the major differences between working in marketing strategy for a company vs. working at an ad agency? 
* I have a very good GPA but little experience besides this internship. Can you recommend a good entry level position that could lead me to a brand management position? 
* I just want any advice in general! I feel so unprepared and I'm scared!

I am an engineer, not a hiring manager. I don't even really know how Boeing HR works. Please do not send me your resume', please do not tell me all about how you did great in school and have experience with X Y and Z; I can't really help you beyond what I say below. (I just thought I'd pass on the good news about a bunch of job openings and the links for applying to some of them. My links are for entry-level engineering jobs. If what you want is internships, non-entry-level jobs for people with more experience, and/or non-engineering jobs, then you'll have to go run your own search. The steps are the bullet points near the bottom).

Also, I do not know any more information than what I say below. (Such as: “Will Boeing be taking interns?” I don't know: Do a search on the Boeing ""jobs"" website and find out! “Are there any openings for X Y or Z?”. I don’t know, do a search and find out!) Still, I believe that the following information is a really valuable heads-up for anyone who thinks they might want to work at Boeing (an employer that I would highly recommend).

Boeing has just announced that it will move nearly all of [Commercial Aviation Services](http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/aviationservices/fleet-services) (“CAS”, also known as “Fleet Support” and “Service Engineering”) to the Long Beach and Seal Beach sites.

These aren't ***all*** engineering jobs, at least I wouldn't think so. They will also need people to do all kinds of things like HR, legal work, logistics, etc.

However, I think that most of the jobs are engineering. So I did some searches on Boeing's jobs website and found the following. So here are the links for some of the entry-level engineering jobs. (I also threw in some links to the Boeing Satellite Development Center in El Segundo, which is across the street from LAX).

I saw about a month ago there was a posting involving an IT related  job (specifically [this one about an IT third level support position](http://www.reddit.com/r/centralmich/comments/1z47k5/anyone_wellversed_in_it_it_department_is_looking/)). 

There's a branch of TechOps that is looking for someone with general computer support skills (like those in ITC 190 and 191) to work starting this summer for a longer-term position (as in, multiple semesters). You can also use parts of the work experience as credit toward one of the IT/CS internships.

If anyone is interested, PM me and I'll pass along contact information for the hiring manager."
22q8i3,1,2014-04-10,I'm a [25/f] married for one year [26/m] wanting advice re: my feelings about a topic.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/22q8i3/im_a_25f_married_for_one_year_26m_wanting_advice/,"Ok, so my husband and myself are just hitting our 1 year mark. We have been together for a total of 6 years, some years better than others, but this past year had been the best yet in terms of growth with each other. We have a great sex life, we are best friends, have our own hobbies, and have a great marriage thus far. However, recently an issue has come up and I want to make sure I am not over-reacting/ nip this in a bud before it has the potential to cause real damage. My motto is trying to prevent a “buildup of emotions.”

Prior to getting married he made-out with some girl when he was drunk while I was at an internship (making us many states apart). I decided to forgive him, mostly because I really respect him and I understand people make mistakes (not that it is ok to do). We had a nice understanding that we can forgive and not forget, and if I needed to talk in the future for reassurance (not to hold it against him) he would be there and willing to listen. I never bring it up, never get jealous, never treat him badly or blow up arguments into talking about that event....I made the decision to forgive and that is what I intend to do. 

The problem is, recently I have been feeling annoyed with his behavior. On 3-4 occasions I have caught him staring, rather intensely, at females he finds to be attractive. I don't care if he finds others attractive--hell I find other guys to be attractive all the time and I think that is normal. What bothers me is if we are at dinner for instance, and he is staring at a cute waitress to the extent he is not even engaged in our conversation and others notice. Or we are at the grocery store and he stares at someone the whole time and turns around to check her out. Honestly, it is rather embarrassing. 

I told him that it is ok to find others attractive and look, however when it is literally non-stop staring/ checking out I get frustrated. I think my feelings are hurt more than anything. I work hard to forgive and make sure I do not use those past feelings to make him feel bad, however I find his behavior to be disrespectful. I told him how I felt, and he says he “compulsively” looks and then when he notices I saw him look he stares almost uncontrollably. Basically he knows he shouldn’t “look” and that drives a compulsive-like behavior. This makes no sense to me because 1. I said he can look---just don’t be so damn obvious/ hurtful towards me and 2. He is aware of his behavior. 

Maybe I am being sensitive because he is about to start graduate school (a short 12-month program) where we will have to live apart during the week. Maybe feelings are re-surfacing? I need advice. I am trying to be upfront and communicate well but I don’t want him to feel like I can’t trust him or something. Sorry this is long and I hope it makes sense.

TL;DR: My husband and I have a happy marriage but a problem recently came up. In the past prior to marriage (while we on a distance relationship) he made out with a girl while drunk, I forgave. Now recently he has intensely stared at/checked out attractive women around me and I feel hurt. We will soon be spending the week days apart because he is starting graduate school. Am I over-reacting?

I'm 21, female and in my final year of my degree in music tech. I have mediocre grades through my course because I simply have had no real interest in my degree. 

I'm coming up to the final stretch of my degree, just a few more weeks and then I'll never have to worry about another assignment again! But wait, what then? I have a part time job in a cinema, that's cool, I can do that full time and maybe work up the ranks and maybe become manager? Thats cool right? I mean I like my friends there and it's a decent enough job.
 
But then there's the pressure. No says everyone. You should follow your dreams. ""What are your interests?"" Ok well I like reading, gaming redditing, I'm pretty nerdy and thats cool. ""Well why don't you get a job in that?"" People tell me. Well because it's not that easy, I have virtually no skills in programming (did a couple of modules of it. Hated it.) So thats out the window, I have no skills in composing or real world experience to go with my music tech degree. Plus I don't really want a job to do with my degree ie studio music stuff.

So then my mother tells me ""oh I just met a girl at a friends birthday party, she's a voice actor in gaming and all that kind of nerdy stuff, I added her as a friend on facebook, I told her about you and you should talk to her about getting into the industry.""
""but I don't want to get into the industry, you know that""
""Yes well, you don't know that, you probably don't know enough about the industry to say, she could help you""
By this point I'm getting upset in the conversation, I hate having to talk to random strangers, it's not like shes going to give me a job straight up and there definitely people more qualified than me. 

So I talk to her via facebook, she's nice enough and she gives me some links about women in the gaming industry, talks to me about what I'm interested in and tells me to look into internships. All in all, friendly lady. I only talked to her so as to appease my mother about the whole situation.

Well thats a sort of summary of it, I don't know where to turn to, my self esteem is really bad, I tried being a booktuber for a while and I enjoyed it but I lost hope in myself and stopped.

 I don't know what to do with myself, what is the right thing to do? When I think about it to much it just gets to much and I cry a lot so I normally bottle it up and move on. What's right for me?"

22qxfx,1,2014-04-10,Disney World Job Application?,[deleted],disney,https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/22qxfx/disney_world_job_application/,"Howdy! Well, I'm not sure if this is the most correct place for the post, but I figured it's a start. I'm most interested in becoming an employee of the Walt Disney World company, and as such, am here to ask several questions to any and all current or previous employees/cast members, visitors, veterans, witches, wizards, ducks, or mice of the aforementioned company known as ""The Happiest Place on Earth."" I'm a senior in college and have been to several of the job fairs that Disney has been a part of on campus, as well as gone in person to the Casting center to gain more information. My issue? Everything seems to be of such a large variety that I'm unable to figure out exactly what to do or where to go! 

Let me start at the beginning, I'm studying Information Technology, yet am not looking for an internship. I've worked throughout my college years in my field, so I have a peak over 4 years of experience in customer service, technical support, and the likes. When I went into the Casting office, they gave me a little job information card and told me to apply online. Is this normal? I had actually talked to a cast member that told me to go over there in person and made it sound very easy to be informed. So you may understand my surprise when I was not even given a handshake, but a small card and a very curt, ""Thank you, have a nice day."" from the man behind the desk. 

Now, I'll go further into my debacle. I've always dreamed of working at Disney and making magic for people visiting from all over the world. So much so, that I'm willing to relocate to the area from where I am currently living. (Georgia to Florida, not too far!) And I have several plans that I'm thinking of putting into effect in order to make this happen. First option, apply for a career position with my resume and hope I get the job right off the bat. Second, get a smaller, part-time job whilst finishing my degree, and then after graduation, Fall 2014, attempt to apply for the higher position within.

I've looked on all of the sites that were provided and have found several positions I'm interested in applying for quite soon. Here are my main questions:

* What is the hiring experience like? Are interviews professional? Friendly? How long does it typically take to be considered/hired?
* How many interviews are normal at a company like this?
* Are there any other previous/current cast members that are willing to network or give information on what type of I.T jobs there are at Disney? (The descriptions are broad and somewhat vague.)
* Is there anything I can do to increase/keep from decreasing my chances of being hired?
* Any general tips or tricks of the trade to appear what they're looking for in a cast member? (I'm a bit shaggy haired, and have a small beard, both of which I am willing to turn ship shape in order to match my professional persona.)
* Should I do the wise thing to not relocate until I have the job in hand? Or would it be best to be looking for places? 

I appreciate any and all comments, and hope I have posted in the correct place! My most optimal and hopeful outcome is to be able to have this happen sooner rather than later, hence this post. "

As you know, the academic year is about to end and everyone is applying for internships/jobs right now.  I've applied to a couple of cyber security internships and I want to begin preparing for interviews.  So I'm wondering, what are some good resources I can use to keep myself up to date with cyber security/vulnerabilities? I know reddit sometimes has articles about vulnerabilities (Heartbleed) but I want to learn more and more in depth.

A bit about me:

This past year, I've studied and earned my CCNA and JNCIA-Junos.  I have a bit of experience with BackTrack 3, cisco packet tracer and GNS3.  I'm brushing up on my CCNA materials as I haven't touched it since my networking class a semester ago.  I figure knowing OSI model, http/https, and such would definitely help in my interview process.  

Any advice, r/networking? "

---

-------

**New Today**

* With the bastion config pretty much ready from what I understand I think we can roll out at will, so bastions will be going online some time in the next couple of days, since I actually have free time. 

* RealisitcBiomes continues to choke on its config for some reason, I will have to email a copy of the error and the config to the dev group, for some reason it seems my github does not have issues enabled and I don't want to dig around in that this morning. 

* I would really like to get some advertising in, we might just have to ignore our version behind situation while I have time to do an advertising run, its really just not going to be feasible to wait. 

* [The Humbug fix](https://github.com/erocs/Humbug/issues/67) issue still need to be patched. 

* I should probably start looking into internships for next summer. 

-----------------------

**Ongoing Subjects**

* It looks like the latest testing factorymod.jar keeps loading its own config out of the .jar instead of accepting the ones we give it, so we should probably get a new compilation with that fixed and then double check the config for yml issues. Once again this is pretty much whats holding back 1.7.5, I might just go ahead anyways without bastion if its not ready soon.  


* Current status of plugins that I would like to get online, all in one quick bullet:

 *   [Bastion](https://github.com/spaceFountain/Bastion) Thanks to Waffle for reviewing the .jar, the updates are in testing and all we need to sort out is production setup and radius. 
  * [FactoryMod](https://github.com/ttk2/FactoryMod) needs the BastionBlock factory, plus a serious decrease in printingpress costs. 

* The new ticket system is now pretty much ready for testing, if someone could please start sending plugin issues and non-sensitive modmail issues to this email just to test it out that would be great jira@civcraft.atlassian.net

22s2l3,1,2014-04-11,I'm stuck and can't move forward.,atsuatsu,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/22s2l3/im_stuck_and_cant_move_forward/,"Reddit, I need your help. I'm stuck in a rut and just don't know how to move forward. I feel like I've been stuck in this position for a few years and I don't know what I'll do if I don't move forward soon. It's killing me inside - the frustration, the anger, and the sad desperation. If you'd like some back-story, please read on. Otherwise, please tell me - how do you get yourself out of a rut? I feel like I can't even separate the 'me' who knows I'm stuck and the 'me' who's making me stuck (if that makes sense). As a result, I'm quite anxious a lot of the time and fast running out of stamina. I don't know how long I can keep this up.  

Back-story; Or 'Why I'm writing this now' 

I don't really know where to begin and I'm not particularly articulate at the best of times so I apologise if this is a little incoherent. I just need to get the words down and then I'll summarise them in a more lucid tl;dr afterwards. 

Let me begin by saying that I'm gay. It's been a long, very difficult journey to get to the point where I can say that. In fact, I'm 23 and only coming to grips with it now - despite not living in a part of the world (Australia) where homosexuality is particularly stigmatized.

A couple of years ago (almost two), I dated a guy called Michael. He was my first 'boyfriend' and I really wanted things to work. At the time, I was living out of home, had plenty of privacy, and was excited to finally - *finally* - make use of the freedom I had moved out of home in order to obtain. I thought that maybe I would become more comfortable with myself, I guess, and vanquish the anxiety and intense self-loathing that pervaded my adolescence. 

Well, perhaps I was expecting too much. I was needy and moody and not nearly as ready as I thought I was. The basic problem was that I found it impossible to expose myself emotionally . And I liked Michael - I liked him a hell of a lot.

We broke up after almost a year and I remember - quite vividly - the sudden and painful clarity with which I understood the nature of our relationship at the same moment that it ended. *Of course* he finds me overbearing, I thought, my god - how didn't I realise? And then something very strange happened - I fell in love with Michael. For the first time. I was experiencing love for him despite the fact that our relationship was over. The timing was awful. After a while, I kind of pushed it out of my mind. I dated a few other guys and, although nothing very meaningful came of it, I did enjoy myself a little. 

We remained very close friends and had several conversations in which he emphasized his wish never to date again. I respected that. I should say that he's only just moved out of his very conservative home - a home that made it more or less impossible to be with men. 

Fast forward to now. A lot has happened. I finished a degree that's practically worthless (I studied a language that I still can't really speak and it's not going to help me find a job). I move into the bottom of my grandmother's house to save money and... I've more or less failed to save any money at all. I've fought off depression, relapsed, recovered, relapsed, recovered... you know how it goes. At the moment I'm doing 'okay' - but 'okay' isn't particularly impressive. It's a mood in which I can get by but hardly a mood in which I'm 'flourishing'. 

Today I found out that Michael, who just moved out, has started sleeping with other guys. I want to emphasise that I think this is *great*. I'm not angry that he's doing this and nor am I so hypocritical as to think he shouldn't be. But when I found out - almost by accident - I realised that I still loved him. 

You still love him, said my brain. 
Fuck. What the fuck., I replied. 

I immediately wanted to cry. How could I have suppressed that knowledge for so long? And then the floodgates opened. How is it that Michael has moved out of home and finished his law degree and gotten an internship and started dating people and received a highly paid job while I basically *haven't changed* in a year. I'm not progressing. I'm not doing anything. I'm just treading water. All my wonderful friends (including Michael) - friends whose success I celebrate and don't resent at all - are doing terrific things. And I? I'm just... wasting away. 

I'm sick of hating myself. I'm really sick of being in the same goddamn spot. I just want to feel like I have the ability to achieve things. As it is, I'm taking things day by day. I'm terrified that in a year's time I'll still be the same person instead of somebody new and interesting and excited to be alive. 

This just isn't working for me.

tl;dr I feel like I haven't changed in any way for almost two years. I'm not doing anything with my life and sick of being stuck in a rut. "
22seks,3,2014-04-11,I (22F) am worried about my relationship of 1 year and 10 months with my boyfriend (21) who is leaving for boot camp,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22seks/i_22f_am_worried_about_my_relationship_of_1_year/,"So for the first year of dating, my boyfriend and I had next to no issues. We rarely fought and got along great. We met at a party and spent our first summer together going a little too crazy. But we chalk it up to immaturity and new excitement in our relationship and we have grown together since then. I have more dating and sexual experience than him seeing as I was his first girlfriend and first constant sexual partner. But it never really bothered me, I was attracted to his personality and sense of humor. We really clicked and seemed to understand each other in a way I've never felt with anybody else from early on.

By the end of our second summer together (9 months ago), he expressed a great interest in joining the military. I was of course fully supportive of him because of how respectful a decision like that is. I was also at the time thinking about joining the peace corps after college so we both shared these dreams of traveling and doing what we could in the world. We were excited for each other but of course wanted to stay together. 

Last August, I unfortunately made the biggest mistake of my life. I was 21 at the time and he was 20, so when I went out to bars with my friends and coworkers, he couldn't come. This raised suspicions and jealousy in him that I knew was understandable but I never thought would lead to be true. 

One night when hanging out with some coworkers of mine, I got way too drunk and was dancing with them in a sort of circle like friends do. I remember a coworker, who I knew kind of had a crush on me, coming up next to me. I was just dancing and laughing but I remember the look he gave me when he leaned in towards me.  I was stupid drunk so it is a blur but I remember that we kissed. I also remember feeling terrible about it and trying to leave the bar immediately. One of my girl friends followed me and offered to take me home since I couldn't drive. I was so upset and ashamed that I broke up with my boyfriend the next day saying that I didn't deserve him and coming clean with what I remembered. 

Needless to say he was crushed and lost all trust and respect for me. For a few weeks we didn't see each other but of course I tried to reach out to him since I loved him and really wanted another chance. I knew that I could prove I wasn't the bitch I had acted like, and it was going to start with me not getting that drunk because of how  much it inhibited my judgement. This was the first guy in my life who had fully respected me and loved me for exactly who I am and I go out and betray him. Not only had I betrayed my boyfriend but I had betrayed my best friend.

So after weeks of talking, we finally decided to get together for coffee and discuss things. He said that he still loved me but didn't feel the same way that he used to. But he was willing to try to build up trust again with me and to build us up to the strength we had in our relationship before I acted like a dumbass.

I was so grateful for the second chance he gave me and since then (about 7 and a half months), I have not taken it for granted. I never once texted or talked to my coworker except for essential things during work, and stopped going to bars without my boyfriend. I have tried my best to make him feel loved and special by doing all sorts of things for him. I take him places, take us to concerts, make him dinner, plan surprises etc. I also validate his feelings of betrayal and have tried to show him how ashamed and remorseful I am. It really changed the way I thought about myself. 

For a while things started to return to normal. He was busy training for the marines, I was busy with college and an internship. We were happy. Recently (about a month ago) we even talked more seriously about having a future together. He even switched from active duty to the reserves so that he would be away for about a year and a half instead of four or five so that we could be together and build a family one day.

However, just last week he called me while I was at school (I live at school during the week and kept my job an hour away by him on the weekends so we only see each other then). He told me that he had been thinking a lot and needed space. I was a little caught off guard since things had been going so well but I let him have it. He then called a few days ago and said that he had changed his mind back to being in active duty instead of the marines. I was so shocked but all I could say was that he needed to do what made him happy and that I would support him no matter what. But honestly I kind of felt like my emotions had been played with because I was really excited that he wanted to be in the reserves. Maybe it is for selfish reasons because I would only see him about 11 days a year if he was stationed somewhere else and that wasn't what I imagined my love life would be like. But he made it clear that he really just wants to travel and see the world which leaves me wondering where I would fit in. I have huge plans for myself too though. I now plan to attend grad school out of state and start building my dream career. But I can't help but feel like I care a little more about what is going to happen to us than he does.

Upon more discussion, he then confessed to me that it has been really hard for him to get over the fact that I kissed another guy while we were together. He even said that he feels like he still doesn't care as much as he used to and that he feels like I'm putting in a lot more effort than he is in our relationship. I asked if it had anything to do with his decision to switch back to active duty and he said no but I have a feeling it is. But literally in the same conversation he says he still loves me and wants to try to work it out. He just wants to know how he can get over it if none of my efforts are working 100%. So this left me with conflicted feelings of whether I should really be trying this hard for somebody who really still isn't sure about me and of what I could do to make his doubts go away. Just last night I traveled home to visit him during the school week to take him out to dinner. We had a great time and it was as if nothing was wrong. He just changes his mind a lot and I feel myself waking up and wondering if he is going to feel good about us or if he isn't. At the same time I feel like I deserve this indecision because of what happened. Even though we both decided to get back together and work things out, it keeps being brought up which makes me also feel like we can't get over it. When it happens I just let him vent and then try to make him feel better or prove my love and devotion to only him. But it seems like a never ending cycle which he says makes him feel like he doesn't have a lot of hope for our future.

I love this man more than I've ever loved anybody and I will work my ass off until the day I die proving it to him if I have to. I know that's a little dramatic. But I really don't want to lose him. This is all making me nervous too because his ship date is this August and I know things won't get better just because we have distance between us. We have all these plans for our last summer together before he goes away and then he brings up these feelings he's been having. I don't know what to do.

Sorry for all the text, if you read it all and have some advice to give me it would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.

tl;dr; Boyfriend and I got back together after cheating, things got back to normal, he is leaving for marines soon and started having doubts about us.

Edit: The first night we met, he and I actually had a threesome with one of his childhood friends... I am also bisexual and he has seen me kiss 3 of my girl friends (with permission). We have also three way kissed with two of his guy friends. And once when we were in one of these guy friends' bed, he asked me to give him a blow job then give his friend a blow job too. We're kind of...unconventional. "

22sq5i,78,2014-04-11,The ham and the city.,hipstersonhipsters,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/22sq5i/the_ham_and_the_city/,"Typing this on my phone so I apologize for any mistakes! 

Loved that you guys appreciated my last story. I have a ton more from my fast food days from my Midwest days. In terms of my New York life after living here for going on 5 years now you meet a lot of different people. I have a group of friends from my undergrad days that I hang out with maybe once a month. They're the kind of people you hang out with if you want to have a ""sex and the city"" sort of night: expensive clothes, expensive restaurants with tiny little portions, champagne at the table, bottle service at clubs that Miley hangs out at. I'm not saying that these people are my close friends or people I'll have long term relationships with, but it's NYC! It's okay to have fun. 99% of the time I live extremely frugally cause poor. I save up money to go out with these people so this doesn't represent my daily life at all. 

Here are the players: 

&gt; be me: 5 foot flat, 120, I work at a bakery in bk, I intern at galleries, applying to grad school for curation, had an eating disorder when I was 16, still have a lot of food issues that I don't talk about.

&gt; don't be trustfundmoon: 5'11, 300 pounds at least, writer at a fairly popular magazine, VERY flamboyantly gay, trust fund baby, his Instagram ""about me"" was ""and on the 7th day God created Berkin"". He owns several. I go way back with him and I consider him a good friend because outside of his outrageous public persona he's a good person. His fat logic hurts me though. It's complicated. 

The setting: restaurant in Chelsea. We're getting dinner. 10 pm. 

&gt; trustfundmoon: blahblahblahshopping blahblahblahblahworkstuff

&gt; me: Blahblahblahpretendingtobeinterested 

&gt; trustfundmoon: okay so you're getting the chicken, I'm doing the duck, let's get an order of steak for the table?

&gt; me: oh I don't need it, it's a 30 dollar cut and I'm already ordering the cheapest thing off the menu. 

&gt; trustfundmoon: But it's so LUXURIOUS to order the steak for the table here. It's fine, I'm on a diet anyways.  

Note: he says that to me as he takes a bite of his Cobb salad in which he asked for extra ranch on the side in addition to the regular dressing. 

&gt; me: yeah? How's that going for you?

&gt; trustfundmoon: I'm basically anorexic at this point! Waiter? Yeah I want the duck and the order of the steak for the table and she need the chicken. 

Waiter walks away. I've known him for long enough to know that he goes on these ""diets"" every couple months. Every time he claims he's anorexic and every time it hurts me a little more. I had anorexia in high school and I've never been open with it even with my parents who were fairly unaware. I was a pretty fat kid/teenager so when I lost 50 pounds down to 89 pounds people just thought I was a success story. Being so small it didn't look terrible, I just looked petite. I put myself into recovery when I went to college and did it all by myself. Trustfundmoon on the other hand, doesn't have nor never has had anorexia. If you talk to him for long enough you'll actually find out he's a little delusional about how large he actually is. He probably thinks he weighs a decent 100 pounds less. On that duality, he thinks everyone is maybe 50 pounds heavier. 

&gt; me: why did you order the steak? I told you I didn't want it! 

&gt; trustfundmoon: I need the protein! This restaurant is amazing. Let's get another cocktail?

&gt; me: no I was just going to get a glass of wine. 

&gt; trustfundmoon: wine is SO high in calories!

&gt; me: why do you say that? I feel like it's just as bad as this ginger, champagne, orange thing?

&gt; trustfundmoon : well honey, you DONT need it. I switched to non fat milk at Starbucks, diet soda in my drinks, went to yoga and I deserve everything at this dinner. You on the other hand look more... Thick than usual, you go up to a 6 honey? 

&gt; me: how can you say that to me?

&gt; trustfundmoon: I can say that to you because even with my various conditions and the fact that I need to eat every two hours I manage to be perfectly healthy even though I'm bigger and I'm making an effort to get skinny. You on the other hand are probably just as heavy as myself and you've never made an effort.  

&gt; me: do you hear yourself? You cannot actually be serious. I wear a size 2. You've been wearing those designer sweatpants from Opening Ceremony for like literally 5 years now. Do you own anything other than like 7 pairs of 500 dollar sweatpants?!??

&gt; trustfundmoon : don't even dare talk to me like that when you're wearing Zara. You're trash and you know it. 

I immediately got up from the table and left. Apparently according to some random acquaintances that were at the restaurant he accepted all the food that he had ordered, in addition to my food, and ate most all of it, and left.

22sqwa,24,2014-04-11,Dancer: well done!,Amphrael,perl,https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/22sqwa/dancer_well_done/,"Wanted to send some love to the Dancer team. Their Perl web framework was incredible easy to get install, configure, code for, and execute. I haven't really done anything with Perl since my internship days back in 2003. I was very impressed with how easy and straightforward it was to get basic web serving, HTML templating, and database connectivity set up. Within only spending an hour or two a day, I had a functioning web app up and running in less than a week.

My only complaint so far is that some of the documentation and tutorials are lacking. I admit some fault in my lack of understanding since I did not read everything before I started hacking. My major hurdle occured when I did not realize that the Template::Simple module that Dancer enables by default did not support processing listrefs and hashrefs in the HTML template (you need to enable TemplateToolkit for that).

I plan to document my learnings and post in an appropriate manor. I've never written a POD or contributed to CPAN before, but now is a good time to learn.

Glad to see Perl is **far** from dead!"

I am 21 year old Canadian student studying Computer Science and I'm coming to the bay area for an 8 month internship. My company's office is in the financial district so the closer the better but I don't mind living a little bit farther out. I start work on May 5th and end on Dec 19th.

Depending on the neighborhood of the place I'm willing to pay +/- $2000. I'm flying in May so I can't take a look in person until then, though I may have someone else take a look for me in late April possibly. Thanks."

I'm a rising senior studying advertising, and I've got two main internships I'm looking at. 
One is a big name NYC ad agency. Been around a long time and is close to the top. I'd be a creative in their internship program and would make $10/hr, with overtime, so around 400/450 a week. 
The other is a promising NY SaaS startup. They have some big name clients in tech and social media, and are offering 800/week, though hours maybe be closer to 50/60. I'd be doing advertising/web/graphic design for them. 
Here's what I'm dealing with. My uncle got me a contact at the ad gig, so I feel like I'm partially oblige to take that job. That being said, I think I'd get more out of a start up in terms of what I'm able to actually work on. Also, I'm studying abroad in London this fall, so I'll have the chance to get an internship there (and the agency has offices in the UK that I could potentially work at). Also, the agency name is more recognizable. Also, I'm looking to travel a lot while abroad and the extra money would definitely help with that. 

TL;DR: Deciding between at big name NYC ad agency that would look good on a resume, or a Quickly growing start up that might not look as good but would offer a better experience. 

Any and all thoughts are greatly appreciated. I'll try to answer any questions I can without giving away PII. Thanks in advance. "
22tcta,0,2014-04-11,Looking for advice/perspective regarding my summer internship options.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/22tcta/looking_for_adviceperspective_regarding_my_summer/,"Quick background: Mature student, leaving another profession, finishing 2nd year in Accounting Major BCom program, entering Coop program next year (so over the next 2.5 years I'll be getting 1 year work experience), but this summer I'm pursing an internship/summer job to get my feet wet. Zero practical experience so far, only academic.


I applied for a few jobs, and interviewed for two for the summer. One with the local branch of the tax authority, and one with the University that I attend. Not *overly* concerned either way, I still have my job in my old profession as a guaranteed fallback, but here's my situation:


I have been made a *conditional* job offer by the tax office, in the audit division. This seems like a good opportunity, and it is conditional on the results of my security screening. While I can not perceive the screening disqualifying me from working for the federal government, I am not 100% sure what their criteria are and there is a level of uncertainty that I don't like about the conditional nature of the offer. In some quick searches, I've seen posts in forums about rescinded internship job offers before. Sounds as though the security screening is an extremely long process, usually back-logged, won't have a definite answer too soon, and job doesn't start for another month.  I should be receiving my conditional offer letter late next week.

Other job I just interviewed for is with the local University. Job is assistant in finance administration, working for an accountant, helping close projects, and investigating non-zero balance budgets. While they have not yet offered me a job, it's seems like a reasonable possibility, and they said they'd be making their decision early next week. I believe I did really well in the interview, and I'm the type to second-guess most of what I do, so I felt pretty good about it.
 

Anyways, I'm looking for some perspective. Basically, I have the conditional offer coming at me AFTER I'd get an offer from the university, if the offer is made. Obviously if the school doesn't offer me the job, the default position is to take the conditional offer from the tax authority, but I was wondering what you guys would do if the school job was offered? I *feel* as though the audit internship may look better on a resume and provide a better starting off work experience, but I'm not yet an accountant, and don't really know. Pay differential is negligible, one pays slightly more, but I'd end up spending the extra on a transit pass anyways.

So from your points of view, what is the better opportunity? Which one would probably give me a better experience, and look better to a future employer? If you were offered the Financial Administrative Assistant job, would you take it over the conditional offer for Audit with the federal tax authority? My current mindset suggests that I should take a concrete offer from the school (if it's made), the uncertainty of the other offer is kind of unsettling. Thoughts?"
22ty20,1,2014-04-11,I spent most of my life as an awkward tomboy. I really don't want to go through that shit again.,smootie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22ty20/i_spent_most_of_my_life_as_an_awkward_tomboy_i/,"Growing up, I was a tomboy, partly because I was into building tiger pits and watching WWF but partly because I didn't really know how to be feminine and didn't have the self-esteem to try.

Recebtly, I learned how to do my hair, put on makeup, and dress for my body type (thanks to many of the helpful subreddits here).  I finally became comfortable dressing like an adult woman, and just recently *finally* assembled a flattering wardrobe.

But then I landed a great library internship (yay!) that requires me to completely change the way I present myself.

I live in a tropical climate so it's hot as fuck and humid, too.  So my wardrobe is almost all tank tops (to keep cool), skinny jeans (to be modest while still rocking dat ass), and sandals.

It took me ages to figure all this shit out, to finally be confident in the way I looked.  And now I have to start *all over again*.

My library maintains a cold temperature to protect the collection so I have to dress for the cold, and we have to wear closed-toe shoes (for fear of falling tomes?).  I have no idea how to dress for that kind of climate while still looking stylish and being comfortable.

My coworkers don't wear makeup, polish their nails, or wear perfume. I like all of those things.  Everyone is much older than me and dresses very conservatively.  I want to fit in so I'm following their lead.  I just started and don't want to stand out in a bad way.

First world problems, I guess."

So, I turned 23 this year and it sucked. Every year since when I turned 20 has been getting consecutively worse. I did a couple 1-year long college programs to make myself employable and that's a bit better but I still don't feel very proud of myself. My parents are happy and they keep saying I should stick my nose to the grindstone and work like a slave for the next 5 years so I will be financially sound but  I want to do fun stuff too while I'm young. I've been busting my ass for the last 3 years with school and internships so my life has been very dull, I feel like I've wasted the last 3 years I have no good memories.


I was getting jealous of seeing all my friends on facebook affording vacations, and doing cool shit, and I avoided Facebook for over a year. I deactivated it while I was at school so I could concentrate on my classes.


I turned my facebook back on a few days ago because I'm done school and I'm working. It just reminded me of how unhappy I am and how much I miss my old friends but since I haven't kept in touch, they've moved on. I messaged a few of my closest friends and we talked a little and it was really nice but everyone is busy doing their own thing and I live alone in a new city.


I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I don't drink so I don't go to the bar to make friends, and I haven't been able to afford doing the activities I usually do (like skiing and hockey) so I haven't made new friends. I feel so alone and I'm really disappointed at how I've ended up at 23.


I have a really good summer job and it pays really well, so I'm hoping it will be enough to pay my debts and then maybe I can take next winter off so I can visit some old friends and so I can have fun again but I feel like I'm going to lose my marbles before that happens.


I wish I never turned off my facebook so my friends wouldn't think I deserted them. I wish I didn't live in this city but I'm stuck here until August. I wish I wasn't so upset at myself. 

I'm trying to keep busy, I'm trying to learn guitar, and I talk to my parents a lot, and I'm doing my best to eat well, sleep and exercise but I still feel down on myself.

Does anyone have any extra advice? 


---   
**tl;dr**: Feeling down after I turned off facebook and lost contact with a lot of friends while I was studying. I live in a boring city and I have to wait until the fall before I can do anything fun but I feel like I'm going to lose my mind before then after 3 years of nothingness I need some extra advice."

22u45m,2,2014-04-12,Please help me move on.,atsuatsu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/22u45m/please_help_me_move_on/,"Reddit, I need your help. I'm stuck in a rut and just don't know how to move forward. I feel like I've been stuck in this position for a few years and I don't know what I'll do if I don't move forward soon. It's killing me inside - the frustration, the anger, and the sad desperation. If you'd like some back-story, please read on. Otherwise, please tell me - how do you get yourself out of a rut? I feel like I can't even separate the 'me' who knows I'm stuck and the 'me' who's making me stuck (if that makes sense). As a result, I'm quite anxious a lot of the time and fast running out of stamina. I don't know how long I can keep this up.

Back-story; Or 'Why I'm writing this now'

I don't really know where to begin and I'm not particularly articulate at the best of times so I apologise if this is a little incoherent. I just need to get the words down and then I'll summarise them in a more lucid tl;dr afterwards.

Let me begin by saying that I'm gay. It's been a long, very difficult journey to get to the point where I can say that. In fact, I'm 23 and only coming to grips with it now - this despite living in a part of the world (Australia) where homosexuality is not particularly stigmatized.

A couple of years ago (almost two), I dated a guy called Michael. He was my first 'boyfriend' and I really wanted things to work. At the time, I was living out of home, had plenty of privacy, and was excited to finally - finally - make use of the freedom I had moved out of home in order to obtain. I thought that maybe I would become more comfortable with myself, I guess, and vanquish the anxiety and intense self-loathing that pervaded my adolescence.

Well, perhaps I was expecting too much. I was needy and moody and not nearly as ready as I thought I was. The basic problem was that I found it impossible to expose myself emotionally . And I liked Michael - I liked him a hell of a lot.

We broke up after almost a year and I remember - quite vividly - the sudden and painful clarity with which I understood the nature of our relationship at the same moment that it ended. Of course he finds me overbearing, I thought, my god - how didn't I realise? And then something very strange happened - I fell in love with Michael. For the first time. I was experiencing love for him despite the fact that our relationship was over. The timing was awful. After a while, I kind of pushed it out of my mind. I dated a few other guys and, although nothing very meaningful came of it, I did enjoy myself a little.

We remained very close friends and had several conversations in which he emphasized his wish never to date again. I respected that. I should say that he's only just moved out of his very conservative home - a home that made it more or less impossible to be with men.

Fast forward to now. A lot has happened. I finished a degree that's practically worthless (I studied a language that I still can't really speak and it's not going to help me find a job). I move into the bottom of my grandmother's house to save money and... I've more or less failed to save any money at all. I've fought off depression, relapsed, recovered, relapsed, recovered... you know how it goes. At the moment I'm doing 'okay' - but 'okay' isn't particularly impressive. It's a mood in which I can get by but hardly a mood in which I'm 'flourishing'.

Today I found out that Michael, who just moved out, has started sleeping with other guys. I want to emphasise that I think this is great. I'm not angry that he's doing this and nor am I so hypocritical as to think that he shouldn't be. But when I found out - almost by accident - I realised that I still loved him.

""You still love him,"" said my brain. 
""Fuck. What the fuck.,"" I replied.

I immediately wanted to cry. How could I have suppressed that knowledge for so long? How did I ever become so good at lying to myself and *believing* the lies? Do I even have the fainted idea of who I am and what I want? Then the floodgates opened. How is it that Michael has moved out of home and finished his law degree and gotten an internship and started dating people and received a highly paid job while I basically haven't changed in two years. I'm not progressing. I'm not doing anything. I'm just treading water. All my wonderful friends (including Michael) - friends whose success I celebrate and don't resent at all - are doing terrific things. And I? I'm just... wasting away.

I'm sick of hating myself. I'm really sick of being in the same goddamn spot. I just want to feel like I have the ability to achieve things. As it is, I'm taking things day by day. I'm terrified that in a year's time I'll still be the same person instead of somebody new and interesting and excited to be alive.

This just isn't working for me. I feel like a failure. The worst thing is... I can't even cry about it. I'd appreciate your advice, kind people, I really would. 

tl;dr I feel like I haven't changed in any way for almost two years. I'm not doing anything with my life and sick of being stuck in a rut.

22uusu,88,2014-04-12,"UPDATE: Me [21 F] with my father [50s], where is the line when it comes to my education and life in general, and is he crossing it?",throwawaymyparents,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22uusu/update_me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/,"[original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22lvy3/me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the_line_when/)

So the good news is my professor instantly had a solution to my problem and let me do work for her side company, which is also great for my resume. It's one less thing I need to worry about, but I didn't update my dad about it because, good or bad news, it'll still encourage him to think he's entitled to these updates. Last time I spoke with him, I told him what he was doing wasn't helping and I won't be talking to him if he's going to talk to me that way, such as cursing at me, cursing my professor's name, making me sound stupid, etc. 

He's been pestering my grandmother and even had his wife call and text. She and I don't like each other admittedly since she was emotionally abusive while I lived with her and my dad [she was part of the threats to take away my school funding when they wanted me to stop talking to my boyfriend]. However, she seemed open to knowing what's going on between my dad and me. I told her:

&gt;I'll be proactive in finding a letter of recommendation and I scheduled a meeting with my professor. However, daddy was cursing at me and blowing things completely out of proportion and making this far more stressful than what I need right now. I have a lot on my plate which he witnessed yet he still acted completely inappropriate. He needs to calm down before I can allow him to be more involved. I cannot get everything done effectively if he constantly calls me and curses at me and threatens to contact my professor. Had I known he was going to behave this way, I would have kept the information to myself.

She told me she'd talk to him about his behavior and didn't fight me on this. I also spoke to our family therapist and she was in agreement that the cursing was inappropriate, the phone calls at night were inappropriate, getting my grandma involved in the middle of the night was inappropriate, and he's overstepping boundaries. She's going to reach out for a session with him and told me it was alright to continue to ignore him. 

My private therapist also thought the whole dynamic was toxic and I don't have to speak with him yet but I need to establish boundaries the same way I do it with my mother who is mentally disabled. She has Schizophrenia and at times uses me as a sort of emotional punching bag to relieve herself, so whenever I notice things are getting inappropriate I hang up or tell her I have to go and then I limit our calls to every two weeks. My father is not mentally disabled, that I know of, so I'm not sure how I can adjust this tactic with him. My mom's mind is so all over the place she doesn't even notice when I hang up half the time. My dad would take it more personally and think I'm being immature.

Meanwhile, I've been ignoring his phone calls all together and his messages say, ""Okay you can stop ignoring me now. What is going on with your internship? I NEED AN UPDATE."" He's completely oblivious to why I'm avoiding him and only cares about the damn internship updates. I don't want to give them to him anymore since clearly it's a reason for him to fight me if things don't go his way. I sent out all the forms I needed to send and that's that. He doesn't need every grueling detail. He used to ask me about every grade I got in college too to make sure I wasn't ""fucking things up."" I live four hours away yet I feel like he's down my neck.

He's still bothering my grandma and is acting completely oblivious. She was on my side at first but doesn't think I should continue ignoring him because my dad ""has an unhappy life"" and I'm the ""only joy in his life."" I told her:

&gt;If I'm the only joy then he should treat me like it. No one should talk to their grown daughter with foul language and harass them hours into the night when they were told to stop and no one should overstep their boundaries on issues that do not concern them. He went over the line and I'm not going to give him detailed internship updates if he's going to take anger out on me over something that frankly isn't a big deal. I got both of my letters of recommendation sent out no thanks to him. His emotional reaction made me distraught and only made a hard week harder on me. And his life is what he makes of it and he chooses to handle it the way he does. If he's so unhappy with his marriage, he can take advantage of his prenup or go back to marriage counseling.If he's not happy with his life, he has to do something about it; I have nothing to do with his unhappiness.

tl;dr: Still ignoring my dad. My family and personal therapists said I can continue to do so and think his behavior is bad. They want me to establish boundaries. I also told my stepmom about his behavior which she apparently will talk to him about. My dad is bugging my grandma still to the point where she's starting to have sympathy for him and thinks I need to stop ignoring him because his life sucks. Should I continue ignoring him?

22vb8l,2,2014-04-12,Moving home was the worst decision I've made in college.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22vb8l/moving_home_was_the_worst_decision_ive_made_in/,"I moved home for my mandatory internship required by my school. The rules say that students aren't allowed to have jobs while interning, so I made the decision to go back and live with my parents since I couldn't pay rent at my apartment anymore without a job. 

At first it was nice, because my parents make dinner every day for ourselves and my younger brother, who is still in high school. I didn't have to worry about paying rent or utilities since my parents were awesome enough to welcome me back with open arms. It's kind of just like being in high school again, actually.

But a couple of weeks later the loneliness set in. While I moved home, my boyfriend stayed back at our school an hour and a half away so he could finish his studies, where he has still another year left to go. We only get to see each other on the weekends, where either I go to him in our college town or he comes home to his parents' place about 45 minutes away from me. We talk every day, but it isn't the same as when we could hang out after school and go grocery shopping or take naps together after long days. His parents are super strict, so we can only watch TV at his place or go out to hang out. At my house the rules are more lax.

On top of not being able to see my SO, all of my high school friends have moved away from this city, or I don't talk to them anymore. I hung out with a rough crowd to say the least and cut ties with many after graduation. I talk to maybe 3 people from my high school, and they have all moved away to their respective colleges. All my other friends are at school with my boyfriend, and when I come up to visit, I hardly have time to see anybody because I'm trying to catch up with my boyfriend. 

I am so lonely. There is nobody I know left in this town, and every day my routine is this: Wake up, go to work, come home, eat dinner with my family, and go to sleep. My little brother goes and hangs out with his friends and I have nobody to hang out with. I am the youngest person by far at my internship, as well as the only intern, and while I am very friendly with many people, the type of job I am working does not exactly allow for the employees to hang out with interns on their off times. It would be seen as highly inappropriate. Most are also men (90%) and married. 

Basically, I have cabin fever, and it's driving me wild. My loneliness is so bad that the idea of not being able to see my boyfriend for an hour on one day but for an entire day the next day still makes me burst into tears. I have nobody to talk to, so basically my parents have become my ""best friends"" whom I tell everything about my day, and while it was okay at first, by now my parents have begun to roll their eyes in annoyance.

[F, 22 and M, 22] 6 years",throwaway-whattodo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22vo29/i_feel_this_is_either_going_to_make_or_break_our/,"My SO and I have been together for 6 years, and we have been friends for even longer. We've never had any serious relationship issues or any major fights. I've been very happy with him for the last 6 years, and I know he feels the same. I cannot imagine my life without him. 


Two years ago, we sat down together and discussed our future of attending a university together that would be perfect for his major and my major. We decided that we should take the next step of our relationship by living together if we both got accepted to this university. Last year, we graduated from a community college together and decided we would take a year off from school before transferring to a 4 year university. Last year, we applied to our top university, as well as other universities for a backup. A couple months ago, he got accepted into his backup university. Both of us have not heard from our top choice university yet. A couple days ago, he told me that he feels his backup university may be a better choice than our original top university choice. 


When he told me, I felt my stomach and heart drop. I wanted to talk to him about it on the day he told me. However, I was too distraught to talk. Plus, he had to leave for his other responsibilities. I don't know why he changed his mind. I have not talked to him about my feelings about this yet. We will be talking about this soon. I am absolutely, utterly terrified of what may happen. I am terrified that we will end up having to live in separate locations, and that we may break up in the process. I've had LDR relationships before. Those relationships always failed due to ""falling out of love"" due to the time apart. 


My top university choice is a hour drive away from the university he wants to attend. Realistically, we COULD live somewhere in the middle of the two universities and commute 30-50 minutes to school daily, depending on traffic. I am not even sure if this will work out due to the amount of gasoline and costs for wear and tear on our cars. My car is old and is constantly breaking down. I spend so much money to keep it running. I do not even know if my car can survive that kind of a commute daily. We do not know where we'll end up working. We do not know what our school and work schedules will be like. This will be our first time living away from home. This will be our first time having to pay for rent. I am not sure what our monthly budget will be and if we can even afford that kind of driving time. Sure, it would be easy to get a new car with better gas mileage, but I do not have anyone to co-sign for me, nor do I have enough money saved up for a down payment. 


If his university choice has my major available, I would attend that particular university with him without a problem. However, it does not, which is where this problem arises. There are only a couple schools in my state that I can attend for my major. He can attend almost any school he wants in our home state because he has a popular major. I would never force him to attend a school he wasn't comfortable with. But, I would be lying if I said I'm okay with this situation. I'm not okay with it. I honestly thought he wanted to attend the same school as me due to the great program it has available for his major. He was excited about the possibility of us attending the same university together. I'm not sure what happened. 


I may be making a bigger deal out of this than it really is. But, I do not deal with change well. I don't handle the unexpected situations well. I am trying to look at the bright side: it is only a hour distance between the two schools. I have family that lives a hour away from my dream school. I could live with them as a backup.


I still haven't heard from the university I want to attend yet. I am not sure what will even happen if I don't get in that university. Should I stay home and do a LDR for a semester or two? Should I move with him and work/do internships until I am able to attend school? Reddit, please help me see clearly about this situation. I do not have any questions in particular, but I would love your insight. I realize this post is probably all over the place. Bear with me, because I have not been thinking straight for the last few days.

22w54q,25,2014-04-12,That significant moment...,noahamor,wine,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/22w54q/that_significant_moment/,"Who here remembers the exact moment when they had the realization wine was more than an alcohol choice - rather something worth exploring, tasting, discovering and learning about?

I was lucky enough to snag an internship with a wine exporter in Buenos Aires right after graduating college. We had a small tasting room where visitors would come and taste our selection of Argentinean wine, mainly from Mendoza and Salta. Every once in a while, our tasting room sommelier would be unavailable and I was called in to run the wine tastings. I memorized the script and could talk the talk regarding tannins, terroir and tasting notes, but I hadn't had enough exposure in my undergrad days to any kind of decent wine beyond the boxed sort.

This one dreary Tuesday in our tasting room, I was conducting a private tasting with a husband and wife collector and we made it to our Malbec Gran Reserva. I poured myself a taste to enjoy with the duo, and had a zinger moment of true love and appreciation for what I was experiencing. The aromas of tobacco and leather were intense, and I could finally distinguish them from just wine smell. The mouth was bold - ripe fruit with an incredibly long finish. The husband, wife and I grinned at the same time out of love for this wine.

I sold six cases that night from various fincas and left that night not only ecstatic for my commission, but with a fascination and desire to learn more, taste more and dive further into the wine world. I was 22 years old. The wine was Carinae Malbec Gran Reserva 2008."

I am really hoping to get into Georgeotwn because I think I will have better internship options and also will enjoy living there more than I would Ithaca (I'm a city girl).  Also I'm queer and the gay scene in Ithaca is not comparable to what I'm used to (in San Francisco).  Also the weather in Ithaca could be too harsh for me.  Basically I really hope Georgetown accepts me.  I visited DC and their campus last week and it just felt RIGHT.  I can really picture myself living there.  I visited Ithaca too, and was very impressed by Cornell Law - but I couldn't see myself there.  If Georgetown rejects me, however, I won't have any other desirable options (I am waitlisted at UVA, Columbia, and UCLA.  Also accepted at USC - but I don't want to stay in CA)

Need help winning her back.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22x7tg/i_27_m_let_my_girlfriend_go_25_f_lost_myself_lost/,"So basically I need help getting my girl back, and feel like beeing really creative so as she has no other option than to fall into my arms. Call it romantic or selfish or whatevver. 

First off all, my english is not that good, apologize in advance. 

So, here's the story. 
We've been together for about 5 years when we ended it. We had kind of drifted away for some time when we went different directions. It all startet about a year ago, when I got my first job in a new city, away from our home town. At the time it was no biggy. She was going abroad for some time, and we somehow made it work. I came over to her and she came to visit me. But after 6 months she ended her internship abroad and came to stay with me for the summer (before going back to our home town, to finish her last year of her masters degree). 
The summer was really something. It seemed no matter how hard we tried, we only drifted apart. I had kind of found a life, with new job and new friends. And when she came back, everything just became a hassle. I think she wanted to have me to herself for some time, which is reasonable, I just could not see it. Instead I was a bit more independet, wanting a lot more people around me. No matter what or why, we ended up fighting much that summer. It was like a wound that never healed. And when the fall came she moved back to our home town, and the gap grew bigger. I feelt more need for space and she only wanted me closer. In the process I lost myself a bit, a kind of midlife crisis. I didnt know what I wanted with anything anymore, and started excluding people from my life, alt the time trying new things and chasing a dream that was not there. I got really obsessed with finding myself, ""there's got to be something out there for me in life, what am I suppose to do??"".
So when christmas came, she said she could not wait anymore. Either she had to try us with a fresh start or we had to break it off. 
I was a really messy christmas. We met a couple days in a row, and cried, and I had such a hard time. But at the I didnt know anything, I was so confused and had really lost myself. I told her i still wanted to be by myself, and thats when we went different ways. 

Now, 3 months has passed. What have I been doing? I have read a lot of books, trying to find out what i want with myself in life.  Self development, and chasing my dreams. I have learned that I have to have something In my life that brings me up early in the morning and keeps me late in the evening. 
Have i found myself? Maybe not fully. But I have realized that part of my dream is having somebody to share them with, and without havving people I care about around me, life is nothing. I need her back! 

So 3-4 weeks ago, I called her, and booked a ticket back home, to tell her how much I miss her. I poured my heart out, I told her everything I know about us, and tried bringing out every good memory.    It ended bad.
She told me she was not ready yet, and didnt want to give me any hopes as she doesnt know how she will feel about us in the future. She has about a month left before her master's is due, so she's working a lot with that at the moment. Do not want any distractions, and is happy beeing by herself and only thinkin about herself after beeing with me for 5 years. 

Now what do I do? I know I dont want to disrupt her masters, but I go to work every day like a mess. I think about her all the time, and have realized she is the one. There is no other, and I want to spend the rest of my life making her as happy as I can. My job doesn't mean anything anymore. I loved working out and eating healty. But lately I have lost 5 kilos and eat whatevver. My hobbies are no more. 
I realize I have to be happy by myself, for us to be happy together, but thinking about me throwing away the best thing in my life really messes me up. I need her back. And if I can't I have her, I have to rethink me life. Start over somewhere new. Sell my apartement and live as if she does not exist anymore, because this can not go on anymore. But anyway, I ow it to myself to give it one more try. 

So reddit, if there is anything good in here, could u please help me knock the socks of her feet. Help me telling her I love her and miss her In a way that does not drive her away. I need to be creative.

Relevant information: 
 For the last 2 weeks we have been e-mailing (not much), where I tried telling her how I feel (she asked). Last night i got a respond, and think she got a bit paralized of everything I said (what she means to me and whatnot). She responded quite shortly, telling me she didn't know what to say, and asked if I was in town for a meet up. Poked at it a bit more, and said that I was not in town, but could come if she wanted me to. She responded with, something like"" It would have been nice to see each other, without it meaning something"". 
I found it a bit strange, since I in the mail before litterally told her I would ride a horse to Mogolia and back again, for her. So I do not know what she means with it? Anyways, we might hook up tomorrow. And I might be able to meet her and tell her something. But im uncertain if I should wait and knock her socks of some other time. I somehow want it to be tomorrow. 

This somehow turned out to be a diary or a blog or something.
If anybody has something useful to say, then thank you.

When I enrolled as a Freshman, I had no idea that I would later leave the Church.  I came to BYU expecting a happy, mormon existence, but found myself depressed and completely unmotivated. Last summer, between my Freshman and Sophomore year I started having doubts, but it wasn't until early this semester I realized that I really didn't believe in the church, and that I cannot, for the sake of my mental health and staying true to myself, continue to take part in TSCC and BYU. So I've been preparing myself to transfer to the U of U, I just haven't decided when. 

Originally I was going to stay for fall semester so that I would spend winter abroad on an internship for my major, and I've made some arrangements for living situation in the fall (I have a contract, but haven't turned it in yet).  However recently my professor mentioned that the internship might not be feasible, and so now I am trying to figure out if it is worth it to stay for another year or not. I already did the same internship last summer, so I'm not sure that it would even be worth it to stay for that. So the question is whether I transfer to the U for this owing fall semester or wait until next year.

Ex-mormon redditors, have any of you been in a similar position? realizing you no longer believe in the TSCC while at BYU? How did you deal with it? People that transferred to the U after attending BYU, what was the change like?

Also, when I transfer to the U, I plan on cutting myself off from the church completely, but how do I break it to my mom and her side of the family? (They are all super conservative TBMs, my dad's side are all ex-mos though).

TL;DR Ex-mo at BYU, trying to decide when to transfer to the U, is it worth it to tay at BYU for even another year?

22xd9s,0,2014-04-13,I [19 F] am unsure of my own rights because of my Mother's [50 F] pressure of her religious beliefs,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22xd9s/i_19_f_am_unsure_of_my_own_rights_because_of_my/,"I am currently feeling pain and frustration from my Mother because of how much she wants me to attend church. Until my senior year of high school, I was a practicing Catholic. I lost my enjoyment around middle school since I never felt at peace with myself. I always thought prayer and having faith would bring you peace and give you a healthy conscience. Instead, I always felt guilt-ridden and shameful of myself. 


 I always felt like my mother used religion to make me feel below her and that I was troubled. I have always been good at school and participated in extracurriculars. People usually say I'm extremely quiet so I wouldn't say I'm a rude person. After I was done with high school and attend college, I thought I might have a little more freedom. I don't remember how but I was able to stop going to church for a long while (I remember hiding in my room with her banging the door and finally giving up).


I still live with my mom, and she has become a lot more judgmental about me, telling me how I've become useless and have done nothing with my life (I go to college, have a part time job, and have been accepted for a paid summer internship). She has always been like this though, her reasons are because I gained weight, and do not help the family out by taking care of the house (I'm always at school, or my two jobs).


She has these outbursts about how I'm not ""well-rounded"" and I need to go to church to better myself. She talks about how my siblings are so much better and mentally healthier because they go to church. They also yell at me about how ""useless"" I am but they have also skipped out of church a bunch; I am the youngest sibling so maybe that's why. They started going back all of a sudden, so my mother has a lot more reason now (I don't think because of me though). 


 I have talked to other relatives but they all feel that I must attend church with my mom until I move out. Because of the amount of money and time I'm putting into school, I don't expect to be able to leave before I'm 24 years old. I feel like even when I'm past 20 I shouldn't have to do these things for my mom anymore. I want to focus on school and work now instead of having to go to church 2-3 times a week. I feel like this is a way for her to control me and judge my character. I don't want that anymore.


I know I'm only 19, but should I have to go to church in order to please her while I still live under her roof?

(I first posted this in /r/sanfrancisco but that didn't seem to be the right place, the mods redirected me to /r/AskSF!)

I'm not at all a frequent visitor of this subreddit, but I figured you guys might be able to help me achieve what I've always wanted!

I'm a 19 year old Belgian student. At this moment I am in my second year of my Bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics: Application Development. The total time for this Bachelor is 3 years. In the third year (next year) we will need to conclude our formation with a mandatory internship.

These internships mostly take place in Belgian firms. But luckily they also push students to take an internship abroad, it is allowed and supported, each student has a choice.

I've always been fascinated in the United States in general and became increasingly interested in San Francisco in the previous years, mainly because of the abundance of IT-companies and startups which are established in the area!
Unfortunately I've never been to the US in my life. It would be an amazing opportunity to engage in an internship abroad, and the US (preferably the San Francisco region) is at the top of my list.

I've been mailing some small companies, but this is just on a small scale of course. I wanted to take this a level further, so I turn to this subreddit for some help!

I am hoping to find some people here who can help me, guide me, give me contact details of IT companies (even startups) etc. I also have a few questions while I'm at it: 

- I've heard SF has a unique vibe, how is the area in general? 
- I've also heard living in SF is not at all cheap. Is this really true? Are there decent places for decent prices available? 
- Is it common for students to take an internship abroad in the area? 
- What would be my best course of action to contact companies and get myself an internship?

A bit of basic information about the internship: 

- internship has to be somehow IT-related (in a broad sense, but preferably something with software development/ engineering) 
- it will take place in May-June 2015 (I was advised to start looking early) 
- the internship should be around 6 weeks but can be longer if needed (for example if a company has an opportunity but 6 weeks is too short, a longer period is possible).

Please don't hesitate to reply to this post or send me a private message!

TL;DR: young motivated Belgian student in search for an internship abroad, preferably the SF area. Would like to get in contact with some inspiring companies to engage in an internship in May-June 2015."

The position calls for proficiency in programs like Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint which have been one of my strengths throughout my academic career.  Along with anything Microsoft, I’ve taken classes on website design. If given the chance of this internship, I can ensure you that I can provide a plethora of fresh ideas, energy, and motivation to any and all my assignments.

22yyxw,1,2014-04-13,I'm thinking of quitting my job CAW,Xyuli,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22yyxw/im_thinking_of_quitting_my_job_caw/,"I've worked part time at an asian supermarket in the food court for almost exactly a year now, I started last April. I'm thinking of quitting because of everything that has built up. Sorry this is really long! 

The only reason I can't is because I've grown used to having my own money and my independence, I don't need to rely on my parents anymore. I started working because my parents were struggling a bit and I could support myself. 

But I've been so stressed lately, I'm still in high school and I don't have time for homework anymore. I leave my house at 7:30 in the morning, I don't get home until 9:30 most days (I usually only have 1 day off). I work almost every day, and even if I get a day off it's on a weekday, like Tuesday. I rarely, VERY rarely, have weekends off. I can count on my fingers the number of Saturdays I have had off. And I have to have extremely valid reasons for it too. My (part time) coworkers, they have to beg to start late on Sundays so they can go to church (or to take the day off). 

I don't see my friends anymore, if I do it's when I finish school early and have time to visit them before I have to head to work. If I want to see them it's only after work on Friday nights. I recently changed schools too so I haven't seen a lot of my friends and spent quality time with them for what feels like ages.

Some of my coworkers are really great. I've become really close with them and we're like a family. My boss though... She's another story. She likes to yell at us, for one. Which isn't that big of a deal, but it's just annoying. But she doesn't treat us fairly.

You have to understand the dynamic here - there are full time and part time employees. The full time employees get paid under the table and they get paid less per hour than us (around $7/hr vs $10.25/hr). The full time employees work from 9am till 9pm, doing lots of different things.

But the thing is, when it gets busy, like really busy, a lot of the times the full time employees will not do anything and leave everything for the part time. All the hard stuff, like cleaning and taking out the garbage and helping customers, they leave to us. If we're busy, then they do it. Or if there's a customer they'll look around and wait for us to help them. They won't do anything unless they absolutely have to. They just stand around and talk a lot of the time. Or do small things, instead of actually helping when there's a lineup. 

Most days me(usually me) or another part time has to clean the back and take out the garbage. Today was a bad day, I asked if I could go home early because there was almost no customers there. The full time were standing around doing nothing. The part time were occasionally helping a customer. There was no reason for her to make me stay. Except, to clean so that none of the full time will have to do it. I had been ordering food for almost my entire shift (12-7 at the time),  short of my breaks and the hour and a half or so my coworker switched with me.

I asked her if I could, she said no because ""who else would clean the back?"" I told her my friend (another part time, who I asked beforehand if I should ask to go home early because I knew she would have to clean, and she said it didn't matter to her if she did).Then my boss said ""What? She's going to do the work of two people?"" 

The thing is on Sundays we do a big clean up and two people clean. Another part time was taking out the garbage today so she would have been cleaning and I would have been cleaning too. I said that she would be cleaning as well. 

My boss then said ""You can't just give people whatever jobs you want, then there's no one else here to clean over here. Who is going to do this then?"" (rough translations because we were speaking Mandarin). 

I'm not one to complain, whenever she asks me to do something I do it. But it's ridiculous how there's like 7 other people at work who are fully able to clean and she wont ask them. Last week I had a large amount of homework to do (even today I still do, it's hard for me to get things done on time now - a problem I've never had before) so I asked her to go home early. She said fine, as long as you finish the cleaning. 

I thought that was fair enough, but KNOWING that I wanted to go she kept on asking me to do more and more things that she could have asked ANYONE else to do. Nobody was doing anything, and she still asked me. She asked us to clean at 7:30, when we;re supposed to clean at 8:30 (we finish at 9). She looked again and told me to clean the tables again because they were dirty. Then she told me to wash the garbage bins. Then she told me to mop (which my other coworker was already doing).  

So obviously today I'm upset... I felt my eyes burning so I walked away, and I tried to calm down. My coworker tried to talk to me and make me feel better but I still felt like crying. I went to the washroom and I hung out there for a while trying to calm down. Eventually my boss came to the washroom and we talked a bit, I told her I was stressed with school and work and she said she would cut my hours. See if I could find a way that it would work. 

But it's not just the hours, it's what's going on here... My coworker has been getting pissed at the full time because yesterday (I went to visit an university - one of my rare weekends off) they were super busy and the full time wouldn't do anything to help. My boss talked to us about it and she said how the reason it seems like we do more is because we work for short shifts. They do work in the mornings when we aren't there, so they don't do the same work again when we are there. 

But how does that make sense? If you're getting paid to work, do actual work instead of making us do it. At first it made sense for us to order when they're tired, but now they're just relying on us to do almost everything when we're there. Not all the full time do this, but most of them do. 

Then after I finished cleaning today, my boss said I could go. But because I wasn't there yesterday and it was payday, I didn't get my paycheck yet. I had already left but I called my coworker and asked her if she would take my pay check for me instead. She said she would, gave the phone to my boss and I told her to give my pay check to my coworker. I thought it would be better because we might see each other at the gym tomorrow morning or before work so I can deposit it. I literally have 42 cents in my account because I paid for a volunteer trip to Costa Rica with my school. I need the money because I haven't had money for lunch or dinner since I don't go home from school to work. 

But then my coworker calls back and says ""well you're working tomorrow anyways, and I don't want to lose your pay check, so why don't you just get it tomorrow?"" So I gave in and said fine, whatever, if you don't want to take it don't. 

But then my boss calls me again and she's yelling because she's saying how she went and got my pay check to give to my coworker but now she's saying that she doesn't want it. So what is she supposed to do? So I tell her to just give it to her and now my coworker is mad at me because they're yelling at her. 

I have been thinking of quitting for a while, I've been looking for a new job anyways. But I don't think I can find one. I don't know how I found this one. It's shady, it's unfair, it's stressful, and I don't even know if the money is really worth it anymore. I've given up so much of myself to work here - I don't get to do anything I really enjoy anymore.

I'm leaving for university in a few months, I applied for a 6 week job (kind of like an internship) that pays 385/week for the summer. If I get that job I can easily quit. Even if I don't, I'm not sure if I want to work here during the summer. I'm going to quit in a few months to go to university anyways, and I'm sick of working here. But it would be really good if I could just save up some money to use in university since I'm not sure if I'll have a job then. I know my parents have money saved up for me and there's some scholarship money and OSAP, but I don't know how I'll get by.. 

I'm thinking after next week (which would be the last week including in the next pay check) I should quit. What should I do? Do you think I'm wrong to be so upset over this? Is the job worth it? Should I stick it out? I know my coworkers and I are unsatisfied and want to find something better. I don't agree with a lot of the stuff that they do in the kitchen here and I don't trust how clean it is here. I miss having freedom and I miss out on so much by having a job - or just this job. 

I don't think there is an in between. Even if they cut my hours, like if I worked 3 days a week, I don't know if I would want to work there. I keep thinking about what I can do once I quit. I could dye my hair. I could spend time with my friends. I could actually relax and read. I could actually do some homework. I could get home when it's not dark outside. I could just do whatever I wanted with my time. 

Edit: Forgot to say, that usually when you order food you don't clean. I ordered all shift (and it's important to note that I ordered when it was actually busy) and I still had to clean. Which happens, but everyone there is fully capable of cleaning or ordering too, but they don't. 

There's also the fact that you don't get raises. My boss mentioned to me a few months ago that she was going to ask if I could get a raise. I haven't received one. I've asked other coworkers and they said no part time workers get raises, that's why everyone leaves. There's no way I can move up in the company. Even my friend at Mcdonalds gets continual raises - even if it is like 10 cents every 3 months. He started at 9.60 and now makes like $10.00 "

Thanks!

EDIT: I've got a lot of great advice, thanks guys! Just wanted to elaborate a bit.

The reason I'm focusing on EC's is because my GPA is sub-par. 3.8 on a 5.0 scale, and about 3.3 unweighted. My SAT scores are near perfect, 2350. In addition, I've taken the most rigorous curriculum possible, and my school is a well-respected private institution. So the only thing that really brings me down is grades, and those are definitely improving. I just want to maximize my chances by becoming as well-rounded as possible."

&gt;The GNOME Foundation has run into cash flow problems and as a result is freezing non-essential expenses. The GNOME Foundation has eliminated their cash reserves leading to this dire situation, but should be recoverable in the months ahead. The GNOME Foundation got into this situation through its Outreach Program for Women (OPW) and managing the program (and funds) for a number of other participating organizations. The GNOME Foundation staff and board fell behind in their processes with being overwhelmed by administering OPW. GNOME's Outreach Program for Women is explained as ""The Outreach Program for Women (OPW) helps women (cis and trans) and genderqueer get involved in free and open source software."" They've had around 30 interns for their most recent cycle. 

I'm sure you guys are all aware of feminism's war against the technology industry. Well we have another casualty. The GNOME Foundation, the makers of one of the most popular desktop environments for Linux is running into financial troubles. The culprit? In 2012 (2013 report isnt out yet) shows 1/4 of their expenses went to ""Women's outreach""[1]. In a matter of 2 years they went from spending $0 on women's outreach to over 100k while at the same time spending on Hackfests went from $82k to $21k. In 2014 the program hired 30 women's outreach interns who each got a $5,500 stipend[2][3]. All you aspiring software developers out there better be ready to walk on eggshells and put on your feminist friendly face.

So, I have been dating this girl for almost 7 months now. We have been taking things slow, and just enjoying dating each other. We are both in college, and this upcoming summer we both have internships, hers in in Washington, mine is in Chicago. If we both werent leaving, I want probably want to take this to the next level, but because we are leaving, I dont want to start a relationship and then be gone for 3 months. I rather just wait it out until we get back. 

So assuming both of our internships go well, we will get offers for full time positions. We both have another year left, but this just guarantees we have a job after graduation. Neither one of us is planning on staying in our city where we go to College, so this brings up a pretty big problem that will need to be addressed sooner rather than later.

If we do get back and are still into each other, I would like to be in an actual, exclusive relationship with her. At this point we would have been seeing each other for almost a year, and I want to know if I need to move on with my life (I think this is fair right?).

Since neither one of us is planning on staying, one of us would have to look for another job in either Chicago or washington, or do a LDR. I feel like this is so early to bring up in a new relationship, but time is running out, and I dont know if this is the right thing to do.

We met on Okcupid about a week ago, started chatting and got along well enough so we exchanged numbers. We spent a fair bit of the evening texting one another and just generally getting to know some basic things about each other. The next day he asked me if I wanted to get together and watch a movie sometime and I said yes, and as it turns out he literally lives around the corner from me (less than a two minute walk) so we are practically neighbors. 

He came over the next day and it wasn't awkward in the slightest. He walked right up to my roommate and I (we were on the front porch enjoying the sun!) and shook our hands, introduced himself, chatted with us then followed me to my room. We sat on my bed and ""watched"" The Internship. We talked through the whole thing and just had each other absolutely cracking up. My roommates got nosey and came down and started chatting us both up and told us to come upstairs for a drink, so we did. I expected it to be a quick drink but we actually all had quite a few, and before we knew it it was 2am. Everyone started filtering off to bed so I invited him to watch another movie before he left, he agreed. We ended up cuddling, kissing, and one thing lead to another and we had sex. 

I honestly expected him to get up and leave after that, figured I likely unknowingly met up with someone who was just kinda looking for a hookup - but he threw his leg and arm over me and pulled me in for a cuddle and we fell asleep. He stayed the night, we fooled around a bit more and we talked a lot, then he left in the morning. 

He texted me that day, we chatted throughout the day and into the wee hours of the next morning while I worked a midnight shift. It's been only 5 days but we have seen each other every single day since. He came over the following day and we went for an hour walk, stopping by his place so I could see his cat and his house, etc. Then returned to my house where we hungout with my roommates for a few hours til almost midnight when he walked me to work. During our walk I mentioned that I saw he had two ukelele's at his house and that he should play for me sometime because I love ukelele's. He dropped me at work and we texted again til the wee wee hours of the morning. 

The next day he had all these plans to get school work done and then visit family then visit friends in his hometown but he texted me throughout the day AND stopped by my place on his way out of town with his ukelele. Told me to hold onto it and learn something for him :). Again, we texted all night and into the morning. 

Then yesterday he came over after doing some school work and we sat on the porch with my roommates and all hungout and chatted and had a casual time, just enjoying this amazing weather and then he and I went to his house. His roommate wasn't home so we went into his room and got into bed and just talked for about an hour. He admitted that he felt extremely comfortable with me and that it's pretty undeniable that there's something between us. We get each others jokes, understand each others life situations, etc. There's no awkwardness and it honestly feels like I've known the guy for years, I'm so at peace in his company. We ended up kissing and having sex and then cuddling naked for about 5 hours, yeesh, before I had to get up and leave for work. He texted me a short while after I left and stayed up chatting with me til about 2am this morning. 

We have plans to start Keto together (both have done it in the past!) again and embrace the spring by going for walks and just going outside lots. We have seen each other every day since we met and, it's hard to explain without sounding like a giddy teenager, but there's something between us that is just so amazing and I'm very much enjoying it. He told me he was looking for a relationship, not just random hookup type things and I agreed. 

**The Question**
So NOW, all that being said, I am super curious what happens next. Do we just keep doing this? Should I mention that I'm interested in making things ""official""? I'm cool with waiting a bit still because I know it's super early on, but I'm just curious how this kind of process works really! He reaches out to hangout with me just as often as I do him, and he's returned all the feelings of happiness with us doing whatever we are doing. Should I just leave it? Hmmm what do you guys think?

***TL;DR:*** Seeing this guy, have hungout/talked every day for almost the last week, insanely great chemistry that even my roommates and his roommate have picked up on. How to move things to the next level? "

I'm being drug tested soon for my summer internship. The test will probably be April 28th, so 2 weeks from now. I read your guide [here](http://beyondchronic.com/2011/09/ask-old-hippie-will-cranberry-juice-help-you-pass-a-drug-test/) and it was very helpful, but I have a question regarding my specific situation.

For the last few months (September-March) I have smoked 4-5 times a week with friends, usually a few bowls each time. Starting at the beginning of this month, I began to cut down and have only smoked 2-3 times up until this past weekend (where I took edibles on Thursday and Friday).

Do you think it's likely that I will have to resort to the substitution method? I plan on exercising and drinking lots of water each day up until then and am about 15% bodyfat, so my friends say that I have a good chance of passing. But it's not really something I want to leave up to chance and would like to be as prepared as possible.

Also, I was thinking about buying a few home test kits to check on my status every few days; is this something you recommend/think would be a good idea?

Thanks for your time!"

As people that thrive off attention from others, I'm sure there are other ENFPs who can relate to this.

I'm getting ready to graduate college and the uncertainty of what I'm going to do and everything else that comes with that is leaving me in a pretty vulnerable state. I also went through a shitty breakup a few months back that I'm still struggling to overcome. The girl and I share many friends, and I can't help but feel that most of them are on her side.

Over the past couple months I've felt that I'm slipping from the minds of others. Some friends are preparing to start big internships and others are involved in projects. It seems feeble, but I've noticed a somewhat drastic decrease in Facebook interactions with others. When with others, I can't help but feel that I'm not welcome or liked. I've brought these fears up to my best friend, and he told me that I was wrong...but he sounded like he was trying to make me feel better, as if he knew that on some level, I was right.

I know that these thoughts are illogical and that the more I think about them, the more anxious and ineffective I'll become. My whole life I've struggled with these kinds of thoughts so I'm rather confident this social anxiety is somewhere engrained in me.

Have any of you dealt with this? How do you deal with feeling lonely despite evidence that you aren't alone?"

We knew each other for about six months prior to this, as we both work in the same store (different departments) and have a few mutual friends. I like him, but I take a really long time to open up and I haven’t fallen for him yet. There is plenty of sexual attraction, I always have a good time when we hang out, and he’s very nice to me.


Todd is pretty introverted. Not in the sense that he is quiet and shy—he is outgoing and quite weird (which I enjoy). However, he keeps all of his feelings locked away and is very insecure, despite being crazy handsome, smart and funny. In the past Todd has had a really hard time being comfortable with people sexually. However, recently he has begun to open up to me. He told me he’s never been so honest with someone, and he’s even told me about some pretty fucked up stuff that happened to him when he was a child that probably is the root of all his insecurities and why he is so uncomfortable sexually. Todd also has a bit of a drinking problem. Almost every night he goes to bed with 3-4 beers and a glass or two of wine in his system. I know this is his coping mechanism, and I am not yet and maybe never will be in a place to talk to him about this, because as of right now I don't think it's any of my business. 


So yada yada we get along great and it is obvious to me that he is falling for me, and I possibly am too. However, there’s another catch. Todd has accrued some pretty bad credit card debt. I don’t know the exact amount, but he is very careless about spending money. He openly talks about his debt and how poor he is, and usually in a joking matter. The other day he bought something and said, “Oh well, another $100 doesn’t really matter when you’re already in this much debt. I’ll pay it off sometime.” This scares the shit out of me because I am a freak about my finances. 


Lastly, I am graduating in May and will be starting my internship at the hospital in August (still will be living in this city). I have lofty goals and plan on doing something great with my life. However, I don’t think Todd has goals. He went to school for photography right out of high school and then dropped out after a year. He talks about planning to go back to school for automotive stuff, but I’m not sure when. And I’m not saying a college education matters to me at all, but aspirations do. All in all I just think he’s pretty lost in life.  


I guess what I need help figuring out is if this is all worth it. I like this guy and we share so many of the same values and opinions. But I don’t know if I should be the one to deal with all of this baggage. I know he needs to figure out his own shit before he can be with someone, and I don’t know if I should stick around to be there for him while he does. Don’t get me wrong I really would like to stick around, but I’m scared of getting too involved and then it being hard to turn back. I feel like I can’t talk to him about this because we haven’t been together long and we aren’t even dating. I would have no idea how to bring it up without overstepping my boundaries. Sorry for all of this word vomit. I'm not sure if I'm worrying too much and should just relax and see what happens. Any advice you have to offer is much appreciated.


**TLDR: great guy, lots of baggage. Do I stick around and see where this relationship goes, or do I get out before things could get messy?**

&gt; You're missing the real picture. GNOME is running out of money because they spent it on stupid outreach programs for women and ""trans-women"". And now that the financial shitstorm is coming to light... the female exec director responsible for this [debacle resigns](http://www.gnome.org/news/2014/03/karen-sandler-steps-down-as-gnome-foundation-executive-director/) 
&gt; 
&gt; So basically men made it...men funded it. Women showed up later and demanded all the money be spent on them... and now there's none left. It's almost a microcosm of the Western nations economic woes.


And here is the story:

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTY2Mjc

&gt; While GNOME has been riding high lately with driving the development of its Wayland-based compositor and being the first major desktop getting there natively for most of its applications, and the overall work on the recent GNOME 3.12 release being fairly exciting, on the foundation side they are running into a budget shortfall and funds are becoming very tight within the GNOME Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; The GNOME Foundation has run into cash flow problems and as a result is freezing non-essential expenses. The GNOME Foundation has eliminated their cash reserves leading to this dire situation, but should be recoverable in the months ahead. The GNOME Foundation got into this situation through its Outreach Program for Women (OPW) and managing the program (and funds) for a number of other participating organizations. The GNOME Foundation staff and board fell behind in their processes with being overwhelmed by administering OPW. GNOME's Outreach Program for Women is explained as ""The Outreach Program for Women (OPW) helps women (cis and trans) and genderqueer get involved in free and open source software."" They've had around 30 interns for their most recent cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; The GNOME Foundation Is Running Short On Money
&gt; Making matters worse, in their 2014 budget they made assumptions based upon the previous year's incomes and expenditures, which were more optimistic. There's also the matter of payments from GNOME sponsors and others owing the GNOME Foundation money being rather fluid or coming in late.
&gt; 
&gt; For rectifying this budget shortfall, the GNOME Foundation is going through with its invoicing of conference sponsors, more pro-actively following up on unpaid invoices, better invoicing OPW sponsoring, increasing their general fundraising efforts, and taking other efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; As a major step in acknowledging and correcting the problem, the GNOME Foundation voted last week to ""freeze Foundation spending which is not essential to the running of the Foundation. By keeping expenditures to a minimum while some delayed revenue is regained, the board aims to have things back to normal within a few months."" 
&gt; 
&gt; 


Now what this means is, instead of fixing stuff that matters and listening to feedback, they spent their resources in Women outreach programs. THANK YOU KAREN.

I've been interning at this small agency for the past 8 months and, because I'm graduating, they just offered me a position to keep writing for them. Regardless of this, I had plans to stay where I am because a) I don't think moving back home is a very productive idea b) I have a decent amount of clout here that'll come in handy when I work on personal portfolio things c) my writing partner and best friend has one more year to graduate and I really would like to stick around with him. 

My logical brain is telling me to take the position because it's a pretty solid gig and, frankly, it's not like I have a lot of other offers on the table. Staying here could be good for displaying longevity and any agency experience is better than no agency experience. Besides, I plan on leaving this city as soon as this year is up. What's a year?

My creative/emotional brain, however, is telling me to blow this popsicle stand ASAP. The people I work with are great, but the work this particular agency does is not my cup of tea. Our clients are largely conservative small business owners that aren't very openminded to newer marketing approaches. As an intern at this agency, I have to write a lot of web and social media content that tends to be on the more bland side of things. A lot of my content has low amounts of traffic because my audience is so small and so disconnected from social media. I'm not sure getting paid to do this will make things any better. I'd hate to not be able to work on things I'm more passionate about because I'm busy making lousy Facebook posts.

There is another, more nationally recognized, agency in town that I could potentially work for, but there is no promise of being able to secure anything. If I did manage to land something, it'd likely be unpaid and possibly unproductive for my portfolio. Despite this, the work would be a lot more exciting, creative, and in line with the kind of things I ultimately want to do. 

I'm in a heck of a pickle.

College student interning in NYC this summer, want to be dressed/treated like an adult.",WhoopdyDoo642,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/231jv8/advice_needed_college_student_interning_in_nyc/,"Hey there. Long time lurker, first time poster. I first checked out MFA last fall, and I've been slowly improving my wardrobe ever since. This subreddit has been insanely helpful so I just want to say **thank you** before I even begin.

Alright, here's the issue:

I landed a good internship at an advertising agency in NYC this summer. As I said earlier, I've been building up my wardrobe this past fall/winter, but as the weather is getting nicer I'm quickly realizing that I don't like a lot of the stuff I have for the summer. It's mostly stuff from high school (band/graphic t-shirts) and I kinda feel like a kid whenever I wear them. 

I've come to really like this sort of [americana style](http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--americana-menswear-63378.html), and I think it fits for the Northeast area of the US I live in. What I'm having trouble doing is transitioning this style over to the summer. It gets really hot here June-August so pants/long sleeve button downs don't really seem to be an option. 

I'm also having trouble with shoes. I bought a pair of [Katahdin Mocs](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/74748?page=mens-katahdin-iron-works-boots-moc-toe) last November that I was basically living in, and the transition back to sneakers seems kinda weird. I was looking at these [Blucher Mocs](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/11575?page=mens-handsewn-moccasins-blucher-moc) but I'm not sure how well they'd go with shorts. I was trying to avoid boat shoes since I'm not sure the preppy look is for me, but I'm open to anything at this point.

**TL;DR: Rising senior looking for a slightly more adult wardrobe for a summer internship. Pants/long sleeve shirts are a no go as it gets very hot/humid in NYC during the summer.**

Sorry for the lengthy post. Let me if there's any more info you guys would need and thank you in advance! You'll be helping me not look like an idiot this summer."

231mb7,76,2014-04-14,[UPDATE] I [20 F] need to tell my quadriplegic Dad [46 M] that I got a job.,notinsidethehouse,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/231mb7/update_i_20_f_need_to_tell_my_quadriplegic_dad_46/,"[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ux7wk/i_20_f_need_to_tell_my_quadriplegic_dad_46_m_that/)

First off, I'd really like to thank everyone who commented on my original post.  It was a topic I'd never explained to anyone before. I know it was a while ago, but I thought I'd post an update since there was a bit of response... I know this is a less dramatic and immediate dilemma than most who post on here, so I'll keep it short.

In short, everything has improved dramatically.  Following reddit's advice, when I got back to school in January I sought out counselling through the university.  I've been meeting with a counselor weekly this semester.

At first, I felt extremely uncomfortable and weird trying to explain not just the relationship I have with my Dad, but related anxiety and emotions.  Basically, my counselor admitted that he had no expertise in family cases like mine, but we have ended up talking a lot about, and working through, personal issues of competency, emotional-independence, and overall anxiety.  

Many things have happened in the last few months, and I feel like I've matured a lot.  I've been happier too... which I credit to keeping the part-time job and for the first time having a personal income.  

All this growth of self-respect and independence culminated this week when I had to start making real decisions about what I'm going to do this summer.  My Dad called and started pressuring me for exact dates and times for plane tickets, although I still have over a month left.  I very cautiously told him that we should wait on plane tickets until I knew exactly when I would be in town. He became very upset and angry about me implying that the dates and times would not, in fact, encompass the whole summer.

For the first time in my life, his anger and distress didn't immediately fill me with deep-wrenching guilt and the need to comfort him.  Instead, I took the steps to finalize my decisions... I put in a deposit for a room I'm renting in my college town (I toured it, it's ideal and affordable), talked to my supervisor at work about summer hours, and applied for four other jobs just in case.  (I decided against the internship in Vietnam, which feels a little bit like a shame, but I just love the idea of having nothing to do but work and play in wonderful weather...)  

After talking with my counselor and adviser, I sent out an email to all my family members updating them on my credits, my graduation path, life in general, etc... i included a paragraph about my intention to work and live on my own for the summer.  From my mom, grandparents, brother, and stepdad, the response was overwhelming love and support.  I had forgotten, or not realized ever, maybe, just how much I'm loved and able to talk to my family.

The response from my dad was overwhelmingly negative.  I called him, and on the phone he was distant, unresponsive, and sulky.  He had nothing good to say about my email (even though I'm on track to graduate in only 3 years, and am maintaining a high honors GPA!), and instead, after almost an hour of coaxing and idle, tense chit-chat, told me, in a voice just on the edge of a ""rage,"": ""if it was up to me, you'd be here the whole summer.""  

I'm really proud of myself here, reddit. My immediate instinct was to compromise, shift my tone of voice, do whatever I could to calm him down... Instead, I took a breath and calmly explained to him that I needed to do what was best for me- that I would rather work to break even with rent than not work, and have nothing to do (but be there for him)... that I already had a room, that I was looking forward to it... but most of all, I used a tone of voice that was not too-careful, too is-this-okay? There was no argument.  For the first time, he was upset, I was responsible, and I was not falling apart to please and ease him.

The phone call inevitably ended badly, but last night I called him and asked him to turn on Skype. 
**edit:** occurred to me to expand here... after our bad phone convo, he called and left a message at a time he knew I was in class and wouldn't answer... instead of listening to the voicemail, I waited to call back until I was home, and then called him and was like ""I'm in front of my computer, are you in front of yours?""
We skyped for almost two hours, in which I, as lightheartedly and familiarly as possible, asked him about his day, about his work, how it was going, how he was doing... it was wonderful. He chatted back at me, and every so often would drop an emotional ""hook,"" which I wouldn't respond to. My summer plans didn't come up until the end of the conversation, in which I was once again firm, sure, and removed from his terrible guilt-trip. I think, seeing me over skype talk about it, and smile about it, even while he was inadvertently trying to get to me, changed his mind about the whole thing.  I never imagined how much me not catering to his emotional neediness, would improve my ability to actually have a relationship with him.  It was definitely a step in a new and good direction- he told me he would support me in whatever decision I made, as long as I knew that he missed me horribly.

I came to the realization, thinking about that conversation, that I may never really be able to be my dad's daughter. But as an adult, and as adults who can update each other on their lives and share their feelings without a deep, knot-like obligation to 'deal' with them... I think we may finally form some kind of equal relationship.

In other words reddit, the last few months have been a huge success!  And it definitely started with me posting here. Thank you.

---   
**tl;dr**: Sought counseling and self-improvement to deal with my quadriplegic and emotionally dependent dad, who has resisted me getting a job or living independently since that takes time away from him... Finally was able to talk to him as an equal, force him to accept my plans, and have a real, healthy conversation. "

I've been told I should dress ""business professional."" I'm assuming that means a suit, so I'm planning on purchasing that this week. I'm prepared to spend about $200-300 for this one but probably not much more.

Where can I get a good suit for a lowish price like that? Do I even need to spend that much? Also I am tall and skinny (6'0"" and 150 lbs), so I've always preferred a slimmer fit on the pants. Does that mean I should account for getting it tailored or the pants taken in?

Also on the topic of shoes... I still have the same dress shoes I've had since I was 15 so I think it might be time to replace those as well. Any suggestions on where to buy/ how much to spend?

I live in pittsburgh and the places that come to mind that are near me are macys, burlington coat factory, jcrew, banana republic, jos. a bank, mens wearhouse...

Any and all suggestions (including general suggestions about how I should dress for this interview) would be greatly appreciated!"

231uyz,2,2014-04-14,About Flatlining...,IrishP,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/231uyz/about_flatlining/,"WARNING; there are possible triggers ahead. I try not to talk to much about my sex life, but I can't keep in all details, I must get them out.

EDIT- A little misleading title. I went on a rant that was supposed to be about how it was good that I passed up sex, as I almost had it at the beginning of my flatline. The flatline is pretty much ED leaving your body. 




I want to take all of you back to my 24th day of abstaining from pornography, masturbation, and orgasm. 

I woke up on a Friday heading for a new city to see an awesome band. The city is only two hours away, so my friend and I headed out after class. We went to see one of the most awesome concerts that I've ever seen. 

Before we went up, I decided that I would stay with a girl who is a friend, that I happened to be quite into. Even though we flirted a lot, I never made it clear how I felt. She was out, and I got in at an extremely late hour. After a long day of traveling, I noticed I was sick. This was bad, since the girl texted me telling her it was going to be just us at her place. 

I knew that she wanted to have sex with me. I can tell you right now I was dying to have sex with her. After 24 days of abstaining, I hit a conundrum on the way over there. I remember not thinking about it too much, that either way I would do my thing. Finally, I arrive at her place. 

She was out, so she was a little tipsy. She had on a shirt, and no pants. She was extremely tired when I talked to her on the phone. We decide quickly that it's time for bed. She tells me that I can sleep in either of her roommates rooms, on the couch, or in her bed. I take her bed. When I get in, I said ""I promise not to invade your personal space"". It was one of the most awkward comments I could have made. 

She says to me as I'm getting in, ""SO, was that a lie?"" I tell her no, take a side of the bed, and go to sleep. 

I was up all night thinking about what an idiot I was. I could have had what I wanted from nofap, and have arrived at the destination. I felt like I made a pussy move, not granting myself what I wanted. 

Eventually I fall asleep, when I have an idea; I have all day with her tomorrow. That wasn't me being a pussy back there; it would be totally pussy of me not to tell her at some point tomorrow how I feel, and that I was sick but still wanted her. 

I remember when she woke up, I dropped my voice to the most baritone I could, because I remembered the night before part of my problem was in speaking with a high pitch. She was totally into it, we just enjoyed each other's company in the morning. It was totally easy to move on from the ""mistake"" that I made the night before, once the sun came up. It was a new day, and a day I promised myself to prosper. 

We spent an amazing day together, when we came to a park. I will never forget how awkward and intimidated I was, it was extremely uncomfortable. But eventually, I put my arm around her and say, ""I want to kiss you really badly right now, but I'm sick"". Before I say anything back, she leans her head into my shoulder. Probably the best feeling ever. 

Now I've made out with a bunch of girls before, had some drunken sex, and got a few blowjobs when I was at parties. Let me tell you something-doing something that you feel like you need to be drunk to do when you're sober is incredibly worthwhile. You feel as though you are not only overcoming your dependence on alcohol to lubricate the way you express your intentions, but you also gain the ability to speak truthfully and deal with real women and not hyper-real sex. The way she reacted was one of the most worthwhile things I've seen in NoFap. 

Now looking back, I think that I probably would have had sex with her under different circumstances. If I was with her a week earlier, I would have. If I was with her, not sick, and had spent some time with her before going back to her place, I would have. But it was an awkward situation in the first place, as I had been awkward in expressing my intentions to her. I arrived late at night. Her roommates weren't there, so I thought that she told them to stay out while she bring a guy back. It's pretty obvious she wanted to have sex with me right then and there, but there were a few reasons not to. I was not drunk, she was. That is technically rape, even though I trust her not to get me in trouble with the law. We were both tired. I was sick, even though I used that to rationalize why I didn't go for it. 

I'm now flatlining. It was probably for the best that we didn't have sex, because I probably still have ED. It would have been some wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Gone in the morning. Forgotten forever. 

But now I'm looking forward to her returning. I have improved myself since I left. I now have a job (or at least an interview, which is looking good, and I interviewed for another internship), I've read more books, I'm leaving a lot of the things that I've been so attached to behind. I'm only getting stronger with each day of NoFap.

The point of this post is that you can do two things; be rational, or you can rationalize. We all do this, and are unaware of it. I was actually being quite rational back there if you ask me. I did not want to get her sick. I knew that having sex right then and there was a bad idea. I passed up sex with a beautiful girl, something that many people here and elsewhere would say is ""pussying"" out. But you know what? It doesn't matter. I didn't get laid. So the fuck what. I could have so fucking easily, if I just went for it. I got my validation. I didn't get satisfaction.

But yet, by waiting I think that this fruit will grow into a bigger bush. I have a great feeling about the future. I believe that the decision I made was for the absolute best. I know that when she comes back at around day 140, I am going to be ready for her. I just have to commit to the goddess of NoFap before I can give everything to this girl. Because she is fucking awesome. She is beautiful. She is incredibly intelligent. She is super cultured. I learn so much from being with her. I enjoy things much more when she's around. And I'm really looking forward to getting to know her better. "

Please help,EpicMedic,Marriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/232dpf/weve_only_been_married_for_7_months_and_weve_been/,"Tl;dr 24 y/o wife is depressed and unhappy, doesn't give answer as to why. Married only 8 months and together for 4.5 years. Also dead bedroom of maybe once a month. We're on a 6 week dead bedroom streak right now.  

We're both 24. I'm finishing Paramedic school in a month and then I will be done. No more ""working"" 60-72 hours in a week (normal schedule will be 48 hours 3x per week but I'm doing my internship) it's rough and she's a nurse and also works 3 days a week.  

I'm basically trying to wrap my head around this depression that she has. She won't see a physician, go to a marriage counselor or see a psychiatrist. Her only response to when I ask her or try to talk to her about it is, ""I don't know"" or ""just everything""  

I don't understand what depresses her. We're about to move into a rental home in a nicer area that is closer to her family and mine, our current place is basically ghetto (no offense but I work this district and it's ghetto) and I'm about to finish school giving me more time at home. But I feel like it won't change anything. She is ""always depressed"" but won't talk about it. It's driving me nuts because she won't talk about it and I don't nag her about it because it does no good. We're also in a dead bedroom and maybe have sex once a month and she's recently told me she hates having sex. (she's not cheating she's too lazy to go out or cover anything up and this isn't new)  

Maybe I'm shallow or young and stupid but I feel like I'm too young to waste my 20s with someone like this. Everything was great (kind of) before hand but then we got married and then depression. It's the shittiest feeling in the whole world. I married someone and caused them to become depressed. I'm to the point of calling it quits but I do love her and she does mean the world to me. Just like she's not happy (which I've also asked her what she is un happy about and same response as above) but it's also making me unhappy. I'm constantly led on that we will be intimate or that she says she wants to be intimate then nothing. I don't know what to do anymore

Given that I impress on this internship, I will be offered a place on their Finance graduate scheme in which I will work for them full time and then study for either the ACA, ACCA or CIMA (whichever I choose) whilst I work.

I just have a few quick questions for you guys over here at r/accounting! :)

1) Which qualification would you say is the most well respected/rewarding for a successful career in finance/accounting?

2) What advice would you give to a new intern? Would creating a LinkedIn account before starting be beneficial or would you, as an employee of the firm for example, find it strange for an intern to add you on LinkedIn?

3) Are there any accountants here who have worked for a utility? If so, how was it? Pretty generic question but I'm curious. 

Thanks in advance! "

I recently acquired a full time IT help desk Tier 1 tech support position with no professional experience.  I have about 6 years of college completed most of the course work being computer science or information systems related.  I am close to graduation (an internship + 20ish credits) but my degree will not be officially CS or IS.  I am burnt out on school, but I am constantly being harassed by family members as to when I will graduate.  I want to be a Systems Administrator, and intend to obtain the MCSA, Network+, and possibly the MCSE and CCNA certifications in the next year.

Basically my question is, Is it ok if I work this help desk position for awhile, gain experience and certifications and pursue a systems administration position? or do I really need that piece of paper right away?

How is the community college?

How is the job market? (I've done some internships in the computer science field, well versed with computers)

How is public transportation? Do you need a car?

&gt;&gt;My background
I will try to keep this short.  I had a rough time in my teens and it weighed on me heavily.  I became extremely withdrawn from social interaction and believe I was living with Major Depression (Clinical Depression).  I was never diagnosed, but, met regularly (almost daily) with my schools child and youth counsellor, and twice with her supervisor at the board office. This 'treatment' did not help with the depression, but, I feel as if it helped me avoid attempts at self-harm/subside.

&gt;&gt;Then I was off to College, leaving everything else behind and starting over.  In the beginning I found it extremly difficult to meet people and have casual conversations. I would never approach anyone, and was always looking for a reason to leave and be alone.  This was not what I wanted to happen, so I forced myself to be social with the people in my dorm.  This started as me quietly sitting off to the side (ie- Raj from the Big Bang Theory when a girl is around).  As a way to combat this I began to drink.  It started off as 'normal' college drinking, but when others would tell me how much fun I was when I was drunk, I drank more and more frequently. This went on for about two years, and by the end I was a daily drinker.... I guess an alcoholic. I was not as depressed, but I was no where near happy or even content.

&gt;&gt;That summer I did an internship, which I took seriously.  It kept me busy, and I only drank a handful of nights in those 4 months. I recognized I had a problem with alcohol and decided to avoid it.  The same cycle repeated, but this time I began smoking pot daily and drinking when at bars/parties (1,2 times a month).  The pot felt better for my health, but I was still depressed, and for 3 years I was high daily, smoking multiple times a day.  I would not interact with people unless I was high (everything from work to parties to grocery shopping).

&gt;&gt;It has been 3 years since then; I very rarely smoke or drink now. This is easy because I have almost 0 interaction with people.  I work from home, I live alone, and I move to a different city 3/4 times a year.  I tell my family and other that I move around because I like to see new places, but in reality, it is just a reason for me to justify being alone. The loneliness really started to effect me, and I could feel myself slipping back into a serious bought of Major Depression. I am going to skip some details now and just say that I am really close, or already addicted to cocaine. It started last summer, casually and but I have being using daily for over a month. 

||
:--|:--:|--:
| | 

&gt;&gt;The weekend that just passed, I consumed what I would consider to be a very large amount of cocaine. From Friday around 8pm-Monday around 9am, I had about 6 hours of sleep, and when I was awake I 'dosed' at least once an hour.  I am not a stupid person, I know this is very serious and I am slowly killing myself, and was probably close to overdosing on the weekend. 

&gt;&gt;My fear is what comes next.  I do not feel the euphoria from taking it.  This is why I first started. It was a way for me to be feel energetic, be happy, and easily talk to people. It is difficult to put into words; it allowed me to be who I felt like I was on the inside, I was the person who I wanted to be. Now after my first hit I get an energy rush, and then every hit after that is just me delaying the crash. I am worried that when I stop (I am moving again next week, and will not be able to locate it) I am going to hurt myself; either physically as the depression takes over (which will be compounded by withdrawal) or, I will find a new dealer and will start again...or even worse move on to something heavier (my history points to escalating risks).

||
:--|:--:|--:
| | 

&gt;I asked the above question because   

**I have done a lot of research on the internet. More than a quick google and wikipedia read.  I have spent hours and hours reading sites, blogs, boards, news articles, journal articles**   
&gt;about they types of depression, types of anxiety and treatment options.  

&gt;Based on how I feel during my times of sobriety (sober for months at a time),  

**I am convinced that I have depression.**
&gt;It is hard for me to determine the narrow type, I think I have Dysthymia, and at times will have Major Depression Episodes.  There is probably some socially anxiety type of disorder mixed in as an side effect of the depression.

||
:--|:--:|--:
| | 

&gt;&gt;I have decided (aka scared myself) to finally seek proper treatment.  I want to stop now before I completely loose control, but, I know if I require more than therapy and am looking to be prescribed something.  Ideally, I will have both psychological and pharmaceutical routes. I have looked into SSRIs, but am conceded with the side-effects, and, believe that Bupropion will be a better option for me. However, I am willing to try whichever the doctor thinks is best.

2338cu,4,2014-04-15,"I'm (23m) thinking about breaking up with my gf (23f), but I'm afraid I'm being a douchebag because of the reasons. Am I?",Gladrias,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2338cu/im_23m_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my_gf_23f/,"Sorry for the long post. 

**Context:**
Me (23m) and my gf (23f) have been together for 6 years. We met at a bar when we were both 17 (legal drinking age here was 16) and graduating from different high-schools at the time. I started flirting with her and a week later we had a date. On that date we started the relationship. I was her first boyfriend, while I already had 2 really short, sexual relationships. 

When we were 18 we decided to live together, because we already did at her and my parents house, and I really wanted to leave my parents. We were both in university at that time.
After my 19th birthday, she got really depressed. She disliked the neighborhood and really missed her parents and sister (they only lived a 20 min bicycle ride away) and was thinking about dropping out of her course. Our sex-live turned from active to nonexistent at this time, for the first time. 

She decided that she wanted to move back in with her parents. Leaving me on my own in the apartment, but we didn’t break up. 

I got really bored  and lonely and I didn't take good care of myself. 
In the weekends she would come over, and those really where good times. Because I missed her every week, it was really nice to see her in the weekends. I lived a strange life back then, depressed during the week, and as happy as ever in the weekends. Our relationship and our sex-live peeked in those weekends. 

Close to her 21st birthday we decided that we wanted to live together again, in another apartment, another neighborhood and within a 5 minute walking distance to her and my parents house. And for about half a year our relationship was the same as it was when we were living apart form each other. 

That’s when our sex live turned nonexistent again. I confronted her about this, without blaming her. She tried to think about it more, or let me get her turned on more often and we even tried some things to spice our sex live up a bit, that really helped.
 
About half a year ago things have changed again, and for the worse. 

**Here are the problems:**

*we really live alongside each other now*


* i’m working on a graduation project, a start up and I do freelance work 


* she’s working as an intern, follows classes, has a parttime job and is a very active moderator for a healthy lifestyle community


* when I’m with her (at home) she’s really obsessed with her phone (moderating and social media i guess)


* we only get to have one evening to spend together other than falling asleep next to each other because


   * our friday-evening turned into a weekly visit of her younger sister (18) which I have to stay home for


   * she plans our saturday-evenings by going to mutual friends or to her parents house (although I want to plan an evening together for months now)


*bad sex-live*


* we only have sex twice a month and what we did to spice things up, is not going to happen anymore


* she makes fun of my sexual urges, like i am the bad guy for having them


* the circumstances have to be perfect for her


* she lacks experience and won’t try new things anymore


* sometimes sex only leads to me making her cum, without her doing anything for me (the other way around is even out of the question)


*she has terrible double standards with me*

**example 1:** at sunday she wants to go to bed early because she has riste at six in the morning on monday (she works as an intern on monday and tuesday) and she leaves me to do the dishes,  feed the cats, scoop the cat-litter, while I have to get up at six in the morning too (and unlike her I have to rise at six all of the working week). When I confront her about this, she just doesn’t see what’s wrong with this. 

**example 2:** she works at saturday and sunday, so I have to do the groceries and housecleaning, although she’s mostly free on thursday and friday. I asked her frequently if she could do the housecleaning if she has those days off. The only problem is that I always have to ask her

I really don't know what I want anymore. I have a feeling I've tried fixing our relationship enough. I still love her, but I'm afraid what the future will bring. If our relationship is so bad right now, how will it be 10 years from now? 


**tl;dr:** we hardly have compassionate moments anymore. it seems like she's not interested in me anymore too. Am I right by wanting to break up with her?

I've tried talking with her but she dismisses the problems with excuses. Formatting edited thanks to: Falco98"

233l9c,0,2014-04-15,Quitting my stable managerial role to move to contracting/freelancing for a US company while in the UK. Any advice?,smellslikecatsfarts,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/233l9c/quitting_my_stable_managerial_role_to_move_to/,"Hi, 

As the title says - I'm potentially going to be looking to quit my steady low-lever managerial role in a telecommunications company in the UK to become a self employed web developer contractor/freelancer for one sole company that I worked for during my internship whilst at university. 

I'm currently in the research stage, looking at the best/easiest/cheapest way to accomplish something that's mutual benefical for both the US company and myself. 

I'm currently on £24,000 + company car (no fuel), and the US company have said that my salary of £30,000 ($50,000) is within their budget, so I could potentially earn more that £30,000. 

I have a friend who works for Parasol Group (an umbrella company) and she swears by them. I've also looked into this route, and although it's likely to be the more costlier route, it's both easier/less hassle than becoming a Sole Trader or LTD company as I know there's a lot of paper work, and I'd have to save 1/3 of my monthly salary, and pay all my tax in one lump sum.

My only concern with the US company is that they would need to pay me in GBP if I were to take the Umbrella company route, which I don't think is possible (they're a small digital agency in the midwest). 

Which route would you recommend? This opportunity is too good to miss, and I just want to get all my options laid out before I make a decision. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice, or has done something similar? 

Anything would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
23406r,2,2014-04-15,Applying to grad schools,theophrastzunz,compmathneuro,https://www.reddit.com/r/compmathneuro/comments/23406r/applying_to_grad_schools/,"I've posted this question to /r/gradadmissions, but I also want to hear what people in the field have to 

I want to do a PhD in computational neuroscience (leaning towards high-dimensional statistics) in the US and that's been my dream ever since I started university. The last of applications were depressing and now I'm wondering what 'else' I can do to improve my chances.

I've graduated from a liberal arts and sciences in college in Europe, associated with a good research school. I got a fair GPA 3.75 with a very strong upward trend in my last year. Had a half-year stint at a top research university in the US, where I took grad courses, but couldn't get an internship. I spent the last 2 years working as an RA, because I couldn't afford a MSc. I published 2 papers as first author in Neuron. They don't exactly match my interests as they are in biophysical models. I'm going to a conference, a computational neuroscience summer school and I'm networking as much as I can.

Now, this shouldn't be too bad, but the competition for the PhD's I'm interested in is insane. Five hundred people, 10-15 spots and at most 2 spots for internationals. I've tried last year and I didn't even make it to the interviews. What can I do to make myself more competitive?

I took the GRE and got V170 Q166. Should I take a subject GRE?

Can I apply for funding independently of the department? I could only think of the Fullbright, but my national division of the organization refuses to even consider my candidacy, because I studied abroad. Are there any other scholarships for international students?

I've been accepted at couple of paid MSc in Germany and Switzerland but I worry they won't improve my chances for a PhD and furthermore I'm already quite old so I'll be done with the MSc's at age 27. Could my age be a hurdle? Is it wise to start one of the MSc's and apply concurrently for a PhD? Will dropping an MSc have 'repercussions'?

TL;DR: Why won't they love me?

234by8,11,2014-04-15,I'm [19 F] starting to resent my boyfriend [21 M].,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/234by8/im_19_f_starting_to_resent_my_boyfriend_21_m/,"Like the title says, I've been recently feeling really resentful towards my boyfriend lately. I love him to bits and I intend to stay with him but I'm really having a hard time trying to stifle these feelings. 

It starts off with my parents. Whenever I talk to one of them, especially my dad, and tell them that I'm doing something, the first thing they ask is if he's coming with me. Ever since I started at college, they've basically drilled it in my head that he should be with me at all times. I'm very independent (I get it from my mother so I'm not sure why she's treating me this way) so this takes a huge toll on me. Yesterday, when I called my dad and casually mentioned that I was going out with my coworkers, the first thing he asked is if my boyfriend was coming. I said no and that my boyfriend often hangs out with his coworkers and I'm never invited. My dad (jokingly) said that it was different, but I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I feel like he's more of my babysitter than anything. Even my roommates question it when he's not there some nights during the week. It's like I can't even spend a night or two alone. I love that everyone loves him, but I can't stand how suffocated I feel by the situation.

This past weekend was the first full weekend (Friday morning to Monday night) we've been apart in about a year. We both had to work. It honestly felt great. I'm looking forward to it happening again this weekend and I'm even considering going home for a few days, so we'd really be apart from Friday morning to about Tuesday or Wednesday night. I was able to clean my room this weekend (he's really messy when he's over and I hate that) and relax by myself and do a bit of shopping. It was great. Things are a little better now that I have my own car since I don't have to rely on him for rides or ask for permission to use his car, but I still feel like I can't go anywhere without bringing him along or telling him, even if I'm just going to the grocery store. He does things all the time without telling me but it's like I'm not allowed to do that. Once, last year, I went out clubbing for the first time with a few friends and he barely spoke to me for two days. He ruined the first good night I'd had in weeks. I don't feel like he's controlling or anything, he just breathes down my neck too much sometimes.

Now, on top of feeling like he's my babysitter, I'm starting to resent him for his job situation. He works (and is paid for) about 30 hours/week, and actually does about 15 hours worth of work. I currently work about 40 hours a week, and with all that I do, I'm paid for 16 hours worth of overnight shifts. It's obviously not anyone's fault and I'm trying to find another job, but it sucks. It's not like the money really makes a difference. We both get enough financial aid to be able to survive without jobs, but it makes me so upset that I do so much and get so little back from it. Don't get me wrong, I love what I do, but the day he told me he was gonna start getting paid for what was supposed to be a volunteer position, I honestly broke down. 

It's not like he's stingy with his money either; he often takes me out or gets me little surprises, but I don't know. I feel bad that I can't pull my own weight often. I should be making more than him with all I do and I'm not.

Like, right now, he's out to lunch when he should be at his his internship. I'm taking a brief respite from doing admin work and grading papers at my internship to get this all out before I start to cry. A lot of it comes down to feeling like he'll get into graduate school for the program we're both in because, on paper, his internship is better than all the fieldwork and internships I do. I have a higher GPA and I'm good at standardized testing, but it feels like none of that even matters. 

Sorry for making this so long. Thanks for reading though.

Edit: I've tried to talk to him about this, but it's never been easy for me to get the point across. I need tips on how yo address this. 


TL;DR I'm feeling resentful towards my boyfriend of two years because I feel like he doesn't deserve his salary and he treats me like a child he babysits. "

High storage would be preferred because I'm also going to be storing my music, movies, and TV shows on it as well.  I would love to be able to run most triple a titles at max settings.  Ideally I'd love to spend about $1000 on this PC but I don't know if that's reasonable, so I'm willing to go up to $1500.

235dgz,8,2014-04-15,[21 F] I feel like my boyfriend [22 M] is not supporting me or going out of his way to help me (1 1/2 long relationship),[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/235dgz/21_f_i_feel_like_my_boyfriend_22_m_is_not/,"So today I received news that I was asked to attend a second round interview for an internship that I'm pursuing. However, they only notified me today (around 2 pm) that they need me to come in tomorrow from 9:15 AM-5:30 PM. The thing is, I live 3 hours away from this office and so I would need to leave my house at the latest at 5:30 AM (in case there is traffic etc.) and I would start my drive home during rush hour and likely get back around 9 PM.

 The interview is a day long process and I'm very nervous/stressed about it. What I'm concerned about is the driving and being alert on the road and navigating through highways and roads I'm unfamiliar with. This whole prospect makes me more anxious and I would feel completely more comfortable if I had someone with me. I'm terrified of dozing off at the wheel and being exhausted and getting lost etc. The first person I think of who would be willing to go with me is my boyfriend. We are both in school and I am having to miss all three of my classes. My boyfriend has one class tomorrow (a freshman history class) evening in which he has a quiz. 

I asked him to go with me, to help me drive since it would make things easier and I would feel a lot less anxious and worried. 'He said no way, its too much to ask of him. I've begged him to talk to his teacher about rescheduling the quiz. I dont have money to stay the night before at a hotel. 

I normally don't ask him huge favors or for large sacrifices. I feel like I would completely be willing to help him out in a situation in which he feels very uncomfortable and nervous about. He sees me as being completely unreasonable and crazy for begging him to go with me. 

The thing that gets me is, it may not be a big deal for him to have to drive through unknown roads and be tired and what not, but for me IT IS. This is one of the few times I can remember in which I am truly asking him to please put himself aside and do this for me, because it would make me feel so much more calm and focused on my day ahead and less worried that I'll be exhausted on my drive home after waking up at 4:30 AM that same day. 

This isn't the first time I feel like he isn't willing to sacrifice something for me or help me out. I feel like this situation is kind of indicative of bigger issues in our relationship. 

---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend won't drive with me for 6 hours to a job interview that I am nervous about. I am scared of falling asleep at the road on my way home and he thinks I am being unreasonable to ask him to miss a class (and rescuedule a quiz) to drive with me in order to make me feel more comfortable.

I got turned down for an internship, saw a post that my crush put up of another guy, and just felt as though I wasn't very productive. I think I'm heading out of the flatline, and it's a way slower lift-off than what I was expecting. 

I think that people out there should know that there is a hard side of NoFap, something that is totally unexpected. Trust me when I tell you that the emotional side of nofap is the hardest part, not abstaining from masturbating. I just feel so depressed some days, and today is one. There is no reason for this, except for irrational behavior after treating an addiction. 

I just deleted my Facebook, as I never had these stupid, over-insightful stories in front of me. I created one recently to be part of a study. I think that Facebook makes us read too much into other people, as I have seen in myself. I will stay away, as I feel as though it is a dangerous trap that I am messing with. 

You need to be mindful everyday of nofap. Even though today was tough and I hang my head low, tomorrow will be a new day. Day 57. I'm thinking that the last thirty days I keep myself a journal..."
235om8,8,2014-04-16,Everything I ever wanted to tell you,[deleted],UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/235om8/everything_i_ever_wanted_to_tell_you/,"A,

I made the mistake of not giving you the space or time.  I didn’t respect your needs.  Even now, I am once again interfering with your space to tell you this.  I  have to carefully consider what I did to you, and now I am only realizing the full extent of the errors in judgment I made.    Instead of giving what you needed, I responded with what I wanted. I suffocated you. It was not a hallmark of a true friend.  I am happy that you have moved on, and that you might have found someone to make you happy.  I am sorry I was immature in my actions.  I can’t offer you a good explanation for my actions because they were inexcusable no matter what my intentions were.  For what it is worth, you were a good friend to me.  You tried and that is all I can ask of you.  To ask anymore at this point would be a disservice to our friendship.   

All the text messages that I sent to you in the last couple of weeks were a mistake.  I was upset about the situation, and I did not handle it maturely.  I have been bouncing around from high and low, from anger to disappointment, to sadness.  My emotions were unfairly targeted to you at some points.  I knew it was stupid, but I did it anyway.  I didn’t want to lose you, and by doing what I did, I guaranteed that fate.  I knew that what I was doing was a mistake at the time, yet I did it.  I can’t offer any good excuse for what I did.  I have spent the last several weeks struggling to figure out what to tell you. How to win you back.  I have come to conclusion that I have to accept your decisions, and I can’t fight this anymore.  I am sorry that it has taken me so long to make this realization.  If I had been more patient I might have not lost you in the first place.  I used you as a crutch for working out my feelings and that is inexcusable.  

I don’t like failing like this, especially to someone that was important to me, but I did fail.  I can’t erase the past, and at this point you have no reason to trust me.  You have no reason to be my friend because of what I did. I enjoyed being your friend.  Despite how it ended, or maybe due to how it ended, you taught me some very important life lessons. I am grateful for the time we spent together, and the memories we shared.  I wish it could have lasted longer, but I can’t alter the past no matter how much I want.  

Words cannot express my anguish at hurting you, and driving you away.  I have spent the last several weeks reflecting on my mistakes.  I ask for your forgiveness, and for you to grant me the opportunity to make amends.  It took me longer than I thought to put my house in order, but now I feel I am ready to make the necessary changes to revive our friendship.

I know this is a difficult request to grant, I only wish to right the past wrongs, and reestablish our friendship on a solid foundation.  I don’t expect immediate forgiveness and absolution for my mistakes.  Your friendship was something I treasured.  You helped through one of the toughest periods of my life.  You gave me strength to continue. If it wasn't for your presence I would not be here today feeling the deep remorse at losing you.  You are someone I greatly admire.  For your gift of friendship I will always be grateful.  

I am not a perfect person, I have made a lot of mistakes in my life.  Very rarely do we get second chances, so I know I am asking something significant from you.  If you agree to give me one more chance I would like to sit down with you and work out what steps I need to take to restore your trust in me.

There are three things you should know about me.  The first is that I am loyal to all people I consider my friends, I will move mountains for them.  The second thing is I love each and every one of my friends, they are like family to me.  The last thing and most important thing, is if I have wronged a friends, I will do everything in my power to correct it.  

The last thing I want to do right now is to make you feel pressured to make a decision.  I want you to feel comfortable letting me come back into your life.  I do sincerely want to make amends to you.  I don’t want to stop you pursuing relationships with other people, I only want to be friends again.  I made the mistake of misinterpreting you intentions, and I don’t want to make that mistake again.  I understand if it is too soon and the wounds have not healed. 

I hope you are doing well.  I know your internship is coming to an end soon, and I want to extend my congratulations for a successful year in a field you are passionate about.  My Door Will always be open to you.  If we never see each other again, I hope you will find someone special someday.  Someone that can accept you better than I did.  I wish you the best, and a future of joy and happiness.  I hope that you will fulfill your dreams and ambitions.  I know you will become a wonderful teacher.  I am proud of what you have accomplished, and who you are.  

May the road rise up to meet you.

May the wind always be at your back

May the sun shine warm upon your face,

And the rains fall soft upon your fields. 

And until we meet again,

May god hold you in the hollow of His Hand.

235sdf,6,2014-04-16,High school junior looking for a paid internship to gain experience/knowledge. Need some tips/advice. Am I being too ambitious?,thecolombianjesus,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/235sdf/high_school_junior_looking_for_a_paid_internship/,"***Bless your soul if you read this entire thing. I really appreciate it.***

Hi guys. I'm currently a junior in high school. I took Web Design I this year, intrigued by the idea of web design/development. I fell in love with the class from the start. Learning the basics of HTML and CSS sparked my interest in building websites. I delved into Codecademy, starting reading blogs/articles on web design (many of them coming from this amazing subreddit!), making my own little projects in my spare time, and am currently reading *Javascript: The Definitive Guide* in hopes of becoming a better front-end developer. 

Ever since I was a kid I have loved computers. I enjoy technology and digital media, unleashing the creative side of me in terms of having a keen eye for design. After extensive hours of research and thought, I have decided that I want to follow the career path of a Front-End Developer.

As a 17 year old in high school, having a job is of somewhat importance to me. A source of income to fund my technological desires or social activities is extremely helpful. However, trying to balance schoolwork, a job, the gym, and a girlfriend is a lot to undertake. This is why I don't want just any boring retail/fast food job that will serve me no benefit in the future. However, if I am able to get a paid internship at some sort of local web design/development agency where I am able to work in a professional environment and gain some experience pertaining to the industry while also acquiring new knowledge each and every day then the long term benefits are tremendous. I will be ahead of the game when I enter college and will hopefully have an easier time finding another internship, or maybe even a full time job, as a Front-End Developer. 

Now, for those of you thinking, *""Well do you have what it takes?""* Considering I'm only going off of what I've learned in a years worth of my Web Design class, and through my own personal effort to learn more about HTML/CSS/JS, I believe that an internship would be a whole new experience for me; one that will be challenging yet rewarding.

In terms of my portfolio/personal achievements so far, I won 1st place in the Web Design division for a local school district competition between all the high schools in my county. **Here's the [link](http://everyday-auto.corenode.io)** to the site (Sorry if it's slow. It's being hosted off of my dropbox). I also worked with a group of 4 fellow club members to design and build a website for a state competition, in which we placed 4th **(I can get the link to this site upon request. I don't have the files uploaded right now)**. I am also currently working on a site for my friend's mom's cleaning business, which will hopefully feature a flat &amp; responsive design.

As you can see, I am very serious about my future. I want to take steps as early as I can to fulfill my ambition for success in my future career. So therefore my question is: **How should I go about finding a paid internship at a local web design/development firm that will actually look into a 17 year old high school student like me? Are my ambitions too far-fetched? Anything I can improve on/learn?** I'm all ears to constructive criticism!

Thanks!

235twj,0,2014-04-16,I'm slightly worried about my class performance affecting a firm's opinion of me.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/235twj/im_slightly_worried_about_my_class_performance/,"More information: I'm a junior Accounting major/Econ minor with a Big 4 Audit internship for this summer. I have to take 18 credits/semester (means 6 classes, most people take 5) in order to reach 150, and I also work two part-time jobs on campus. 

So far, things have been going mostly fine. My GPA when I applied was 3.55, now it's about 3.48. My accounting grades should be pretty much fine, I might get a C in my Intermediate Accounting this semester though. My main concern is that I am currently failing an Econometrics class, and probably the best I can do is pull it up to a D (MAYBE a C if the teacher is super nice). The teacher said that this would still count as passing, so it shouldn't affect me getting 150 credits. The main thing is that the lowest grade on my transcript when they looked was a B-, whereas now there will be Cs and maybe even a D. 

I'm not really all that concerned about my GPA personally, but I hope they don't see this as a significant drop in my grades and re-consider the offer. I don't remember exactly that they said about maintaining grades over the remainder of my schooling... 
Should I bring it up, or just assume they won't ask? "

I'm French and moving to Paris for 8 months, including 6 during which I'll be doing an internship in the luxury business (which is why I need to wear casual but elegant clothing at work).
As a personal challenge, I have chosen to only take a (big) backpack with me, and a handbag (big enough for carrying my computer). 

Here is my packing list. Do you think I've forgotten some important stuff, or there are some things that I absolutely don't need? (For the first few weeks I'll be staying at friends' or couchsurfing, until I find a small flat to move in.)


BACKPACK

-Power strip

-Small purse (for work and going out)

-Plastic cups (so I don't need a glass immediately when I move)

-A Thermos food container (also works for liquids)

-A plastic lunchbox I can use every day

-1 or 2 washing cloths (my mom has many of those in very high quality)

-A towel

-My toiletries and makeup box, which is the size of a small purse

-Glasses and sunglasses

-1 large T-Shirt as a pajama

-A small purse of jewelry

-Underwear

-Work shoes (high heels) and casual (light) shoes

-2 pairs of work pants, 2 skirts (one for work, one casual), 1 jean

-Sports clothes (one top, one legging)

-2 pullovers

-2 tank tops, 2 work tops, 1 casual T-Shirt

-A formal business ensemble

-1 small black dress

-1 rain jacket


HANDBAG

-1 pen

-Pair of scissors

-File for paper documents (insurance mostly) + Times covers (not heavy, doesn't take much place in the file and makes nice decoration for an apartment wall)

-Ethernet cable (often better quality than wifi)

-Notebook

-Computer, charger, mouse and mousepad

-Earphones

-Deodorant

-Wallet

-Phone &amp; charger


WORN WHEN GOING THERE

-A scarf

-Sports shoes (since the casual shoes are much lighter and smaller, and I can't travel with high-heeled shoes since they aren't very comfortable, especially with such weight to carry)

-Jeans

-A pullover

-A top that's fit for going to work

-A warm jacket



What do you think? What could I take off this list, what else should I take?

EDIT: forgot phone &amp; charger

236eds,2,2014-04-16,My [f18] boyfriend [m19] of almost two years doesn't think it'll work only because of the possibility of meeting someone someday that might be a better fit. (long story),[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/236eds/my_f18_boyfriend_m19_of_almost_two_years_doesnt/,"Our relationship is extremely complicated. Junior year of high school, I was head over heels for this guy and unfortunately, he seemed to be after one of my friends. Before my feelings had developed, I asked this friend if she felt anything for me (because she knew how he felt) and she gave me the okay to go for him. So I went; I had never had a boyfriend before but I don't think I really ever tried that hard to be with someone. Well, two weeks later, she up and decides that perhaps she did like him and pretty much just ruined our friendship (although we never fought about it, and I've forgiven her, I can't trust her anymore). They end up getting closer and closer for about a month but never even dated when she once again decided that it wasn't anything real. She thought she liked him, but turns out, she just wanted him as a friend. This was the closest that he ever got to having a girlfriend so he took it pretty hard for a while. Meanwhile, I'm still hurting from them being together in the first place. I had shared a class with both of them and I know that it was one of the hardest things that I had to sit through each and everyday. I tried to recover and I told myself that I didn't like him anymore. And then I was no longer drooling after him. I lived my life (and I was also going through a lot of problems trying to find the right friends so I was alone for most of the time) and thought I moved on. Senior year rolls around, and he knew I probably still liked him and so he kept trying to get himself to like me back. Eventually, we got to talking, the timing and pieces fell just right and by November of that year, we started dating. It was ridiculous for me because I never even imagined that this would happen and for a few months after that, I had trouble believing that it was actually happening. I was scared to fall in love because I was afraid it was all a fluke. We had a first kiss. I went to my first prom. We moved much faster than I would've liked and rushed into things I wasn't ready for, but I adjusted. We graduated and spent the whole summer together and he was attending a state university in town and I was moving six hours away for a rigorous school specialized specifically for my job field. We agreed to try our best to make our LDR work. I always got a bit nervous and jealous when he would hang out with that girl (his friend) from junior year. He had forgiven her completely but I still had trouble trusting her. He said that he would decline invitations to go hang out with her, but if she happened to drop by while he was with friends in public, he wouldn't do anything. I thought it was fair enough. We've gotten through 2/3rds of the year fine (it was tough and we did fight occasionally) but it wasn't until this last month and a half that we had one of the biggest issues we've ever had. I get irrationally depressed the week before my period and it just kind of lasts through the period. I probably had one of my lowest of lows this time around because the timing was awful; he just started becoming friends and hanging out with this attractive physics lab partner. That same day that he spent a few hours with her playing his favorite game, he also was with this girl from junior year simultaneously. My emotions felt so intense, and I know I was wrong to take it out on him, but I just kept trying to voice my concerns. He never really definitely dispelled them either. I asked him to just take a break from hanging out with the two of them because I could not handle the things I was feeling. I knew it was unfair of me to ask, but my heart could not stand it. I really was trying to get used to the idea of it so that I wouldn't be this irrational. He agreed; one day while we were video chatting (which we hadn't really been able to do as often lately) it was past the time that we agreed to set out for each other. So he says he's leaving to go hang out with the ""junior year"" girl. I couldn't have felt more hurt in that one moment than I did in our entire relationship so far. And of course, I got upset and he postponed meeting her and eventually she left. I found out later that he did in fact go meet her that night though. I trust him to not do anything but it still doesn't make my heart any less restless. A week or so ago, he applied for an internship where his lab partner works. He says this could turn into a career, he doesn't know. Fundamentally, with our relationship, I feel as though I'm putting in more effort than he is. I'm always the one to WANT to talk to him and call him and text him. I constantly slip his mind and he always wants to hang out with other people. I've tried to be patient with him but I got lonely. Everytime we would talk, things always got serious and he hated that. He just wanted to casually talk and have a good time. But I couldn't help this doubts and fears I had on my mind constantly. Two days ago, after I kept pressuring him to tell me what he actually thinks about these things that I've been worried about, he finally lays everything on the table. He doesn't dispel these doubts because they have some truth to them. Out of our high school, he believes I was the best choice for him. But that doesn't mean that in this entire world of billions of people, I am the best choice for him. This is both our first relationship and I think he wants to try other people. He said that one day, if someone came along that he thought he was more compatible with, he wouldn't leave me for her, but rather unintentionally resent me for having this obligation to stay with me. He knows that to have someone at their best, he needs to be there at their worst. He told me that the weeks we had our low, I was at my very worst. And he couldn't handle it. He said he absolutely did not deserve me at my best.  I asked him what we should do and after a few hours of talking, he didn't want to, but it's the only thing his mind would lead to, and he truly thought it was the best move: we should break up. I don't think I've ever had my life crumble so fast in front of my eyes. But after a few minutes, we decided perhaps it would be best to stick it out until I got home from college. We know that once I get home and we can be intimate together, it'll all seem fine. It's just the LDR part that seems to be too much for him. I'm willing to make it work by any means possible, but he knew that I loved him more than he loves me. The fact remains that he still loves me. Aside from fear of future possibilities and the difficulties of long distance, our relationship is great. So I feel like it's so stupid to just throw away something perfectly fine (but not easy) just because of ""possibilities"". That night, after we agreed to try to stay together, I called him desperately begging for him to try his best to change his mind and stop thinking that way. I pleaded him to give me a chance to work on my ""worst"" so that it can perhaps be tolerable. I can only be better if I decide to work on myself. I just don't feel that he will try his best because he's notorious for not liking to work for things, whereas I can be a workaholic. And yesterday, I kept thinking about the situation and knew that once we called it off, I would be in pain much much longer than he would. He deals with his problems by compartmentalizing and just ignoring them. And it always works, except with deep stuff way underneath, which is why we've arrived at this giant issue to begin with. I kept thinking that this summer, I would have to be the best I could be and being a better girlfriend, I had to break it off because I feel like he'll always resent me for trying to make it work when he believes someone else out there could be better. I've talked to two friends in private about this issue and each time, I'm sobbing hysterically with snot incessantly drooping out of my nose. I had started to love him so hesitantly because I feared this exact issue might one day arise and now my heart is in pieces, even though we are still together. I start doubting if he even really liked me in the first place because he told me he actively tried so hard to like me back in the beginning and he wonders if that was a mistake or not entirely genuine. When we talk not, we kind of just avoid serious things, or discussion about our life after this year, or if we make it long distance for three more years, life after college. We've been trying to keep it positive and just good vibes. And yesterday, I came to acceptance to just throw away all those ideas of me ending it during the summer. Instead, I'm just going to try to be the very best version of me I can be so that I won't have any regrets on my end of things. I tried my best and it hopefully it'll be enough for him. One day, I'll let him decide whether or not he can't stand me anymore and I'll let him go (hopefully, smoothly and acceptingly; I know it'll hurt no matter what though). 
But now, today, each night I lie in bed thinking these thoughts. Each morning I wake up, having forgot momentarily everything that happened, and then it floods back to me and next thing I know, I'm running to the bathroom to cry my eyes out, careful not to wake my room mate. I don't know what's the best thing to do and how to deal with these things. It hurts so much more than it should because I'm so young and he was my first everything. I know that I'm strong and if it doesn't work out, one day I will find someone where it can. But I don't even know how to live life without him anymore. I have to lose not only him, but his family members, and probably some of our mutual friends because I'm long distance friends with them. I think he might've started thinking of these possibilities because he became friends with that lab partner, but who knows. I certainly don't. He doesn't tell me these controversial underlying thoughts. I'm just so lost and need some advice or even just to talk. "

236rfl,1,2014-04-16,"Me [29F] with my sister [26F]: bad blood between us, relationship in shambles, don't know what to do",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/236rfl/me_29f_with_my_sister_26f_bad_blood_between_us/,"Bad blood between me 29F and my sister 26F and not sure what to do now. 

I’m not sure what to do. There’s a lot of bad blood between me and my sister, which has been made worse by her physical and mental health state. 

Background on my sister: My sister, 26F, has had a lot of issues in the past. She’s been in several car wrecks (none were her fault) that resulted in a traumatic brain injury, and slipped disks which lead to spinal fusion surgery. She’s also suffering from PTSD (resulting from a traumatic incident with a guy), frequent panic attacks, and extreme anxiety. Also, she has always presented with extremes in moods (even when we were kids). Needless to say she’s struggling with so much. Currently she’s seeking therapy regularly (3 times a week I think). 

Background on our relationship: We’ve never been close. As kids we fought a lot - as much or more than most siblings. I don’t remember a time when we were buddy/buddy. We weren’t close growing up, and haven’t been close as adults. There’s a long long list of things she blames me for, but I’m not convinced it’s things I deserve to be blamed for. 

I wasn’t going to post a lot of examples or background of what I’m being blamed for, but my reactions and current state of emotion on the whole thing don’t make much sense without context. So here’s a long list of things I’m still being blamed for over &amp; over again, some of which are 10+ years old…..

1. Not stopping bullying in high school (10+ years ago). 
2. Not coming home immediately from across the country when she was in a car wreck that didn’t have any immediately apparent injuries, but ultimately she had a traumatic brain injury from (9 years ago). 
3. We were roommates in college for 2 years but I worked 3 jobs and wasn’t there for 24/7, which she is mad about (7-8 years ago). 
4. I graduated college on her birthday, therefore ruining her special day, which she made sure to voice repeatedly (7 years ago). 
5. For not putting forth enough effort to be friends and to hang out frequently when I was in grad school (4-7 years ago). 
6. For being good friends with her ex-best friend. She thinks her ex-best friend is trying to get close to be as revenge (this is ongoing….)
7. For not going to more than 2 family therapy sessions (1 year ago). 
8. She was raped, and that’s my fault. (6 months ago)

My side of the above: 

1. I didn’t know bullying was going on, I never saw it. And nobody told me it happened until literally three weeks ago, which was 10+ years later. 

2. My parents said she was fine, and my internship ended 3 weeks later and I came home then. 

3. I worked 3 jobs and was in college full time. I wasn’t even there for myself 24/7. 

4. I didn’t plan college graduation… 

5. I was in the field 5+ days a week and in class the others. I didn’t see much of anyone. 

6. Her ex-best friend is the younger sister of MY best friend. I’ve known her for 20 years. Us being friends isn’t a recent development. 

7. I tried to make more, but in the 6 weeks she was in the outpatient therapy place I was out of town for 2 of those and in the field the rest of the time for work. My job requires long and early hours and lots of time in remote locations but I left work early on the days that I could to make appointments. 

8. She says it’s my fault she was raped because she doesn’t have any friends and I never invite her to hang out, so she tried to make new friends and then this happened. 


I’m not trying to justify my actions by explaining my side, I just feel like both sides are useful in seeing what’s actually happening and both sides matter to the story. 

My mom says I need to just accept all the things she blames me for, let her be angry, and just say “ok sorry” to everything. But I don’t think that’s fair. What about my feelings? My mom said its not about my feelings. Except that if I’m involved, so are my feelings. 

I’ve reached my max capacity for coping with this. I don’t want to be involved anymore. Of course I wish my sister will be able to heal mentally &amp; physically, and live a normal life. It’s the point though where talking to my parents on the phone stresses me out so much that I get chest pains. I cannot physically handle the stress anymore of being the perceived source of everyone’s problems in the family. 

I love my parents and the rest of my family, and want to continue a good relationship with them. I just don’t know what to do about my relationship with my sister. And am I in the wrong for any of this? If her blame is legit, please tell me. I just need advice and outside opinions… Thanks!

---   
**tl;dr**: My sister and I don’t get along. She blames me for lots of things, but I think the blame is misplaced. Our relationship is in shambles. What do I do?"

I have a sit down interview for a data scientist intern position(year long). I am a currently a 2nd year Math Bsc (Math major in the states?). I was wondering what sort of prep I should do for the interview?

I am taking the Coursera ""Big Data"" course that just started, and working my way through the modules. 

My background is just my 2/3 years of my maths degree, which has a focus on data analysis/modelling and statistics and also pure maths such as multi variate calculus.

Any help/material that I can use to prepare for the interview would be much appreciated. 
Thanks!"

2373o0,96,2014-04-16,"UPDATE 2: UPDATE: Me [21 F] with my father [50s], where is the line when it comes to my education and life in general, and is he crossing it?",throwawaymyparents,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2373o0/update_2_update_me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where/,"[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22lvy3/me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the_line_when/) [Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22uusu/update_me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/)

I'd just like to start this by saying during my father's visit here he told me he wanted me to touch base with the family therapist in general. Also, he left his push to talk cellphone behind. He's not tech savvy, barely uses it, and rarely keeps it on. He also has my old cellphone and my stepmom's old cellphone that can be activated for no charge. My classes run all day long and I have had project after project due almost every day. I'll try to get it to the post office but I've been delaying it for my own work which he's well aware of and was a witness to.

Anyway, back to the update. I'm still getting emails and calls from him, my grandma, and stepmom about the internship. Now he's saying his life is on the line because I have his cellphone. I have 48 hours to get it to him or else.  As well as the internship updates. I'll try to get to the post office today if I can but that's the most contact I plan on giving him.

Also, he said my update to the therapist he told me to contact is expensive and I can't get her involved just to justify ignoring him. He NEEDS his updates about the internship. 

I also got an email from my grandma saying she knows I'm swamped with work but he needs his cellphone and returning it will show how responsible I am. I haven't answered her for days, but I did today. Here's my response:

&gt; I have three final projects due this week and I had big projects due last week. I have been working every day with little to no sleep so the post office was not my top priority. I get out of class most days when the post office is closed. I will get it out as soon as I can but getting emails from everyone 50 times a day will not make it happen any faster. Dad has my old cell phone in his room last time I checked and could have activated it days ago for no charge through Verizon. I will get it out when I can but I need everyone to get off my back.

&gt; He will be receiving his cellphone but he will not be receiving detailed internship updates anymore until I get it. He cannot handle any information I give him without acting like a child; I will not be encouraging his temper tantrums with the subject matter that encourages them.  The cursing is unacceptable. Calling me hours into the night is unacceptable. Getting other people to contact me is unacceptable. This is not up for discussion as he has serious boundary issues. I will not discuss internship details with you or my stepmom as well; it's nothing against either of you but I don't want him involving other people in something that is already not his business. By over reacting and treating me poorly, he has made it clear that he will be more harmful than helpful. It is in my internship's best interest that I distance myself from the drama as it is way too distracting for me to complete my work. 

&gt;I have gone well beyond most people my age to show him how responsible I am therefore I do not need to prove my responsibility to him. Whether he realizes it or not, distancing myself IS the responsible thing to do. His distraction and over-involvement is interfering with my college which he pays thousands of dollars a year for. I will not have his emotions ruin my workflow, grades, and opportunities. The first night of his drama alone, I couldn't get my work done because he made me too emotional to concentrate. I refuse to let him interfere with my work again.

 &gt;He told me to touch base with his therapist when he visited, yet when I did, he made it seem as if it was out of line because she has encouraged me to distance myself for the time being. This is the last time I will be discussing internships and his attitude with you. I will not entertain the subject anymore since it'll only encourage him to use you as a bridge of communication even further. That isn't fair to you or me. I'm sorry dad is pressuring you and I'll call you when I get a chance, but I am telling you in advanced the internship is absolutely not up for discussion. Please respect the boundaries I am laying out. 


I'm starting to question how I'm handling things. The cellphone thing is my bad so I'll try to get that out despite having 2 more projects due tomorrow as well. But I don't want to stop ignoring him. I'm afraid that if I do, this will have all been for nothing and it'll just encourage him more to see me as a selfish immature little brat. So, what now?

tldr; more pressure from family. Finally answered my grandma saying it was the last time I'd be discussing this with her. More threats from dad. What now?"
2379sk,7,2014-04-16,My [25/f] bestfriend/roommate [25/m] is moving halfway across the country for his gf and I don't feel he should.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2379sk/my_25f_bestfriendroommate_25m_is_moving_halfway/,"Ok so a little bit of a back story. My bestfriend/roommate who I will call Max, have been friends since high school. We've gone through a lot, death, drug addict, disease and because of it we've become very close friends. We got were romantically involved with each other for a few years, a few years ago. Never developed into anything and though I always wonder what would have happened if it did, I have no feelings like that for him and I'm happier with our friendship now. I genuinely care very deeply for him and just want him to be happy. 


Well he moved into a room in the house I rent about a year ago after breaking up with his ex-gf. She pressured him into getting apartment together, he told me that he was trying to save the relationship. I told him it was a dumb idea, did it anyway. They lasted 2 months together before she moved out and he was stuck in a new lease, covering whole of rent. So once a room became available in my property, he broke the lease and moved in. 

Soon as he moved in, he started dating his new girlfriend, Amy. So they have been only dating for about a year, could be a little more. I really like her, she is a nice girl and we've spent days watching t.v. and getting food. We've hung out together without Max and she honestly a great person! It was very apparent though, that Amy came from money early on as she didn't hide the fact. Her and Max go out pretty much every night and she normally flips the bill. She is currently a full-time student and is about to graduate at the end of the 
semester. 


A few months ago, Max went home with Amy to visit family. He came back amazed, neither one of us really understood exactly how much money Amy family has. He went off about all the things they did and saw with her family. He mention to me how her father was a high class attorney and made back. A few weeks later, he changed his major to political science and now has this idea he is going to be a big shot lawyer. Silly but it's whatever. 


So Amy and I hungout recently and I asked her what she planned on doing after graduation and she mentioned some pretty awesome things her father has offered to her to do after school on his dime. None of which includes her getting a job unless she stayed here, she would have to get a job and pay her way. If she stayed for Max, which would be the only reason why, he father said he won't fund her anymore. Which I could tell she had no intention of losing his funding. When we were discussing her options available I could tell, none of them included Max. Her father has made it clear that he doesn't want him to come with her, that if he did, he couldn't live with her etc. She most likely moving back with family after graduating or moving to NYC (close to family) to take an internship. Which is across the country from where we are.


Well Max came up to me last night and told me how he applied for several school, all within the area she is planning on moving. I asked him, ""Are you planning on moving with Amy?"" He informed me that he was moving so he could be with her.


I've watch him make stupid decisions for women before and I can't help but think, this is a bad idea. He has no family or friends out there only Amy, who has tons of money, family and friends out there who will take care of her if anything happens. Max and I come from family's who kicked us out as soon as we were 18 and have supported ourselves. If Max can't live with Amy, where is he going to live? I can tell he hasn't thought this one through and I hate for him to move cross country just for them not to work out and he alone, broke, without friends/family in a strange city. I

I'm wondering if I should say something to him. Part of me feels that it isn't my business, which is partly correct, it isn't. But as Max best friend and after all we've been through, what type of friend would I be if I DIDN'T tell him it was a bad idea. Max has always been a relationship guy and when he is with a girl, he is devoted which is admirable but it leads him into dating ungrateful women who treat him badly and normally ends with him getting screwed over. I don't believe Amy is this way, but I can tell she isn't being honest about her true feelings on the situation as well as about her father's intentions regarding Max. Don't know what to do.


**TL;DR** Bestfriend/roommate been dating a girl for around a year now and wants to move cross country with her after she graduates. she is moving closer to her wealthy family who doesn't seem to want there daughter to have any involvement with him after graduation. I don't know whether to talk to him about how I believe this moving isn't in his best interest.

I'm going to be in the NOVA area for the summer and was wondering if anybody needed some help or knows of any possible internships available in the area.

I'm a quick learner and great people person. Mainly I'm just looking for some experience though, getting paid is by no means a requirement. So  if you just need an extra set of hands to help run through some data or bounce some ideas off, or even just someone to do some organizing work around the office, I'd love to be of assistance.

I also have a strong interest in the startup community and same deal goes for that, willing to work in exchange for valuable experience for a local startup in the area. I am great at problem solving and have a creative mind, so even if financial skills aren't what you require, it can't hurt to have an extra team member around for free.

If you have any questions about my background, would like a copy of my resume, or have any leads feel free to PM me. Even if it's something not right now, like I said I'll be graduating in December and would be available to jump into a position at the beginning of 2015. Thanks! "

237t9e,1,2014-04-16,When should I plan on taking my internship(s)? [US],MyOwnPath,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/237t9e/when_should_i_plan_on_taking_my_internships_us/,"I'm about to finish my third year of college. However, due to switching my major a couple of times, I'll have to take about four more semesters of college to get my accounting degree. I'm well aware of the fact that I need to get an internship in order to make me employable at the bachelor's level. However, given my circumstances, I don't know when I should plan on taking.

The obvious answer would be to take one over the summer between two years. However, I know that most firms only give true value to those with a winter internship, due to how the busy season tests you. 

Thus, I think taking a winter internship would make the most sense. However, when would I take it? If I complete the next two years I'll end in a summer semester, meaning I'd have a gap in my work history from waiting for one to come along. Alternatively, I could take one next winter; however, that would leave a significant gap of time between getting the internship and getting hired; almost two years.

Also, I should point out that I've met with recruiters from a few firms (no big 4, but as I understand they rarely hire at the bachelor level anyways). I would assume they expect me to apply ASAP, given the fact that I went out of my way to meet them personally and give them a copy of my resume; I don't want them to think I'm ignoring them.

Is there any ideal time to take an internship, or am I overthinking this way too much? Also, would it make sense to take two internships, say one during a summer and another during a winter?"

237z6e,0,2014-04-16,I'm [23/m] dreading my 1 year anniversary with my clingy girlfriend [22/f] and considering breaking it off,torbald128,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/237z6e/im_23m_dreading_my_1_year_anniversary_with_my/,"So, I've been dating a beautiful, brilliant, caring woman for the past year, but I'm not sure if I want to keep going. Our 1 year anniversary is coming up, and I feel like I would rather hang out with someone else than see her.

I was content with everything until about a week ago, but she made me stop hanging out with one of two friends other than her that I ever see in person. This friend was a girl from my high school (who I had a brief fling with then, but mind you this was 6 years ago) who I hadn't even had contact with until she moved into town a few months ago. She has a stable boyfriend of 4 years, and we never did anything other than play video games and other shit I do with my male friends. But I absolutely had to stop seeing her because of my girlfriend's insecurity. I told her over and over that it was purely platonic, but she said that it doesn't matter. She said having her as a friend made her want to hurt herself, and awoke a dormant eating disorder and that wouldn't ever change as long as we were hanging out. 

So I broke it off with this friend and have been questioning the relationship ever since.

Reflecting on the relationship, I have felt more and more that she's not letting me be myself. I've always been a very independent, introverted person, but recently I have stopped all of my hobbies (I've been a pretty avid musician my whole life until a few months ago) other than playing video games and browsing the internet. I feel like I can't get engaged in anything on my own time because she CONSTANTLY is messaging me and gets really upset if I don't respond. If she texts me and then sees me on g-chat, I'll always receive a message asking why I didn't respond to her text. If I don't respond to anything for more than an hour or so for whatever reason she thinks something is wrong, even if I'm just busy with schoolwork. She drains me dry every single day, and I basically never hang out with other friends, or even IM/text them, because I'm just spent. I've seen all of my friendships except two or three completely deteriorate over the course of the past year.

I feel like when we started dating that it was helping me grow as a person, but now I don't see that. When we hang out, it's always cooking something together (her personal hobby is cooking; I couldn't care less), or watching some shitty TV (I never watch TV on my own). Her only interest in any of my hobbies is asking me to write a song for her, despite me being super disengaged from any musical practice for the past few months. I was recently applying for internships during the summer, and she was supportive for the ones in town, but ambivalent to anything else. I don't feel supported professionally. Her only support is a fantasy of hers of moving to California after I graduate next spring, despite neither of us having jobs there at this point.

Which brings up another thing: she never lives in the present. She's asks way too often if I feel she's ""The One,"" and talks about marriage way than I'm comfortable with. I'm just not at that phase in my life yet. She says that anything I buy or she gives to me is her's as well, because we're going to be moving in soon enough anyway. Ignore that there are no actual real life plans for moving in yet. She makes me promise that I'll ""be with her forever"" every other time that we hang out, it seems. If I say I can't promise that at this point (the truth!) she breaks down and says I don't love her, so I just lie whenever asked now.

She has such an entitled view to everything. I recently was talking about giving her ""whatever she wanted"" for a night because she was in a shitty mood. Her response was, and I quote, ""Oh, I always get what I want anyway."" This even holds true in sex, as we've slowly cut out everything that I really like doing that she's neutral on for her same favorite positions every time. If I try something new, she never really seems engaged, and often just tells me to stop.

Last weekend, I woke up on Saturday knowing I had agreed to spend the afternoon with her at a local festival, and spend the night later. When we were driving to the thing, I told her that I needed to finish a paper and wanted to leave after the thing we were going to so I could work. She thought I was staying from noon until the next morning. This upset her because ""I just got there and only wanted to leave."" Upset her so much that she would have driven into oncoming traffic if I didn't grab the steering wheel. We switched so I could drive her home at that point, and she spouted endless hurtful shit until we got back. She later revealed that she ""didn't mean it"" and ""was only saying it because [she] would rather [I] be mad at [her] than have no reaction.""

So our one year anniversary is coming up, and I'm at a loss. I'm not excited for it. I know that she bought me some inappropriately huge present (according to her she told a friend about it and he said ""why? are you sure you want to spend that much?"") and I can't afford to get her much of anything, so I feel terrible about that. I just don't want to hang out that much. I already told her I would spend a lot of the upcoming weekend with her, so she has me down for spending all of Friday evening and all of Saturday. Just not looking forward to it.

Should I break it off with her? I still love her, but I feel she has too many traits that I just don't want to deal with at this point in my life. I'm not sure if I know enough about myself at this point to want ANY relationship. We took a break for a month for all of the above reasons last December and both started seeing therapists. She stopped after we got back together, and whenever I suggest starting again to her, she just blows it off or flat out ignores it. I felt I gave her a chance to change things, but she doesn't want to so I can't help her. She expects me to be the cure to any issues she has. I don't know. Just not sure I should stay around any more. Help me, reddit!"

238b9g,1,2014-04-16,Me [23M] with my best friend [23m] and his girlfriend [19F] I fell in love with her and there's been issues ever since.,troubledthrowaway01,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/238b9g/me_23m_with_my_best_friend_23m_and_his_girlfriend/,"Hi reddit, sorry in advance because I think this is going to become a wall of text. I've changed the names because my friend looks at reddit.


TL;DR


Anyway like the title says I fell in love with my best friend girlfriend (They've been dating for almost 3 years), and the way things have been I guess could be described as anything ranging from ""awkward"" to ""tense."" Initially, I didn't have any interest in her for the obvious reason that she was dating my best friend, however as time went on I started to like her more and more to the point where I had a crush. After that, one night we spent several hours alone talking waiting for my friend Rob to get off work (He works 5pm-12am, or 4-11pm) and that's when I guess I decided that I didn't just have a crush, but that I loved her. (I should mention that I hangout with Rob and Rene almost everyday, (up until recently) so Rene and I waited together for him to get off  5-7 days a week.)


I know the TL;DR normally goes at the end of the post but in this case it kind of helps for me to put it at the start. 


Rob and Rene started dating when he and I were both 20, and I think Rene was 17 at the time. Out of all our friends, I was the only one that didn't see a problem with Rob dating a 17 year old, mostly because I didn't see it being any of my business and I supported them both which I guess must have made Rene think highly of me and she got me a mug (because Rob mentioned I'm a big tea and coffee drinker) with my nickname on it which I thought was a little weird because I had only known her for a month or so, but I was gracious about it and accepted the gift and honestly I love that fucking mug so much.


Fast forward to Valentines day, Rob and I are now both 21 and while I was alone with Rob he told me he was thinking about breaking up with Rene so he could be ""free"" for the summer (whatever that means since Rob doesn't go to bars, or go clubbing or anything of the sort.) I told him I thought it was a mistake and actually kinda pushed him to stay with Rene because I knew how happy he was to be with someone who loved him, despite his flaws and short comings. So, they stayed together, and somewhere between valentines day and the start of summer, Rene and I started texting each other.


So summer started that year, and during the summer Robs hours get extended so he gets off work later and Rene would sit at home and wait for him to get off work, because she was a host and obviously didn't work as long hours. So, one day Rene asked me if I wanted to come pick her up and go on a bake route (Basically smoke weed and drive around, stupid I know for numerous reasons.) We drove around for a few hours and ended up parking on a residential street and got stoned, listened to music, and talked. This was the first time both of us learned any details about our respective personal lives beyond what her and Rob had shared with me and vice versa. (i.e family, pets, college, friends, interests, hobbies.)


So this became a pretty regular thing, and Rob knew about it and didn't mind and I checked with him multiple times over the course of the summer and fall that year. Sometimes, we'd hop in my truck and go for a bake route, or sometimes we'd sit out on the back deck of their house in the dark and smoke. This cycle repeated itself all the way through to the next spring/summer, and it wasn't until this past summer that I started to realized that I might actually love her. I wasn't sure, and I guess I'll never be sure if she felt the same way about me because I've only had one girlfriend and she just used me for whatever she wanted at the time.


That feeling got confirmed over the course of mid-june 2013 when we were waiting for Rob to get off work, I told Rene I was kinda tired and wanted to lay down and she went and got me the pillow she sleeps with  and her favorite blanket, and started playing country music (which I used to loath) and told me to ignore my dislike of country and just listen to the melody of the songs, so I did while I was falling asleep. Anyway I woke up, and I remember feeling different somehow. I couldn't put my finger on what exactly felt different but when I sat up on the couch, I just remember looking over at Rene and saw her looking at Facebook on her laptop. She looked up at me and for what felt like the longest time we held eye contact, and I'm not talking staring contest eye contact, I'm talking about significant, intimate, eye contact. After what I can only assume was a few minutes, she asked me if I wanted to keep her company outside while she smoked a cig (I only smoked weed at the time, now I'm sober.) So I said sure, and we went out on the back deck and she started playing country music through her laptop, and after the 3rd or 4th song had passed, I realized that not only did I not hate country music anymore, I knew the lyrics to most of the songs in the set list she made, and I wanted to hear more country songs. After this particular night, I realized that everything I thought and felt about Rene had changed, and I realized I loved her. 


This is where the problems, self-loathing, and guilt started to sink in to me. Over the next couple of months, I started to feel more and more guilty about the way I felt towards Rene, but I didn't want to change my pattern of behavior for two reasons. One I was enjoying spending time with her and two I didn't want to raise any suspicions because I didn't want them to cut me out of their lives. Eventually, I ended up not being able to take the guilt or deal with my shame I felt anymore and purposefully told Rene's best friends boyfriend, whom I knew would tell them because I lacked the courage to tell them myself. Rob has been my best friend for the better part of a decade, and I knew him when we were both very young (he used to stop me from getting bullied.) I wanted to tell him and apologize to him over and over again, but I could never muster the courage too, which is disappointing to me because I have a strong constiution and morality.


The fallout wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. They didn't hangout with me for a week, which let me know something was up, and deep down I knew what it was. They had found out about my feelings for Rene, and after a week Rob called me. I asked him if just he and I could talk and he said that sounded great and that he missed me. Anyway, I went to go pick Rob up and I just remember rambling and rambling and making no sense and finally he just said ""troubledthrowaway01, you're still both mine and Rene's friend, we're not mad or disappointed at you."" I was stunned. Anyone else would have bashed my teeth out, and told me I was a dirtbag and a snake, and Rob just told me that I was still his best friend no matter what. I couldn't believe it. 


Things went back to normal for them, or atleast so I thought. This is where it gets complicated, I can't tell from this point on if I'm the one who's having issues with awkwardness, remorse, and self-loathing, or if Rob and Rene have been playing off my feelings to continue getting me to keep preforming small to large random acts of kindness. (I'm generous to all my friends pretty equally (I.e I pay for meals when we go out, I always shared what weed I had, and if any of them need a ride to or from somewhere I'm reliable and will pick them up.))


Ever since Rob and Rene found out about the way I feel, it feels like Rene tries whenever she wants something to attempt to get me to comply by guilt tripping me/wooing me (not seducing, nothing has ever been sexual between us.)  I wouldn't say that Rene guilt trips me or attempts to get me to do something for her all the time, but when she does it makes me feel like crap. That, coupled with Rob's decline in interest to talk when I hangout with them has started to make me feel...uncomfortable and I've tried addressing the issue of Rob not being interested in conversation, the activity we're doing, or much of anything really but nothing ever comes out of it. Rene on the other hand is still very willing to talk to me during hangouts, and share details with her day with me while Rob just sits here and looks at his phone or plays pokemon X. 


They're not bad people, but whether they're acting this way intentionally or subconsciously it causes problems occasionally and I end up isolating myself from them for a few weeks to a month. Like I said earlier too, I'm not sure if Rene ever really loved me, or it was just my loneliness convincing me that we had a connection. I tried to rationalize it, and still do from time to time in my head that she did love me with things like (She could be hanging out with her best friend right now instead of me, or watching tv alone, or whatever.) 


I haven't seen them in roughly 3 or 4 weeks, and I've been taking better care of myself, (I've been working out harder because I am a big dude I  Went from 550+lbs down to 378 in about a year and a half) volunteering, doing yard work, and looking for internships related to computer science.  I'm writing this right now because in an hour or so I'll be going to hangout with them. I just wanted reddits input on what I should do at this point. I don't really feel anything but neutrality and numbness towards Rene now since I haven't seen her in a month, so I think that this friendship is worth keeping as long as I'm able to say no to unreasonable requests/special requests and if I can get Rob engaged and talking again.


What do you think r/relationships? I know that the length of a friendship doesn't make it a good friendship but since I've been (or possibly have) moved passed my feelings I think that things may return to the way they used to."
238d7v,40,2014-04-16,"How to Build a Network Like Macklemore's, Step-by-Step",stillnotahipster,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/238d7v/how_to_build_a_network_like_macklemores_stepbystep/,"A lot of people praise Macklemore for being an ""independent artist"" who has accomplished a lot without a label backing him up- multiple chart-topping singles, Grammy awards, heavy radio rotation, sold out stadium shows- the stuff that's usually reserved for the top stars on major label rosters. What the average consumer (and even the occasional aspiring musician) probably isn't aware of is the EXTENSIVE team/network behind him, making all of these amazing things happen- a network that includes major label radio promo departments, a fantastic manager, dedicated fans working on his behalf (even before he had extensive celebrity), and more. 


Without further ado, here's a broad overview of how to make music industry connections in 7 manageable (not always simple, but not impossible) steps:


**1. Be your own biggest cheerleader first**

There are a couple elements to this: First off, your art needs to kick ass. It doesn't have to be perfect (how much music do you see getting a lot more attention than yours that sounds ""meh""), but it needs to be something that you're honestly proud of, that objective listeners have praised and expressed a legitimate love for. This is the easiest way to be confident and sell yourself- having a legitimately great ""product""/cause. 

If you're going to ask people to believe in you and be apologetic for asking, don't bother. If you aren't confident in yourself, why ask other people to take the leap? This isn't the time to be looking for external approval or praise- ask your friends if you want that. Walk into this process feeling good (not cocky or egotistical, but confident and assured) that you have music worth hearing and working for. 


**2. Identify the players you need on your team**

What are your goals? To get on some sort of radio? You'll need a radio promoter. Is it to go on tour? A booking agent. Don't have enough traction to do ""anything""? You want a manager who will argue on behalf to people like a booking agent or radio promoter. This step is pretty simple, so I'll leave it at this. 


**3. DTFR: Do The ~~fu~~..err... Fabulous Research**

This is where you do your own little private headhunting. Want a record label? Identify 5-10 labels that release things that sound similar to you, figure out who does their A&amp;R. Want a radio promoter? Go shopping and see who does radio promo for your favorite artists. Google is your friend, maybe a LinkedIn premium account is your friend, literally any stalking tool possible. Once you have names, find their email address, find out who your mutual friends are on Facebook, figure out their cat's name. What's going on at their company, what projects are they starting, what do they like to do in their spare time? 


**4. Reach out, be succinct, and offer them value**

There's one tactic here that will increase your chances of success literally tenfold- *get introduced*. Nothing beats a warm introduction, even when it's just via email. How do you ask for an introduction? Here's a sample request I could send to a potential connector, along with some comments showing what I'm doing (email them, facebook them, whatever): ""Hey Bill- so sick that you guys are putting on that Shooby Taylor show at the Rat's Nest next week! [say Hi if you aren't homies, build rapport] I saw you're friends with Robby from the Koncertz Agency- we're looking to tour this summer and I think we would fit really well on the bill for Discoband's tour. Would you mind introducing us so that I could pitch him on the idea and give him some numbers on our draw? [using the lingo that promoters/bookers use, showing that I understand his business, and OFFERING HIM VALUE- our draw]"" 

This is a pretty direct ask- for times when you think you need a subtler approach, or won't be able to get an introduction, I'm a fan of starting a conversation/connection by asking if they'd be willing to answer 2-3 questions you have about their job/experiences. Important people love to have their brain picked, as long as you do it in a way that's respectful of their time and you ask GOOD questions. 

Just to illustrate ways that I've creative gotten introductions and used the ""interviewing"" approach: I've gotten job opportunities at record labels by using a LinkedIn premium account to look for people who have interned there in the past, asked these former interns if I could ask them a few questions about their experience there, and then after having that conversation, tactfully asked them to introduce me to the management at the label itself. 


**5. Persistence is courteous and respectable, not annoying**

If somebody doesn't get back to you, DON'T BE AFRAID to try consistently to get in touch with them/get their attention. I'm not saying be an annoying fanboy, email them every day, or contact them on email AND twitter AND facebook AND comment on their instagrams. That being said, people are *very busy* in today's world, and often times may need some prodding before they get back to you. It's completely courteous to send followup emails every few days, unless they say ""Hey you freak stop emailing me."" That rarely happens though. In fact, I can't tell you how many times I've had people say ""Hey, thanks SO MUCH for being consistent here- I've been so swamped this week and would've totally forgotten to get back to you if you hadn't pinged me again. Sorry about that!"" Hell, I myself have told people that countless times. Persistence is courteous and respectable, not annoying. 

This is true AFTER you initially make a connection as well. Keep in touch! Every 1-3 weeks, shoot them an email with an article you think they'd be interested, a connection you encountered to something you two have talked about, etc. etc. Just keep following up to say hi and casually share something (that ADDS VALUE)


**6. Ask**

Going into any sort of persuasion/influence tactics is way outside the scope of this Reddit post, so I'm keeping this step simple. **ASK** for what you want. Speak in terms of the benefits they could gain. Be direct, and be confident. Remember- your music is worth believing in. 


**7. Do the work**

Follow-through on YOUR responsibilities. If you expect a manager to help you by promoting you to all of their connections, trying to get you shows and opportunities, they expect YOU to continue making great music, doing what you can to promote yourself, building your own connections, playing polished and exciting gigs, etc. etc. If you expect other people to do all of your work for you.... just get out now. Understand what YOUR responsibilities are, versus what your team has signed on to help you with. 



**Alright, that's a LOT of writing for a Reddit post.** I hope these tips, although they just skim the surface of this stuff, are really helpful. I think I'm going to start writing a lot more on building music industry relationships and other Music Systems that I've tested to build success in the music industry, so if you want to read more of this type of stuff I have a [brand-new mailing list](http://forms.aweber.com/form/97/1451014297.htm) I just started (not selling anything, don't worry!)

* a lot of really great things going for me, including fantastic internships at fortune 20 companies, stuff like that
* older
* do poorly on exams, never really get As unless it's something I'm naturally good at
* diagnosed with insomnia and depression
* veteran

I saw a therapist for awhile, but, frankly, it's way too difficult for me because I can't take what they say seriously, and I can't buy into many of the ""do xyz"" things.... I've tried others, and this therapist is a senior therapist who is supposed to be experienced. I don't really feel like they care that much, so I stopped going. 

Most days, I have reoccurring thoughts that I'm disgusting, stupid, worthless, etc.... How can I feel valuable when I don't really have any friends outside of school, or no romance to make me feel that way? I got rid of social media, because it was making me feel bad. I don't feel intelligent at all. I do ok in school, but I'm definitely not an A student, but I also feel like school isn't that hard. I really try and find active ways of getting rid of negative influences in my life. 

I've given philosophical approaches a shot, but it doesn't seem to be helping. I have ""good"" days and ""bad"" days. I really don't want to feel this way, but most days, and excuse the cliche, I feel like somebody is just standing on my chest, or pushing my shoulders down. I have reoccurring thoughts of people in my life dying, or me dying. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. I'll never get that. I just don't know what else I can do, and I've been this way for quite awhile.  This is a shot in the dark I guess. I'm not sure what I'm looking for? Somebody to tell me it's ok, even though I know it's not? 

Thanks for any help/advice I can get. 

-edit-

I also have very low self esteem. I've had a lot of sexual partners, but not many loving/caring relationships? My last relationship I was verbally abused. My last sexual partner pressured me into it, and after just stopped talking to me. I'm not sure how much these things have affected me. :("

How do I move on without feeling like this everyday?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/238vc5/stuck_ashamed_and_alone_how_do_i_move_on_without/,"Hello r/depression. I need to talk. For three years I hid my depression from friends, family, and work. It wasn't until about 5 months ago that my employer reached out to me about what was wrong which led me to admit that I was a chronic marijuana user. That week was when my depression fully surfaced. They were supportive and suggested that I look into rehab. So on the night of December 18th, 2013 I smoked an eighth of the weed to myself outside of a hotel room close to the facility I was scheduled to check in with the next morning.



I stayed there for 21 days with no internet, video games, television or outside communication. I was given a routine which began at 6am that included group therapy, individual counseling, AA, NA CDA meetings, 3 meals, and free time that concluded at 11pm. I can honestly say that I want to return just to have the structure back in my life. 

It felt great being given the tools to deal with my problems head on, but as soon as I was discharged I felt a major shift in my outlook. The sober living house I moved into is isolating. The guys are much older (I'm 25) and are consistently joking about their old days of getting fucked up and sleeping with girls in AA. I haven't had a relationship in 3 years, but hearing them joke about it makes me upset that I can't find something more meaningful and causes me to question if I should try their methods to satisfy my needs. 

That's not the problem though. Sex isn't what I want, nor is it a relationship. What I want most right now is job satisfaction. Something I can wake up every morning excited to do and come home feeling like what I did actually had a purpose. The worst part is that I have an opportunity in front of me, but no clear path to get there. It's like a giant puzzle without any picture for reference. I'm obsessed with solving it, but it's become debilitating. 

I work as a job coach for adults with developmental disabilities and last year I attempted to create a [vocational training program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEHQJW-Y9Z4) with a local university. The idea was to create workplace internships for my team that would give them better job experience and education about working in the community. This project was very important to me, nothing had been done like it before in my area and I knew it would help me get a scholarship for grad school to pursue a career in public policy / assistive technology. We spent 6 months planning for the contract by cleaning offices and animal shelters but it was eventually pulled from the bidding process. That week was when my addiction fully surfaced. 

I went from being a casual smoker to full blown multiple times a day while perseverating over this failure and coming up with ways to try something new. But nothing worked. I kept having ideas and never acting on them. I stopped hanging out with friends and felt safe by myself playing video games or doing research. The truth is, weed kept me motivated. It was my reason to get up every morning and it caused me to think about how I'd want to improve my life and my job. I'm trying my hardest now to get myself happy and productive again without subjecting myself to drugs or alcohol and it sucks. 

In the future I need structure and moderation. Right now my structure and sense of purpose is lost. Sleep has become my new drug. It takes so much out of me just to get out of bed and put a smile on my face before work. I'm hoping to talk to anyone who can advise me on what to do to get myself back to normal. I've been prescribed Lexapro and Buspirone, but I'm convinced that my depression is purely environmental. I have no family nearby, I'm hopelessly trying to do something important at my job, my friends are moving on and the worst part of all is that I'm alone in almost everything that I do.  

How do I get over this slump without carrying my past with me?"
238vuz,3,2014-04-17,I'm not sure what's entirely wrong,DoctorRager,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/238vuz/im_not_sure_whats_entirely_wrong/,"Not sure if this is the right place but here goes...As of late I've been feeling pretty alone. Even though I'm surrounded by friends and people who care I always feel like I'm just by myself. 

For some background I guess I have to start about 3 or so years back. I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of 19. Being in college I had to take a leave of absence because they wanted to start the treatment right away to hopefully stop it from spreading anymore than it had. At the time of diagnosis I was handling it pretty well and everything seemed fine. I had to come home from school to do all this but I had just begun a relationship with my best friend. However she was in Massachusetts and I in New York so it was long distance. We were madly in love and everything was great, or so I thought. I realized much later that even though I was the one fighting for my life I was continuing to have to be strong for both parties in the relationship and it took a toll on me mentally. This caused arguing and fighting because no matter what I did I couldn't help her overcome her anxiety issues even when I convinced her that talking to a school therapist didn't mean she was crazy. All the while having to deal with the mental and physical stress of chemotherapy. Fast forward six months to when my treatment was over I had unfortunately formed blot clots from the change of my blood composition and had to be put on blood thinners for another six months. I actually pin point this as to where my depression started and remember the emotional breakdown I had when they told me. The unfortunate thing about this was I was a very active person before getting sick ( I had already gained 20 lbs from not being able to move really for six months ) and I had to wait another six to play any sports I enjoyed or even spend too much time in the sun. This sent me on a spiral because I had been wanting to go back to normal for the entire time I was sick. 

I went back to school in the fall of 2011 and began working my ass off to catch up. I had missed two quarters of classes and a summer I could have been interning somewhere. My girlfriend moved to Rochester ( where I was in school ) to complete an internship and to be with me while she did it and I appreciated it immensely. However the fighting wasn't stopping and I couldn't figure out why ( mind you I had no idea I was depressed at this point ). Fast forward through the year and my roommates and I who were best friends when we started living together all started to resent each other. My girlfriend moved back to school to finish her last semester and had planned to move back to Rochester with me the next fall. I didn't necessarily want her to move in with me because I thought her living with friends she had here was a better idea so that the two of us could have space. Unfortunately it was all or nothing. So I agreed to it and we planned to move in together. While at school she ""cheated"" on me by letting another guy kiss her. She called me the night it happened and told me everything. I bottled it up and let it go at the time but I think secretly I resented her for it. So fast forward to us moving in together and she's now having doubt's about everything. About a month in to living together I agree to go see a therapist because I'm not getting better mentally and this is when I had the realization that I was depressed but I didn't know what to do about it. Fast forward a couple months and she breaks up with me while living together. Joy. 

Unfortunately this has a traumatic effect on my mental state and I pretty much went into a major downward spiral. I had to rethink everything about my life all at once and I had lost my best friend even though we still had to live together for six months before she could move out. That was a fun period of time. Since then I've been dating and such ( this all happened from January 2013 on ) however not been able to form a stable connection with anyone. I lost a lot of friends during my stages of depression and the breakup and its made it incredibly difficult for me to trust or make new friends in general due to the fear of going through it all again. I've caught myself purposefully self sabotaging potential relationships for no reason and I can't figure it out. I had shut out my family for a while and have slowly been letting them back in.

I graduate this summer and have a full time job lined up in August in Norwalk, CT that I'm incredibly excited about but I'm terrified of the making friends process and relationship process.  

The question I guess is does anyone have advice about how to handle this? The whole feeling alone and purposefully self sabotaging relationships without actually knowing it?


Apologize in advance if the story is a bit confusing. It's a bit of a brain dump and felt good to kind of write it all down."
239505,1,2014-04-17,Anyone in CT looking for a summer student intern in the front-end web development field?,data-ui-component,Connecticut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/239505/anyone_in_ct_looking_for_a_summer_student_intern/,"I'll be coming back to CT in about a month. In University(out of state) I'm studying Industrial Design, but I'm really interested and knowledgeable in front-end web development. I was wondering if there are any places that would consider letting me join their team. I enjoy building things properly for people on the web. 

My goals for this summer are:

1. Join a team and use my skills to help in anyway I can.

2. Allow room for my own personal growth, I think actually working within a setting of other talented people would be a valuable experience. 

3. Increase project productivity. Both personal and professionally. 

If anyone would like more information please ask or pm. My professional work is limited, to just about one client who I am working with as a freelancer.  I've got a github, a personal site, and an active twitter if you would like to see more about me.  I've also some ideas for projects that I want to take on myself this summer, but it would be really nice if I could get my foot in the door professionally. Any recommendations on where I should look for such an internship would be greatly appreciated. "
2395qs,7,2014-04-17,Trying to be supportive during SO's job search (rant/advice) [22f],AgainstHope,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2395qs/trying_to_be_supportive_during_sos_job_search/,"So I've been a lurker for awhile, but this is my first post in this subreddit, so I guess I'll give some history.

Me (22f) and my boyfriend (23m) have been together ~3 years now and have been long distance (2k miles cross country) for a little under a year.  We met and started dating sophomore year in college.  During our 2 years together in college we were long distance for ~9 months on and off for 2 summer internships and 1 semester abroad, but we lived together our entire senior year.   On graduation we both got job offers, but not in the same place.  I was the more employable of the two of us and could have turned down my offer and looked in his area, but we both agreed the offer was too good to turn down and was a job I loved, whereas he wasn't thrilled with his position, so we'd do long distance again, and in a year he'd start looking at new positions in my region.  That was last May.

He didn't make it to a year.  He hates his job, and started looking for other work within 3 months.  The focus has mainly been on jobs where I am, but he hasn't gotten very far, mainly rejections or ""we'll keep you in mind for future positions"" sort of form letter responses.  I'd originally offered to look for work where he is, but I like my job and have better pay/benefits/location for both of us, whereas he dislikes his job, current location, and pretty much everything to do with the situation, so at least for now it doesn't make sense.  We'd just live together with one job if we could, but we're both in technical fields where every year of unemployment kills job prospects by a ton, and we both have student loan debt, so if we lived together on 1 salary right now we'd be screwing ourselves over long term.

Recently though a new position at his company opened up, one that's in a better department and more the type of work he enjoys.  It's the sort of job he wouldn't hate, and he got an interview for it.  On the one hand, I'm thrilled for him, finally someone's giving him a chance, and he doesn't have to feel so defeated, and it might finally make his day-to-day life less depressing.  So I want to be supportive, and I'm trying so hard to be.  But on the other hand, he's getting all excited about this position, and all I can think of is the reality of what it means for our relationship.  If he gets this job, he'll be staying where he is for at least another year before even looking for work where I am, and that's from after he starts the job, which due to their hiring practices might not even be for 2-3 months.  So while I'm trying to be supportive-girlfriend all I can think in my head is that this is just postponing our end date, that it's just longer that he's so far away from me.

I have talked to him about this.  We're a very open couple.  He says he understands, that he wishes he could get a job out here instead, but that this job might make him more attractive to companies in my area in the long term. He doesn't expect me to be as excited about it as he is, and I'm not UNhappy about it.  I am thrilled for him... at the same time though I'm sad for us.  He says he gets that, but I can tell it hurts him that I'm not as optimistic as usual with this job app. I feel bad for being selfish... but I don't know how to be more supportive, at least not genuinely right now.

I'm sorry for the long rant.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for exactly, but I think I just wanted to get this off my chest, hopefully to an audience that at least sort of understands how hard it is to be so far apart.  If anyone's gone through something similar I'd love to hear how you dealt with it?  Or any general advice on being supportive to your SO in these kinds of situations?

Thanks for listening...

tl;dr - My boyfriend is applying for a job that'll keep us LD for at least another year.  It's better than his current position, and would make his day-to-day life better, but I'm having a hard time being supportive for selfish reasons, cause I want him here with me."
239b1p,6,2014-04-17,"Looking for a dual monitor dev setup, possible gaming",indigojuice,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/239b1p/looking_for_a_dual_monitor_dev_setup_possible/,"* What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible. 

There's what I need and what I want. What I *need* is a PC that I can
develop on. That means compiling large software projects, running multiple operating systems, running multiple virtual machines *at once* and using all of them *at once*.

I need to have two monitors with HD high quality screens. I have poor vision, in particular I have a condition that makes glare very difficult for me - if it's possible to take this into account that would be amazing for me. In particular I need less-glare, screens that I can see from a bit of an angle (my current laptop screen is totally terrible when you look from the side), and high resolution.

 

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

I would like to spend no more than 1,000 dollars. However, if you have some super primo whatevermajig that'll be amazing, I can maybe go over. I'm a student, this is all internship money, it's not like I'm rolling in it. If you can save me some money, of course, I'll love you for it.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

August but I could put it off until like mid-September or something if some new thing'll be released. Latest I'd want is December, really would prefer not to push it that late.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

I have a Samsung 830 128GB SSD
(this i believe http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0AJ0ZF4605 )

and that's it. So I'll need 'the works'. Mouse, keyboard, two monitors, tower, everything *except* Windows. I have my own Windows licenses and I'll primarily be on Linux anyways.

And I realize this is not the best place to ask but I'm also in the market for a chair - outside of the computer budget. If you have any suggestions on that, again, much appreciated.

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 


I'm in the US - New York. I don't have access to one as far as I know

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

As mentioned, the Samsung 830 SSD is all I've got. Link above.

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

If it's simple and painless (ie: run program, it's done) then perhaps. But most likely not interested unless it's necessary.

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

I'm mostly leaving that to your discretion. A solid chunk of hard drive space for my files would be nice and I can just put the OS's on my SSD. Lots of RAM for VMs, preferably a nice CPU for compiling. 

If it's in the budget I'll take a nice GPU , but if not just prioritize the aspects that will matter for the activities mentioned.

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

I don't like flashy/ gaudy things. Minimalist is nice. I'll just cover LED's anyways since I have to sleep in the room with this thing.

* Do you already have a copy of Windows 7 or 8, or do you need a copy included with the build? 

I will handle the Windows part.

* Extra info if required:

I guess I'd say 12GB of RAM minimum (16GB would be nice), preferably a quad core CPU (intel), as long as the HDD is 500GB or more that's fine.

edit: Oh, and maybe something to protect from power surges. That happens sometimes.

If there's any other information you all need just let me know.

23aclw,1,2014-04-17,"My crazy roller coaster ride, a 4 year span, all for you ENTs!",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/23aclw/my_crazy_roller_coaster_ride_a_4_year_span_all/,"It all started in the summer of 2009.  I was away working at a company as an intern engineer.  That summer/fall I came back home to finish up some general education classes at my local community college.   My mother had managed to do the yard work without me and then some.  My first week back I was mowing the lawn like I always did, I get towards the back of the yard and there it was, an 8 foot male plant.   I stopped the lawn mower to inspect it, I went inside, her and I had an awkward discussion, she said her friend gave her these seeds as a joke and told her that they were really challenging to grow.

Now, I’ve been drunk before, a few times, I remember hating being hung over the next day.  That pretty much did it for me as far as drugs are concerned.  But growing it out in the open, in plain view, hidden among the Earth, it jolted me into a new exciting way of thinking.  I did research, I spent weeks reading up on it, strains, equipment, laws, basically everything out there (I was on my neighbor’s wireless internet, so I wasn’t worried).  

Then I found it, her little stash, she had it curing in a plastic sandwich bag. I carefully examined it, and saw a few seeds hanging out of the pods.  She must have cut down the female plant and let the male plant just keep growing. I took a whole branch, and picked the seeds out.   I bagged the buds for my friend to try, (this friend will have a key role later on).  So now I had the first key part in my future plot to rule the world!  

Fast forward to the spring of 2010.  I planted a few outside with her permission. They got damn big, but still were not producing buds. Towards the end of the summer an old fling and I re-connected.  This girl said she smoked, so I figured this was something her and I could do to bring us closer.  How fucking wrong was I?!  I get a Facebook message from a pal of mine that said her and her ex-boyfriend were going to steal it all from my.  So I blew the lid off of all the secrets and verbally threatened both of them that if anything happened, “something” would happen to their pets.  I cut everything down and that was it for me for a while.

“The weed be lettin’ you know… evil lurks” – “Smokey” Friday, 1995.

So now it’s March 2011.  I got a small indoor kit and planted some seeds.  The idea was to get them to be about 8 inches tall and then put them outside.  I got everything to 8 inches and put out the most robust of the bunch.  “YES!”  I thought after I put all them in the ground!  The first two weeks went good, then it happened, frost… all was lost.   It got too cold for anything else and the few I had left inside were getting lanky and burned from the light.  I threw in the towel at this point.  I didn’t have the freedom and space to do this the way I wanted, I put the project on the back burner.  I told a close friend of mine about my struggles, (the friend from paragraph 3), he told me that the market around us was dry as shit, no game in town and we’d do well.  That was all I needed to hear.  

January 2013.  I purchased my first house in the whitest neighborhood in my area.  Got together some equipment, some was high quality but I remember my shade was held up with a twisted coat hanger.  It worked decent and we got our first batch!  Gave some away for people to try and moved all of it.  Now here is where this “friend” started to reveal his true colors.  Off the bat, we agreed to put all the profits back into it for equipment upgrades and supplies, he said “nah man, let’s just split the profits 50/50”.  I was fine with that, which meant he didn’t own any of the equipment and I could liquidate it at any moment or sell to someone else if the opportunity presented itself.  So I moved on.

Now we’re at batch #2.  I had some very nice stuff now folks!  My “friend” (soon to be partner and not friend) wants a bigger role (Idk why).  He wanted to sell it faster, so he kept the jars of it at his place (the dark and damp basement of another friend’s house) so he could sell it right after it fully cured.  One day he comes by the next week and accuses me of giving him shitty trees.  I basically yelled at him and said that the only thing done differently was what he wanted to do different, I blamed him and took everything back in case he tried to say it was bad and just sell it anyway and keep the profits.   I am now cautious, leery, and short tempered with this guy, he apologizes verbally with a laundry list of excuses.  I now own all the equipment, he is just the guy on the streets and we have completely separate roles.  

Batch #3.   So after much stress and patience it finally happened, we got a batch worthy of some serious money (a few thousand a piece for each of us).   At some point between my handover to him, his pill dealer died, my friend found this guy dead on his couch from a massive heart attack.   My friend was pretty shook up so I gave him a lot of slack, I knew he wanted to tell me to back off asking about the money so I did, I honestly felt bad that he lost a friend.

Backup for a sec!!!  My fiancée told me to stop growing, she wanted to have friends over and the smell was too strong to hide at this point.   So after Batch #3 in December 2013, I shut it all down (it’s still shut down as of now).  

Batch #3 cont’d: January 2014.  I’m kicking back and waiting for the cash.  But my former pal is going down a tough road with losing his “friend” and getting evicted from his apartment for letting two other people live there without documentation.  I asked what was the status of my money and then he tells me “I had to get my car repaired and needed a down payment on my apartment”.  He didn’t ask if it was ok or anything, he just did it, took my money and funded his well-being.  I told him, and I quote “if you don’t give me the money you owe me, I am going to give you a scar, it will be on your hand, every time you look at it you’ll remember how you tried to screw me, you have 4 months to pay me back”.

Aftermath:  After him and I not speaking for a few weeks, and his pill dealer dying, he invites me over to his place.  It was a decent place I guess, he looked cleaner, more alert and with it, making eye contact and everything.  He said he’s going to pay me and that I’m his first priority along with more apologizing.  So here I am, an envelope with about 2K in it, waiting to be spent on a tent and supplies for grow room 2.0.  He still owes me about $400 but so far so good.  I have a parts list and hopefully after my wedding in June, it’ll start up again!  But until then, we wait…

Just thought I’d share my behind the scenes experiences from the beginning!  Questions?  Comments?  Suggestions?

Yes, I knew it was a long shot for Oculus to offer internships or summer jobs, but I was excited just to talk to the amazing staff at Oculus. ""Thank you Facebook, finally they have the ability to hire new people."" Seeing as how working for Oculus is one of my dream jobs (I've been part of this community for quite a while) I went straight in today and doubled over the fair looking for Oculus. They weren't there. I asked the administrators outside thinking they were running a bit late.

&gt; ""Did you guys check in a company called 'Oculus' today?""

&gt; ""Actually, they cancelled on us. They thought they were signing up for Cal Poly Pomona.""

23aml2,1,2014-04-17,"She said she ""isn't really interested in a relationship right now"" but then invited herself over for dinner and drinks.",panths,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/23aml2/she_said_she_isnt_really_interested_in_a/,"We're coworkers and we've known each other for a couple of months now. We both got strung along by our respective others, so when we were at work we'd talk about it and we would both tell each other that they needed to end their relationship, but it always seemed that one of us was in it while the other wasn't and if just flipped around like that every couple of weeks for the past few months.

The other day I told her that my relationship was completely 110% done, and told her how great everything in my life was going with internships and such and she said she was excited for me. She said along the same lines as I did, but she said she's ""not really looking for a relationship right now"" and I didn't really think anything of it because at the time I wasn't either and hadn't even hinted at it so I didn't really think anything of it. 

I ended up telling her that I had food that I was going to cook for my ex one last time (I wanted to go out on a good note) but she, instead, said horrendous things to me. So I said ""I've got all this food with nobody to eat it with"" and my coworker got all excited and invited herself over my place (we have never hung out outside of work) and said she'd bring drinks too. It was so fast and I didn't even really think about what was happening but I said yeah.

So now she is supposed to be coming over tomorrow night and I don't actually really know what is going on. I think she likes me because she always laughs at my stupid jokes and tells me I always make her smile. We also have a work trip planned together that is two weekends and it's going to be a 4 hour car ride one way, so she's clearly comfortable spending extended time with me. But then I'm confused because I'm somewhat oblivious and I probably think too much about things that don't matter.



TL;DR We're both single and she said she wasn't really looking without me even hinting at it, and then she invited herself over for me to cook dinner that was supposed to be for my ex, and she is bringing wine.

Should I treat it as a date? Or should I treat it as just hanging out and having drinks? "

I was quiet, docile, and complacent. I was the epitamy of a wallflower. One could honestly overlook me four times before realizing I was right next to them. 

The senior year of my high school, I met a girl. She and I hit it off - our first day we made out. After that we hung out a lot and started dating. I fell in love.

She was someone I put all my time into. I put her on the pedestal, and hard. I did no self improvement. It was always about her. This went on for five years. 

She started hanging out with a friend of mine; he is not red pill, exactly, more a creature borne of desperation. But he has enough selfishness to be more ""alpha"" than I. I brought this up to my girlfriend at the time, and she said it was friend crush. I let it slide. 

Finally, after she had done an internship abroad, I had enough. I wasn't getting the ""love I deserved"", or the attention I wanted. 

We split up. A week later, she slept with my old friend, despite her various claims before: he smelled; his fat rolls held mold; he was a bitch.

Needless to say, I was upset when I found out. It was half a year ago and I'm still upset. 

But now I have TRP. I read, and I read. I realized that she wasn't a whore - she was just a woman. A woman who thought she was a little hotter than she is. She and my old friend are now in a relationship. I run into them from time to time, and I want to be better than them. I hit the gym 3, 4 times a week. 

I know my blue pill mistakes. I know the female imperative. I'm still learning,  and boy it can be hard sometimes to let go of that hero image I used to want to be years ago. But I realize that the only one who will ever truly care about me is me. 

So thanks TRP. I'm growing, even if a little slowly, because of you."

First of all, I'd like to thank the people in this subreddit for helping me make some really positive changes in my life. The X-Effect, in particular, has been incredibly helpful. Okay. Now onto the good stuff

A few months ago, I started an internship at a local startup company. It's great! The hours are the standard 8 to 5, so no more working late for me (at least not in an office), and I'm learning a lot about my chosen field (IT). The problem is that, since this is a startup, there isn't nearly as much structure to this job as I'm used to with work. I used to work my ever-loving ass off at whatever job I happened to have. Most of these, however, were low-level fast food and retail jobs where it was expected of employees to be constantly moving and/or on their feet. 

When I got here, it was a major shock to not have that constant feeling of ""okay! now on to the next thing!"". I'll get a bit of work to do MAYBE once a day, if I'm lucky and then nothing. I could keep asking for more work, but I've done that in the past and ended up slightly annoying my supervisor and I don't want to risk doing that again. 

I've gotten really good in the last few weeks about using my down time constructively, but when I'm at work I feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. The trouble is, there's nothing in particular that I'm supposed to be doing.

I just feel like he is being mistreated and I think people should know.
  
So my parents recently got a divorce and my dad had to create his own phone plan. No big deal. But, because of the divorce, he moved to a new city, got a new job, and as a result got a work phone from his new job (he is in HVAC sales). So, he contacted Verizon and wanted his old line (he had it for maybe a month) because he was going to only use his work phone. So, Verizon says no--he has to keep both or pay a cancelation fee.
  
He said that is ridiculous, and that he is still keeping the plan in place (my brother is on it) and still keeping a Verizon phone (the work one), but just using a different Verizon phone (as in, not the personal one). So, because he said he should not have to pay a cancelation fee, Verizon locked (or whatever the right word is) all of the phones on his personal plan.
  
My brother tried to switch over to my mom's plan because he is in college and summer is getting close (and he is in talks with a lucrative agency after accepting an internship). But they will not let him because they said that the fees need to be paid.
  
Verizon is holding his plan hostage all because he said he should not have to pay it, and I think he is right. The debate on cancelation fees aside, he is not backing out of his contract. He is just saying that since he is only using his *other* Verizon phone, he should be able to drop the old (but really only about a month old) phone.
  
I hope this proves true:
  
&gt;All on-topic posts are accepted, even those which may put Verizon in a negative light, but please keep it civil. We are all here to help each other.
  
And any advice that others can give for me to pass on to him would be greatly appreciated. I know that issues like this sometimes just take a nasty call (although that has not worked so far), so any tips are appreciated.
  
**TLDR;** Dad got a VZW work phone, VZW makes him pay for canceling new personal line.
  
Edit: VZW employee redditors -_-"
23axww,1,2014-04-17,Getting some other points of view. (long post),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/23axww/getting_some_other_points_of_view_long_post/,"I guess I'll just start from the beginning. So my folks split when I was 10, and they didn't handle it well at all. My mom moved in with the guy she cheated on my dad with, and he ended up being about as much of an asshole as my dad was. My dad had major anger issues, and was pretty abusive emotionally, even getting physical with me once right before the divorce. They didn't really explain anything to me, I just got dropped off at my new house with my new step dad one day. 

Things were alright at first, but ""new dad"" soon showed his angry and violent side. I went from being a model kid, to hating almost everything but smoking weed and music. I got into a little bit of trouble with the law around the age of 13, and basically became the family fuckup for the rest of my teens. I learned my lesson, but was still treated like the classical burden stepchild anytime I was home.

I quit breaking the law, except for weed, and pretty much stayed away from my house as much as possible. Being around my step dad was like constantly walking on eggshells. There really were no specific triggers, he was just a depressed and angry person who wanted to take it out on the easiest target in the house, me. So I stayed the fuck away. 

Right around when I turned 17-18, is when life became really dark. My folks lost the house because the step dad quit showing up to work and mom didn't work much/make much. She was also hating the situation and dealing with it by taking pills and drinking. So she wasn't really there for emotional support for me either. This put me on the streets with no working skills or anything to fall back on to get me on my feet. 

I found a job, and things were going well. My father comes back into the picture around age 20, because he agrees that he will finally help me get through college. I quit my job, which was on track to management, based on the promise that he would help me pay for college if I took care of rent. He broke that promise during my first quarter of school, and never provided a good explanation.  Here I was sincerely trying to make my life better, and now I am over 100 miles from my hometown stuck in another city with no purpose. 

I find a girlfriend, eventually a better job, then bam! Car accident. At the age of 23 I was facing possible permanent disability. Paralyzed arm, no medical insurance, and eventually lost the job. During this time the father wont even help me get insurance to cover some costly care, and I am handling the whole thing on my own. I begin to recover from my injuries after a long year of surgery and rehab, and the girlfriend leaves. 

Well at least now I am 24 and can get financial aid. I go to school, get great grades and find a great internship. Then I go to university. My dad keeps saying he's going to help, then never does. This happened at least three times. The last time I told him I had enough of him pulling the rug out from under me, and to not contact me with promises that will only end up broken. 

By now I'm still going to university, I am 26, but am not doing well in school. PTSD from my car accident and abusive childhood are consuming my life. Can't concentrate, sleep, remember important data for school. I was going to melt down. New girlfriend and I agree that university is probably not the best thing for me now. So I quit. Things get better, I keep working part time, and like the work I fell into. The career doesn't really require a degree, and I actually like it.  

This brings me to now. The girlfriend left due to her own emotional baggage, and the job I have wont support me for long. I'm getting interviews for the jobs I want, but they take forever to get back to you in city/gov jobs, so I'm hanging out in limbo until then. It really seems that everything I try fails, and I have been at my wits end for way too long now. I thought I would at least put the story out there to hear some outside opinions or just get my fucking mind off of all the misfortune I have survived. Feel free to ask questions because there is a lot more to the story.

23b9yw,7,2014-04-17,I am getting better at this but no result yet. Few Pointers is appreciated.,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/23b9yw/i_am_getting_better_at_this_but_no_result_yet_few/,"I have made an alternate account because my lil bro reads all of my reddit activity and recites them to me as jokes.

Hi seddit. I have been watching PUA videos and reading PUA stuff for a long time and I have finally gotten better but I am still AFC kid.

A brief description of myself. I am 20, 5""5, ""Indian"" looking in race terms (small brown kid that no girl finds attractive) and skinny (~50 kg.)

I am very inexperienced when it comes to girls. I have kissed 1 girl a year ago and made out with two few weeks ago. So I have only kissed 3 girls. That resume sucks donkey cock. I have actually ran away from girls that wanted me because I was inexperienced and was scared of embarrassing myself. Like, girls would show interest in me but I would ignore it because I thought I am gonna be a terrible kisser and show to everyone that I am so inexperienced. I am still scared about making myself look bad for this reason. I don't know where my logic is in this.


I think there are a few reasons I suck at PUA;

* I still have approach anxiety. I need a few drinks in me to get me started.
* I have terrible self worth.
* I am still horribly inexperienced so I am scared of showing this.
* I am looking in all the wrong places. Girls don't go to clubs looking for me.
* ...

More on the self worth part; My inner game is terrible. I literally have asked myself more than once ""why would girls want to be with me?"" It's a virus I can't get rid of. I am not a bad looking guy, good career ahead of me (nearly done with my 3rd year of college as an engineering student with an informal job offer from my manager where I did my internship,) I am smart, I am a nice guy (as in genuine kind not the kindness coins for sex kind,) I don't have bad sense of humour (mind you, it's a little dry.) I still am not able to change my self image even though I know the above. 

Anyway, I have been getting better, even though it requires a drink or two in me. Some of my friends even have said ""you are good with girls,"" ""you've so much confidence""... If they say that I must be doing something right. I have gone out 4 times in the last 2 months and I got 2 k close, 1 badish date, 6/7 numbers first night and 5 facebook add (most of them didn't accept, didn't expect them to.) I got 4 numbers second night and 5 facebook add (same as earlier,) third night I got 2 facebook add (one girl was very interested in me that night but after about 2 15 mins of conversations she told me she can't give me her no because she has a bf, asked her to add her on fb from my phone, she didn't accept the friend request. The other girl I still chat with some time.) The next night was a mess, I didn't approach anyone and got nothing.  Here comes the bad, very few replies on the text and very few facebook add. What am I doing wrong? I would stop drinking altogether but I feel out of place in clubs if I am not drinking, hence my most recent night out. I also can't close.


Thanks in advance."
23bm3l,1,2014-04-17,KPMG Leadership Question,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/23bm3l/kpmg_leadership_question/,"Hey guys, just had a quick question. I am a Junior in a 5 year CPA track just to throw out there. 

I was recently selected for the KPMG National Leadership Conference in Hollywood, CA. I was beyond excited when I found out I was the only student from my university to receive this offer. 

However, EY has been  my number 1 choice for a while after doing my own research, from visiting each office, and talking to many students and alumni. I was really hoping to get EY's summer leadership as well. I just found out this week that unfortunately did not happen. 

Here is my dilemma: Given the situation that I might be offered an internship from KPMG this summer after the leadership, I will have to accept or deny before fall recruiting. This means that I will be basically locked out of any of the other Big 4 internships before I can even interview for them.

I know it would be foolish to reject the potential internship just for a chance at an interview for an EY internship. So is there anything I can do to still start my career off with EY? I have heard of people switching firms after internships but I'm not sure how often that happens.

I also don't know how prevalent KPMG's reputation of being ""the worst Big 4"" is outside of the online community, but it is always in the back of my head when comparing EY and KPMG. Sorry for all the text guys, I've just been thinking about this a lot. "
23bmmz,11,2014-04-17,[Rant] [Advice] Unsupportive parents...,spamlewin,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/23bmmz/rant_advice_unsupportive_parents/,"Greetings. I don't know if this is the right place to post this, and if consulting an online community is the appropriate course of action, but here goes.

I'm the older of two children in our family. My parents, divorced (but still friends) have always ensured my sibling and I stay in school, college, etc. etc. etc. However, there's a distinct level of difference between the support we receive. To preface, I'm bored in school. I'm thoroughly uninterested in classes and subjects that don't interest me. As a result, I haven't always gotten the best grades. Not terrible grades, but not good ones either. The only exception is computer classes. Anything involving a computer is a top priority to me. I've always been good with them, and it's no surprise that I can always be found in the computer lab at my school. My sibling is sort of the ""be good at everything"" kind of individual. She's good at everything. Around 6-7th grade, my parents began shifting support and positive reinforcement away from me to my sister. To my disavowing, it's had a negative effect. I don't know why or how, but it just happened. I would be told that I was a failure night after night (by my mother mostly, but both my parents are guilty). Things went well during 7th grade. I spent all my thought-power on ignoring them. My sister would occasionally chime-in, sometimes calling me a failure, sometimes supporting me. My parents had all manner of hurtful material ready to go, ranging from accusations of ADD to just simple stupidity, to simply wasting my time and theirs with school. It's been going on for years now. If my sister so much as went to school, she was congratulated. If she scored a C on her open level (not honors or AP) science test, she'd receive a congratulations, even a Tweet or Facebook post (and since I'm forced to be linked with my parents on social media, I get the pleasure of seeing every single one). I recently participated in a computer-based competition, and was one of two people from my state/province to advance to the international level. I got a half-assed ""Good job"" from my parents. I take challenging courses (but not impossible by any standards), work my butt off to get a B or C, and sometimes lower, and I get nothing. No recognition whatsoever. I asked why a while back and they said, ""It's because we expect you to do it. Same for your sister. Why should we celebrate what you already should be doing?"". I was in the car the other day, and said (with a noticeable joking tone), ""I wouldn't mind getting an internship at Google!"". My father said, in a quite serious tone, ""That won't happen. You don't have the grades."" I was very close to opening the door and just sort of falling out. My parents know that computers are my life. I've had psychiatric help in the past to help fix relations between my father and I (we had a really lousy ""relationship"" up until I was about 13 or so). This very same psychiatric help was restricted to a ""parental-approved agenda"", which was also bored into my brain every night. When I tried to deviate to fix my inadequacies, I was promptly yelled at, and I stopped going to avoid further incursions. I tried sports. I used my talents in a season of track. My mother attended one meet. Out of the few that I stayed for. After that, I just sort of quit, due to lack of support. My educational career has been a mess ever since my parents stopped providing positive reinforcement.

If you've read this far, I appreciate you more than anything. On to the advice part. My questions are:

1) What could have caused the ceasing of support? Did I do something wrong? Say something?
2) Am I justified in planning to never seeing my parents again after college?
3) For those of you who may have dealt with this kind of thing, do you have any advice?
4) Where can I look to for support?
5) Am I simply being an emotional teen that's blowing things out of proportion?"

I am completely in love with my SO who says he doen't even know if he could love me. I worry every time I have emotions I'll loose him because he's too good for me and I barely have him as it is. I feel unlovable and unworthy. Even if I did go the 16 hours back to my home state I have no one there either. My mother is insane and my dad and stepmom give me money so I won't bug them. I miss my dog more than anything and I can't see him unless I go back because he's staying with my ex-boyfriend back home who I'm not ready to talk to yet. I feel like my dog will forget about me. I honestly want to give up. Everything in my life makes me miserable and I genuinely have no hope it will get better.  "

**5,987** film-goers for **4 years.**

You like movies? You like talking about movie? Hey, me too! Let's head on over to /r/Ijustwatched and strike up a conversation! Many filmmakers old and new have stressed the importance of watching films in a cinema to enhance your movie-watching experience visually and socially. Movies just aren't the same when you can't talk to someone about it right after you watched it. So after next time you hop on Netflix to watch a movie and deprive yourself of the visual experience the director intended, you might as well preserve the social aspect. But seriously talking about movies is really fun. 

Did you just watch [Blade Runner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/?ref_=nv_sr_1) for the first time after years of being nagged to see it? Great, head on over and talk about it! Did you just watch it for the billionth time and just noticed that Deckard could be a replicant? Great, head on over and talk about it! Just don't click on threads of movies you don't want [spoilers](http://xkcd.com/109/) for. Even if you just want to talk about how badass the music in [The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQGGQ-FCe_w) was, head on over!

Sometimes you watch a movie you just don't ""get"" and need somebody to talk too about it. Director David Lynch says claims that everyone understands a film after they see it, but they sometimes need to put their thoughts into words in order to bring out their understanding. And if David Lynch, a guy who has started dedicating his life to transcendental meditation says its true then it must be true. 

I just watched La Dolce Vita, it was a really good movie; one of Fellini's best. The cinematography was excellent and the music added a lot to the atmosphere of the film. Oh look! I just made an /r/Ijustwatched, its that easy! Even if just want to say you watched a movie and don't feel like discussing it, that's fine too! Just making a post shares movies with people who might not have heard of them otherwise. Some of my favorite films like [In Bruges](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/?ref_=nv_sr_1), [8^1/2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), and [The Seventh Seal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050976/?ref_=nv_sr_1) I discovered because of /r/Ijustwatched posts. You can find tons of awesome movies you haven't seen before here too!

So whether you want to talk about that scene where Snape kills Joe Pesci who was actually dead the whole time or just want to say how awesome a movie was, then head on over to /r/Ijustwatched. So sit back, relax, grab some popcorn, get watchin' and get talkin'.

Now lets here from the very friendly mod team over at /r/Ijustwatched:

&gt;##1. Tell us a little about yourself! (You personally not your subreddit)
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** I'm twenty two and live in Texas, I really enjoy movies and love to hear people talk about them with more passion than I can.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** I'm a 20 year old guy who likes movies. I'm currently studying Mechanical Engineering and my lifelong dream is to one day direct and star in a movie.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** I'm our only female mod. Besides film, I'm a regular gig-goer, I like fashion and makeup but also own a kick-arse drill and a huge tool box (no pun intended). But I've always dreamed of being a princess, and I LOVE shiny things. However, I'll probably always be a tom-boy at heart. I also have real life friends outside of Reddit, as implausible as that may seem. I like ale and champagne in equal measures, although if forced to make a choice I'd choose champagne (as long as it was chilled). My ideal people to be stuck on a desert island with would be Sir David Attenborough, Louis Theroux, my two BFFS (both of whom sadly live on different continents to me), my mum, and the amazing drummer Thomas Pridgen. Obviously I’d lose all of the above in favour of David Bowie, but let’s just hope none of them see this post.

&gt;##2. How did you get involved in /r/Ijustwatched?
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** I got the idea from an /r/movies comment I believe, the subreddit sat dormant for months until it spiked and got hundreds of users in one day.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** The head mod /u/ARS_ put up an announcement where he said he wanted someone to take over while he was inactive. So I applied, I got the job. My first time being a moderator on reddit.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** /u/ARS_ (whom I prefer to think of as /u/ARSE ) recruited Minion and I when he was about to vanish off to a war somewhere or other. I believe we were the only two who offered. So the poor sod basically got lumbered with us. I'd been reading the sub for quite a few months at this point and was happy to help. We grew the readership by several thousand in his absence. He got quite a shock when he returned. Is that the key achievement of my life? Well, if I get run over by a bus tomorrow, it probably is. Put that on my gravestone.

&gt;##3. Whats your favorite(s) post so far?
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** I can't say that I've had any favorite posts seeing as they are all helpful but I enjoy how the same people keep coming back and making posts for new movies, that makes me happy that we have a community that people like to return to.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** This post where a user watched The Shining backwards and forwards simultaneously. Yup.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** What a rude thing to ask. The answer of course would have to be all the posts made by moi (you have to imagine this in Miss Piggy's voice, obvs).

&gt;##4. What lesson have you learned from browsing / modding /r/Ijustwatched?
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** People really hate some movies.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** I learnt that not all subs are shitholes to moderate. We get trolls sometimes but this is a relatively easy going sub.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** To chill the eff out. I hold /u/DaedalusMinion entirely responsible for this. Note: this does not mean I accept the lessons, but just that I have an easier life as a result.

&gt;##5. Tell us about your community!
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** They can only get better.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** Chill, easy going and loves movies. If that's not the best crowd there is, I don't know what is.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** They’re mainly a good sort; we’re lucky enough not to be attacked by trolls very often. What most appeals to me about the sub is the many levels of discussion. It really is a sub for all film watchers. Sometimes people post reviews including ‘I didn’t like it, it didn’t have this’ or ‘I really didn’t understand the last third’ and other readers will take the time to chip in and explain what the OP didn’t understand or to give their alternative perspective. Sometimes such a discussion will entice the OP to go away and watch the film again, bearing in mind such comments. We can’t all pretend to be intellectual film buffs and so I think that a second, third or fourth opinion and/or watch can be invaluable in appreciating (or dismissing) a film. In short: the sub is all about dialog, which is as it should be.

I'm a new intern at /r/Subredditoftheday, and as a first time poster (and a massive movie buff) I am very proud to present /r/Ijustwatched to you all for my first post. Thank you to the mods for being so polite and helpful! I hope I'll see guys there soon to talk movies!"

&gt;##4. What lesson have you learned from browsing / modding /r/Ijustwatched?
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** People really hate some movies.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** I learnt that not all subs are shitholes to moderate. We get trolls sometimes but this is a relatively easy going sub.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** To chill the eff out. I hold /u/DaedalusMinion entirely responsible for this. Note: this does not mean I accept the lessons, but just that I have an easier life as a result.

&gt;##5. Tell us about your community!
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** They can only get better.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** Chill, easy going and loves movies. If that's not the best crowd there is, I don't know what is.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** They’re mainly a good sort; we’re lucky enough not to be attacked by trolls very often. What most appeals to me about the sub is the many levels of discussion. It really is a sub for all film watchers. Sometimes people post reviews including ‘I didn’t like it, it didn’t have this’ or ‘I really didn’t understand the last third’ and other readers will take the time to chip in and explain what the OP didn’t understand or to give their alternative perspective. Sometimes such a discussion will entice the OP to go away and watch the film again, bearing in mind such comments. We can’t all pretend to be intellectual film buffs and so I think that a second, third or fourth opinion and/or watch can be invaluable in appreciating (or dismissing) a film. In short: the sub is all about dialog, which is as it should be.

I'm a new intern at /r/Subredditoftheday, and as a first time poster (and a massive movie buff) I am very proud to present /r/Ijustwatched to you all for my first post. Thank you to the mods for being so polite and helpful! I hope I'll see guys there soon to talk movies!"
23cucy,13,2014-04-18,Outhacked,legomaster00156,twitchplayspokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/23cucy/outhacked/,"A knock came to Looker's office door.  Being the head of the operation to unravel Project Firered, he was getting constant reports from those underneath him. He set aside a folder of classified information and sat up straight.

""Come in,"" he invited.

The door opened to reveal a short, balding old man in a lab coat. Looker smiled and gestured for the scientist to take a seat. The man did so, and Looker noticed he seemed to be jittering a bit.

""Mr. Charon, is something the matter?"" Looker asked.

""Oh, no, quite the opposite, in fact!"" the scientist replied excitedly. ""We've been hard at work in Bill's programmings. I believe we have finally found cracks in his security. We have begun file extraction.""

""Really?"" Looker asked, smiling with the scientist. ""That's great news! Alright, extract everything you can and report back to me when it's complete. Back it all up on a flash drive and I'll go over the documents on my own computer."" He breathed a heavy sigh of relief. ""Finally, we may be one step ahead of-""

Two more scientists burst into the room without warning, surprising both figures already in the office. They looked much less eager to share their news than Charon had been, but even so they rattled off their reports loudly and simultaneously. Looker saw more people - mostly interns and techies - crowding behind them and joining the babble. Eventually, Looker had enough, and he stood up. He put up a hand to call for silence.

""One at a time. What is the problem?"" he asked.

""S-sir! The files from Project Firered were-!"" one scientist exclaimed.

""They had a virus, sir! Built right into them!"" the other scientist finished.

""Every computer in our network is shut down!"" one of the techies yelled. ""Our files, our firewalls, everything! We've only got one file left, and it was put there BY the virus!""

Looker's eyes went wide, and he looked between the crowd and Charon. Charon looked no less nervous by any means. Looker sighed and began to push through the crowd, which cleared for him. He walked straight up to one of the computer. True to their words, they had been wiped clean. One single file, apparently a video, was seated in the corner of the desktop.

Well, it wasn't like this could get any worse. He clicked on the file. A video popped up on the screen, with Bill's smiling face playing across it. Bill began speaking once the video was up.

""Good morning! If you're watching this video, congratulations!"" Bill said cheerfully. ""You've clearly managed to hack into one of my most secure databases. I don't know if I could hack past my own security for this. Unfortunately, your forethought clearly is not as strong as your foresight. You're probably fuming right now about how I've wiped out your entire hard drive. Hey, that's the price you pay for trying to outhack me. Have a good day.""

The video shut off, leaving Looker to put his face in his hands. Of course they wouldn't so easily thwart the men who'd invented the PC. It would take months to recover from this one mistake. Even so... they couldn't give up yet. He stood up again and turned back to the crowd of Interpol employees.

""Continue as planned. Recover any files that you possibly can, and recreate those that you can't. Contact Agent Teala on the surface and let her know of this development,"" he ordered. ""Remember, our number one concern is still Miss A. Get a 20 on her and continue observation. Back to work!""

The crowd returned to their stations at his order, and he gave a brief nod as he returned to his office. Bill would not defeat them so easily."

I know it'll be expensive, but I've heard all the horror stories about cancelling a membership, so I really want to avoid that.

I just had a few questions I was hoping some people might be able to help me with:

* Is it possibly/likely that I can find a gym that will let me sign a contract just for ~3 months?

* Can I pay upfront in cash? That way I figure they have no way of auto-renewing or giving me trouble when I try to cancel.

* How much should I expect to pay for something like this, given the timeframe and location?

And i'm getting more proficient with python, i've done some linear copolymerisation simulations, written a few scripts to manage those outputs and transform them into other inputs, i've also done quite a bit of data analysis on python and mathematica (i know, i know).

23ec01,29,2014-04-18,Just Can't Be Friends.,Quinn__,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/23ec01/just_cant_be_friends/,"I'm 18/f and am coming upon the end of my first semester of college (I graduated high school a semester early, and jumped right into the wonderful world of college). While it was fun, I also had some incredibly creepy things happen to me. Here's one of the many.


 This actually begins before I even reached campus. My mother and I were at the airport, waiting on my *twice* delayed flight when she runs into the son of a friend of hers named Matthew. She freaks out like only my mother can do, then remembers that Matthew is a sophomore at the same University as me. She introduces us, has us exchange cell numbers, and talk for a while. Eventually, hunger makes it's way to the top of my priority list and I bug her about feeding me until she caves. But just for reference, she made *me* pay for that ludicrously expensive airport food.

+ After we touchdown in Louisiana, and start unpacking my things for my dorm, my mom asks me to text Matthew and make sure he made it back okay. I do, and he ends up sending me a picture of his flight itinerary. Weird, but whatever. I believed him when he said that he made it, I didn't need proof. After drawn out (and by drawn out, I mean my mother nearly ran out of the building after we were done, thanks a lot mom) goodbyes, I was left to my own devices for a few days before school actually began. During this time, Matthew text me and tried to make plans with me for upcoming parties, which I declined. 

+ At the end of the first week of school, Matthew text me and asked if I wanted to go get ice-cream. Excited, because I hadn't really made any new friends in a week, I jumped at the chance to feel like a real college student. He took me to Cold Stone Creamery, and paid for our ice-cream, and began a conversation with the server. Somehow they ended up talking about school, and he proceeds to tell her that he only came to this particular University because I begged him to. As confused as I was, I let it go. He'd been going to the school a whole year before I had, so I didn't see why he would say that, but I chalked it up to him wanting to be funny and make a good impression on the girl. Later that day, he text me, and many of his messages had a very flirty feel to them. I explained to him I had a boyfriend, and that I really just wanted to be his friend. He said he understood, and apologized for his ""flirty personality"". While I believed him, my mind changed when right after he asked me if I was ticklish, because he wanted to tickle me. I stopped texting him.



+ The next creepy encounter I had was when he met my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years now, so we're pretty serious, not to mention ridiculously comfortable with each other. So we tend to hang out with other people for a while before they notice that we're actually together. This night we were hanging out with a couple of my boyfriend's friends, tossing around a football when Matthew pulled up in his car. He came out, greeted everyone, and began to talk to just me, blocking everyone else. My boyfriend, feeling a bit territorial, strode over and placed his arm around my shoulders. It took a minute for Matthew to put two and two together, but when he did the look on his face changed completely. My boyfriend's friends tried to interrupt the awkward moment by inviting us to go hang out in someone's dorm, to which Matthew accepted, but my boyfriend and I declined and headed back to his apartment. As soon as we reached the room, I got a text from Matthew saying that he ""approved of my choice in boyfriends"". I rolled my eyes and sarcastically replied saying ""Thank you, oh so very much"".




+ The straw that broke the camel's back was a few weeks later, after all the nonsense with him had died down. I hadn't heard from him in a while when he text me out of the blue at about 11 on a Friday morning. My university only gives classes on Monday-Thursday, so we always have 3 day weekends. On Fridays, I usually just lounge around while my boyfriend goes to his internship at a local radio station. It was simply a good morning text, and not wanting to be rude (also because I hadn't discovered how to turn off the 'read at [insert time here]' notification on my iPhone, I felt obligated. The conversation was civil for a while, until he asked whether or not my boyfriend was around. I didn't see the relevance, so I asked him why he needed to know. He responded by saying that he wanted to say something crazy to me, but didn't want me to get in trouble with him. Being incredibly naieve, I asked him what would be so bad. He responded with a pornographic picture of what appeared to be a man *raping* a teenage girl, with the text: ""I want to cut tf up with you."" I didn't reply. A few minutes later, he sent another text, asking if I'd gotten the picture. I still didn't reply.




Since then, I've seen him in passing around campus and do my best to avoid and ignore him. He even asked me to go to the movies with him and a few friends. What really bothers me about this guy is, he is aware of my relationship, and even speaks to my boyfriend whenever he sees him. My boyfriend, being a non-confrontational person, only nods back. What bothers me is that our campus is small and I run into him almost daily. And it scares me to think what he might do if he ever has the chance to get me alone. He's a pretty big guy, and I only weigh 92 lbs, so this situation could end horribly. I've been doing my best to stay with people, have my phone ready, and be aware of my surroundings, but I don't want to spend my time at school paranoid. Plus, I'm not putting my social life on hold for this creep. So far so good, but there's bound to be more in store."

It used to be great, I would sometimes take notes on it, take it with me to watch movies with or review notes while donating blood or sitting between classes. Using it for basically all reading needs. I would even use it at the coffee shop. But now I find myself gravitating back to my laptop and my tablet being largely unused, and it's not that I don't like it, but now after using my laptop again consistently, I feel things are still much easier to do on it. Granted, it may not be anywhere near as portable as the tablet (one feature I really do appreciate), but overall it seems to have more benefit. I'm not a big user of cloud networks so the limited storage on the tablet tends to be quite annoying and while I do have an OTG cable and flash drives that I use, it simply is not convenient. I've come to the point where I do like the idea of having the tablet around for when I just want to light browsing or maybe watch a movie if i'm out and about, but at the same time I see it as a gross misuse of potential funds. I could sell it and use the money to do several other things, or even sell it, and buy a first gen Nexus 7 to keep around and still put money back into my pocket. So fellow redditors, I ask your humble opinion and personal thoughts as to the fate of my tablet.

TL;DR - Own Nexus 10. Great Tablet, not using it as much, but do like having it around. Keep it? Sell it? Sell it and buy 1st gen nexus 7."

I have a question about clothes and I figured that this would be the place to come and get some answers! I am currently a sophomore in college and starting my first internship in a couple weeks. I've been lurking on this subreddit for about a month now trying to pick up whats good to wear and what goes well with what. I've thoroughly read every guide on the side bar, but I still have some questions about my summer style. 

I would like to say that I'm hoping that purchasing clothes for this internship propels me into refining my style into the fall, winter and so forth. Essentially this isn't just me trying to find what works for the summer and going back to regular college wear but starting to build a great foundation in style.

This internship is a business casual environment. After reviewing the company's Instagram it seems that they let their employees wear ss button down shirts, jeans, chinos, oxfords, etc. Shorts and graphic t-shirts seem to be absolutely off limits though.

My question is this: How much of each item should I buy? I think I want my style to be ss button down shirt, kahkis/jeans, Clark's desert shoes, belt, and watch. Also, where is the best place to start looking for all this? I've always gravitated towards Zumiez, Target, and Kohls. 

Should I purchase 5-7 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, and 1 pair of shoes? 

Guys, help me out, please?

TL;DR: New internship, business casual, need clothes, how much of each?

So I'm a 26-year-old guy and I graduated from college in December 2009 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. My GPA was below 3.0 (2.9, to be precise) because, admittedly, I slacked off, so I had trouble finding a job. It didn't help that the economy was in the toilet at the time, either. 

Fortunately, I had interned at a company in the summer of 2009 and was able to continue as a contract worker for all of 2010. After that, however, I was on my own. All throughout 2010, my parents had bugged me to get a Master's, so I decided to take the GRE and ended up doing very well. I was able to get a few letters of recommendation and ended up getting into a pretty good program. I was set to start in September 2011. In April 2011, I started a job as a contract worker at my uncle's company but, because I behaved irresponsibly, I ended up getting fired. This was a pretty low point in my life, but I knew there was still hope because I was about to start my MS program.  

However, as my MS program progressed, I knew more and more that it wasn't for me. Somehow, I managed to drag myself through the coursework, barely managing a 3.0. I was able to get an internship at a large tech company (well, let's just say it's a fruit company) through my grad program in 2012. But I think it's safe to say that I was miserable the whole time. My parents kept telling me that it'll help me find a job and it'll lead to a higher salary, but I kept wondering if it was worth it. At this point, I should mention that I paid every last penny of my tuition, housing, and living expenses out of my own pocket. Every. Last. Penny.

Anyway, my coursework is done and I've been a full-time employee at a large company for 5 months now, but my thesis still needs to be done. My employment at my current company does not depend on me finishing my thesis (at least, I'm quite sure of that but I'll definitely check, but even if I'm wrong, I'll still transfer to another non-thesis program). And I have zero interest or enthusiasm or desire to do my thesis. But my parents have sort of...bullied me into it. Every time I tried to raise this issue with them, I'd sort of get shouted down, but I think I've had enough. I have a stable, well-paying job. It's my education. It's my money. It's my choice. And I want to tell them. I might still get my MS. But it will be at a time of my choosing. I might do a thesis. I might transfer to another school that doesn't require one. But it's my choice.

But I'm scared. I still live with my parents and I'm afraid they might kick me out. I'm especially afraid of what my dad will do. After I got fired in 2011, my parents and I sat down with a social worker to iron out some mental health/emotional issues that at least partially contributed to my getting fired (these same issues have been dogging me to this day). I see that social worker regularly these days and I talked with her about maybe bringing my mom in to discuss this with her (I'm way closer to my mom than I am to my dad). I don't know what to do or say. I mean, I want to put my foot down, but I'm afraid of the backlash.  

What really sucks about the whole thing is how my mom tries to emotionally manipulate me into staying on. She keeps saying ""I need you to get this. I need you to finish. If you don't get a MS, it'll really cause me a lot of pain."" I kind of want to say ""Bitch, it's my money, my life, my education, my choice.""  

I feel like I shouldn't be so scared. I mean, it's not like I've killed somebody or like I'm going to jail or something. I still have a BS from a prestigious university, an internship at one of the biggest companies in the world on my resume, tons of skills, and 5 months and counting at another respectable company on my resume. And my current job is going quite well. Just today, my boss told me that he showed some of my work to some of the marketing people and they really liked it. I have to be honest with myself. It's my life, my choice, my money, and I can't force myself to do something I don't want to do just because my parents want me to do it. If I didn't have a job, it'd be a different issue. But I can't live a lie. Not anymore. It's been eating me up.  

But I'm just so scared of my parents, especially my dad.


tl;dr: I want to drop out of my graduate program, and it really is no one's choice but mine since I've paid every penny for it. My parents have bullied me into staying on, but I've had enough and I want to put my foot down and assert myself, but I'm afraid of the possible backlash."
23fit9,3,2014-04-19,"I cannot fall in love with this person, I have a storm brewing in my head and can't continue with my regular life, I need to get this off my chest!",NumbersSystem,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23fit9/i_cannot_fall_in_love_with_this_person_i_have_a/,"**TL;DR: Fate has aligned in such a way that the love of my life (from abroad) has been in pain for over a year holding back her affection towards me because our love was not possible. Just as I start to truly fall in love with her it is already too late, and I will now knowingly have to endure the exact same thing as her: not being able to love the one person in the world you truly feel affection for. I am regretting every decision I made over the course of the last 1.5 yrs and can't stop thinking about this**



*I posted this before in an askreddit thread, and was kind of hoping for some more reactions. I guess I really need to get this off my chest.. I would really appreciate some of your thoughts, thanks for taking the time if you will read. Here's my story:*




I have just fallen deeply in love with one of my best friends whom I met during my ERASMUS year studying abroad. I liked her from the moment I met her but was in a romantic relationship with someone back home. Me and this girl from ERASMUS flirted all the time and became very good friends, we were so much alike, we had the same sense of dirty humor and had shared interests, both studying architecture and design. We had the best time ever being the best of buddies and hanging out almost every day of a very special year.



It culminated in one of the most romantic nights of my life ever. After a party at my place, once everyone had left or gone to bed, she stayed over for the night since she was too tired to go back to her place. She was lying next to me in my bed slightly touching my sides and running her fingers over my lower back, which at that time seemed to be my most erogenous zone ever, and we talked a whole lot about life and everything. Nothing sexual ever happened and it was clear she was being respectful and holding back.



This night forever being in my memory, I showed refrain from seeing her a lot and taking her to see my country when she came for an internship after the ERASMUS year, being afraid of what might happen and still being in love with my girlfriend from before ERASMUS. This hurt her a lot, she has now told me: all she wanted was to see her good friend and all I did was hang out with her a couple of times and leave her to her own devices for most of the time, being completely alone in a foreign country.



Not until after she left I started to realize what I had let pass by me, and in tandem with my own relationship deteriorating I started to realize I had let a very important person in my life slip through my fingers. We kept in touch and talked a lot on Facebook, still being flirty and big on the sexual innuendo's we usually laced through our conversations (which I never saw as a sign of her affection). So I always kept her in mind as someone who I will someday look up again.



Now fast forward about 4 months of regular contact and just talking, still OBLIVIOUS of our now mutual feelings for each other. Out of the blue, I get the opportunity to visit her in her country on a very short notice, and we are both really psyched! I suddenly get a surge of happiness and feel like this is the opportunity I have been waiting for, she clearly loved me and I certainly as hell like her, so this surely will at least be a very nice trip no? Perhaps I set my expectations too high..



My stay there was great, just having a nice time enjoying the great weather and scenery and enoying seeing each other again. But during my time there I got this weird vibe coming from her and was too afraid to pull through on finally discussing our feelings for each other. Her affection for me was so obvious before, and I didn't see anything now, I thought to myself that I must have misinterpreted it all this time, or maybe, that she was seeing someone else, all of the worst possible outcomes came to mind..



Once this feeling crept up on me, I started feeling insecure and shutting down as I usually do, we still had a great time but there was a storm brewing in my head.. I did not know what to think of this or what to do, so I just played it out passively until I went back home, having fun as the friends we are, nothing romantic happened.



Not until I am home the next day does this idiot realize that the insecurity and the shitty feeling that came from the fact that she showed not the same affection as before, came from the fact that - I - in fact was the one very much in love with - HER - and that I was an idiot for not simply discussing this with her at that time to clear up the air of 1 year of sexual tension.. she was after all (and luckily still is), such a good friend.



So with the tiny balls I have hanging between my legs i gather enough courage to write her a fucking message on Facebook telling her that I think I love her and feel very bad for leaving her and not acting on that feeling and only then do I finally hear her side of the story which she kept to herself for all this time..



She was in love with me from the moment she met me and was constantly fighting the feeling as I was unavailable. I hurt her a lot in a way that is indescribable, it is the most unfair emotional pain that one can ever endure, being unable to love the person you truly love and having to hold that inside of you living next to that person for almost a year.. After she had endured all of this pain and had finally come at peace with it after all that time, she decided it was just not to be this way and had moved on, settling for our friendship.



So just as I realize I am head over heels for her, she just got over it. I feel so stupid for never having acted on the tiniest of feelings for her which were there from that first night we slept together. I feel so stupid for being such a pussy and not having acted in the whole week I was lying next to her every night when I went and visited. I feel so sorry for having let her down when she was in my country. I feel like the universe is playing a cruel joke on us, torturing us individually by letting our feelings just be one year apart like this.



At the moment I am still very much in love, and maybe naively hope that she might turn around and realize she hasn't completely buried her feelings for me, but I cannot expect her to do this since we are now back to living apart from each other for another few months. I feel like I should just take a plane back and make up for every promise I failed to fulfill but I am too scared and, most of all, regular day life such as work and school are holding me back. This is probably my biggest heartache, I have all these strong feelings for her but these fucking rational things are holding me back from the only thing I really want.. And I then realize that that is probably how she must have felt all this time..



We still talk, and are now very honest about our feelings towards each other and I try to keep it cool, but deep down inside I know I will have to get over her in the next months and it will never be the same. I will either see her finding a nice guy where she lives, slowly see our relationship fade and/or have to surgically remove her from my life before I can truly cope with this, which will be a very hard band-aid to pull off. 


Right now I am completely unable to do anything work-related, I have a storm brewing in my head and can't possibly focus on anything serious I actually am supposed to be doing, the emotions are just too strong. I constantly overthink everything I did in the past, and I know I cant change them but I feel very stupid for fucking up three times by being a passive scared-y-pants. I just want to go back, take a plane and go see her, but I feel like I truly missed my opportunity and can't just show up again and demand that we now both can be in love and be happy, since I will have to get back within a few days anyways and she has just done coping with her feelings.



My idea is that I will just continue regular life until the summer and then go and surprise her, being the most romantic motherfucker ever, showing up with all the flowers and chocolates I jokingly promised her all the time we were still flirty-friends. I will either get shot down right then and there or I will get my feelings answered, that's all I kind of want right now, closure.. Right now all I do is sit on facebook and reddit and wait for her to tell me about her day as we usually do, make some stupid jokes on how I love her and then both go our own way again. 


At this point I would like to thank you for reading and I would like to ask you what you think of all this and what you would do. Next to that I wonder how you guys here cope with doing work (school/uni/job) while you have such strong emotions which you just cant ignore.. 



Thanks for reading Reddit

23fotu,3,2014-04-19,On Campus Jobs,Doombuggie41,umass,https://www.reddit.com/r/umass/comments/23fotu/on_campus_jobs/,"I'm a student who will be going to UMASS next year for computer science. I was just wondering what sort of on campus employment opportunities existed for freshman students during school.

I'm majoring in computer science and have worked in the technology department of a large retail chain. I've done computer repairs, onsite jobs, tutorials, etc. I also work as an assistant research coordinator for drug studies at a hospital. That also opened the door to me to have an internship in the IS/IT department at the hospital over the coming summer.

I'm obviously aware of jobs like working in the kitchen or being a tour guide, but are there any kind of jobs (such as one in the OIT) that I could pursue (eventually, if not freshman year) that could boost my resume and give me more valuable work experience than cooking food or showing applicants dorm rooms?"
23fvx3,87,2014-04-19,"I'm starting to hate other Christians, at least the ones in my college fellowship group",sameproblemhere,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/23fvx3/im_starting_to_hate_other_christians_at_least_the/,"I came across this thread, and it sums up my feelings EXACTLY: http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1yw35y/anyone_else_getannoyed_with_other_christians/

They may act like the friendliest, warmest people when you first meet them, but it's a facade. (If you're alert, you'll notice the first questions they ask you are your background in Christ, whether you read the Bible daily, whether your family is Christian.) One of the **PRIMARY MESSAGES** they emphasize is ""bring more people to God."" So I feel like everyone is just being fake and trying to bring as many people to God as they can through fake, half-hearted friendships. That's not what friendship is about.

For the first 2 years, naive me thought it was real friendship. These people always post encouraging Bible verses on Facebook and express how religious they are in church. But then I noticed as soon as we're outside church walls, these same people begin gossipping (about OTHER members of the church, even), backstabbing, and trash-talking. When I'm actually sick or going through tough problems, none of them bother to follow up. But when I don't show up to church one week, they ask me judgmentally why I was so busy to as to miss church. (""Did you have a lot of work? Were you busy?"")

I should probably mention how last summer, none of them congratulated me about a research internship I got with a large-name university. If anything, the people whom I thought were my friends got sour looks on their faces, and when I returned this semester, one of them completely started ignoring me. 

(And in case you're wondering, I never brag or boast about any of my achievements. One of them asked what I was doing that summer and I mentioned the internship, and got an, ""Oh"" in reply. Huh.)

But that last part's another story. Anyway, this semester I met some people from a non-religious organization (just a regular college club), and I have to say *these* people were some of the most honest, open-minded people I've seen. But I'm entering my senior year of college and I feel I've just wasted 3 years and unnecessary emotional distress because of my church group. Plus I don't even have any real friendships to show from it. F my life? What am I supposed to do?

23gftj,0,2014-04-19,"IamA successful at every job and interview I've ever had (Big Tech, Big 3 Consulting), and I want to help you! AMA!",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gftj/iama_successful_at_every_job_and_interview_ive/,"Hey Reddit,

I've been along time subscriber to r/jobs and r/AMA and wanted to contribute some of my knowledge on interviewing, securing a job and how to be your company's rising star. The following advice will follow this outline: 1. How to make yourself a top candidate, 2. how to outperform all other candidates during the interview process, 3. How to be the rising star in any organization you join. Please ask me any questions you may have and I will try to help as much as possible! 

1.0 How to make yourself a top candidates

* Resume: Easy enough to find good resources
* Stay busy: Whether it is part time jobs, internships, temp work, or just picking a talent that you have and teach others, be the person who doesn't take no for an answer and gets things done. In my case, while studying and preparing for interviews, I taught my hobby full-time to people around the city. No company I interviewed look down on this because of below:
* Become PROCESS-Oriented: I cannot emphasize this enough. Process oriented can be explained simply as following some sort of flow that others can follow on with. This is why methods like STAR and the 5Cs or 4Ps were invented. They are a process to follow to make sure you hit every item. More on the actual process later. But a process-oriented person shines through their resume, their cover letter, their email communication, and in their networking ability. There is no job that a process-oriented person cannot handle. These are the candidates the top firms go after.

2.0 How to outperform

* Preparation: Obvious enough, if you expect to get at a top company, how much time would you expect to spend preparing? 1 hour on your resume and cover letter? Try more like 150-200 hours. This is how much time me and all the people I practiced with spent on preparing for ONE company, let alone others. The good thing is that the preparation for the one, will help with all your others
* Preparation: This one is about how you think. As stated above, you want to be process-oriented. This means that from every word uttered out of your mouth is easy to follow. You want it to be so easy that the person sitting with you can guess the ending. This is the mark of an excellent process-oriented individual. We know how they think and that, given enough time, they will get to the answer no matter what. This is the type of individual ALL firms love to hire. Leader material
* Preparation: Confidence is key. For those who are shy, the above two preparation steps will help you be more confident so that you can rely on your process to explain all questions and answers carefully and clearly. This will allow them to be confident in YOUR ability to do the job even though you may seem nervous at the interview (which is normal for anyone, even myself, even though people say I'm good at interviewing but am actually incredibly nervous

2.1 Process-oriented thinking example: Below is the example about a question I got at my current company, yes it may seem dumb, but this one question and one answer set me apart from every single individual in my current company. I became immediately known before I came in for how I answered this question. It has made me the rising star from the get go. (Caveat, I joined a smaller tech company of less than 500 because I wanted to be a big fish)

* Question: How do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Here are two answers:

A. Uh, you get some breaded, put some PB&amp;J on, spread it around and put them together?

B. (My answers) I would divide the task into three parts:1. Preparation, 2. Executing, 3. Review. The preparation would consist of planning out what type of pb&amp;j we're going to make, such as:

3. What type of bread
4. What design?
5. What about the peanut butter,
6. what type of Jelly
7. Materials need?
8. others etc.

Now let me go a bit deeper to show what I would need to do within each of those categories

1. What type of bread -- White, Wheat or other? -- Bagel, or other bread types?
2. What design? -- PB on both sides or one? -- Inside or outside jelly? Jelly on the side?
3. Nutello and others added?
4. What about the peanut butter, -- How much PB? - Lot, little, how many spoonfuls? -- What type? - Chunky, Smooth, mix? -- Use a spoon or knive to spread?
5. what type of Jelly -- Repeat of PB
6. Materials need? -- Knives? How many, what type, etc. -- Fork? How many, what type, etc -- Plate, Paper towel? Round or square, paper, plastic or ceramic, etc.
7. others etc.

Next I'd go into the actual making of the PB&amp;J Sandwich: ( This part i did quicker as I demonstrated above that I can go several levels into each step, and can continue on as necessary. I'm showing my thought process vs answering the literal question.)

1. Cutting style -- Several layers of detail underneath
2. Layering the PB -- Several layers of detail underneath
3. Layering the Jelly -- Several layers of detail underneath
4. Placing and decorations -- Several layers of detail underneath
5. Cleanup -- Several layers of detail underneath

Lastly I'd enter the review step: (I've gone into a little more detail here as we didn't have much time at the end and I couldn't exactly remember what I said here as by that point, it didn't matter anymore as I had nailed the interview)

1. Quality/Quantity -- Costs -- What does the market want -- How much of x to produce y
2. Requirements document -- Step by step instructions on how to repeat -- Simple language for future users -- etc
3. Future iterations / improvements -- How to cut done preparation -- Minimize execution time -- Market analysis -- Customer survey
So planning, executing, and reviewing main areas I would focus on when making a PB&amp;J sandwich.

* As you can see, this type of question can have quite a lot of depth. I can't tell you how much this has helped me at this company and will continue to help me as I progress.

3.0 How to be the rising star: 

1. If you prepare with the above two points, you will come into the organization ahead. This is one key point to being the rising star
2. Be eager: Be the person who wants to be promoted: Can't tell you how many people I've passed up because I sought that promotion from day one even though I was definitely not qualified yet. But you know what? I got the chance to interview for a position I'm probably 3-4 years away from qualifying from because they knew I was A. Eager. B. Ready to take on any challenge. Now this 3-4 year requirement has changed to 1 year and I'm looking for that promotion in 2-4 months.
3. Process-oriented in all that you do. Whether it's writing an email, drafting a training guide, or creating a requirements document, write everything following a process. This WILL make your work stand out from all others, you will succeed because of it.

A little about myself so that you have a reason to believe the above advice is valid. 

* Careerwise

1. I secured an internship at a top 3 management consulting firm at age 21 in a foreign country (didn't speak the language well, didn't know what I did below)
2. Failed to secure a full-time job after internship due to be unprepared and unready
3. Decided to work at another consulting company in the above foreign country
4. After 3 years, I decided to make myself ready to join a Big 3 consulting firm after finishing my MBA and scoured the internet for resources to make myself ready. 
I ended up finding two important resources that turned me around as a candidate: A. Victor Cheng's www.caseinterview.com and B. Case study partners (or interview practice buddies)
After that, I was able to secure an offer from any company I applied to, whether a top tech company or a top consulting company. Since joining my current software company, I've been able to secure a promotion within 4 months and on track for #2, a management promotion, in 2 months.

How I know my advice is valid:

1. Personally tutored 10 people while interviewing and helped 7 of those people get a job at Mckinsey, Bain, or BCG. That is a 70% hire rate in an industry with traditionally 5% or lower. 
2. Promotions stated above with a fast track to upper management from all executives in the company (3 promotions in 2 years)
3. Offers from top consulting companies mentioned above

Job Opportunity: I hope this was helpful to you all. I've come a long way myself and would be more than happy to coach anyone who is willing to learn.

I'm sure that a few of you might have had the same problem I am having, so I would like some feedback. Since I got into Seddit, I have gained a ton of confidence, am able to talk to anyone easily (girls compliment my intelligence and wit all the time), and I have become a leader (e.g., people sit me at the end of tables for projects, and I give people orders and they follow them and seek my validation). However, my dating life has not improved much. 

I have friends whom are about as equally as intelligent and attractive as I, BUT they are the most beta people I have ever met, and yet they get more girls than I. They exchange at least 50 texts per day with HBs and they ask girls out in the most wishy-washy ways (e.g., ""when will you be free?... ok, what do you want to do?"" or ""we should hang out sometime""). They send the girls the stupidest messages ever. Yesterday, my friend showed me he sent a girl a picture of himself shirtless. And on top of that they talk about the most meaningless shit ever. And despite that, the girls actually go out with them. I actually third wheeled my friend on a date, and it was incessantly painful for me. My friends was constantly supplicating her — my friend was really nervous the whole time and trying to endlessly please her and do things for her even if she didn't care. The girl told me she loved him a lot, but it honestly seemed like she didn't give two shits about him, and if I didn't know any better, I would've thought she was coming on to me (but that's besides the point).

On the other hand, I ask girls out in person before I have their phone number. I'm not too invested in them and I don't supplicate them. After they have shown enough interest, I'll ask them out on a date, and explicitly say DATE. Usually, that's where I lose a lot of girls. They'll turn me down, and say we could still be friends. 

One of my hypothesis is that it could be because I pursue women that have a lot of things going on (a lot of them have internships and jobs, at the same time), and my friends pursue girls that don't have a lot of things going on. 

I don't know though, what does Seddit think? "

It's me, Jerry, presidential intern, as you know, I've had it a bit interesting since I've got here. My local pharmacy loves me, I'll tell you that. My therapist, Dr.Mustacheck, he has me on three different anti-psychotics, I think they are helping, but it's hard to tell. I can't tell if I'm going bonkers, or if the whole world is. I mean, I keep having these really vivid dreams, where the whole world is being destroyed, or taken over or something, and there is this massive war. Someone died, and now someone is getting revenge. It's really hard to remember, I just took like, four pills.

Also, update since last time, the ghost in the New White House is real, I'm not just going nuts. Apparently he is real, and is also former President Sonic Star. He is really annoying, and won't leave me alone. I really don't like him, but at least President Lilly helps me out, she is really nice at times to me. She is a bit of a slave driver, but, it's not always bad. Plus, I can't lose this job, or I lose my scholarship, and then I can't go to school anymore. I already have another job, since my girlfriend kicked me out, to pay for an apartment.

Also, it gets old having the Devil zip in once a week, to complain about some show, and it seems that President Lilly has started watching it as well, so, it's just gotten worse. Also, she and the first lady are so loud, just all the time. It's ridiculous, I have to play my music so loud to ignore them.

It isn't all bad, I've met the King of Mars, he seemed nice, and his father, who seemed not dead. I don't mean weekend at Bernie's, I mean, like, back from the dead. I've met a few others, but I'll tell you about them next time.

So, this is the end of my Blog tonight guys, I'll see you soon.

23hl57,4,2014-04-20,I [22 F] am terrified of going to work at the same place as my ex [25 M] of 10 months when I graduate college in May.,underth3radar,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23hl57/i_22_f_am_terrified_of_going_to_work_at_the_same/,"I interned at a company last summer and met him on my first day of work. Within 2 weeks we were dating and started basically living together (even though I still had my own apartment) a couple months later. Things got very serious very fast, and when I got the offer to come back after graduation for a full-time position we started making long term plans for getting a place together, meeting parents etc. During this time I also discovered he is bisexual, and eventually came to the painful realization that he was never going to be happy being in a monogamous relationship with just me (he never cheated, just talked about threesome, swinging, etc. very often).


I broke up with him a couple of months ago and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do because he was my first love. Everyday I wish there was some other option because I want to be with him. 


I'm terrified of having to see him when I start back at work in May. We will be working very close to eachother on the same floor, and are also both on the same team so I will see him in meetings etc. 


I don't know how I will handle this. We were pretty much together for the entirety of my internship last summer, so I cant imagine not walking in to work each morning with him, or hanging out with him when I get bored, or practicing presentations with him, or going to him when I need help with something. It's going to be a slap in the face when I realize I'm completely alone at work and he's not going to pop his head in and joke around with me when he gets a free minute. 


If anyone has experience with this, please please help me figure out how to handle this. I'm terrified of how my body will respond the first time I see him in the hall or in a meeting. 


I thought I was slowly getting over him over the past couple of months, but as graduation gets closer and I realize I'm going to be face to face with him in a month I'm completely breaking down and losing it. My stomach is in knots and I'm having a hot flash just thinking about it. 



TL;DR Terrified of having to see my ex at work every day after I graduate."

Yeah so, basically, I'm a brown belt from Scandinavia. I won gold in Rome IO in my (rather tough) division. Then I cut some weight, felt tired and only placed second in the No-Gi Europeans the day after. Ugh!

Well, in any case, I'd like to compete in the international scene a lot more. But I have no money! GAAH! It's driving me insane. I'm a student, and I'd love to partake in all (or at least one or two?!) the big international tournaments, because I know I'd do well -- for example, my division in Rome IO had a 2013 brown belt no-gi world champion, so I'm pretty confident that I know at least a bit of jiu jitsu. In any case, so expensive. Mad! And gis are expensive, too. And apparently, if you're not from the US or from the UK, no one really has any interest in you, even if you do really well and have a lot of potential...?

So like, how do other people do it? The more-or-less professional fighters? Do you guys know any? They're being sponsored by gi companies and such, I presume? Aaaand I suppose they get money teaching jiu jitsu? Well, here you don't. And I'm currently studying 5 days a week, which includes working as an intern, and then training every day for as much as I can. It's exhausting, and doesn't really feel worthwhile all the time, as I still can't participate in international tournaments.

So uh, yeah. Got that off my chest, at least.

23ietg,1,2014-04-20,Backpack for working 8 months in Paris (x-post from /r/minimalist),thatslexi,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/23ietg/backpack_for_working_8_months_in_paris_xpost_from/,"Hi! 

I'm French and moving to Paris for 8 months, including 6 during which I'll be doing an internship in the luxury business (which is why I need to wear casual but elegant clothing at work). As a personal challenge, I have chosen to only take a (big) backpack with me, and a handbag (big enough for carrying my computer).

Here is my packing list. Do you think I've forgotten some important stuff, or there are some things that I absolutely don't need? (For the first few weeks I'll be staying at friends' or couchsurfing, until I find a small flat to move in.)




BACKPACK

-A handbag (which I both use for work and for going out – it’s too small for carrying my computer, which is why I’ll just fold it and put into my backpack instead of using it as my smaller travel bag, which I’ll show you under this list)

-Some plastic glasses; they will let me live without having to buy glassware immediately after moving, and when put inside a big sock, they also provide small storage inside the backpack.

-A Thermos food container (I’ll have to check if it also keeps liquids – if it doesn’t, I’ll carry a 50cL water bottle in the train). The best part about this container is that there’s a spoon inside the cap! My mom bought it for me a couple of years ago, and it proved really useful.

-Cloths; since my mom has a lot, I wouldn’t want to have to spend money on lower-quality ones. Plus, since I might be staying in pretty filthy places in the beginning since I don’t want to spend much, I’d rather be able to wash the floor a little!

-A towel, because being clean is cool and being dry is even cooler.

-A toiletries purse, including makeup and jewelry

-A pair of sunglasses

-One large T-Shirt to sleep in

-Underwear, consisting of: 15 panties, 6 bras and 15 pairs of socks if I’m lucky (which I am not, so I’ll take whatever I can find)

-One pair of high-heeled work shoes, which I would DEFINITELY not bring if I wasn’t forced to wear them at work. They take lots of space and they hurt my feet.

-One pair of casual shoes, which are extremely light and don’t take lots of space, but could be more comfortable. Guess you can’t have everything.

-2 trousers that I can wear for work

-2 skirts: one I can wear for work, one casual

-1 pair of casual shorts and the appropriate leggings (which will also do for wearing under a skirt or a dress, or as comfy clothing for home; multi-purpose is the key word here)

-1 pair of casual jeans, as light as possible

-Sports clothes: one tank top, one pair of running pants.

-2 pull-overs for work

-2 tank tops

-4 tops which I can wear at work

-1 casual T-Shirt

-1 formal work outfit

-1 little black dress; that stuff really goes with everything formal or dressy casual.

-1 raincoat (or, more specifically, light coat that also incidentally happens to be waterproof)

-My tea collection, if there's a bit of extra space





IN MY SMALLER BAG

This bag has a shoulder strap. I will put my fragile and important stuff, and the things I might need to use often.


-A pen and a notebook

-A pair of scissors: I do not want scissors in the same bag as my clothes.

-My computer, its charger, my earphones, the mouse and the mousepad; the mouse and mousepad may go in the big bag if there is still space.

-A folder for all my printed documents (I’ll scan most of them, but keep the insurance and the mandatory papers to get an apartment), including all my TIME covers, which make fantastic decoration for an apartment wall, aren’t heavy and barely use up any space

-A stick of deodorant

-My wallet

-My phone and its charger




WHAT I'LL BE WEARING DURING THE MOVE

For maximum space gain, I’ll be wearing my heaviest gear:

-A scarf

-Sports shoes

-Jeans

-A warm pullover, fit for work

-A top that’s fit for work

-A warm jacket (which I’ll probably carry in my hand because it might be pretty warm in May)

-My glasses







So, any advice? =)

Thank you Redditors!"

i was in a relationship at age 14, that i held on to after the expiration date in 2003.
i was hospitalized once for depression in 2005. 

i broke up with my girlfriend in january 2006. i had hope for the future, i was happy to be a free man to do what i wished. i drank for the first time in february 2006 - age 20- and i smoked for the first time in may 2006. i went to la for a research program that summer, and loved it.  i smoked once more in 2006.  my life was going great! i was finishing three bachelors degrees and headed to grad school.

i smoked once in 2007, at the end of my senior year of college. i was doing well, starting grad school. i became really depressed. was put on medication for bipolar disorder.

i started 2008 with some hope: i'd have an internship at microsoft games this summer. a lot of interns at msft smoked.  i smoked ~ 30 times that summer. i was happy. i had practice thinking about why i could be happy, what that felt like and why i should do more of that.  the internship ended, i started working full time in fall 2008. i started dating a wonderful, beautiful girl named christine.  i was happy, but something was still missing. i was still sad inside. christine and i broke up in october.  i smoked again in december.


i came back from visting my family for christmas and felt really depressed. i wanted to get high. i found a dealer in town, and i smoked ~ 100 times in 2009.  i'd come home from work, get high, and work on a game that i hoped i could sell. i started thinking about the future being unstable, and told myself i could save the world. in the spring, i told myself  i should quit. i tried; it didn't stick. 


i smoked ~ 200 times in 2010. i was miserable. i changed girlfriends a few times, put one game 'on hold' and started another, put that 'on hold' and started another. i changed jobs. moved to san francisco, as if that would help me. i was obsessed with zen buddishm and thought weed would help me reach enlightenment. i was obsessed with the singularity and thought weed could help me start it. i tried to quit multiple times; i'd smash my piece, give away my stash, and each time i'd relapse a few days later. the first time i'd ever carried a balance on my credit card was march 2010. it gradually grew bigger and bigger. i took out a loan against my 401k to try to help pay the card down. it didn't work.

i smoked ~ 300 times in 2011. i changed jobs twice more. i was an early employee (#11 or so) at uber - which is now a $3bn comapny. i was the CTO of game company. i spent two months in ukraine, and was sober the whole time as well as another month afterwards. the first time in years i felt this good. i was working hard, exercising - even eating vegetables. i moved out of SF and was away from drugs all the time - but also away form my friends. i relapsed in fall 2011 and started having intense hallucinations.   i felt like the whole world was based on lies, emotional games and manipulation that nobody talked about. i was angry at the world.  i took on more credit card debt and spent 20k on therapy.

i smoked ~ 400 times in 2012. i spent another 10k on therapy. i hallucinated all the time, thought 2012 was it, and that the whole world depended on me. that i was dead and in purgatory. that i was in the matrix. that i was in a false reality and could peel away the veneer if i got high enough. that i could talk with animals and that i was prometheus and mercury, the jesus of computers and a techno-buddhist hacker warrior monk, alan turing reincarnated, an alien lizard who had learned empathy and wanted to communicate it to the new world order financial elite who were also lizard people trying guard the multiverse. they saw empathy as a weakness and i wanted to communicate to them that it's a strength. they laughed at me with sharp teeth, flicked their tongues. i had broken ancient laws to keep the world safe, and tried to invoke ancient powers to destroy it. i wanted humans to travel to the stars, and i wanted civilization to crumble before we got out there to pollute them, too. i was hospitalized in january, again in august, again in december after a serious breakdown. my car was stolen, my house was broken into, the rental car i'd been driving was smashed in a hit an run, my uncle had brain cancer and my grandma was developing dementia. i existed in all universes at once, the bodhisattva sent to enlighten the world by being high all the time. my ex girlfriend christine moved across the country and moved in as a roommate, a friend. she had no idea how bad things were, and she took care of me when i had the breakdown.

i smoked ~ 40 times in 2013. i was hospitalized twice in january, with no job. my family and friends told me to throw in the towel as a functional adult and to go on social security. i kept going. i got a job at google. i was terrified to fall asleep every night. the dreams were weird and unstable. i was always in a computed reality, punished for my sins, but my kindly captors who wanted me to learn the error of my ways. i was still hallucinating regularly, but i kept the hallucinations inside and didn't tell anyone about them. i still smoked about once a week or so at first. i started dating christine again, with the agreement that once i paid off my credit card debts - which i'd accumulated over the past few years - we'd get engaged.  i worked at google, i tutored for extra money, and i completed a small mobile app early in the year. christine and i fought every time i smoked, which i did less and less often. each time it was intense, i felt powerful and terrified and confused and certain. i couldn't sleep for a day or two and felt depressed for three or four. i smoked every week or so at first. every month or so after that.  things gradually got better. i went from having no car to driving a 15-year old toyota to a 3 year old mazda that my fiance took the risk of cosigning on for me. i exercised more. all year long, week by week, things got a little better. the last time i smoked was late october 2013.


since then, i have received two awards at work. a product i created is now in beta, i've written a manuscript for a novel. i'm healthier; i run several times a week, faster and with better form than ever. i paid off all my credit card debt. my finance christine - who believed in me when no one else did - are engaged and planning our wedding. i have vivid dreams. i accept my weaknesses. i spend less than i earn. i plan for things. i have a todo list. i eat vegetables. i believe in myself, and i see my mistakes now as chances to learn instead of indicators that the world is broken.

you can do this, guys. just don't give up. keep going. "

Two schools in mind:
Direct admitted into Indiana University's Kelley Biz school
Kentucky with more scholarships and cheaper costs

IU would cost me about 130k-140k in loans while Kentucky would cost me about 40k.

Parents will be providing little to no money unless they still stick with their plan to downsize their home (which doesn't sound brilliant to me). I have about $5k in savings myself and I'm making a couple of thousand over the internet so far.

Majors in mind: Finance/Accouting however I am taking interest into Econ and Stats as well.

What do you guys think is my best plan of action? Thanks for any advice.

Also a follow up question that was on my mind is whether or not IU would be worth the extra money because of its higher rankings.

I plan on busting my ass to get internships or to pick up a minor as well, so would those rankings not even matter when I could go the cheaper route to Kentucky?"

I've always been a sting bean my whole life and I'm really hoping to bulk up this summer. Problem is I got a internship which requires me to work **8am-5pm monday-friday** every week of the summer. 


However, I have an hour lunch break! There is a nice gym 5 minutes away so I've decided to commit **every single** one of my lunches to going to the gym and trying to bulk up. Problem is whenever I'm at the gym I never know what to do, I have **no routine or schedule** when I'm there.


I was hoping all you smart people of r/Fitness can help me get a routine I can follow every week to bulk up! I will be getting food on my way back to work and most likely eat it at my desk. It will probably consist of yaya's chicken pitas (because they are deliciousss!) and a pro-crunch bar/protein shake drink for that **extra protein**. 


As for my routine, I've heard **bench press**, **squats**, and **deadlifts** are the necessary trio to bulk up at the gym. I really want to get a bigger upper body so I was thinking of doing bench press monday, wednesday, and friday, and then on tuesday and thurday I would do one squat day and one dead-lift day. 


On top of these exercises, I would like to do other exercises for my other muscles, probably for my biceps, triceps, shoulders, and back but I'm uneducated in what would help me get bigger in the best way. Also, I want to make sure my muscles won't be unbalanced. 


I would love to hear some of your routines or recommendations for what I should do. I'll probably only have a **maximum of 45-50 minutes** to workout but I will stick to the schedule **5 days a week religiously**. Once Fall hits, I will go back to my college, and hopefully I can bring my workout to a gym near my college.


Also, if people were interested in progress pics, I might do a couple pics before the summer starts and then pics after the summer is over, but that's only if people are really interested. 


I hope I'm not violating any rules, but I would appreciate anyone's input! Thanks everybody!!"

I'm having an extremely difficult time with my college decision and I need your help (and fast because it's due in like a week...). I plan on majoring in computer science, but I'm not the stereotypical nerdy computer science student. I played football and lacrosse in high school and I want to join a fraternity in college, hell half the the reason I applied to Clemson is because of how awesome the football culture seems! So I wanted to hear from Clemson computer science students or alumni about the computer science program. It isn't as highly ranked as the other schools I'm considering, but that doesn't really matter to me all that much as long as the opportunities are there. Do you find that there are a lot of options for internships and jobs? I've been trying to find statistics for job placement or average starting salaries and I haven't found much, so that's why I'm coming to you. Tell me a little about your experience with the program!

Like I said I don't really consider myself a nerdy kid, and I really wanted a college town feel with the school I go to, so that's what made me feel like I would fit in at Clemson versus the other schools I am considering, like Georgia Tech. I also wanted to go somewhere warm and in the south with a great football atmosphere which makes Clemson seem way better than the other school I'm considering, Purdue. The only problem is that both of those schools seem to offer so many internship and job opportunities so I'm worried that choosing to go to Clemson just because it's cheaper and seems like way more fun isn't the best idea...(if you could convince me otherwise that would be great!)  

Also, coming from New England, would I fit in? I love college football and everyone says I'm pretty preppy so I thought it would be a great fit, but do people look at you differently if you aren't from the south? It seems like most of the fraternities are primarily South Carolina kids, which I wouldn't really mind, but would they not even consider me because I'm not from the area?

Anyway, thanks in advance for your help. Hopefully I'll be at your school in the fall, and if not I hope you guys can give me some good advice to help me find the right fit no matter where that is!

**TL;DR** How is the computer science program with getting internships and a job after college? Clemson seems like a great fit for me and it's about $10,000/yr cheaper than Georgia Tech or Purdue, the only problem is those schools seem to have much better career opportunities. Is this really the case, or are the opportunities there for you at Clemson if you work hard enough?"

It was a casual hook up but we eventually started to fall for each other. We had great chemistry. She suffers from depression, so I'm assuming this is why she made a post on CL. She kinda fell for me hard in the beginning and the by the time xmas came we both loved each other. She also gave me an STD, chlamydia. I got suspicious of course as we both tested for STDs before we were serious in this relationship. I don’t know if she cheated tbh, because she would always text me or be with me generally.

Once summer time came she did her internship in South America and we did long distance for the whole summer, 5 months or so. We would always contact each other via text and skype when we can. I also visited her there and we had a blast. She came back when school started again. Over the course of the relationship I would help her with her depression (she has to take anti-depressants). She would feel extremely down and I would comfort her all the time, not at her request but because I loved her. She also lived with me and my family for a month because she couldn’t find a place in time once school started. Her father issues were pretty bad and I would comfort her at times of need.

She seemed to be bothered that I lived at home still. I mean I am mid 20s but I have no debt, my school is 15 mins away with my car and I also work (on and off during my relationship with her). I had money saved up from previous jobs as well. We would go on dates and do what other couples would usually do. One time my mother got upset at her because I wasnt invited to her family gathering, even though she was living at our place like she was part of our family. She let her know, to the point where my gf cried and felt terrible. 

After Valentines she told me that we shouldn’t see each other anymore. I was devastated, with everything I sacrificed and have done for her. She said that her feelings changed for me, that she doesn’t know, that she loves me still... all confusing shit. What I'm wondering is how the hell did she stop loving me? I have no closure about this relationship and why she ended it like that. I would text her, or call her asking what happened? Her birthday was also coming up and I had all her gifts. I gave them too her (we both decided to be 'friends'). They were sentimental stuff that I bought before the break up. A few days later she wanted to meet and talk. She said that she knew why she wanted to break it off, its because I live at home. So I told her that Im moving out anyways at the end of the summer. We walk to her place and she grabs me and kisses me. So I guess we were back together. We took it slowly.

After about a week of us being together, she got the stomach flu and I took care of her for 3 days by cleaning her place, making food, bringing food and being there for her emotionally and physically. She doesn’t have family in my city and her close friends dont either. Once she got better she broke it off with me again, so suddenly. I just dont get it, how can someone do that? Did she ever even love me? Was I just used? We planned so much together and she just threw it out. I tried contacting her to get know what happened exactly and how to improve myself in the next relationship, but she won’t answer my questions regarding about the relationship. Im still confused and really hurt by all of this. I think I just needed to vent, or get some inside information….

BTW there was no signals of her breaking up with me. She was a bit needy and still affectionate till the end.

It's a long one, so bare with me.

So I went on my fraternity formal trip to New Orleans with a girl I was set up with, whom I had never met before this. She turned out to be great, attractive, fun, and spontaneous. We hit it off pretty quickly on the bus ride there, she fell asleep on me, all that. I wasn't trying to have sex with her, I was only in it to get to know her (I'm at the point where I'm tired of just one-time hookups). She informed me that she was going to California (we live in Florida) in two weeks for an internship at Imagine Studios, and said that if she liked it, she probably wouldn't stay in Florida for too long and move out there permanently. So... Keep that in mind. 
Saturday was a little nerve-wracking, because the whole day I could tell she was holding back from getting to close to me, but we managed to have fun during the day, walked around the French Quarter together, and she made friends with all the people we hung out with. My friend (also a girl) befriended her and attempted to get her closer to me. She found out that ""she's not one to rush into relationships"" or ""doesn't think she deserves a relationship"", which could mean anything basically. Also, that she's more into the bad boy types, which I am not. 

That night, we went out, got drunk, and she was holding my hand for a majority of the night. Me and her went to the river and ""broke in"" to the ferry dock. She kissed me there, but we left because some security guard caught us, and went back to Bourbon Street. Once we got back to the hotel, we had sex. It wasn't good, I had whiskey dick and for some reason decided a condom was going to improve things. So basically the sex wasn't great, but I enjoyed it and she seemed to. Hell, I even apologized for my limpness, and she said she didn't mind (she might have...I couldn't tell). The bus ride back today was uneventful, because she wanted to sleep in an empty pair of seats, and I ended up sleeping the entire ride and didn't speak to her. Not intentional. And it was an awkward goodbye... We just hugged, said parting words, and that was that. 

But basically I'm at this point where I could try to pursue something with her, but she'll be gone for a whole month soon, and might not even come back. Any advice y'all can give me? I may have already answered my own question, but I would appreciate a third-party perspective. Thanks.

TL;DR We had mediocre drunk sex, she's a great person, but she's leaving soon. What to do..."

(Long)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23jvpc/me_23_mf_with_my_ex_19_mf_15_years_ldr_broke_up/,"Not sure if i'm looking for anything or just want to rant..

Backstory:

We both live on the opposite side of the country and are both still going to school.  During the course of the relationship we have never done short distance and we would visit each other during summer or winter break.  There has never been a day we don't talk to each other.

Before we go into the breakup, please keep in mind that we still talk to each other, we still want to get back together in the future, and we still care about how happy we make each other. 

Breakup

For awhile ago, she has been unsatisfied with me for some time now.  I'm a very laid back person.  In the beginning of the year she has been pushing me to apply for internship around her area for the summer.  I have been holding it off, not realizing how urgent it was for her.  She took it as I'm not serious about her relationship and started doubting our future.  She then told me one day that she wants to start seeing other people too, instead of feeling confined to a relationship that she doesn't see a future with (Even though I promised her that after I graduate I will be moving to her place).  She expressed how unhappy she was about our distance, how I didn't apply for internships earlier, and how laid back I was.  At the same time, she doesn't want to lose me either as our for our relationship we never had serious arguments and we do our best to make each other happy.  A days after we broke up she would ask us to get back together, I declined and told her that we won't lose what we have build so far but she can date other people if she likes.  At this point I thought I have found the perfect solution, she can see other people but it will not affect our relationship.  I was expecting her relationships to be platonic.

Fast forward to her spring break.  On her springbreak, she went rockclimbing with one of her friend.  She knew him from previous semester and he stayed over at her place right after.  She missed me, got high with her friend and made out and also involved some sexual touching.  I was so upset about it that she promised it will never happen again and I shouldn't be holding it against her because she wasn't herself at the time.  It took me a few days to get over it.  I know he stays over at her place and sometimes she would stay over at his, but she doesn't tell me what they do unless I asked or they did anything more.  One day I called her one morning and she told me they had done more than just touching.  She had gotten as far has getting oral sex from him.  It was a little easier for me to accept since I knew she was becoming more sexually active with this guy.  She said she might not do it again because she didn't enjoy it as much as she thought she would and told me they agreed they would never sleep together.  I asked her then that she does not give him a blowjob because I'd feel weird about kissing her, she agreed.  The next week before she had him come over to her place and stayed over, I begged her to try and stay platonic with her friend, I repeated myself and at that point I could see her starting to get annoyed and pissed, so I hung up and went to sleep.  The next day when we talked everything seemed normal until i asked her if anything happened. At first she was trying to avoid telling me what happened.  I mistakenly took it for that they had sex and cried.  She then told that they did not have sex and admitted to giving him a blowjob.  Yesterday, I was told that she is going to get high and I should be anticipating that they will have sex.  I talked to her for a bit to express how upset i was feeling.  She got angry, upset, and sad about the whole situation and told me she isn't going to sleep with him if it makes me so upset.  She doesn't understand why having sex with another person is making me so upset.

Since the breakup, I've been more involved into talking to her. Checking up on her more frequently, be aware of when she is out of class.  I've been pushing her to tell me if anything non-platonic when she is alone with her friend.  I can see that sometimes she doesn't want to tell me but feels obligated to.

This is my first serious relationship so I know I can sound whiny, but any real advice would be appreciated. 

Am I just overreacting to the whole situation, confront her about how i'm feeling, or just cut off all contact with her (difficult because i don't know how i'm going to just cut off contact with the person i've been talking to everyday for the past 1.5years and been so close with)


---   
**tl;dr**: I really love this girl and we both want to hang on to what we have built.  I am WILLING to change for her.  But with all the promises that she has broken, and telling me she is going to sex with the guy after knowing how upset I will be is really pushing me to the limit.  I don't think it's the idea that having sex with another guy that's really bothering me, but the idea that she claims she wants me to be happy yet she thinks it's okay to be non-platonic with another guy while i'm emotionally attached.

23kp97,5,2014-04-21,Dad went off on me today about my lack of belief in God and my progress with college and work at Easter Dinner.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/23kp97/dad_went_off_on_me_today_about_my_lack_of_belief/,"So I guess this is more to get some perspective from different people, and partly to vent, but during Easter dinner today out of nowhere my dad started harping on me about stuff. 

I was sitting there looking at my phone after everyone was done eating, and he asked what I did to celebrate Easter. I said nothing much, since I was asleep all day since I don't get off until 6am from work, and then slept till the afternoon and went to the parents. He then started saying how he doesn't understand why I think I don't need god and stuff and some other things I just pretty much tried to ignore and not respond to. He's pretty hardcore catholic, and I was raised catholic, but he's never really said anything like this before and it kind of took me surprise. I figure maybe he's just worried about my ""soul"" or something but I dunno. I don't even think he knows i'm more or less atheist, since we never talk about the subject. 

After that he then started harping on me about my college issues, which is not being able to find a place to internship, which would then allow me to finish my BA in criminal justice, which seems to be a pretty useless degree in and of itself. I used to want to be a cop, but I'm not so sure if I want to do that anymore, and my weight and pot use is def going to be an issue with doing that. 

He also stated I was going to be 30 soon (i'm only 26 atm) and that I can't keep working my crappy security guard job forever. I mean he's not exactly wrong about the college and work stuff but all of it all at once and on Easter no less just kind of threw me for a loop and upset me a lot. We don't have a great relationship as it is and never talk about anything ever, so i'm having trouble digesting all this. 

Thanks for letting me rant and any thoughts or tips on any of this is appreciated! Hope you all had a great Easter or whatever it is you did on 4/20. "
23kphy,2,2014-04-21,"A story of excitement, adventure, space, great sorrow, and heroism....",Cat_Mulder,KerbalSpaceProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/23kphy/a_story_of_excitement_adventure_space_great/,"  It is an exciting time to be a member of KASE (Kerbal Aeronautics and Space Endeavors).

  Jebediah Kerman has just done a high-altitude flyby and orbit of the Mün, and the scientific discoveries that have resulted have given rise to gossip about a landing-preformed by none other than Jebediah himself, of course.

  The rumors are true! KASE scientists have created a new rocket, not special in and of itself, but because of its launcher- the asparagus setup is able to lift more weight more easily, and a small intermediary stage for orbital maneuvers to propel the lander to one of the moons of Kerbin. The short range capability ears it the moniker ""Puddlejumper"".

  It is finally launch day, and all the KASE staff are watching eagerly as Jebediah preforms his final checks before liftoff. No one sees anything amiss with the ship, all is perfect.  With a massive sound, 9 engines fire and Jebediah lifts off!

 After an admittedly boring descent involving waiting, decoupling, turning, and a bit of snoozing on Jeb's part, the ship orbits, its intermediary stage just below maximum fuel.

  Jebediah glances at the display, his brilliant piloting mind instantly seeing what must be done to move his orbit from Kerbin to the Mün. In less than a full orbit of Kerbin, he fires the engines again. An encounter. Burn. Orbit!

 Jebediah glances over the crude and un-detailed map of the Mün he  has been provided. Nowhere specific pops into his mind. Jebediah absentmindedly maneuvers the ship around and fires retrograde, paying attention only to the beautiful spectacle outside his window, the spectacle that is space.

 Now for the tricky bit. Firing softy, waiting. Firing softly, waiting.

 Back at the KSC, mission control receives a radio transmission from the great kerbonaut.

  ""Guys? Uh, guys, you do realize there is no landing gear on this thing, right?""

  Panic ensues. A massive problem, yet no one on Kerbin can do anything, so they mostly bump about while some engineers surreptitiously add landing gear to the design and low ranking kerbonauts fetch popkorn for the old guard in the astronaut complex.

 ""Jebediah, can you try to set down without landing gear? The engine is pretty flat and the ship is fairly balanced. You should be able to do *something*...""

  ""I'll do what I can, but I don't know about how flat that ground is...""

  No luck. When the lander finally reaches the ground, it is on a slope, and tips right over!

  ""Jebediah, try and preform your scientific duties as you would, then when you're done, get back in and use the RCS to get yourself upright and lift off; the gravity is low enough that you should be able to do it.""

...

  ""Alright KSC, the science is done, but we got another problem; no RCS.""

  Everyone stares at the engineers, huddled in a corner playing kribbage. The bravest of them speaks up.

  ""Well, uh,    y'see,          we never really use it, y'see,      and, uh,    notice how, err,    nobody's really wanted it 'till now...""

  ""A rescue mission then,"" an intern suggests, ""We can fly out there and pick him up.""

  A scientist shakes his head sadly. ""We don't have the capability; all of our ships have to have pilots, and all of our capsules only have a capacity of one...""

  The room is filled with baleful silence as all ponder what comes next....

This past weekend I had three guests visit from out of town. These are friends that I met about two years ago while living out of state for a year-long internship program. During that year, my drinking (which was already pretty bad before I moved out of state) totally and completely spiraled out of control. By the end of that year I hit what should have been my ""bottom"", but unfortunately I kept right on going for another 8 months after that internship year ended :-/

So these particular friends have ONLY known me when I was at my absolute worst when it came to alcohol. We had a lot of hard core drinking nights together during that year so I was definitely nervous about their visit and expected them to drink a lot and for them to insist that I drink with them. Part of me was also afraid that they might look at me differently, or not like me any more if I wasn't that same hard-core drinking girl that they came to know during internship. I shared about it at meetings, spoke to my sponsor about it, and came up with a game plan with my husband so that I'd be prepared to handle all of their drinking while keeping myself sober. I didn't want to make a big melodramatic announcement to them about my sobriety, so I didn't mention it to them at all in advance. Just planned to be the driver all weekend so I could use that as a reason not to drink. I was ready.

Well...turns out that apparently I'm the only one who was prepared for a weekend of wild drinking! There were many situations over the past two days that would have served as obvious reasons/excuses to drink for me if I was still drinking, but apparently this was not the case for other people:

- Friday night we went to a tapas restaurant. Who in their right mind eats tapas without a big glass of red wine (or two...or three...) to wash them down?? Well, apparently everybody else does. None of my friends drank with dinner.

- After dinner, what should we do? Hit up one of the 8 bars within walking distance? NOPE. Friends were in the mood for ice cream so we went for gelato and headed back to my place without anybody having a single drink.

- We get home, and (although I definitely wouldn't recommend this to others), my husband and I had a few options available for those who wanted to relax for the evening with a couple drinks. Nobody accepted our beverage offers as they all wanted to ""take it easy"" (on a FRIDAY?? Are these people insane?)

- Went site seeing all day Saturday and had some down time in the mid-afternoon between scheduled activities. Anybody want to go hit a bar? NOPE. FroYo all the way.

- After dinner, waiting to meet up with another friend. Want to check out that cocktail bar down the street while we wait? NOPE, time for an after-dinner coffee.

- Get home again...no more driving around to do so my ""excuse"" to decline drinks is out the window. Friends decide to have a drink or two and offer me one. I decline casually. Do they twist my arm...call me lame...insist that I do shots with them? NOPE. One friend says, ""oh, you just don't feel like it tonight?"", and I say ""yup"" and that's the end of it.

If I had been drinking, I probably would have gotten drunk at least twice, if not three times over the past two days while nobody else would have, and I would not have noticed that I was pretty much drinking alone even though I was surrounded by friends. I would have only vague, foggy memories of their visit. I might have even said or done something obnoxious or offensive. Luckily, I have solid memories of a fabulous weekend with friends who love me, regardless of if I drink or not. 

It might seem obvious to others, but it was a real epiphany for me that I'm the only one among this group of friends who thinks/cares about alcohol as much as I do. What a relief to know that I can stay sober and other people, people who care about me and who have a healthy relationship with alcohol themselves, will hardly know the difference."

It's loaded with brand new tires, plugs, filters, brakes and battery.

The dealership offered me a possibility to get a one year extended warranty for $795 if anything breaks.

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 

* The biggest strain will probably come from Battlefield 4 on Ultra, as well as PlanetSide 2 on Ultra settings. I'm not entirely sure if I'll be doing a 3 monitor set-up as of now, but I definitely want to max out settings on Ultra using one monitor. Other uses include heavy MATLAB usage, streaming while playing, video rendering, CAD work, various other engineering work, etc.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $1700 USD. This is solely on the PC itself and not the peripherals.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* Late May 2014. Will have a hefty sum of cash after my internship starts.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Definitely the case. 

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* I live in CT, USA. I'll most likely be ordering online from Newegg, etc.

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* Asus gaming laptop, that's about it. And my Logitech G930s. 

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Yes, I'm interested in overclocking from the get go. May not be extreme overclocking, just small tweaks to squeeze more performance out without straining my things too much

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* Definitely will be placing a Samsung EVO for my primary SSD. Not too sure if I should go AMD or nVIDIA, as mining could be nice when I'm not gaming.

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* I would prefer something like a Mid-Tower or smaller, as I'll be transporting it to college for a round trip. I'd also prefer a black case with blue LEDs for fans, and of course a window. I would like to keep the case quite cool, and noise is not a problem to me as I usually wear a headset while gaming.

* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  

* No, my school provides me with Windows 8.1.

23mf1o,4,2014-04-21,I [20 M] was cheated on by my [22 F] girlfriend and I don't know how to tell people without slandering.,seekingadvices,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23mf1o/i_20_m_was_cheated_on_by_my_22_f_girlfriend_and_i/,"Hello /r/relationships I'm afraid I have a bit of a long one for you today. Writing this out proved to be therapeutic and I got a bit carried away!

I recently (beginning of the month) broke up with my girlfriend of one year because she had recently confessed to cheating on me.  I will use different names of course.  Let's call her Lisa, and guy she cheated with Craig.  Here is what happened:

The two of us began dating in April last year.  She graduated a few months later, and I would still be returning to school.  Over the summer we were going to have to be apart because of different internships, jobs, etc and likely afterwards as well.  Fine.  We decided to do long distance because she would be in a large city near where the college is.

Fast forward to early August and I'm back in town where the college is.  We have a fantastic month together.  As people start returning to school in September she decides she wants to go out with two friends: Craig and another girl (they were not dating).  I was not thrilled because Craig would always be very flirtatious with Lisa.  I told her this.  I could not go with them because I am under 21 and they are all of legal age.  I suggested hanging out at someone's house so that I could join.  They really wanted to go to bars.  Before Lisa left she told me she wanted to be back at around 1am because that way she could get some sleep before getting up at 8 for work.  I said that sounded fine and to please send me the occasional text and not to hesitate to call if they needed anything.

For the first several hours she sent the occasional text about a bouncer that didn't believe the other girl's ID was legit, etc.  Around 12 I told her I was going to sleep, but to please call if she needed anything.  i was woken up around 2am by her drunkenly stumbling up the stairs.  She stumbled into my room, said she was super sorry for waking me up.  I asked if she was going to come join me in bed.  Lisa said that no, she was just back to grab a lighter because they were going to go smoke weed.  I know that weed has never sat well with her (makes her feel sick, etc).  I then reminded her that she wanted to be back around 1 because she had work the next morning.  She then screamed out ""Fuck work, fuck EVERYTHING"" before walking out and leaving me very confused.  I had never seen her act this way before.  She ended up returning at around 4 am.  When she slipped into bed with me she kept repeating ""you know I love you right?""  This really confused me and was a red flag.

The next day we talked and I told her that her actions the previous night had confused me and scared me.  She said she was sorry, and that it would not happen again.  I asked her if anything had happened that night she wanted to tell me about.  She said no.  I asked if anything had ever happened between her and Craig (they had known each other longer than I knew her).  She said no.  After that night things seemed off.  The relationship had lost its magical spark.  I did still love her, and enjoy time with her though.  We continued to hang out with friends, and occasionally went to house parties I could join her at instead of bars.  Whenever Craig was around though it bothered me how she always wanted to do whatever he wanted to do.  She would ignore me and fawn over him.  I told her this, and she claimed that I was being jealous and reading too much into things.  I thought that she was right and that I needed to take a step back.  

After all of the events described above it was time for her to move to the city near the town where my college is.  We continued dating and visited every couple of weeks or so.  At the end of my winter break I spent two weeks with her in her apartment. On night she was going to have a friend over to dinner who she had met recently on the bus.  He was in graduate school and sounded like a cool guy.  I was excited to meet him, and to help Lisa make new friends (she had been lonely since moving to the city).  However, something seemed off and I questioned Lisa about whether this guy knew he was not coming over on a date.  She said to look at her phone and to read their texts myself.  I did.  In her texts she referred to me, her boyfriend, as ""a friend"" several times.  Additionally, her wording implied that her housemate (a girl) and I were a couple.  I told her this.  She said she was sorry, and that I was totally right and that she ""just had not thought things through well"".  The dinner, went well, but the guy did seemed surprised when Lisa introduced me as her boyfriend as opposed to ""her friend"".

Fast forward to a month ago and she told me about EVERYTHING that had actually happened.  Apparently that night she and Craig kissed.  She said she did it because she was feeling competitive with the other girl and wanted to ""beat her at getting Craig"".  She also said that she kissed Craig because she didn't feel that she was good enough for me and that in the moment she felt good enough for him.  So, apparently after kissing him she then lied to my face and continued to flirt with him while denying her flirtatious actions.  I talked to one of our mutual friends about this because I didn't know what to do.  I was glad she had told me, but I felt betrayed.  The mutual friend told me that Lisa had told her over the summer that she (Lisa) was dating me, but keeping her options open with Craig while I was away.  Additionally, Lisa had always had a crush on Craig and considered him ""quite a catch"".  Once I learned that the kissing was not just a drunken mistake I broke up with her.  She had lied to me about Craig, pretended I was not her boyfriend with another guy, and I was done.

The complication arises because Craig still interacts with me and a lot of my friends on a regular basis.  A lot of us compete in the same sport, and therefore practice together, and hang out a lot.  Obviously, it can be difficult to be near him.



So, here is where my questions are.  Whenever anyone asks me why we broke up I'm not sure what to say.  The easy answer would be to say that ""Lisa was not ready for a relationship"".  However, I do not feel like I should be protecting or enabling Lisa and Craig's behavior.  Currently, I have been avoiding situations with my teammates and friends when I know Craig will be there.  It seems ridiculous that I am the one having to pay the price of exclusion when I have not done anything wrong.  Part of me wants to tell everyone, but I don't want to slander anyone.

We're hoping to find a great place on or around May 1st in a central area of the City. We want to add a third roommate to our lives to extend our search parameters and to widen our network of amazing-ass people we know in SF! 

In terms of budget, mine is around $1100/month, and Emily's is between $1500-$2000. We're looking to combine powers with a roommate who can afford between $1500-$2000 to find a really nice place we can wholeheartedly enjoy. Our preferred neighborhoods are the Mission, Castro, Nopa, Haight, and Cole Valley but overall, we're pretty flexible as long as the place is nice and feels like home!

Here's what else we're thinking:

We are envisioning a comfortable, fun, and relaxing space to call home. Emily and I have talked about how we would like to share some pantry staples (like baking ingredients) and definitely a CSA. We're both relatively clean people who like to have tidy common spaces but won’t have a cow if dishes don’t get done right away. I'm a vegetarian and Emily cooks meat occasionally, so wherever you fall on the eating spectrum is just fine although Emily did live with a fruitatarian once and found it more challenging than expected so she's on the fence about that..  But I digress.

I'm 28 and am nearly finished with a graduate degree in Counseling Therapy. I'm just about to wrap up my first clinical internship and dive into the wonderful world of job-searching (my student loans and driving for Lyft keep me financially stable). YAY. I'm training to run 100 miles in a week with my brother for fun, I want to bake a fancy cake from scratch once a month from now until next year, I love the smells of Golden Gate Park, I do a lot of yoga, I have a fire escape garden, etc. etc. etc. I'm pretty great to live with because I love to laugh and giggle with my roommates just as much as I love to wash dishes and take out the trash. I PROMISE.

Emily is a 28 y/o queer woman relocating to SF after spending 3 years in Wisconsin. She’ll be working for a tech company in the Mission, which she's super excited about! She loves cooking, being active, being inactive (ie Netflix binging) farmers’ markets, silly themed dinner parties, and experimenting with nail polish colors.  Emily and I have been friends since high school and we've never lived together (officially – we’ve crashed on each other’s couches many many times) but we are similar minded about the kind of housing situation we want to create. 

Let me know if this sounds appealing to you and we'll go from there!"

Comrade soldiers! The question of the state system is now on the order of the day. The capitalists, in whose hands the state power now rests, desire a parliamentary bourgeois republic, that is, a state system where there is no czar, but where power remains in the hands of the capitalists who govern the country by means of the old institutions, namely: the police, the bureaucracy, and the standing army.

We desire a different republic! One Union more in keeping with the interests of the people, more democratic. The revolutionary workers and soldiers of Moscow have overthrown czarism, and have cleaned out all the police from the capital. 

The workers of the world feel that the cause of the Second Russian Revolution is their own cause no matter how great the obstacles in our way, no matter how many tens of millions in money are lavished in all countries to disseminate lies and slander about this Russian revolution. Parallel with the war between the two groups of imperialists, another war is beginning everywhere, the war which the working class, inspired by the example of the Russian revolution, is declaring against its own bourgeoisie. All the signs go to show that India and Italy are on the verge of a great socialist revolution. 

But I am not here today to reminisce on the politics and glory of the Union I once knew and loved, a little over 100 years ago. The world today has changed. Our technological advances match no other country's most superior equipment. But it is our day, the Soviet Union's day, to take back its former glory, fix what has been broken, and amend the policies of the past. This is not a step backwards for Mother Russia, this is a step forward into a direction that promotes peace, unity and prosperity for all Russians and Boshleviks. I, Vladimir Lenin once again am given the opportunity to take back Russia from the capitalists and crooks who morally corrupted our nation and begin a new revolution. One that will not fall and what that shall not wither.

As I stand here today, unbalmed and unchained from the mausoleum I slept in, in the year 2019, there are greater conflicts around the world that threaten our global prosperity and peace. In 2 months I will make my first address to the nation and republics, and will begin a new era of policy that drives the Soviet Union ahead once again. 

For the rest of the world watching, fear not, as I along with my intern cabinet still hold the territories and claims made under Czar Doky and hope to keep the alliances and friendship the questionable government before us had. 

Now it is apparent to everyone that either victorious imperialism or Soviet power can exist-there’s no middle way.

23nc4a,23,2014-04-21,"Being in the closet is killing me, but I have no choice. Need some help.",[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/23nc4a/being_in_the_closet_is_killing_me_but_i_have_no/,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post, but it's taken me a long time to work up the guys to do this. I'm a closeted 18 year old living outside the US, in what is usually described as the most homophobic  region/country in the world. Nobody knows except me. Being anything but straight here gets you jailed. It's been horrible because I knew I liked guys long before I could put a name to those feelings, let alone spell homosexual. I knew before they told me in church that it was an abomination to have those feelings and have been dancing  dangerously close to suicide (much more recently) because of it.

The one thing that keeps me going is my  starting college this fall. I just got accepted to one of the best colleges in the US, (sounds like ardvark). Holy Shit. Finally! So many years of hard work and self deprivation paying off! And a place where I can be out and be happy! But the more I think about it, the more I dread it. Why? Because I don't think I can be out there either. From my experience, even the most trustworthy tolerant people will let my secret slip to their friends eventually and kids from the same country/family/family social circles as me go there so I know the news would make it back to my family somehow. It happened to a friend of mine going to school abroad from home and it wrecked him. 

Also my dad is a big member of the national religious community here.  It would definitely make a  news story or two if word got out that he has a  gay son. And bad news here travels fast. It would also no doubt  discredit him and his work. His views about 'my kind' aren't great, but the humanitarian work he does is so critical that I'd hate myself if I ruined that somehow. 

Also, there's the issue of paying for this expensive private college I'm about to start. My parents are proud of me, but there's no way in hell they'd fund the education of someone they consider to be an abomination, and I can't afford to not have them help me out, unless I'm willing to take on 240k in student loans. 

The worst part is that my parents are depending on me for a lot of stuff too. I'm 18 now and a dual us citizen. They plan on buying a house in my name wherever I plan on going to grad school and they want to eventually emigrate to the States to retire. Right now, I'm the only person who can help them with that by doing some visa application shit.  I feel like I owe them too much to just run away from that responsibility if/when I do come out, and would feel horrible if I used that as leverage for their 'acceptance'.

So the current solution involves me being in the closet the next four years. even longer than that if I want their help with graduate school. 

Reading this now it sounds like I'm being so entitled. Am I being entitled? I've been working for this college for as long as I can remember. Internships, academics, denying myself a social life just so I could get into this school, only to realize that nothing's going to change.
Never more  have I felt like a useless slave to my ambition.

Is it worth to be more open and happy if I lose the opportunity of a lifetime in the process? Can I just abandon my family after they've invested so much into who I am today? I really just need someone to talk to because right now, nothing makes sense.

My boyfriend and I have been in a LDR for a bit over 4 years.
its had its up and down, but I have never questioned the relationship before.  


He have gone through a handful of restaurant jobs in his country under these years. As well as a shorter prestigious restaurant education in London.


Myself I spent the last three years getting an education within a profession that would be fairly easy to find a job for in his country and something ive grown to love doing. Gardening  
During these three years Ive always had the emigration as a goal after graduating.   
We have talked about it a lot under the years, so ive always seen us on the same page in this matter.


During these years ive taken most my holidays as well as two month during every summer to visit him. He has also taken a handful of trips to me when his work schedule has allowed it.  
Last summer we spent over 3 month living together in London while he went to school and i was able to take  my school internship at a fantastic company there.


When we are together it works well, we communicate and work well as a couple.  
I am quite cynical, introvert and a very straight forward in my approach to problems, while he is calm and likes to hold his feelings and thoughts close and rather avoid arguments.  
Ive had some problems with my libido being low to nonexistent due to medicine, birth control and emotional block, but this is something I have worked on and I now see myself as a working human again. This have caused problems during the years due to me finding it hard to sexually just open up and be into it for the week im visiting and then go back to being alone again..


While not together we have almost always talked daily, or at least sent some messages back and forth. We have always had, made, time for each other.


last year we got to a milestone towards the goal of living together, when he bought an apartment, i was very much involved in the decision and the place have some key features i know he doesnt care about more than that i wanted them.  
We have also hinted about engagement, and he was fully on board for the future, talking about not wanting a ring but a fancy clock instead. Tho he is old fashioned and wants to do the proposing, so ive left that trail of thought until he feel ready.


I finished my education at Christmas and felt so happy, all the talk would finally culminate into something graspable, and all my friends, classmates and family were ready for me to leave and giving me best wishes. After all, this has been on the wall for 3 years.


But i dont know what happened, he started a new job in January. Working 6 days a week. And all the sudden he had no free time anymore. No time to write with me or skype about the practicalities about how to handle the move or setting a date for my move. 


After a month i cracked and booked a trip to see him for a week. 
The apartment was amazing and i could easily see myself living there. But every time I brought up the move he created and built new obstacles. Such as i needed to get my driver licence first to the statement that it was maybe best to wait and see what happened when his one year contract with work expired.  
I do agree on the driver licence even tho i know it would be fully possible to get around without one and that i wouldnt be able to buy a car instantly anyway. ive grown up in the middle of a city and never had any need to get a licence nor anyone to practice with, but sure, if thats what it takes..


During one car ride, while we were in a traffic jam I did corner him and asked how he actually felt. After me talking and explaining what i felt i did get a ""You are an amazing girl and i want to settle down with someone like you""  
my reaction was to feel really hurt ""someone like me"" what does that even mean? I asked him and got the ""yes with you"" instead of someone this time.  
To this day im still not sure if he  just said it to please me or because he formulated it wrong the first time...


After that trip we did decide that i was to get my driver licence fixed and then ill move. But since i left our communication been utterly shit. 
he hardly no longer writes, and when i feel down or wanting to know how he feel or just want comfort im lucky to get a ""today i did -insert random work task- but i need to sleep, need to be up early""  
He blatantly ignores when i write about my feelings or the one time he did acknowledge it i got a ""that sucks"" and then onto what he was watching on tv..


I get that he has no time to be on skype, but phone messages, hell everyone got time for a phone message, when on the toilet, when leaving work walking to the car, at breakfast, before sleep and so on.


Im trying to confront him about how its making me feel, as well as asking if he is having cold feet or doubts. I keep getting nothing back. The one time i got a response he said he felt that he didnt want to burden someone with being with him since he does work so much and likes it that way and that he feels like he is doing me a disservice.
i dont know what to do. Told him he needs to talk about it, if not with me then with his best mate, to that i got an ""i will""  
that was almost two month ago..


Ive always been very clear on that i know that he works a lot and that its nothing that scares me. I dont see it as a problem to be honest. Im introvert enough to enjoy my alone time..  
Im not scared to moving to a country where i dont speak the language, i will learn. Nothing about the move really scares me. I rather give it a try and have it blow up in my face than not try it and regret it for the rest of my life..


He now doesnt take any time to write with me nor respond to anything other than answering to the question of when he got an off-day, where he still dodges my skypecalls by not being available..


the problem now is that i cant just sit around and wait, its gone over 4 month since i graduated.  
I need to know if i am to move or not. If im not moving then i need to find a job and the summer season is coming closer.. and if i wait any longer (already too late for any good ones) i will miss my shot at getting any kind of gardening work during the high season...  
And as soon as i decide to get a job here ill be stuck here for even longer..


I am really lost, i dont know how to get my point across. I dont know what he is thinking or how to make him feel any easier about it all. 
Im constantly feeling sad and scared that i might loose someone that has grown to be a part of me.  
Right now i feel in limbo, waiting on him to get his thoughts sorted.
Im already embarrassed because i already proclaimed to my friends and family that i will be moving. I dont want to be a failure and unloved.  


**TL:DR I am willing to leave behind friends and family for a country where i dont speak the language to move to the guy i love while he thinks he is doing me an disservice by being with him. Im having my life on hold while waiting on him to make up his mind**"

So a lot has been going on in my life, and I've been lurking here for a while with different issues on my mind. Right now, though, this is the most urgent issue I can think of and I'd love some outside advice to help with the situation.

For those of you who don't know me or don't remember me, I'm a high school senior who will be going to college next year. My dad is ridiculously restrictive, and I've never been allowed to leave the house alone, go to the movies with friends, or really anywhere without my Mom, and even then he has made things difficult (a while back he made the biggest deal out of my Mom and sisters going to watch *Frozen*. Don't get me started.)

Ever since I started the college application process, my Dad stressed that I apply to the closest college to us. In fact, he told me that he ""didn't care even if it was a bad college"" because I ""absolutely would not be dorming."" Now, the closest college to my house is actually a community college. Luckily, the one farther than that is a better college, and has a nice writing program too. However, it is really easy to get into. So I got accepted into it, but it isn't providing nearly as much financial aid as I would like. My mom, who may be more open to me dorming in-state and coming home every weekend or something but is too tired to deal with my dad, says that she doesn't care how much loan she may have to help pay. The thing is though, my parents have a really bad credit score and I'm not even sure if I'll qualify for Direct PLUS loans. And even if I do, they are in no shape to help me pay when they're already scraping money alongside my brother to pay for HIS college. And then I have three younger siblings still in school, and their needs, and things like food and clothes.

I applied to a lot of colleges. For some, I even had to send writing portfolios and I actually received notable scholarships from a few. Even more so, for some my student loans add up to less than that of the nearest college, and they are higher, better ones too.

I am so tired. I am so tired of being yelled at because the school play I went to watch ended a little later than I expected, or spending extra hours with the school literary art magazine. I am tired of having to look after my siblings day after day alongside homework from regular and AP classes both. I am tired of never being able to go to Panera or Starbucks with my friends, of trying to scroll quickly through pictures of them smiling and laughing and just being kids. Day after day I feel more and more depressed and stressed out and scared for my future and I really just need to get away. I don't even want that much, one of my most-liked college is less than 2 hours away and I'd be able to come back fairly easily. But my Dad won't hear of it. In fact, after I got the acceptance from the college HE liked, he completely disregarded any other acceptance letters I got, no matter how amazing they were. If I try to bring up college with my dad, he will just shake his head and say he doesn't like the idea of me and ""boys"" living together (even though I assured him it would be a non-coed dorm) and then yells at my mom for giving me too much freedom. My mom tells me not to argue with him, to come to her for any issues, be she herself has assumed I'm going to the close college and didn't even let me decide. Today I started crying in front of her because everything has been too much and I told her I was under too much stress, and she couldn't understand why even though she is LIMITING any chances of me doing what I might want to do.

I really want to be able to dorm and have a complete and meaningful college education. I don't know where my future is headed, and there's a chance I'll get stuck in an arranged marriage that I may not be able to get out of. And I really don't think I can handle driving 40 minutes or more back and forth every day, along with taking care of my siblings AND college work AND working all in one (and I'll have to work to help pay for tuition, in that college anyway). Work is a whole new issue altogether, because even though they are incapable of helping me pay for college they have not let me work, at all. Almost all my friends have been working since junior year to save up for college and I haven't been allowed to, and now the only way I'll be able to is an internship or a part-time job. I'm sick of having a million things on my plate and I just want to be able to dorm in a nearby college. I even gave up dreams of going to Pratt Institute in New York (a very big art/writing school that gave me much financial aid and a 17000 scholarship) and Emerson in Boston, which I also got accepted into. And still they won't relent. I just don't know what to do. I need them for an enrollment deposit and possible financial help no matter where I go, at least for a little while until I get a job. Additionally, ever since I took my scarf off my Dad has threatened multiple times to ""send me to Pakistan"" because I ""don't really need or deserve a college education"" or doing the same to my siblings. I'm so worried about everything and I really want to be able to settle this somewhat peacefully with my parents.

Sorry for the very long rant. May 1st draws nearer and nearer and I need to make a college decision as well as turn in enrollment/housing deposits. There's also other small details, like wanting to save up so that my brother and I may be able to take our siblings from our parents' custody. My mother has become old and frustrated and she can be both verbally and rarely physically abusive, and even more so she will most likely put them in arranged marriages as well. My father has been very harsh on my siblings when it comes to reciting the Quran, and my 9-year-old sister has stress and anger-management issues because of all the work she gets from school (she's in some special classes) and at home with the qari and quran. And before I can help any of them I need to figure out my own life, and before I can do that I need to stop feeling like I'm being suffocated,

**TL;DR,**

My father is very unrelenting about allowing me to dorm and instead insists and I drive back and forth 40 minutes to a college that isn't giving me as much scholarship or financial aid money as other, better colleges slightly farther away. I'll also have to juggle a job and looking after brother and sisters as well as studies. My mom won't do anything about it. I worry for my siblings. My parents won't be able to pay loans and I'll have to burden all that myself. May 1st is the last day to decide on a college.

Help. Any comments, concerns, advice, motivational speeches are welcome.

23nk54,1,2014-04-22,[Advice] Can't find work - Back to university?,Douges,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/23nk54/advice_cant_find_work_back_to_university/,"Hey guys,

I'm a recent uni graduate with a business degree in marketing and advertising. I've had 5 internships, 3 being marketing related and 2 being advertising, one of which with a well known agency in accounts (GPY&amp;R). 

Yet since finishing that agency internship in October last year, I just can't seem to get my foot in anywhere since. It's really starting to make me lose my motivation to keep looking for work and also question myself. (what am I doing wrong? what is wrong with me? what do others have that I don't?).

It's coming up to second semester, and I feel that going back to uni and adding something to my current degree could help, maybe open some new doors and get me a little more motivated. If I did, I believe Graphic Design is what I would want to do as I have always had the interest for it. 

I want to be in creative, I have the ideas but I feel it's the execution that lets me down (We never used editing programs such as InDesign or Photoshop during my degree, and usually in group work there was always 1 guy that was a pro and would take that part of the assessment upon himself to complete for the team)

How do you feel GD could help me? It's an interest of mine, would it really stand out on a CV as opposed to someone without it going for the same creative job? Do most creatives have some sort of Graphic Design background? 

I don't hand draw too well, yet as I am pretty computer savvy I believe I would be a fast learner with editing programs. "

I understand that this is possible if one uses the front page only specific subreddits are in the mix. But I am talking about a person who is signed into their account being able to specifically delete certain subreddits from their view, and maybe having a block list type of idea in case the use wanted to add it back into the mix.
Another topic I would like to bring to the lime light is down votes. I feel that a lot but not all people who do serial down voting do so for a purpose of disagreeing with ones point. Which I feel it is almost a way of disliking a person from what is said. Anyhow I feel is the wrong way to go about it. When a down vote is cast, a comment bar should pop up asking why this dislike this post. This could intern add great feed back to the original poster. I understand people are going to disagree with this is the annoying box that pops up. The reason I feel this should be a future idea, because if one doesn't like a post they shouldn't do anything about it besides ignore it. Down votes could hide a post that is really interesting to some people, and it can become undiscovered by downvotes.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks!"

No fights, we would do everything to make the other happy, and we tried to see each other as often as we could (we live in different cities, 5 hours apart). 


Some details about us: my GF has been unemployed for a year at this point, and has quit her education, planning to start again in september. I'm almost done with my education and I'm looking around for internships. 
The fact that she doesn't have much to do for work/school is a serious problem for her and I try to help her with that, pointing out possible job opportunities etc. 


Since the last couple two months my GF and I are having some serious problems. More arguments, some of which resulted in serious fights. After we cooled down, we'd make up and continued spending time with each other. 
Most of the time, it boils down to the fact that we might be seeing each other too much, she is getting frustrated about having no job/education and that I am under a lot of pressure to finish my education in time. 


It all came to an end last tuesday. First she was distant, while I tried to hug/kiss, and she avoided talking with me. After a while she just broke off with me, saying that it wouldn't work anymore. And then she sent me home. 


On wednesday I sent her a text she could collect her stuff on Friday, because I would be gone for Easter. I already collected her stuff then so she could leave early. We didn't have much communication during the following days. When she came by on Friday she said how much she loved me and that she really wanted the relationship to work again. After a long conversation we both agreed to continue, but that we both have to work on ourselves and for the relationship in general.


So far so good right? Well, one of her ideas was that she should blow of some steam during a party in two weeks. Not a problem for me, we both go out apart from each other, so it shouldn't be. But then shey tells me she want to use XTC during the party. Usage of which I'm not against, but while I am in a relationship I'd like to use it together (she already knows this). So I'm rather confused about wether I should agree with this or not. 


Also, she said that we shouldn't see each other for the next three weeks. She thinks it would help us get our priorities straight. I agree with this, but I think it is too long and combined with her previous idea, I'm just really confused.


Would it be selfish/wrong of me to disagree with this? I really want this relationship to work and her to be happy, but something tells me this isn't right.




---   
**tl;dr**: GF broke up, we came back together, now she wants to use XTC without me at a party and see me only after three weeks."
23oa0h,11,2014-04-22,How should I obtain design internships overseas?,veloceGT,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/23oa0h/how_should_i_obtain_design_internships_overseas/,"Hi, 

Firstly, a little bit about me: I'm a second year Australian University student. I have an internship under my belt, a solid GPA and I've been nominated for a couple of design awards (although I haven't won anything thus far). 

At the moment, I have a part time internship lined up that goes for three months starting from June. After I finish this one, I'd like to move up the ladder to global ad agencies and studios like Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, IDEO or Pentagram to attain some global experience within an international environment during the period from November 2014 to February 2015. 

I understand the demand for positions at the top end is extremely high so the question I'd like to pose is how I should go about applying. I'm confident in preening my portfolio, what I'm more concerned about is the networking and the logistics of everything. Where should I start looking for positions? How should I approach each studio? etc. 

Next up: Asia vs Europe vs The States; which would be the best place to begin? I'm thinking I'd like to start in a place like Singapore or Hong Kong but before I make any decisions, I'd like to know what the differences are in design culture between each region. 

Finally, would studios consider taking on students from overseas? Obviously, I would prefer for the internship to include accommodation arrangements etc but if absolutely necessary, I can organise that for myself. From a purely business point of perspective, it would seem like a hassle to hire a student from overseas over someobody local, but then again, these programmes exist for a reason, right? 

Any insight is greatly appreciated. 

Cheers

My whole offer meeting was 3 mins. 

Said well you need to go back to school so we aren't going to make an offer maybe you can get more internships under your belt we just don't have capacity. And that was it. 

Looks like only 4 people out of I think 21 got offers and those were people in grad school or done with grad school. 



I honestly didn't like it there as my boss was super put off by asking questions and would ignore questions if they weren't exchanged verbally. And would have turned down the offer anyways probably. 

Any advice?

23p7t5,1,2014-04-22,Lost community college student seeking advice about furthering education.,wz_I68,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/23p7t5/lost_community_college_student_seeking_advice/,"My life is about to fork off into one of two directions and I'm not sure which way to go. As it stands now, I'm a community college student majoring in Business Administration (my school offers an AS in Accounting but actively discourages that if you want to pursue accountancy at a higher level, recommending the Bus.Ad. route instead). I have the vast majority of my credits completed, and am looking at finishing this semester with something in the range of 3.2-3.4 GPA. The community college is a school in the SUNY system in New York. I'm planning on this being my last semester here, though I would be finishing likely this December if I stayed. I moved to this town three years ago to be with my girlfriend, who graduates this semester from private school. She'll be living in NYC as that's the best thing for her career at the time. There's nothing keeping me in this town after this semester aside from the community college, and I feel it's time for me to move forward as well. 

My initial plan was to try and get into University at Albany's Accounting program. They offer a BS in Accounting and MS degrees in Taxation, Professional Accounting, and Forensic Accounting. The eventual goal is to get my CPA. I support myself financially and my tuition has been about 50/50 out of pocket/financial aid. Were I to go to Albany, finishing the BS would likely take two to three more years based on the number of classes I've so far been able to take at CC while working full time (those classes have been easy, practically high school easy, so I'm trying to factor in the increased course load when I determine how full a credit load I can manage at a tougher school. The ease of this school is also why I want to leave now, and get more of my education from a tougher level). The graduate degree would likely take another 2 years at least on top of that. Everything I've heard and everyone I've talked to says Albany is a great school for Accounting, but four-plus more years of my girlfriend and I being apart is scary. I have no doubt we'll make it just fine, we've made it four years already. The thought of being apart that long just sucks.

The other option is to move with her to New York and go to school there. Baruch and NYU have both caught my eye, but admittedly I have only begun to do research as we came up with this idea last night and I'm open to school suggestions for NYC. Baruch offers a BBA and an MS in Accounting, as well as an integrated program of both at once. NYU offers a BS, an MS, an MBA, and a PhD all in Accounting. 

I'm feeling overwhelmed. I've heard so far that the CPA is all that matters, it's not important whether you get an MS or an MBA. I've also heard that you need an MBA and that the MS is worthless. And I've also heard the opposite of that. I know Big 4 recruits heavily out of Albany, but I also know that going to school in NYC will offer so much more in terms of networking and internships, as well as just plain life experience. I'm trying to make the best decision for my career, but I'd be lying if I said the fact that my girlfriend will be living in one of the two option cities isn't a heavily weighing factor (and I feel it should be). 

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to get as much relevant information up front to start with. Most of the advice threads I've seen on here start with responders asking for more information, so I wanted to be as forthright as possible. I guess the big deciding factor is which graduate degree should I be looking into? What about the PhD? I've rarely even heard of a PhD in Accounting outside of careers in higher education, is it a logical option for someone who is looking at a CPA? Are the networking and internship opportunities of NYC that much better? Any advice, words of wisdom, or anecdotes are all very much appreciated!"

I'm not sure how I feel and I can tell you now that I don't like that.  I'm going to give you bits and pieces of my story so hopefully it'll help yall understand without getting too lost in my muddled thoughts haha.


My life has been a bit hard.  I've been to 3X as many funerals as I have been to weddings.  My life has been surrounded by death.  Hell I've been going to funerals since I was in utero.  My dad shot himself when I was 7.  My grandparents who I was exceedingly close to died in a car accident when I was 13.  My best friend died my first year of college at 18.  I could go on but those were pretty notable.  I can't help but feel as if I've been depressed forever.  My dad used to tell me and my sister how he wanted to drive us all off a bridge so we could go to heaven and be together forever and mommy could never take us away from him.  He almost threw me through a tv when I was 3 (which was the early 90s so they were those huge boxy tvs that for sure would've killed me had he done so.)


After my grandparents were killed I knew it was the beginning of my downward spiral.  I asked my mother if I could go see a therapist because I needed someone to talk to.  She told me I was a horrible daughter for basically telling her I'd rather talk to a stranger than her.  Finally she agreed and took me to a therapist.  The twist here is when we went I told her and the doctor that I wanted to speak with him alone, and I did want my mother to leave the room.  She said nonsense and stayed and I couldn't open up with her standing behind me breathing down my neck.  It was as if she couldn't help herself, she had to witness this session and know what I said to this stranger and make sure she still looked like the good mother who was just trying to find help for her adolescent daughter.


The doctor didn't make her leave the room and I did my best to talk to him about the stuff I knew were considered safe areas if you will.  I told him about my dad, about how I was having a hard time dealing with my grandparent's deaths, and I how scared I was of my cancer.  My mother chimed in with ""oh she doesn't have cancer, it's just a stupid wart,"" and completely downplayed it.  Now I'll tell yall I had a cancerous growth in my eye that required me to regularly see a specialist optometrist from the age of 6.  By the age of 15 I had to undergo surgery to get it removed from both the inside and outside of my eyeball.  He said it was benign but with the very rapid growth, he worried it wouldn't actually stay that way.  He believed that if we left it in my eye, it would grow so much that eventually I would go blind in one eye.  I wouldn't be able to drive, and it would disfigure my eye so I would probably only feel comfortable wearing something that covered it.  I overheard her and the therapist before we left though.  He wanted me to come back and talk to him one on one.  He was worried about me because he could see and feel the emotional distress I was under.  She went on to explain my mood swings (which she downplayed) and he said he believed I might actually be exhibiting signs of being bipolar.  On the drive home she yelled at me for wasting her time and money on something so stupid. She never took me back to see him again.


I've been worried ever since I heard that over a decade ago that maybe he was right, maybe I am bipolar.  It could very well be true.  My father had all kinds of mental issues as did his mother who I have no contact with.  She's a freakin loon too!  It isn't her fault though, she underwent a forced lobotomy at the age of 18 and had never been the same since from what I'm told.  I've always thought there was something wrong with my head but never got the opportunity to get the help I wanted.


I have a daughter who just turned 3, who is the product of an abusive relationship.  My ex got me pregnant on purpose one night when I was exceedingly drunk and needed a safe ride home and because of the abuse, I had no friends and no one else to call but him.  I stayed with him while I was pregnant because I was in my final year of college and knew I needed the help.  He used all my doctors appointments as excuses to get out of work because after all he had to take his poor pregnant girlfriend to the doctor and she's just too helpless to drive herself.  Whatever.  I worked my butt off to finish college which included an internship with a catering company.  I was determined though.  I worked up until the Friday before I had my daughter, had her on a Wednesday and was back to work on Monday.  I managed to get all my required hours in within 2 days of the deadline.  I had her in April, graduated college in May and left him in June.  It was the best decision I've ever made and I knew it.  When she was 8 months old, I met the one :)  She just turned 3 on the 6th.  We've been in a relationship for 2 years.  And last October I decided to throw caution to the wind, listen to my gut and do what I knew was right for myself and my daughter, we moved 5,000 miles away.  Her birthfather hasn't seen her since she was I think 4 months old or so if I recall correctly and that's exactly how I want it.  We moved to a different continent, to Ireland and have enjoyed living here since we got here.  I've finally started settling in, making friends and what not.


As I already stated, we moved over in October.  I didn't tell a soul with the exception of my best friend since I was 2 that we were planning on leaving and she didn't say a word.  I worked 2 jobs and went against every instinct I had and left my daughter with my parents/family for the summer.  I saved up like crazy, shipped over as much as I could, got on a plane and left it all behind without saying so much as a word to my family.  The reason being I had already told them of my intentions and they told me I was stupid and crazy and my guy was using me and probably with another woman I didn't know about and basically just threw every stupid excuse they could think of at me so I wouldn't go.  Thing is I know they don't give a shit about me, my mother has told me so, but they do love my daughter.  I don't want them to have anything to do with how she is raised at all.  So we left October, and suddenly in November we had an unexpected visitor.  My mother who had never once in her life even left the states had flown to Ireland with no warning whatsoever.  One of the first things she said when I did let her into my apartment and asked what the hell she was doing there instead of just calling (since she does have my guy's number and could have easily called) and she said ""I came to take her home to her family where she belongs.""  I was flabbergasted, completely.  I couldn't believe what I'd just heard.  So I took a second and said to her ""actually, she belongs here, with her parents.""  And she just kinda stuck her nose up in the air at me and just kinda made one of those huffy ""hm"" noises that I'm sure yall have heard before.  She spent the week trying to convince me to let her take my daughter back to the states with her and how ""if you just let me take her, you won't even have to hear from us ever again, we'll be out of your life for good which is apparently what you want since you moved so far away.""  I guarded my daughter like a hawk.  And trying to seem like the ""good guy"" in the scenario she said oh let's go shopping so I took her into the city.  She bought me a dress (which albeit was very nice of her!) but it's a cocktail dress.  I'm a stay at home mom in a new country where I didn't know anyone.  Where the fuck would I wear a cocktail dress that's actually a freakin prom dress for high school girls!!!  Don't get me wrong, it's lovely, except it minimizes my bust and accentuates my stomach and looks freakin terrible on me.  She didn't leave the receipt so I could get something I could actually wear though so now I have this dress in my wardrobe that I'm never going to wear.  It's silly!


My parents are very well off.  She sent over this HUGE box of stuff for my daughter for her birthday and ""oh there's something in there for you too.""  At first I didn't believe this since she hasn't given me a birthday present in a few years.  Turns out she sent me two boxed cake mixes (admittedly, thoughtful since I like baking and can't get this kind of cake over here unless I make it from scratch but I just can't seem to get it juuuust right to get the flavor I'm looking for) along with a black sweater....which I left behind and coincidentally she gave it to me about 5 years ago for Christmas.  Along with a birthday card.  In the birthday card was a cashiers check for $500.  An unsigned cashiers check for $500.  Yep.  But funny enough because of a banking error we still managed to put the money into our account so I guess that was a nice big fuck you right back in her face since I'm sure she 100% didn't sign it on purpose just to torment me.


This is the reason I'm so confused emotionally though since I opened that card a couple weeks ago and already brushed it off.  Yesterday was my 25th birthday.  I really don't give a shit about my birthdays and neither did my family after my grandparents died.  My entire family (2 big sisters, 2 little brothers and parents) all forgot about my 15th birthday entirely.  They told me happy birthday the next day not realizing it was a day late.  That doesn't change the fact that I still like it when they do acknowledge it though (at least on my dad and brothers' parts.)  I've told my new friends over here that my birthday was coming up though and they got me kind of excited about it since it's supposed to be another big one (25, quarter of a century, woohoo, etc).  So because of that I started kind of thinking about it again.  Well I spent the day exactly the way I wanted.  I got to spend it with my daughter and my guy, in my sweatpants just finishing up the 2nd season of The Newsroom just the way I wanted.  We made snickerdoodle cookies and just kind of hung out.  Then we went for a walk through the city and it was perfect for me, except we missed ordering our pizza by 3 minutes so no dinner, that part sucked but oh well.  Today I decided to go ahead and check out facebook (which I abhor at birthday times.)  I got a bunch of false birthday wishes comments and what not, including one from my mother, one from my sister on our extended family page since she's blocked from my fb, and one from my aunt who has turned into a total bitch in the last year.  My father and neither of my brothers told me happy birthday for my 25th.  I'll admit it, it hurt.  I've been trying not to stew on it all day but apparently I have been.


I just don't know how I feel.  My head feels so screwed up.  It's as if I don't know up from down right now.  I'm still exceedingly glad I made the move because I know it was the best move for my daughter and myself (versus bringing my guy over stateside.)  She'll get a better education, hopefully her view of the world won't be as narrow as it was in my home town growing up, she'll be around my guy's family which is just an awesome family by the way, etc.  She'll get to see these places and experience so many things that I dreamed about doing when I was growing up.  Hell when I was a child I used to pray that I was secretly adopted and my real parents would come and take me away from all of it one day.  I feel muddled.  I feel like I should be on a damn pill to straighten out my head because it's as if I can't even think anymore.  I'm an emotional shipwreck (ironic since I'm listening to Titanic while writing this out.)  I'm still glad we moved and I'm still as in love with my guy as I've ever been.  I've got friends, I've got a new family, and yet there's still something nagging.  I'm not sure if I just haven't accepted how shit my family is.  I'm not sure if I'm worried that I do actually have some kind of something wrong with my brain that we could actually put a label on.  I've been crying as much as ever even with me being happier on the whole about my life.  I cry while watching any happy moment on tv, during happy romantic comedy movies even, etc.  I just don't know what's going on with me.  I treat my daughter right, I treat my guy right, my in-laws all like me (which I hear is rare for families with all boys, my guy is one of four boys actually.)  So what the heck?  I'm a mess and I don't know why and I think that's what frustrates me the most.  I have no idea why my emotions are so topsy-turvy and because of that so are my thoughts.  I'm not worried about being a danger to my child or myself.  I still take good care of the house and I cook her round meals every day instead of just giving her crap food all the time.  I know I'm still managing to be a good mother through it all but I just don't know about the other areas of my life.  I don't know what's going on in my own head and it's unnerving.  I contemplated posting this in /r/offmychest but I felt it required too much background and I knew yall would understand more.


I don't have medical insurance just yet so going to a head doctor is out of the question until I do, which will be in the very near future since we have to have insurance to get our required visa anyway.  I'm not sure if I was just looking to vent/rant or what since I didn't actually ask a question.  I just don't want to feel as if I'm going crazy like my dad did.  I'm done though, thanks for reading if you made it through all of this, sorry for wasting your time if you did read it all though haha.  Thanks everyone, yall are all awesome and I wish every one of you the best."

So I haven't been present lately on this sub due to a large internship that I got. I am currently the intern for Thorocraft.

If you guys haven't heard of Thorocraft, it's a men's shoe company that focuses on revamping the traditional silhouettes of shoes. 

We just launched our SS '14 collection and I am posting on here to get feedback from r/Streetwear and to also hear what you guys would like to see in the shoe game. We are very open to suggestions so don't be shy!

We are also looking into giving you guys a special code to get a discount on our shoes.

23q30t,1,2014-04-22,"I'm rather flustered with this economical ""gap"" conversation if no one wants to protest or make their voices heard. As well as keeping my hopes up for a happy life.",Bashship,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23q30t/im_rather_flustered_with_this_economical_gap/,"I have two problems. One personal and one more shared with others.

So today we had another [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/23obyo/american_middle_class_no_longer_richest_in_world/) about the economical gap in the United States and again we have people talking about issues and how more problematic it is.

Great that we know how bad this situation is.

Would you like to do something about it?

Protest? Contact your representative? 

Oh, you're busy? Too much to lose? Just want to talk about it?

We have fantastic information given to us by several redditors.

But I stand here at a loss why we just talk?

I mean we protested the Vietnam War, Occupy Wall Street, Iraq War, Civil Rights and several others.

We have nothing to lose, only to gain. And it seems that since the Wall Street movement failed, we should all just gibber about it while laws keep getting manhandled.

One argument I've heard is that we have too much to lose.

Maybe because I'm sort of at the bottom I don't understand.

We already protested once. It failed, ok that happened. We protested the Iraq War, Vietnam War. We protested Civil right inequality. Abortion clinics, court cases and several other things.

I'm not understanding how we can have so much disdain but not publicly show it. Sure organizing a protest isn't an easy thing to do but its not hard to do either.

* Reason why you're protesting
* A map to show what direction you're going to be demonstrating
* Financial assistance for food and drinks
* Information to give bypassers or new comers some understanding why this protesting is occurring.

You can just get a picket sign and sit in front of a popular area or city hall and just start that way.

---

The second issue is that its hard for me to have hope when we talk about high student debt. a building gap, inability to follow dreams and everything else.

I wanna go to a four year university for either MIT or software development and own a nice home. Drive a Dodge Ram with cowboy boots and jeans. Have someone to give my heart all the care it wants to give.

Its hard to keep hope up when all I read and see is discontent. When there is a picture showing students with their accumulated debt on top of their cabs.

When we talk about how banks play with the economy and how you can have a bill of over $50,000.00 for giving birth at a hospital.

I get the discontent, and I get why protests aren't really happening.

You can't just drop your job, school, kids and just protest. 

Yet at the same time you can't do anything when you know there is a lot of wrong and barely anyone is raising their voice.

I'm actually am thinking of going to the side walk in front of city hall and just have a picket sign and just silently protest.

Sadly I do need a tiny bit of cash but I am thinking about actually saying something. It's absurd, we knot it's absurd. Yet, here we ~~stand~~ sleep being trampled by powerful corruptionists.

Do I genuinely believe going to protest will make me happy? No, it won't.

But how exactly are people going to have a chance when their chances are consumed like it was a joint before they get a chance to even graduate from High School?

I've seen a lot of people join the Military JUST to have an opportunity. Myself included. That shouldn't be the society we should live in. 

We shouldn't be in a society where to just have a stable good paying job you must already have thousands of dollars in debt. Where you must have over 10 years of experience for an entry level position or have to settle for internship or part time.

Where it is much easier to steal a gun and take down a opposing gang member than it is to stay in a school to learn Geometry, Calculus, Chemisty, Biology and then some.

This is the society You, them, us, I and many others are given birth in or must attempt to flourish in.

Standing here and just talking about it with friends, redditors and random people isn't going to solve it.

It'll get the problem to the light but standing in the light will just burn it.

It has to grow, move and strengthen.

We shouldn't live in a society where ending your life is easier than walking another step. 

I have no idea where my rant is going but what I want is just to be in a happy place. Protesting may not change it for me, but it may change it for the babies in the hospital that are being given birth to at this very moment. For that girl in Afghanistan that must hear the sounds of clashing metal and clay. For the Chinese adolescent that is making whatever gadget the western world wants. 

Again, no idea where I'm going with this or anything but I'd like to have a bridge that I can at least see, whether or not I take it is up to myself. But everyone deserves a bridge. A walk way. A stairway. A ladder. A road. A dream that can happen. A life that can be felt. A smile that isn't a faux. 

And here I sit, writing this. I'm genuinely willing to protest - NSA, calm down - my hours are nice enough where I can actually have a bit of the day time to protest. Starting it though would be a hell of a trip though.

I see a lot of questions from college students here and I would like to share a story with so you can avoid the mistake I made.

Back when I was in school I was being recruited by the Big 4 firm I work at now.  My chances of getting an offer at a big market was fairly low but I could easily get an offer out West.  I took and internship out there, liked it well enough, and got a full-time offer.  My salary was a little lower than I expected especially because the cost of living is so high.

I spoke to my recruiter several times over the phone but this particular firm has a standard starting salary.  He did tell me, however, that we would be given a bonus of 6-12% of our salary during end of the year reviews.

I did the math. Assuming I ranked fairly well among my peers, I'd be earning an additional 5k+/year because of that bonus.  After factoring in the cost of living and the bonus, I barely accepted the offer.  I would have absolutely declined the offer if I didn't think I would receive a bonus.  My school publishes all the starting salaries for people in your major so you know if you are getting a good offer or not.

I was just told, after working for 6 months, that these bonuses are not given to first year associates.  In fact, you do not get a bonus if you are being promoted for senior and you don't get the bonus your first year as a senior.  Esentially, I will not get a bonus for the first three years with the firm. I've already moved accross the country and I don't have any proof of what the recruiter told me over the phone.

Long Story Short - Don't be an idiot and get burned like me.  Make sure you get whatever your recruiter says in writing before accepting your offer."

LONG)",rightdownthedrain888,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23qfvl/dear_mom_and_dad_im_not_lazy_im_sick_and_very/,"I have bulimia.  That's why I've lost all this weight.  I wish I could honestly say that it was hard work and dedication, but nope.  I throw up almost everything I eat and I feel like binging and purging has consumed my entire life.  I spend tons of money on buying junk food that I can binge on and then purge later.  I used to want to be a chef, and now I can't enjoy food because I'm so scared of being fat.

Dad, I love you so much, but you would look at women who weighed less than I used to and joke about how fat they were.  Someone told you she had lost 40lbs and you said ""Wow, she used to be fat."" When I said I didn't think 40lbs would have made her fat, you got angry at me and said ""Anyone who needs to lose 40lbs was FAT before!""  Well, now I've lost 75lbs.  And you seem so proud of me.  It's all you talk about, when you're not yelling at me about how I'm lazy and how I do nothing but eat all day(I guess it's good you got the shitty hearing that seems to populate your whole family, because you don't hear me throwing up right after).  I feel like I can't eat anything around you because it's all you seem to care about.  You're overweight, for god's sake, but if I ever mentioned it I know you'd lose your mind.  

Mum... I'm so sorry.  I know this would break your heart.  You're such a great mom.  You deserve a perfect daughter, and I've never been that.  I've never been pretty and I was certainly never thin.  Even now I'm only average.  You've always been gorgeous and effortlessly thin, and I have been so jealous my entire life.  I love you so much, you don't deserve this.

Being an only child has ruined me.  My entire life I wanted nothing more than to be the perfect daughter to give you guys what you deserved, but I've always been a failure.  In elementary and middle school I would study nonstop and do well enough, but I could never be one of those kids who got good grades without trying, and it was so discouraging especially because I wanted to be good so badly.  I was always bullied badly and would fight through it by thinking that one day I'd grow up to be beautiful and smart and everything would finally be like I dreamed.  I applied for a prestigious internship program in 8th grade, it was everything I dreamed of at that age, and I put my entire heart and soul into that application and studied like crazy to get the grades I needed.  I didn't get in and it broke my little heart.  I cried myself to sleep for weeks.  

I wanted to go to a performing arts high school so I could get away from my bullies and be around kids who were more like me, and like before, I worked SO HARD on my audition.  I wore myself to the bone to be perfect and would lie awake at night dreaming about what it would be like to fit in.  The day that tiny envelope that delivered bad news arrived in the mail was probably the first time I ever really hated myself.  I cried myself to sleep in my mom's arms.  Not getting in meant I would go to the local high school with the same people who had bullied me since first grade.

High school was hell.  I tried to kill myself twice, but both times I would wake up on the bathroom floor in pools of vomit, furious that I couldn't even kill myself properly and simultaneously ashamed that I had even tried.  The bullying got worse and worse.  I was so depressed and angry because I felt like no matter what, nothing was getting better.  I wished for my first kiss on every birthday from 9-22.  I skipped so much class to avoid my bullies that I almost didn't graduate.  Summer school was the only reason I did.  I never studied, I failed tons of classes, I was so depressed.

I gained a ton of weight.  I was 5'10 and 242 at my heaviest.  I wanted to be pretty so badly, but all I saw in the mirror was an ugly, awkward monster.  I couldn't even imagine what it would be like to hold someone's hand or be kissed.  I felt so ugly, so sad all the time, but I was always way too embarrassed to tell you guys how I felt because as your only child, I feel like I'm your only chance to have what you deserve. 

So I started purging.  It was slow at first, once a month maybe.  Now it's every day, usually 4 or 5 times.  Now I've lost 75lbs and for the first time in my life... I'm kind of pretty.  I started dating a wonderful man 5 months ago, for the first time at 25.  He's sweet, and he looks at me like I waited so many years for.  And I can't stop hurting myself.  I'm in debt from college because you never told me I didn't have even a penny in my college fund, even after I asked.  I can't find a job in my field so I work retail, but hours are scarce and I don't make enough money.  I can't move out, even though I desperately want to, and we fight like animals about it.  I never leave my bedroom because I am so depressed, and I just don't want to talk about it with you.  My weight is the only thing I can control, and the only way I feel like I can control it is to keep doing this. 

I hate this.  I'm stuck in this cycle and I love you guys too much to tell you and break your hearts.  Now I look in the mirror and see a pretty girl sometimes, but mostly I just see a failure.  And I won't fail you again, because you deserve a better daughter than that.

I love you guys.  I love you so much.  "
23qx38,1,2014-04-23,Me [20 M] with my friend (interest?) [20 F] - conservative immigrant parents and first relationships,plaidpajama,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23qx38/me_20_m_with_my_friend_interest_20_f_conservative/,"TL;DR: Two friends from a similar cultural/religious background with conservative arranged-marriage parents trying to feel out dating and romance. Three months ago we expressed mutual interest, but I'm shying away from that and will be back in town in another three. What do?

I've known this girl for the past eight years through school and the temple (weekly); we became close friends in college. Our mutual friends have always suggested it's something more, but only recently (last fall) did we begin flirting in earnest (or at least, that's when I picked up on it). I started hanging out alone with her on Fridays so I could feel things out for myself. I deliberately avoided using the word date, but yea. Finally, we went to an event on campus which we called a date afterwards. While texting, we expressed mutual interest and decided to see where the next nine months would take us. Why that long?

I received my dream internship offer on the other side of the country, so I'm sitting here on the opposite coast. In September I'll be back for school, and while we've been Skyping somewhat frequently, I'm honestly back to not being sure how I feel about dating her.

My parents come from a conservative South Asian background. They support my decision to not pursue an arranged marriage, but are adamant I only start dating after college. I love my parents, but that's one part of my life they have zero authority over, and I'm respectfully declining to follow their wishes in that respect.

They know this girl and they like her; they also know her parents and are pretty neutral with them. The point is, if I try to strike up a relationship with this girl, I honestly know it'll become a lightning rod for drama in the temple community (hooray for close-knit immigrant communities!). When I brought up the possibility of dating herwith my parents, there was much shouting of ""too soon!"", tears, and thoughts of marriage on their end (which is absurd in my opinion, but perfectly normal in their cultural sense). 

**tl;dr**:   
1) Is it bad this is a major sticking point for me? I don't want my first relationship to have this much tension on both ends.  
2) Do I have my priorities completely misplaced? I've never really dated or been in a relationship, though I think I finally want one.  
3) How do I communicate this to her?  "

**I found a partner for this.** Not looking for others right now, but I'll leave this up in case anyone wants to use it as a starting point for your own RP, or whatever. (This is not permission to repost it as your own...)

--------------------- 


It's 9:45pm when I park and get out of my car. After triple-checking the address against my emailed invitation, I toss my phone into the center console. Sliding my keys into the pocket of my slacks and hefting my toy bag over my shoulder, I walk up to the house. The party started at 7, but it goes all night and I never like to be there too early. I ring the bell, and the door swings open to reveal Trista, the door bunny, wearing her trademark top hat.

After some small talk with her, I walk into the house to check out the party. Most people are hanging out in the back yard, escaping the late-summer Vegas heat by swimming, or just socializing on the deck around the pool. There's some socializing in the kitchen, as always, but I'm more interested in the play spaces. I head down the hall towards the bedrooms to check out what's going on.

The first room has a plastic drop cloth covering the carpet, and is set up as a body painting area. I say hello to a few acquaintances from the group, but quickly move on to the next room. Here I find a couple I don't recognize in the middle of a scene. A tall, red-haired woman is using a Violet Wand on a small Asian man laying on a massage table. A few people are watching, probably interested in the relatively novel toy.

I head on to the third room, and here I find what I've been looking for -- two large [crosses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Andrew's_Cross_\(BDSM\)) dominate the room. A tiny woman -- who I know only by her Fetlife screenname, ""SexyInPink"" (with some numbers, which I never remember) -- is strapped to one of them, and blindfolded. Her Domme and partner, Carrie, is instructing another woman on the finer points of breast flogging. The short, red, leather flogger she's holding seems to be doing a fine job. Again, a few people are in the room watching. I spot my friend Steve as I set down my toy bag and ask him if anyone's using the other cross. He lets me know that a few people have used it tonight, but nobody's waiting right now. ""Perfect..."", I think to myself, ""now I just need to find someone to play with."" Grinning, I head out to the kitchen, grab a beer, and head out to the back.

Sipping on my bottle of Dos Equis, I start working the crowd. I meet a few new faces: George, a 60-ish Marine vet (with a remarkably loud laugh), wearing only a pink collar around his neck and a speedo; Joel, a young guy dressed in casual clothes who says he isn't really sure what he's into yet; a cute black-haired woman who introduces herself as ""Sky""... she turns out to be a masochist, but not a sub. I'm about to ask if she wants to play when she turns around to show off her new bruises, already forming from her session with Steve -- he really covered her entire back, ass, and most of her legs. Obviously she's played enough for tonight.

Mostly it's the same old people, though. I wave to some of my friends swimming in the pool before I ease my way into conversation with my buddies Julie &amp; Matt - making sure that I have a clear view of the door. Julie, naked and dripping wet from swimming, teases me about being so dressed up. I look down at my dark red, long-sleeved, button up shirt, gold silk tie, and gray slacks, and shrug. ""This isn't really dressed up for me..."" I left my jacket at the office, even.

Matt, also naked and just out of the pool, continues his story about the new paddle he's working on making. I half listen, still scanning the crowd and keeping an eye on the door -- and then I see ....... ?

------

I have a couple ideas for who you could be: A complete neophyte, attending your first party? A seasoned sub, new to town and checking out the local scene? A coworker (temp? intern? Maybe even boss?) from the accounting firm, just as shocked to find out about me as I am about you? I'd love to hear about your ideas, too! :)"

Finally, I have been able to apply what I believe to be the right course of action to my own relationship.  My boyfriend and I shared the most amazing relationship that I've ever had.  I learned the value of communicating effectively, being patient, and trust (long distance relationships..can't constantly worry).  However, our future would be difficult.  It did not line up.  

He has an unpredictable future with a PhD in progress, and I am so stubbornly set on getting into medical school.  He told me early on that he wouldn't be able to handle the distance for too long, and I could not tell him for sure that I would be willing to drop my future for a few years to move to be with him.  He was also worried about finding someone..at 28, I guess he feels that his time is running out in finding a stable partner.  I could not commit to a future with him, although I would have loved getting married to him, starting a life and family together, traveling the world..  I have to do what is right for me, and he has to do what is right for him.

We'll be seeing each other in May for the last time.  We'll have a week together, and then we will end it.  I will leave for my summer internship, and that will probably be the last time I see him.  We may be friends in the future, but we both will need a lot of time to heal.  

I have nothing left but love for him.  It is a love that we will ride out for as long as we can, and then we'll remember fondly as life goes on.  

Thank you all for helping me be courageous enough to end things, instead of pretending like everything would be okay.  I know this is the right thing to do.  I am so excited for the future.. For me and him both.  I am going to be an awesome doctor and he is going to be an awesome scientist, and maybe we'll be great friends someday.  It hurts now, but it will be okay, won't it? 

Goodnight everyone :)

**tl;dr**: Finally decided that this relationship will have to end.  Told the boyfriend, will be seeing him for a final visit, and we will be ending things mutually and respectfully.  Thank you all for teaching me to be  a good person. "
23r6sx,1,2014-04-23,How to deal with a low raise,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/23r6sx/how_to_deal_with_a_low_raise/,"Hey personalfinance, wanted to get your opinion on a situation I had at work today.

I am a software engineer, recently out of school. I am now working at a game company. Outside of an internship at Microsoft this is my first industry job. 

I chose to work at a game company because I enjoy the work, but it came at the cost of *significantly* less competitive pay than a bigger company (MS, Amazon) would probably provide. I am good at what I do, and very passionate about it; I feel like getting a job at a bigger company wouldn't be much of a problem. But I found working at MS to be pretty boring, so I decided to give this a shot.

I was started at 65k/year in November. I figured this was alright because of my lack of professional experience. I could have probably gone to MS for ~90 starting, like several friends of mine. I assumed I'd be able to 'work my way up' at this job. During the hiring process the producer had mentioned raises and bonuses. No bonuses have happened yet. No mention of them either.

I should also probably mention that this company is growing, a lot, and isn't hurting for money in any way. So the low raise (which I'm getting to) isn't out of lack of resources.

Anyhow, I've been there for ~6 months. I work long hours, put in more effort than I should, and I'm doing good work. In the process of trying to 'work my way up', I have voluntarily taken on a larger workload than most members of the team. I don't mind this terribly, and assumed it would pay off eventually. I'm even tenatively scheduled to give a talk on some new tech I'm working on for them at an internal conference. I am the **sole owner** of several critical chunks of our project. 

The company does reviews and raises this time of year. I received a positive review.

So I got called in to this guy's office today to talk about raises. He said ""Unfortunately you haven't been here long enough to qualify for the full (1 year) raise. You started at 65 and the formula says you should get 65,800 now."" So, roughly a 1.2% raise. This is less than a cost of living raise (3-5%). It didn't really sink in, the lowness of this offer, until 10 minutes after I left his office.

Here's where I'm really confused: I don't qualify for another raise until next March. Why are they basing my raise off of how long I've been there? I'd be fine with this if I were up for another review in 6 or 9 months. If my quality of work was only 30% of what they expected, I guess I would understand. I'm not sure if they are just seeing what they can get away with, or what. But it definitely didn't make me feel very valued as an employee. Or am I just blowing it out of proportion?

There are a few things I feel pretty certain about:

* I am a valuable member of the team and they know that
* If I approach the situation properly, I can probably get them to 'raise' my raise.
* If I wanted to move to a job that I enjoyed less which would make me a lot more money, I probably could
* I would probably have less responsibility/stress at a higher paying job than the load I've taken on at my current job

So I guess my question is: does this raise seem low to you? How should I respond to the situation, if at all? Should I stay at this company when I potentially have more lucrative, less-stressful options? There is definitely something to be said for doing work you enjoy; but if you are paid less and working harder doing it, at what point does that nullify the argument?

Sorry for the wall of text."
23rczd,1,2014-04-23,My depression has taken a lot from me and I just need to sort this out. It's taking too long to come back.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23rczd/my_depression_has_taken_a_lot_from_me_and_i_just/,"For the last year and a half, I've struggled with depression. There are good days and bad days. Some days I manage productivity, and that is nice. Other days I'm damn catatonic - I'll spend the entire day in bed, lie to others about why I can't come out or call in sick to school, *maybe* shower. It's a mindfuck and if I feel any emotion at all, it's anger with myself. 

But maybe that's improving. I can't quite tell. I know that last time I was drunk it didn't change my mood - perhaps that's the last month of antidepressants finally kicking in and medicating? Depression has taken so much, I'm not sure how well I can save what is left. I'm trying with counseling, meetings, medications, trying to follow advice, but it seems so far gone and so slow to return.

Much is lost. I'm not sure what to do about it. I seem to have misplaced:

My mind. 

- I can't manage my time. It's 5:00am and why the fuck am I not sleeping? School starts at 8:30. I won't be going until maybe 12:30 because the writeup I should have done already is due then with an hour of face to face. There's no way I'll be functional if I don't sleep through morning lectures.
- I can't concentrate. Nothing comes as easily as it used to. My memory faults on such simple things... I even half heartedly worry about brain degeneration. 
- Nothing is enjoyable. Why spend time with friends? Why care about my upcoming marriage (that I am doing most of the work for)? Why learn at school? Why play a video game or read a book? I still do these things... but it's path of least resistance far too often.

My body.

- I'm up 30 pounds. Tone is lost to me. I used to be a national athlete... suppose you can only coast on past fitness for a year or so. But how can I get that back when I can barely get to my car? It's just not a priority compared to so much else but I know it would help everything else flow easier.
- Sleep is so elusive. Losing it on the night side and the morning side, no semblance of a cycle sometimes. 

My spirit.

- Who am I and why have I changed?
- I've lied to those who care about me because I don't want them to worry. I've told the therapist about this and some know, and I won't change this habit.
- I used to enjoy my education so much. My career is still one of the few things I have love for but it's fading. I'm in a professional school at the moment, and for the first time failed a test. It was bound to happen eventually with no studying and missing so many lectures, but if I can't do what I love then what will I do? They've offered my test deferral, maybe a leave of absence. It'll decimate my professional career if I take a leave but unless I can improve, I'll have to.
- How many relationships have I soured? I haven't talked to my best man in over a month. I know he's wondering why I even asked him to do that by this point. I've gone weeks without talking to other friends and at least I live in the same city as them.
- My fiancee lives overseas on a internship for a while. Sometimes it hurts that she can't be here to support. Other times I'm incredibly glad she is gone, because she would see me like this. She might not still be with me if she really understood.

So, it is what it is. I've taken all the appropriate steps that someone is supposed to take. I have had a counselor for a few months. I've started medication this month - perhaps helped increase my baseline mood, but I'm not quite there with motivation to improve other habits. I've tried modifying my habits where I can. Mobile apps and calendars, checklists and reminders, accountability phone calls and rewards. 

So, it seems to be getting better very slowly in the last month. It's not quick enough. I've got finals in May, sensitive work in July, and a wedding at the end of August. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. Everyone is a fountain of hopefulness, and it just irritates me. Nobody in my real life understands this process, and I'm tired of catering to their feelings but know I need to if I want them around when I finally pull out of this. I do know I'll pull out of it, eventually, because the alternative is unacceptable."
23rpsr,8,2014-04-23,Learning curve for Avid MC7?,Gapinthesidewalk,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/23rpsr/learning_curve_for_avid_mc7/,"So, I bought MC roughly 7 months ago and I've recently decided to give another, much more dedicated, go at learning it. It's paramount that I learn it for the work that I want to do. Anyway, it's not my first exposure to the program. I had limited experience with it when I was in film school and much more recently had a bit of practice with it during the internship I had this past fall. So, I guess my question is, coming from a guy that is fairly competent in FCP 7 and Adobe Premiere CC, what kind of learning curve can I expect for Avid MC 7? I heard it's much easier to learn Avid first then something like Premiere versus the other way around."

It's what I call non-incremental scrolling - that is, two-finger scrolling works on a pixel-per-pixel basis, instead of one mouse-wheel tick at a time.

I know the feature is implementable in principle, because I see it in certain controls in Ubuntu already. But it appears that only Mac OS X actually has it implemented in any way, shape, or form.

I've been meaning to submit this feature request directly to Mozilla (and I'd gladly spend a term at an internship trying to implement this very thing), but I have no idea where to put it."

Sigh.",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/23sh3c/applied_to_13_internships_havent_heard_back_from/,"I'm a junior CS major at a UC. Transferred here a year ago, but I live in the SF Bay Area. I applied to a bunch of summer software engineering internships at mostly start-ups. Thought I'd at least get an interview with some of them since I satisfied all their requirements, and I go to a prestigious school so maybe the name recognition would have improved my chances of success? Nope.

My (employed) friends looked over my resume and said it looked fine. The lack of personal projects might be hurting me, even though I listed 2 big projects that are currently in progress.

I constantly hear about CS majors, especially in the Bay, being in such huge demand that you'll get a job no matter what. And there are so many people at my school who are getting internships left and right. But I think that's a load of bullshit, because there's so many of us who apply and either get rejected or never heard back from the company.

Anyway, I'm just ranting. I have 4 months of summer break, not taking any classes. I plan to code every day, all day, come up with some killer side projects that companies can't ignore, then try again in the Fall."

Help!,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/23st0g/im_28_and_scared_shitless_drowning_in_debt_and/,"To start off, I've had some pretty bad guidance/financial support over the years and it's all catching up to me. I'm drowning in student loan debt... was the first to go to college in my family, so debt was just piled on in order to pay for tuition. I work as an Intern Architect with ~5 years expirence (someone who works as an architect, but not yet licensed and is absurdly underpaid) and try to pick up free lance work whenever possible. But regardless of work, I can't ever seem to get my head above water!! Let me break down the monthly expenses:

* Rent and utilities=650
* Student loans= 741 (sitting on 65,000 total on private loans)
* Car insurance= 154
* Credit Card= 550 total 
* Food/Play/Living = ~200
* Insurance= 120
* Gas= 120
* Total= $~2060
* Edit= **also currently taking my license exams which are $210 a pop and there's 7 of them total.. plus all the fees that are associated with being a member of the AIA.**

Income sits at $1120 every other week, so it's been insanely tough trying to put a savings plan together that my life doesn't get me screwed up. It's at the point where my girlfriend is threatening to leave because my finances are holding me back from making major life moves!

Anyone have any advice out there to help me cut some fat/save some pennies?? Thanks!!

23tgxe,1,2014-04-23,I lied about my education and now everything is horrible.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23tgxe/i_lied_about_my_education_and_now_everything_is/,"TL;DR
I lied about my education for a really long time, and now I want to come clean, but in the process I'll embarrass the CEO of the company and the entire team.

Senior year of college was rough for me. After returning from five moths abroad, I hit a bad spot and fell into a deep depression. I lost a lot of my friends, slacked off in classes, and smoked too much weed. My motivation for learning left and with it, any care for my future. I failed my senior capstone class. 

Second semester was no better. I called out sick to my internship a lot more than in the fall, skipped classes more than i should have, and never found the willpower to make up the work that my capstone professor was nice enough to let me do. I still walked at graduation, thinking that with all my free time over the summer, I could (with my professor's blessing) get my thesis done and still earn my diploma. 

Summer came and went. No one in my life knew that I hadn't graduated. My parents had bought me graduation gifts, my friends and I shot the shit about wanting to be back in school instead of looking for jobs, and I even dated girls with them thinking that I was a college grad. Meanwhile, I was working at the local hospital doing janitorial work to pass the time while I ""figured things out."" 

A friend of mine mentioned that there was an opening at her pr firm for an intern so I jumped on it. It was a small shop, so I knew there wouldn't be a background check. I was hired and I've been there for almost five months. I was offered a full time position with a competitive salary last week. I didn't know what else to do so I accepted.

Now, as part of the legal process, there is a background check. I'm fucked, quite clearly, as they use a company to do it for them. I'll be found out, fired, and ruined. 

I've been dating a girl for three months who I've really come to admire and care about. I'm going to tell her tomorrow morning. Hopefully I'll have the courage to tell my boss as well. It's better to hear it from me than someone else.

The crazy part is, on the bus ride home I was jotting down notes on my phone for a letter I'd write to my CEO tonight. It would be more or less a ""here is the truth, do what you may"" letter. When I got home, I checked my email and found an email from the CEO of the company congratulating me on my promotion *to the entire executive staff of the corporation.* Now I'm getting congratulatory emails from executive VPs and presidents of our sister companies (we share space so I see them all the time) on my progress. 

Do I tell the CEO anyway? She'll obviously be pissed, but I don't see any other way to salvage any shred of self respect other than this."

I studied my ass of in high school and I got into UC Berkeley.  I was so happy with the way it turned out that I thought I'd study something I loved: Political Science.

While I was a student, I got a job working for the university since I didn't qualify for financial aid.  It didn't pay great, but it was enough to reduce my debt.

During the summers, I lived at home and worked for three different internships that were related to my field.  During my time at Cal, I learned Spanish, joined a fraternity, and wrote a few online blogs. 

Now, I'm about to graduate.  And I can't get a fucking job.

I went to one of the best goddamn schools in the country, I'm bilingual, I've worked three internships and nobody will even give my resume a second glance.  

On top of that, I go to fucking Berkeley, so I'm surrounded by computer engineers who are about to make six figures out of college.  

Meanwhile, I'm five figures in debt, without a safety net or a job. 

Now I'm probably gonna end up as a goddamn waiter, surrounded by people who are going to assume I'm some big fuck up when I busted my ass to get a degree.  

I can't BELIEVE how i can't get an employer to take even a second glance at my resume.  If I had sat in my room and smoked weed for four years, I'd still have the same fucking career prospects before me. 

It occurs to me that, of all the people who told me to study something I cared about, none of them had gone to college in the last ten years.  

So if you're about to start school...

Study something impossibly hard like computer science.  Don't take an easy major no matter how much you care about it.  

If you flunk out of the impossibly tough major....

Don't get a job in college.  Get an unpaid internship in your related field.  You'll work fewer hours and employers will actually give a shit about it come job interview time.  My GPA was a 3.5 because I worked full time as a student and now I have to compete with people with 4.0s.  Just take the debt and worry about it later.

TL;DR: What the fuck did I just spend the last four years of my life doing?  All I have is debt, a fancy degree from UC Berkeley, and no fucking job."

23u9a9,18,2014-04-24,My true ghost story,tharr7,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/23u9a9/my_true_ghost_story/,"This my ghost story – this happened to me in 2001.

I was an intern for a theatre in Glendale that used to be a mason temple, it was 7 stories, with a lower level that used to be a restaurant night club in the 1930’s. It had gutted restaurant seats. The second floor used to be an old movie room.  On the bottom level, was a prop cage that the theatre had built, that contained thousands of props – like tea sets, spoons, and stuff since a classical theatre company ran the theatre and they performed Shakespeare, Moliere, and Dickens. 

One night I was working late with the tech director, in a room adjacent to the prop cage, right by the staircase that led up to the main room of the theatre. I heard props moving. It sounded like cups were knocking each other, or clinking, like they were rolling on the floor. The tech director went to investigate and saw nothing – when he left the room, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs, although the theatre was empty. 

The tech director returned, and we checked the stairs but nobody was there. I told him I thought it was a ghost, and he laughed, and said, there was no such thing as ghosts – when suddenly we both heard LOUD footsteps stomping down the stairs – crazy loud, and very threatening. We looked at each other in the eyes, and then something truly weird happened, that I will never forget, someone stomped on the floor above us, and scratched the side of the walls, but inside of the walls, as if they were scratching the pipes, and then we heard a long bong noise, as if someone had flicked a door stopper, almost cartoon like – BONG, all at the same time. The tech director and I stared at each other, in shock, and then we got the fuck out.

We couldn't believe what happened, we'd heard stories about footsteps, and other actors seeing ghosts, but this was truly bizarre. What kind of ghost stomps on the ceiling, scratches the pipe in the walls, and makes a loud bong noise? The bong noise sounded like a rubber stopper being flicked - like a sound effect you might hear in a cartoon. 

We had to return a few days later to finish working, and the moment we were alone in there, it started stomping in the room above, but more like someone was walking around, although the theatre was empty again, since it was Christmas break, and no one was in the theatre, we used keys to let ourselves inside. And then, the tech director called to it again, making fun of it, like he had done before, when suddenly I felt fear- from the ghost, or whatever that thing was that was in the room with us – it was afraid. I don't know why I felt that it was afraid, but somehow I knew that it was. I smelled fear coming from it, as if it was scared of us! It scratched the walls again, but I knew that it was the one, scared. We left again, because even though I knew it was scared, I was terrified and didn’t want to hang around in a haunted old mason church. 

Months later, a group of us closed the theatre after a show on the third floor. We turned off all the lights, and locked the doors. We stood outside talking about our show, when we heard books dropping on the second floor. We were standing under the window of the second floor, and we ALL heard large books being dropped – an entire group of people of heard it. 

That was my last encounter with the ghosts in that building, although I heard other stories from the actors there. 

One actress told me that she locked up one night and heard a bell ringing in another room, and she quietly walked down the stairs from the third floor to the main floor, with the bell noise getting louder and louder, until it was ringing right behind her ear- but no one was there. She turned around and yelled at the ghost to stop scaring her on the main floor and ran out. She won't be alone in the building ever and told us that she had seen hangers fly across the room in the middle of stage performance, and that two other actors were standing with her, in the wings waiting to go on, when they all saw hangers from the costume rack fly across the room.

She and another actor claimed to have seen an old man ghost during stage performances, suddenly materialize on stage, or in the wings – but no one in the audience could see him. An actor said he exited a scene, and had to walk through this ghost, and when he returned to the stage, he was white, cause he was terrified.

Well, I never saw a ghost, but I heard one. When my internship was over, I never returned to the theatre, but I saw the technical director many years later, who eventually quit. He said that when he worked late building sets, he would hear his tools moving, or if he was sawing wood, he would hear something moving in another room, and when he would inspect, nothing would be there. He quit eventually. I don't blame him.

I’m not sure if I believe in ‘ghosts’ but I still can't explain what happened to the technical director and me that night. No one was in the building. And if there was, how could one person stomp down the stairs, then stomp on the ceiling, scratch the pipes alongside the walls, the side walls, mind you, and make a large spring go, BONG?


Super weird stuff. I dunno.

2. BVerfG: Keine Hausdurchsuchung beim Justitiar mit Prokura, der seinen Job macht

 

Das Bundesverfassungsgericht (BVerfG) hat entschieden, dass die Hausdurchsuchung bei einem Justitiar rechtswidrig ist. Der Justitiar hatte aus der Presse von staatsanwaltlichen Ermittlungen im Umfeld seines Unternehmens erfahren und die Fälle intern aufgearbeitet sowie „Vorzeigefälle für die Staatsanwaltschaft“ vorbereitet. Das Gericht betonte, dass der Verdacht einer Straftat weder aus der Stellung eines Justitiars als Prokurist folge noch daraus, dass er an der unternehmensinternen Aufklärung einer Straftat mitgewirkt habe. Die Durchsuchung setze einen Verdacht bereits voraus und dürfe nicht erst der Ermittlung verdachtsbegründender Tatsachen dienen. Das Anwaltsblatt veröffentlicht die Entscheidung im Mai-Heft (AnwBl 2014, 446). Die Kurzfassung aus dem Heft und die Volltext-Fassung (AnwBl Online 2014, 149) finden Sie vorab unter www.anwaltsblatt.de.

Dies sind die Vorstellungen von Justizkommissarin Reding, die am 14. April 2014 den Bericht 2013 über die Anwendung der Grundrechtecharta der EU COM(2014) 224 vorstellte. Das EuGH-Urteil C-617/10 in der Sache „Fransson“ (s. EiÜ 09/2013) sowie das Urteil des österreichischen Verfassungsgerichtshofs aus dem Jahr 2012, das den Verfassungsrang der Charta feststellt, seien bereits gute Entwicklungen auf dem Weg zu einer europäischen „Bill of Rights“. Laut Bericht stützt der EuGH Entscheidungen zunehmend auf die Charta, nationale Gerichte ersuchen zunehmend um ihre Auslegung. Die Kommission berücksichtigt die Charta bei der Erarbeitung von Legislativvorschlägen unter Anwendung einer „Grundrechts-Checkliste“ – als Beispiel nennt der Bericht den vom DAV ausdrücklich begrüßten Schutz des Anwaltsgeheimnisses in der 4. Geldwäscherichtlinie (vgl. DAV‑Stellungnahme Nr. 57/2013).

HL 37, LL 35",[deleted],DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/23urnr/what_do_you_think_of_this_situation_hl_37_ll_35/,"I don't know why it never occurred to me, but my best friend is in a DB!  His situation is that he's 37, very good looking/in shape (ran a marathon last year), advanced degree, 6 figure job, really funny and awesome guy.  (OK, he's my BFF, so I'm biased.)  He is a true HL - he would like sex every day if he could get it.

His relationship with his spouse started out great.  His spouse is a couple years younger and was in med school when they met.  They moved in together after a year or so, he helped out financially while his SO was an intern.  Sex was OK to good for the first couple of years.  My BFF is more dominant in bed and the SO is more submissive, so they seemed well matched.

But as the years went on, the sex dwindled to nearly nothing.  The SO starfishes and complains that my BFF isn't finishing fast enough when they do have sex.  SO is a doctor now, makes a quarter mil a year, they own a beautiful house in a fancy neighborhood together, no kids though, thank god.

I have told my BFF to leave for years.  His SO doesn't respect him, and frequently says sarcastic and nasty things to him ( to be fair, they both have sarcastic senses of humor, but I think his SO likes making him feel bad).  Unfortunately, my BFF was a bit of a late bloomer and this is his first really serious relationship, so between that, his insecurity, and financial reasons he doesn't want to leave.  He's couldn't afford the mortgage on his own and the house is worth significantly less than when they bought it.  Their families are quite intertwined too, which is a kind of big deal for my BFF.  His family loves his SO.

I know, I know, it sounds like the typical DB.  What advice would you give my BFF though?  What advice to have for me for supporting my BFF?  It seems like a god damn tragedy that he's wasting the best years of his life with someone who doesn't appreciate him, but I don't want to meddle too much.  I'll be staying with them for a week this summer and am hoping to have concrete advice to give the BFF over beers.

**EDIT: Man I thought this would be more obvious.  My BFF is a gay man.  His SO is a man.  This is your daily reminder to not fall into the trap of assuming all HLs are male and all LLs are female. ;)  But seriously, for those of you who HAVE left, is there something your friends could have said/done to make you feel like it was feasible?**"

I am a student at Wright State University in Dayton, but may have an internship in downtown Cincinnati for this coming summer. I don't really want to spend 2.5+ hours driving every day, so I'm trying to find a place to live for the summer. I know little to nothing about the city though..

Does anyone know of any places that offer extremely short leases (like 4 months/just the summer)? I'm not really picky on the area at all, anywhere from downtown to ~20 minutes from the city. 

It will just be me, so I only need a one bedroom/studio- I don't need a lot of space and I don't need anything fancy. Also... I'm an accountant, so I'm all about maximizing value!

23v81x,8,2014-04-24,Is the position useful for my goals?,3dollopsofmayo,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/23v81x/is_the_position_useful_for_my_goals/,"Hello everyone,

I was just looking for some feedback on a position I currently hold, and how useful it is/will be for the advancement of my future career in accounting.

To start, I was lucky and had a former Deloitte auditor for a careers teacher in high school. I learned very much from her, and going into university, I understood the importance of getting internship(s).

Enter now: I've almost completed my first year of university, and I secured and have been working at a major Canadian University, in their Financial Services department, in the role of ""Accounting Clerk"". Some of my responsibilities include:

- Journal Entries to the General Ledger (up to $50 000)
- Verification and creation of chargeback reports
- Review ledger reports, ensuring outstanding advances have been repayed
- Training on major financial system
- Analysis of property leases regarding institutional liability (Somewhat odd, yes)

As typical of the position, I am passed on work others don't want to do, but I don't mind. It will be ending in a month or so. Anyway, onto the purpose of this post.

I would like feedback on what my goals should be for second year. I plan on applying for the Big 4 conferences next year, in hopes of securing an internship for Year 3. Depending on exam results, my GPA will be between 3.3-3.5 (although, this is due to one bad non-major course; after completion of second year it will be towards the 3.5-3.6 range, most likely). I have not decided whether to go into public accounting or industry yet, however that's not important at this time.

I know that I'm very lucky to have gotten the job I did. My ultimate question is: Is this job enough for my future goal of securing an internship? Should I be looking for a similar one in year two, or focusing on my GPA, and maybe breaking into my school accounting union? I'd like to note that I work another non-career related job, and will do so in the future.

Thanks very much for any feedback."

My parents refused to pay my college expenses but our grandmother gifted me $20k, I paid the rest through internships and savings, and I graduated debt free.

I am in a pretty good financial situation and I want to pay off $12.5k of my brother's debt. Some options I am considering:

* Gift my brother 12.5k in cash, he pays off the debt himself
* Gift my dad 12.k in cash, he pays off the debt himself
* Contact the lending institution, I pay off 12.5k debt myself

With any of the cases above, are there tax benefits to any of us? Are there other reasons one plan is better than another?

This summer I'm going on a school trip to India and then I have an internship for 6 weeks afterwards. Then, I have to go home from mid-July through August before returning to college.

The thing is, ever since I started college, I have a lot of anxiety surrounding home. My family sort of blew up (divorce) during high school, but I really love spending time with my family and I'm so happy when I'm at home with them. Though I had a really solid group of friends throughout high school, I went to one of those schools when everything was a competition--school, popularity, how many guys like you, etc. Now, whenever I think of my friends from home I feel empty and anxious. Either way, most of them will be in other cities this summer, but even if they were home at the same time as me, I know it'll be really difficult to see them. I just feel like I've grown really far away from the person I was in high school and I can't handle being around them, I don't feel like I can be myself and I'm not happy.

So, I think I'll be spending a lot of time alone this summer. I know it's a chance to chill out, start therapy, do yoga, read, paint, etc., but my birthday is in August. The idea of my birthday coming and going and no one cares except my mom and close family members makes me so anxious. I feel like these big dates really reflect where you are in life, and if I'm alone on that day (meaning, not celebrating with friends), I know I'll feel like I don't matter and I'm easily forgettable.


My heart is clenched I'm so anxious I feel like I can't function. I don't know what to do. /r/anxiety, if you have advice for anything, like summer activities, solutions to my issues, or how to deal with these underlying anxiety issues, please let me know


**TL;DR: Will spend a lot of time alone this summer because I'll be at home and won't want to see high school friends. Really scared about spending my birthday (in august) alone.**

I have completely run out of money and cannot get any more money from federal loan providers and do not have well enough credit to apply for private loans. I ran out of money because I paid for a trip to Europe my choir is taking using the money I was supposed to use to live on.

On another note, I start an internship June 1st working 40 hours a week making $13 an hour doing software engineering. That will continue part time once school resumes and I won't be strapped for cash after that.

I am trying to figure out what my options are. Here is a little breakdown of my situation:

Owed:

* Federal Loan amount - $18k
* Discover Card - $450      // Used for gas for cashback
* Chase Card - $30       // Used for amazon purchases for cashback
* Barclay - $1000    // Bought macbook for school when my other laptop died, planned on paying off this summer
* Auto Loan - $7000 

Have:

* ~$400 in cash
* A desktop computer worth ~$600 I don't use since purching my macbook

Expenses:
 
* $50 / month - Cell on tmobile
* $115 / month - Full coverage Auto Insurance
* $235 / month - car payment
* $315 / month - Rent
* $100 / month - Utilities

Income:

* $8.75 / hour, 20 hours / week -&gt; ~$250 every two weeks
* $50 / week, extra help from dad

What should I do? Approach my mom for a Direct Plus Loan from the Government? Sell my desktop to have enough to spend until my new job starts in June? I am unsure. 

Have I been spending too much at college? I have not been worried about my expenses and debt because I have good prospects with a computer science degree for a job. This current internship is wanting to keep me on for the last two years of school and I assume offer me a position before graduating so I have not been too concerned about debt knowing I'll be able to pay it off when I graduate.

23we75,2,2014-04-24,"Me [21 F] with my fiancee [21M] of a little over a year, I don't know how to deal with my parents and my fiancee's Navy status",sadpandathrowawayyy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23we75/me_21_f_with_my_fiancee_21m_of_a_little_over_a/,"Hello! My fiance and I are very happy and are living together. He's about to graduate university and I've only got a few more classes left (and a paid internship this summer with a job with the same company to follow the internship) before I'm out as well. My problem is more related to my parents' opinions.

Ever since the first time I brought my fiancee (then boyfriend) home (about 3-4 months into the relationship. Early, but I just ... felt right. Prior to him I dated someone for 3 1/2 years and with this one I just knew), my parents adored him. He had a lot of drive, ambition, and a lot in common with my parents. One thing that they loved was the fact that he was Navy bound. Both of his parents were in the Navy and his father was an officer. My fiancee aspired to be the same thing. He worked so hard this past year to get all of the paperwork in and to go through all of the tests to qualify. He passed the ASTB with flying colors. 

The problems began to come up whenever he had to begin the medical check. We are from Florida, where the Baker Act is present. A few months before I met my fiancee, he had attempted suicide by swallowing bleach. Many things had gone very wrong that year and he had lost control. As soon as he swallowed the bleach, he had immediately regretted it, and began contacting his friends asking for help. They called the Baker Act on him, which is Florida's involuntary psychiatric commitment. He was released early (the normal time span is 72 hours of evaluation) after they deemed he was not a threat to himself or others. After being Baker Acted, the medical record is sealed and cannot be seen. He visited a counselor at our university's health center and talked to her for a couple weeks.

When he began visiting his recruiter to begin the Officer application process, he was very honest and up-front about the incident and asked if it would affect his chances. The recruiter falsely said that it wouldn't be a problem. So he went through the entire process this year, and once he got to medical, things slowed down. The Navy wanted the notes from his counseling sessions at the university, and the university refused because they won't do it without a court order. Instead, they wrote a note to the Navy saying that my fiancee was psychologically okay and that he no longer needed counseling. Obviously the Navy wanted the ugly truth. Our university still would not forfeit the notes. Currently, this is the step my fiancee is stuck at in the process and we are waiting on baited breath for either a miracle or a disqualification letter.

My fiancee has backups, such as a secured teaching job (his passion -where the county is paying for 100% of his master's) as well as a few other offers for decently-salaried jobs throughout the state. We are both very sad about the Navy problems, but we are not completely SOL. His parents (who know about the suicide attempt) are sad but are happy that he is pushing forward with a career instead of giving up, just as I am.

Whenever I communicate with my dad about even minor things like my car's mileage, he will bring up ""seeing [fiancee's name] in Pensacola while he's in flight school"" or ""You'll have to figure out when [fiancee's name] is on leave so that you can have room for the honeymoon post-wedding"". The bad Navy news came about a week ago, and it's been stewing in my head. I CANNOT tell my parents about the suicide attempt, and I feel that it is something personal and that no one NEEDS to know that. My parents are very judgemental about suicide and self-harm. I'm preparing to tell them that he will be medically DQ'd, but I will give other medical problems (his vision and hearing may not qualify for the standard either). I don't know how they'll take it. It seems that they are hellbent that he's ""going to the Navy"" and it would hurt me so much if they based their entire opinions of him on the fact that he was Navy-bound.

I don't know how to talk to them about it. It seems like my parents are slightly elitist and see teaching as an ""easy way out career."" They have always been tough on me about careers and about the careers of the people I date. My fiancee is already hurt enough and he's upset with himself that the suicide attempt harmed his ability to go Navy, and it would break his heart if he lost my parents' affection over something like this. 

Obviously I can't hide the Navy thing from them (despite the fact that I refuse to tell them about the suicide attempt) but I really don't know how to go about this conversation.

---   
**tl;dr**: My fiance is disqualified from Naval Officer Candidate School for a suicide attempt a while back. Though upset, he is still very motivated and has good career backups. HOWEVER, my parents seem to obsess over the fact he's going to the Navy. I'm not sure how to talk to them."

Mind you this guy looks like he's making 400k+ and I'm a college kid on his first interview. He doesn't know me from Adam, but we talk like we've been friends for a long time. We talked about sports. We talked about his kids and their careers. We talked about his 30+ year career in computer technology. We talked about life in general and career paths. My point is there are very few things that I've seen bring complete strangers together like this, and a cigar is one of them. 

TLDR: Random guy talks to me for an hour and a half over a cigar and dinner. "
23wxc1,3,2014-04-24,Buying a car is hard.,killergamer0,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/23wxc1/buying_a_car_is_hard/,"(Background)My name's Andrew, I'm 22 years old and I'm going to college to get my associates degree in software development. I probably shouldn't be allowed on r/Frugal with how terrible with money I am. 

So a couple weeks ago my last car broke down and was going to cost me $1,500 to fix at the lowest, and possibly $2,500 to put an engine in it. Well the car is only worth $700 to $1,000 so I've come to the conclusion that it's time to find a new(er) car. Well, has it been hard. Tonight was the hardest night I've had. I found a 2008 Mazda 3, with 106,000 miles on it, for $8,500. So I called my uncle who is willing to help cosign for the loan if I'm able to show him my finances and how I'm going to pay for it. That got me thinking, I had originally planned on putting about $750 down and than when it's summer working 40 hours with my internship pay that months worth of car payments. Than when it was August I would take my left over school money (I get extra money from grants) and pay for my car payments up front. Than I got to thinking that it's a bad idea to pay for something mentally with money you don't have. And now I'm really stressed because I'm giving up pretty much a dream car right..Now, I know this is a long story for almost no reason other than I need to vent. And explain a few things my uncle said to me. 

-If you can't pay for it before you buy it, than you can't afford to pay for it after you buy it.
-Even if you get your payments lowered by stretching them out you'll end up paying in the long run and you should not expect to pay more when you think you're going to have it.
-You need to show your self, and than me that you can afford something before you buy it. 

So, while these are all common themes when buying big purchases I thought I could express some of the million things running through my head. Now to find a 3k to 4k car. Any one have any good suggestions for a good gas mileage car in that price range? 

TL;DR My car's broken, almost payed $8,500 for a car I probably can afford without stretching my self way to much. And I need to learn to budget and find resources on it.

23xlsl,14,2014-04-25,"Questions about graduate school, post-graduate school, etc",firelitdrgn,AskAnthropology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/23xlsl/questions_about_graduate_school_postgraduate/,"Hi r/AskAnthropology! 

I've lurked around here and posted a few times, but something's been on my mind lately and I wanted to see what the people of the world wide web has to say. I'll try to keep it short :) 

I'm currently in my last quarter as a college undergraduate in the anthropology department, focusing primarily on physical/biological (but I've taken some archaeology classes before as well). Due to the fact that I've been volunteering in my university department's lab for the last year, I have plenty of lab experience under my belt when it comes to data entry, cataloging, archival work, dissection, wet lab/cleaning animal bones, and I'm starting to dabble a bit in 3D scanning. 

I'm also volunteering for an internship through my university department (it's an internship but I'm not getting credits for it like everyone else is) where we're working on a project that will eventually go to the Smithsonian. I also have an excellent report with the lab manager in my department as well as many of the professors in the department (in both the physical and archaeological anthropology) because I've been volunteering so much in such a short time (I changed my major at the end of my sophomore year). 

My initial plan was to go into forensic anthropology, but after talking to a few people in the field as well as going to talks hosted by the professors in my department I realized it is not a feasible goal because of:

* job prospective; there's literally no jobs for anyone just under the title of ""forensic anthropology""
* over-saturation of the field due to recently popular television shows
* too broad. Wayyy too broad. 

I thought about it for a long while but I knew I still wanted to work with bones to a certain degree (I'm interested in both bones and decomp remains, so I can do both). I've been very interested lately about working at the Smithsonian under their forensic anthropology department, but I have also heard through the grapevine that this is ALSO not a smart idea. 

I also want to just throw it out there that I am not opposed to eventually working in the academia if I do end up doing something forensic related (because I know that happens a lot of the times when one goes into forensics). Neither am I opposed to doing other sorts of work, no matter how back-breaking or difficult it is; all I know is I just want to be able to work with bones, skeletons, and the human body in general. 

And of course, as a senior I'm looking towards my future in terms of paying off my student loans, putting my degree to good use, graduate school, etc etc. 

SO my questions are:

1. What is the prospective, or the possibility/chance, of working in a museum society such as what I've described? Is this more or less difficult than say going into bioarchaeology and doing something forensic related?

2. I had changed my major to anthropology during the end of my sophomore year. My GPA in the anthropology major is **wayyyyy** better than the GPA in my previous major. For graduate schools, especially if you're focusing on anthropology, do they look at the overall GPA or just your major GPA? (I've always wondered about this but can't seem to find the right answer...)

3. I have no fieldwork experience under my belt (bad I know) due to either financial, familial, or school conflicts. I have heard from a few people that if finance is an issue (cause I'd really like to not take out more loans for field school), volunteering is the next best thing. What are your thoughts on this? What happens if I want to volunteer but have no hands-on experience in the field? What are your thoughts on taking out loans for field-school **period**?

4. In-state verses abroad for graduate school? I have heard that studying abroad for graduate school actually makes it harder for you to find a job back in the US. 

5. Jobs straight out of college? Any ideas of what field I can go into, and where to start in general in terms of job search? 

Anyway, all and any feedback are more than welcome. Many thanks in advance!"

23y5gk,8,2014-04-25,My [25 F] Mirena insertion experience (Canada),thedogsbreakfast,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/23y5gk/my_25_f_mirena_insertion_experience_canada/,"I have wanted an IUD since I was about 19. One of my girlfriends got one and I was unbelievably jealous. I lived in Ontario at the time and my family doctor told me that I was not a candidate for Mirena. She said that I was too immature, and that she would only prescribe and insert for women who have had children previously. I was disappointed, but I let it go. I broke up with my boyfriend not long after that anyway. 

Fast forward to summer of 2012. I moved to Atlantic Canada for a post-grad internship and I fell head-over-heels in love with my now fiancé. I can’t seem to get a family doctor here. Luckily a not-for-profit organization exists in my city. It runs similarly to Planned Parenthood. I sought them out for birth control options that summer. I asked about IUDs, and sure enough, they were only too happy to prescribe and insert. However, the wait list for an appointment was upwards of 4 months!

I got pregnant in the fall of 2012. I was so close to my IUD appointment that it was painful. I waited out the first trimester to decide what to do. Not to mention that in Atlantic Canada you must have a doctors’ referral and there is, yet another, wait list. I ended up terminating the pregnancy around Christmas that year. 

Following my pregnancy I got back on the waitlist for an IUD insertion appointment. My cultures were fine, but my pap smear came back with low-grade changes. I was no longer a candidate for an IUD until I got a colposcopy to rule out a problem with my cervix. It was summer 2013 before I was able to get in for that appointment. I had to wait another 6 months for my next pap to ensure there were no more changes. Luckily everything turned out okay. My pap this past Christmas was okay. 

So, I *finally* got my IUD inserted yesterday. I was prescribed Mirena about 6 weeks ago while at my cultures and pap smear appointment. I recently got a job with unbelievable benefits. My Mirena was completely covered! Even if it hadn’t been, Mirena sells for $350 and change at my local Costco pharmacy. I picked my Mirena this past week. The pharmacist was very discreet about packing up this rather large, and awkward box. I got a little note at my prescription appointment that reminded me to take 600 mg of ibuprofen about an hour prior to my appointment. All I needed on arrival was my valid provincial health card. 

The doctor was running about 45 minutes late. She asked if I had any questions for her, and she walked me through what she was going to do. She reminded me that any time I wished her to stop, to let her know. Honestly, I have been excited for this! I had no questions for the doc. I have also been trying my best to avoid online reviews, experiences, and horror stories. I want to be able to form my own opinion. 

Yesterday was day 4 of my cycle, an ideal time for insertion. I undressed from the waist down. The doc did an internal exam of my uterus and ovaries in order to determine whether my uterus was tilted forward or backward. Mirena comes in a rather large, sterile box. The doc was not going to open the box until she knew that she could get the device inserted. No problem. 

Next the doctor inserted the speculum. She then sprayed an antiseptic disinfectant into my vagina. It smelled like cherries! Next was the sounding device (to determine the size of my uterus, and how deep the Mirena would be placed). The sounding device was kind of like a long tube. It had to go through my cervix. The doctor told me it was going to feel like a sharp pinch, and that a big cough will help her get it through. It did pinch. In fact it about 60 seconds of just plain uncomfortable. 

Mirena was next! The insertion technique is similar to placing a tampon in the vagina. Mirena gets inserted through the sounding tube. The doctor pushed Mirena into my uterus, checked it’s position, then removed the tube. This step felt like a painful cramp. It did hurt, and I did say “ouch” out loud. The doc asked if I was okay, and of course I was. All that was left after that was the cutting of the strings. Of course I didn’t feel this. I was just eager to have the speculum out by this point. The doc cut the strings, and voila! All over! 

When I was getting dressed I noticed some blood spots on the pad I was laying on. Being day 4 of my cycle, the bleeding had really tapered off. I had not expected to bleed during insertion. I guess I just never thought about it. Luckily I brought a pad for the way home. That was something that I wish I had known previously. Especially after having asked if there was anything I should bring when I called to confirm my appointment. Oh well. 

The entire appointment took less than 10 minutes. The doc handed me some literature (similar to that included in each box of HBC pills), and a date card to keep until my Mirena’s removal/replacement. On my way out of the office I made a follow up appointment for the first week of June. There was no cost for this, although I did make a modest donation to clinic. 

So far, so good. I had some pretty intense cramping all afternoon. I took ibuprofen at 4 hour intervals to manage the pain. I chose not to have sex with my partner yesterday, although the doc said it would be fine to do so. I slept well last night, and the cramps seem to have tapered off this morning. The bleeding is less intense as well. Everything seems fine! 

I’m happy to share my (Canadian) experience! I’ll do my best to answer any specific questions you might have as well! Good luck on your birth control journey :)

**TL;DR:** I had Mirena inserted yesterday after a very long wait. It was a short appointment, and not too painful. "

Even if I did, I've got tons of shit on my head due to studying Physics and Computer Science at the same time and it's gonna stay that way till at least September, October.

Meanwhile situation at home is getting more and more tense. Dad is hitting the bottle pretty hard on weekends, he's got problems at work and his health problems cause him a lot of stress. And he doesn't know to deal with it in any other way. As a result my parents are either not speaking to each other (when dad's sober) or screaming at each other (when dad's drunk). Silly as it sounds, it's still taking its toll on me, even I'm almost 23 years old. It causes me to pretty much shutdown, I can't focus, I can't get anything done.

Lately I've also realized that I'm not over a girl that I thought I was over. I missed my chance with her last year and I thought I've dealt with it, but for some reason a month ago I started thinking about her again. And while I hoped to try it again (even if I'd get a straight 'no' this time, it would be better than this uncertainty), today it turns out that she's moving abroad for summer, so right now chasing this feeling would seem kinda selfish.

Only thing I've got going for me right now are my football practices. Going at it at offensive line helps me with all that stress. But even there it's not what it used to be, cause I've had to step up and take center position, which requires a lot of responsibility. I also still have some problems with snapping the ball (tho I know I just need practice), which doesn't help.

Overall I feel like I'm not moving forward at all. I hope I'll be able to get a summer internship, got an interview on Monday. But, while I'm good, I know that I'm not the best. And I know there's gonna be big competition. But I really hope I'll do well there, I really need it."
23zkt4,39,2014-04-25,"[trigger warning] Why did I need a ""Bad Guy""?",Polenicus,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/23zkt4/trigger_warning_why_did_i_need_a_bad_guy/,"For whatever reason, checking out the posts on the forum today led my thoughts to drift back to an old argument my parents had.

My Nmom had been going to school to get her Counselling degree. As soon as I turned 13, she had gleefully decided that I did not need as much parenting, and this was her opportunity to better herself by pursuing her dream life. This consisted of professional accolades, a shiny new convertible, and even a brief political career.

As she termed it, it was 'her turn'.

In the meantime, my Dad (The one with a full time job as the General Manager of a brand new printing plant) was tasked with parenting me, as Mom was too busy with her night courses and eventual internship. This put us in the unusual situation of our schedules being out of synch - We were never home when she was, and vice versa.

So, Dad and I started doing things together. We took up night skiing as a way for him and me to exercise, and we also spent time together on the family boat. We experimented with making kites and a remote controlled model boat, and essentially for the first time really spent time together.

This is a good thing, right? Apparently not.

Sometime after her courses finished, my Nmom grew dissatisfied with the situation. I don't know if it was because I brought home a poor test score, or she had audited my bank account and found it wanting, but she decided to rip into my father, with me listening in.

""You aren't willing to be the bad guy!"" She snarled at him. ""You're so proud of him, getting him his first bank account, without ANY limitations on it... he's going to get himself in debt and we're going to have to pay for it!"" (As a note, it was a junior savings account, not a credit card. Managing to accrue debt would be an accomplishment indeed.) ""He's already spending it irresponsibly!"" (I was spending my paper route money on things like a drink to take with me on said paper route, or things that interested me instead of, say, school supplies or new clothes).

She accused him of 'wanting to be my friend', and how he wasn't willing to be the 'bad guy', which meant SHE now had to swoop back in, take back parental control, and be the bad guy herself. She mocked the things we had been doing together and said ""That's not parenting!"" She said that she was going to take back the role of 'bad guy' and we were both going to regret it, because she was NOT happy about having to do it.

I had the thought today, after remembering this. A question I had never asked myself before.

""Why did I need a Bad Guy?""

I was never what you would classify as a 'problem child'. I was quiet, self-sufficient, the most trouble I got into was detention ONCE in my entire high school career, I was on the honor roll every year until graduating. I had a part time job since I was 14. I never threw parties, or even went to them. I never tried drugs or alcohol. I never wrecked the family car. I never spoke back or spoke disrespectfully to ANY of my elders, much less my parents. I didn't get into fights, I did my chores, I did my honest best to be grateful and helpful.

And yet... it was accepted without question that I needed someone in the family designated to hurt me. That me committing a wrong severe enough that I would need to be reduced to tears was a foregone conclusion. There were never any hands raised in my household, I was never hit... And more than once I had wish that I had been. Physical pain would have been easier for me to endure than being emotionally destroyed whenever I had displeased my designated 'Bad Guy'.

After that, my Dad and I still did things, usually on the weekends. I realize now that we never did things as a family. It was Mom and Dad, or me and Dad, but never Mom and me, or the three of us. Dad and I spent time together in the bits where Mom didn't need him. We didn't ski together anymore, even though after a few moves we had gotten a small ski chalet. He and Mom skied a lot, though. I remember when she fell once and broke her shoulder she screamed at him a lot for 'intentionally taking me on a run you knew was above my ability, that you KNEW I was going to fall on!'

There was a lot of that. Dad and I kinda got relegated to the kind of relationship a divorcee Dad has with his kids, only seeing them on the weekends. The rest of the week he was too busy with her needs, and I was too busy hiding from her. We never really evolved beyond that awkwardness; He never really knew what was going on in my life, and I could never trust him enough to tell him anything of substance, knowing that it would immediately go to her, and possibly be used against me.

I realize now, what a wonderful bit of awful, narcissistic brilliance this was on my Nmom's part. She justified her abuse as 'needed', and absolved herself of rancor because she insisted she didn't WANT to do it, but that there must be a 'Bad Guy'. She set my father up to be blamed, because he was unwilling to perpetrate the abuse, and me to be blamed because I was such a rotten kid I needed to have a 'Bad Guy'. And so she was free and clear to rage and scorn and judge all she wished, and then to extract apologies from us for making her do it."

Should I start my first credit card now?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/23zpry/got_a_nice_job_coming_up_but_many_bills_the_week/,"As the title says, I'm about to start a pretty nice summer internship (which should continue into my final year at school). I laid out all my bills and income in Excel from now until the end of summer and by the end of it, it looks like I'll be in a pretty nice position.

My problem is that my first paycheck will not arrive until May 30, but I have quite a few bills in the two weeks leading up to it which I won't be able to pay for myself. I could somewhat easily borrow from family, but I'm wondering whether a credit card would be good for this situation. I figure I could pay for these bills using credit starting on May 14, and be able to pay it off on May 30. Those bills add up to ~$1500.



I've never applied for a credit card before, so here's some info about my situation:

* 21 year old student (Junior)

* No debts or loans

* Held only a near minimum-wage student job for a year



So what do you guys think? Is this a good situation to start a credit card in, or should I rely on some family help?

If a credit card's a good idea, which one would be good for me? Thanks!"

I had a few internship interviews this week and I think I'm likely to be offered the position.

I've never done anything with databases before, but am very interested in learning how. I really want to get a leg up on my SQL knowledge before the internship starts this summer. I asked the interviewer to give me a bit more information on the actual database, but we didn't have time to go into great detail about it. 

Any tips? Thanks!

240f28,1,2014-04-26,Me [21 M] with my GF [18 F] 6 months: GF is strongly opposed to marijuana; Threatens to break up if I smoke. Need outside input.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/240f28/me_21_m_with_my_gf_18_f_6_months_gf_is_strongly/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating a short while (6 months), but things have been going well. I told her I loved her, and we have a very strong connection. She has learned a lot about me (childhood abuse, family issues, etc.) and I've seen her as a very very open minded/fairly liberal and accepting person.


She told me in the beginning she wasn't a fan of pot, and didn't care for people who smoked it. I said that's coo. I myself (who has only smoked once) am fine with it, but I don't use it. I told her that her opinion was fine with me, because it's not part of my life. 


Fast forward two months later, and I smoke for the second time in my life with some new friends (I'm interning in a different state for the semester). I reflect on it, and realize I did something that would make my GF uncomfortable with me, so I tell her the next day when I see her in person. I told her I fucked up and apologize. She cries, and tells me how she is now worried that she'll, ""be at school waiting for me to tell her what I've done next."" I feel guilty, apologize again, and we go on just fine. She says maybe one day she'll feel differently. She said she used to avoid dating anyone who drank, and I'm the first one she is comfortable with.


Fast forward, and I'm still living and interning out of state. The people I live with are solid interning dudes, good students, and they smoke pot regularly. They sometimes ask me to smoke with them, and without telling them why (GF), I just say no thanks. I think it over, and I think, ""This is silly. Pot is harmless. I should be able to smoke occasionally if I want.""


I figure my GF has thought it over, so I call her and ask how she feels about it. She says, ""I don't have much respect for people who smoke. I think it's an unintelligent choice, and I don't like it."" I tell her I want to smoke. MELTDOWN ENSUES. We are on the phone for 2 hours. She brings up every classic argument against weed. She tells me 

1. it's addictive 

2. will increase my anxiety (I get it occasionally) 

3. that I risk getting laced weed, because, ""that's what drug dealers do to sell more drugs.""

4. I will support the drug cartel

5. I am increasing the price of medical marijuana for those who need it more than those selling it.

6. It's a gateway drug (exact words), and with my family history (father/relatives drug addicts) I shouldn't. Fair enough, but I have never had issues.

7. Money wasted on pot is money that could be used to visit her (we live

8. Literally, any possible argument against it you can think.


She cries, swears, etc. and I'm proud of myself, because I keep calm and don't raise my voice. I explain to her that I have a great internship, I have 3.8 GPA, don't drink heavily, exercise everyday, and have never so much as gotten a speeding ticket. I counter her points to the best of my ability, and explain I'm not a degenerate. I'm not looking to make this a regular habit, or pour money into it. I simply want to the option to casually smoke if the opportunity arises. Nothing more. 


She says that she doesn't command me to do anything, so why can't I do this one thing. ""I don't dance with guys at parties, because I know it makes you uncomfortable."" I tell her that's completely different, and even she knows that there are plenty of scummy college dudes. A random dude grinding on your GF is very different than smoking, and I trust her completely. I tell her this is a tiny harmless thing, and that's why I do not want to be controlled. That really is the biggest issue. I never want to be TOLD what I can and can't do in a relationship, and obvious things (don't cheat, lie, etc.) don't fall under this category, as they are a given. 


In the end, she says she will break up with me if I can't respect her opposition. I tell her I disagree with her opinion. She asks to talk about something different in the meantime, since we've come to a stalemate. Neither one of us agrees with the other. That was two days ago, and it has not come up since. It's looming over my head, and I don't know what to do, or how to convince her it's harmless and that I'm not at risk. Or am I an asshole like she thinks I will be? 
 

This is completely out of left field, and I had no idea she felt THIS strongly about it. I always thought she was so open minded. Maybe she is just too young for me? I AM GOING TO TALK TO HER SO I KNOW THAT. PLEASE HELP!

***TL;DR: Girlfriend is strongly opposed to marijuana for reasons I believe are invalid; Will break up with me if I smoke. I simply want the FREEDOM to smoke if I choose. "

I'm a 24 year old male currently living in Sweden and am contemplating a move to either the west, east or southern coasts of the US by summer/fall 2015. As this will be the first major move for me I'd like to get in touch with others who have been in a similar situation and who currently lead successful lives there for a number of years (basically people who decided to move, got a job and decided to stay there permanently) but people who have been there temporarily are also of interest.

Worth noting is that I am already an american citizen since birth, but moved from the US shortly after I was born and have been living in Sweden my entire life ever since. It wasn't until last year that I finally got an opportunity to visit my true home again and I absolutely loved it.

Currently I have a BSc. in Automation/Mechatronics engineering and am pursuing my MSc. in Production Engineering and completing my degree june 2015 from which I will be available for work. I am also aiming to achieve an internship or master thesis spot in the US (no preference where) which I will be conducting during the spring of 2015.

I'm currently a second year student studying software development and am in a somewhat unique situation. I am attending school in Boston currently, but will be returning to Kansas City this summer and will be continuing my education at UMKC in the fall. I was hoping to secure an internship for this summer or next school year but, because I am in Boston, I am finding that to be rather difficult. 

Although my degree is in software development, I have aspirations to enter into the security field. Any internship that would give me some experience in this field would be awesome, but I would really like an internship with a smaller, startup company. I would prefer to intern at a small startup because I want to surround myself with like minded, creative, eager, people that share my passion for technology and security. 

One of the driving forces behind my search for an internship is my desire and eagerness to learn as much as I possibly can. Outside of my required coursework I spend a lot of time teaching (or trying to teach) myself various skills. I believe that I would gain a great deal of knowledge and experience through an internship that I am not able to gain in the classroom or at home in my free time so I would gladly accept an unpaid internship if an opportunity arose.

On a side note, I have talked with a handful of people in the security field and have reached out to a few companies already. I do realize that getting an internship in the security field is extremely difficult, or at least to my understanding it is.

I'm open to any guidance, feedback, or opportunities that you might have to offer me!"

I met my boyfriend online when I was 17, around September, and after couple months of courting (Talking all day every day, me skipping school just to talk to him... That kind of thing) we finally told each other how we felt. It was sweet, it was romantic, it was perfect. Ever since we met we were inseperable and we would make plans to meet and eventually, the next year in September, we met up and I was living with him (I was planning on dropping out of school after my fifth year because I couldn't take it anymore and I finally left sometime before Christmas.)

I lived in Scotland and he was going to school in France, I can barely speak a word of French so I somewhat rely on him quite a bit, as well as the fact that I obviously don't have a job so there's that. He told me along time ago that if I was happy with not working and not going to school then he would be fine with that and would take care of me, but he would still enjoy seeing me do something or studying something because he doesn't want me to wake up one night and regret my choice to stay at home and that if there was anything I wanted to do, he would make it happen. He was/is even willing to move to Scotland to work so I could maybe go to school or just so I could be closer to my family.

I feel scared that one day he will resent me for being at home doing what I want to do while he's working for the both of us and at the same time, I'm worried that I will eventually regret doing nothing for my whole life or maybe working as some waitress or a dead-end job because I need to get out or have money of my own. I hate asking people for things too - I rarely ever asked my parent's for anything and I have never to this day asked my boyfriend either - anything I've received from him has been a gift. I feel ashamed that I can't get him anything for birthdays and such and it really pains me.

But the thing is, I have no idea what I want to do! I spent years thinking about what would I could do that would bring me joy or excitement or entertainment and there's nothing. I went from marine biologist, to lawyer, to commercial pilot, to makeup artist... Everything seems mediocre, tedious and boring. I've spent my life hearing things like people should do what they love and that you shouldn't work a job that you hate and I want to stand by those principles but currently, I feel like dead weight and it's bringing me down.

As of a week ago, I had to return home to Scotland so I could renew my passport and because my boyfriend is doing an internship for school and for that he needs to go back to his home oversea. It's tearing me apart but maybe it will give me some time to think about what I want to do with my life. Being with him, he is/was all I ever thought about and I would do anything for him to make his life more comfortable, more enjoyable. I realise that our relationship is potentially very toxic having me rely on him for everything, not to mention the fact that he is pretty much my entire life. I don't talk to anyone else except one other friend but that relationship is toxic too (He likes me a lot, but obviously I have a boyfriend so I try to keep my distance but I'm genuinely afraid of how he would react if I stopped talking to him. He said that I'm the only person he cares about and if I disappeared, he didn't think he would care about anything anymore) and I have one girl friend in my life but we barely ever talked and she pretty much abandoned me when I left, she didn't respond to any text, didn't message me on facebook or whatsapp, just no contact at all.

I don't know what to tell him because I'm afraid that if I explain how I feel he would promote me staying here, as much as it would pain him and not to mention myself, so that I could have the life I want and the life he wants for us both. Writing this last paragraph bring tears to my eyes because he's all I ever wanted and now that we have each other, I don't want to do anything to jeapordise our relationship, but right now my and our future is hard to envision.  I don't know what he sees when he thinks about it because I know he does a lot, and I don't know where I am or what I'm doing in it. I don't want to eventually be something holding him down and the thing that he comes to hate, even if he tells me that's never going to happen.

EDIT: Even if I were to choose to stay behind, I only have 4 out of 5 classes from academy/high school required to go to university without some kind of condition and thinking about having to go to college just for one class supremely depresses me. An extra year spend on one class for the chance to do a 3-4 year course? I would rather throw myself under a bus, to me honest. Even though I know I'm still very young and I have the world at my feet, I just can't bear the thought of it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR, I'm at a crossroads in my life where down one road, I have my boyfriend and being with him and doing whatever I want, but also relying on him greatly and being afraid of becoming something he despises, while down another road, I have the long-distance relationship again and all the fears and loneliness that goes along with it but also doing something productive with my life that could not only benefit me but the both of us. I'm feeling terrified and alone and worried about the outcome of whichever decision I choose to make."

I've been here for a year now, and couldn't be happier--except for my relationship. I also have confrontational anixety.

He's wonderful. He's unbelievably intelligent, practical, and determined, just finishing up a masters in engineering. He is caring, cuddly, and we have a great sex life. We have all the same opinions on life and where we are going, and we could really have an amazing future together. We've traveled far and wide, and been through a lot. People say we are meant for each other, and a lot of the time, I believe them.

The thing is we differ on one big thing. I am forgiving and non-confrontational. I try my best to be polite and to phrase things in the least offensive manner. He is petty, argumentative, and downright rude. He also loves to tease and torment and tickle (I hate being tickled, it's a nightmare), and can't stand any twinge of illogical thinking. And he picked it up from his parents, who are the most petty and bickering of people I have ever met (and hate each other--are only together because of him and the farm). I hate going to his house because it means enduring hours of ""nya nya nya nya you did this you said this nya nya"". And he can't deal with my anxiety at all, he just doesn't understand it.

He teases me constantly. I'm self-conscious about my boobs and have asked him not to tease me about them many many times. When rearranging my bra, ""Hey if you look hard enough down there you might find something!"" ""Aww that's sweet you've got an internship that'll pay £180 a week... That's alright you'll be hating me when I'll have a full-time paying job at the time!"" (Though he did at first say that was great and he was really proud of me). After saying I couldn't find something he had anywhere that I wanted ""Duh, it's called amazon?"" --Yeah I tried that... That is just the way he talks. Everything is a competition, everything I am stupid for if I'm not as good as him.

And when I call him out on it, he just says ""I'm only joking, you know that. Somebody can't take a joke..."" And gets annoyed with me.

And god forbid I ever tell him to stop tickling me! ""Oh, yeah, because I'm so horribly abusive aren't I... I'm really hurting you..."" Actually, yeah, I fucking hate it. And if I try to explain that, ""but this is how I've always been with all my friends and exes, and nobody else has ever complained.""

He is really really lovely. We have all the same hobbies, we care about each other immensely, he gives me little gifts, we cuddle for hours on end, he compliments me, he takes me places and vice versa. We agree on most of everything, and we have basically named our kids.

I just don't know if I'll ever be able to get used to it.

So, what do you think? Is it something worth putting up for, or trying to talk to him about? I highly doubt he'll ever change, and like I said most of the time it's absolutely fine, though he is better when it's just the two of us at my house without his parents. As a non-petty person though, I just don't know if this is something I can live with, especially with my anxiety acting up every single time he does something mean-spirited.

Thank you so much for reading!

TL;DR: Boyfriend loves to tease, and is often mean-spirited about perceived illogicality. I hate going to his house because of his parents and how he is around them, and they will be in his life forever. He is absolutely perfect for me otherwise, but I don't think he'll ever change. Is the relationship worth it?


EDIT: oh, and because of the anxiety I've been through, I now have IBS. Probably would have it anyway, but it's fascinating to watch the correlation between him teasing me and my stomach aches."

242t88,0,2014-04-26,How did you choose your grad school?,tootiefruitie,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/242t88/how_did_you_choose_your_grad_school/,"I'm in a slight pickle right now and could use some advice.

A little about me: I am an applied physics undergrad at a small university on the East coast.  My school has very little research going on, so I have worked in industry since Freshman year to gain experience.  I am a very good student and have a strong academic record.  I am looking to attend grad school for Mat. Science or Chem. Eng. It sounds like a major swing from applied physics, but I tailored my classes to prep me for those programs.

Long story short, I was rejected from both original grad schools that I applied to. Stupid, I know.  In desperation, I applied to several others and was accepted two 3 of those.  

I am not interested in grad school ""SC"", since they were not very receptive to my application when I submitted it.  I assume they didn't meet their quota this semester.

Grad School ""NC"" is very interesting.  I visited their facilities a couple of weeks ago and was very impressed.  A couple of the faculty had very interesting research, and one offered me to work for her over the summer to get adjusted to the school. Overall, she and the entire department have been very supportive and their offer letter reflects that.  Pros and cons of this school:

&gt; Pros:

&gt; * No worries of funding. Their program has plenty of federal and industry involvement, so funding their labs is not an issue.
&gt; * Plenty of interesting research and inter-department collaboration.
&gt; * Very nice area surrounding the school.
&gt; * Very nice offer letter.
&gt; * Plenty of companies that collaborate with the department.  Job placement looks good.

&gt; Cons:

&gt; * Very large program. Coming from a small program, I am not sure of how the transition will go.

I am visiting grad school ""VA"" next week. Although their offer letter is not as good as ""NC"", one of my undergraduate professors graduated from there and personally knows most of the faculty.  I have some experience with a few of their faculty's research.  From what I understand, funding and facilities are both in plentiful supply.  Job placement is also good.

Recently, however, one of my original grad schools came back with an offer.  The professor that I wanted to research with received NSF funding, and can hire me into their new MS program.  My current boss graduated with a Ph.D. under the above professor.  The work I have been doing at my internship mirrors what his group does very similarly, so it would be a natural transition into his group.  The major benefit of this school is its name and recognition.  It is a very prestigious school and recognizable my most people in the USA.  However, I would be locked into that particular research to keep my funding.  I am not sure if that is what I would want to dedicate my life to in grad school.

I realize this is a very long post, but I honestly have no idea what to do.  With my original grad school coming back to the table, I'm not sure if it is worth it to accept the limited research options to get a name on my CV.

So, my question is ""simple"".  Why did you choose the grad school that you did?"
2432z2,7,2014-04-27,Hi Highlanders! Possible Computer Engineering Grad Student here. Would love to hear your opinion!,MixedMetafive,ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/2432z2/hi_highlanders_possible_computer_engineering_grad/,"Hello! I'm currently a senior Computer Engineering undergraduate, and I'm looking to enter a MS Computer Engineering program starting this fall. I applied to UCR, and was delighted to find out that I've been accepted with a modest amount of funding (which I hope I'll be able to supplement with a TA position -- RA would also work but that's probably shooting too high). If you're familiar with the Computer Engineering department at UCR, or with the engineering graduate program, would you mind telling me your honest opinion of them?

A few more specific questions:

* Have you gotten along well with UCR engineering professors? Have your grad classes been useful?
* How are the research facilities? I'm going to be thesis-track, so I'll probably be spending a lot of time in the labs.
* Do I have a realistic chance of getting a TA job my first semester? Or perhaps later? Regarding qualifications, I have three semesters of experience as an undergraduate TA.
* How many quarters do most MS (thesis track) students take to finish the degree? How many publications would they typically have their name on upon graduation?
* What do MS students typically do during the summer quarter? Continue research/classes, or leave for an internship?
* Anything else that you think that I should know? Or in other words, anything that you wish you had known before coming to UCR?

243m3k,32,2014-04-27,Planning a Halo Total Conversion mod,_Nakamura,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/243m3k/planning_a_halo_total_conversion_mod/,"Original topic on Bnet: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/12675247492

Hello everyone,

I'd like to start off this topic by properly introducing myself, as I intend to lead a project with the goal of creation of a Halo mod for SC2. My name is Nakamura(as you can see), the project leader of the Age of Mythology: The titans Fan Patch, the Complex Enhanced mod for Homeworld 2 (and balancing associate of the Complex mod), and assisting developer of the Sins of the Prophets mod for Sins of a Solar empire. Some of these you may have heard of.

My focus as a mod developer is mainly in the design and balance area, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to programming, too. Currently I don't have much experience with the SC2 editor, but it seems less complicated than the naked code I'm used to working with - by the time the mod is bound to leave concept stages, I will have the necessary skills(and helping hands hopefully) to create the mod.

Recently I've played around with the thought of creating a Halo themed total conversion mod for Starcraft. This would basically create a huge opportunity to undo the damage that Ensemble Studios did to the Halo franchise when they released Halo Wars for the xbox.

Clearly Starcraft 2 is the best modern RTS out there, both when it comes to mechanics, accessibility to modding and the game itself (free arcade is HUGE for modders) along many, many positive features.

What I would like to do here is assembling a team that would be willing to carry through with this immense project.

But before that, I would like to share a list of main concepts that I wish to enforce on the mod in order to make it as professional as possible, and in order to satisfy you, the potential fans.

So the 10 point list is as follows: 

1) The mod will retain the main, non racial mechanics of Starcraft 2. Minerals, vespene gas, supply, main unit commands, unit energy for given abilities will all be in the game, as you are used to them.

2) Asymmetrical design and balance will not be taken to the extremes. All races will be able to deal with what is thrown at them, given proper preparation and execution. The goal is to keep the skill requirement to be near-equal between factions.

3) Units, with the exception of workers will not be able to shift into each other. This design decision provides battles on a larger scale, including multi-pronged skirmishes. It also effectively fights the much complained about ""deathball"" phenomena.

4)Each ability will require a certain type of mechanical skill to be used. Each ability will also have counters, either through moving units away from the effect, or setting up different, specific countermeasures (counter-spells, perhaps).

5) The mod will run on the ""normal"" speed. This will make newer players more easily get into the game, as the timer doesn't appear to be ""off"". The fast pace of SC2 will be achieved through unit stats, not through a time speed manipulation. If my information is correct, this taxes the hardware less, too.

6) The UNSC and Covenant will definitely be featured. Further factions will be up for internal discussion. The multiplayer aspect of the mod is not for storytelling. Sub-factions such as the insurrectionists, Covenant loyalists/separatists would only make the design clumped and overlapping. If we are to build a campaign, things like factions can be featured there, maybe.

7) No copyrighted material will be used - most assets will be created, but hopefully other mod teams will be lending us assets to speed up development.

8) The scale of the mod has no limits. If we can get popular enough, becoming an E-sport would be desirable, if legally applicable (such as DOTA did). Otherwise, community based events can go a long way, too.

9) The development team will consist of 4 departments: Designers/balancers, programmers, artists, and testers, who are going to be interns of the design/balance group mainly. It is recommended for each applicant to stick to only 1 department, as working in multiple can be quite tasking - just like with ""real jobs"".

10) Further into development, donations will be possible. These will be obviously greatly appreciated and spread out evenly for motivating the team. Donations may see use in cash tourneys as well, if legally applicable.

So these are the (very basic) concepts I would want a Starcraft based Halo RTS to have.
Please add me on the sc2 client (Nakamura #474), or join the ""Halo total conversion"" group, which is also on the client. A dedicated forum is in the making, but not completely ready yet.

If you wish to help out, you need to qualify to be in either of the following :
Programmer(works in the editor, codes stuff)
Artist(makes models, etc)
Designer/ Balancer(the creative mind behind the scenes/polishes design and unit stats)

Testers will be only needed when the mod is in alpha.

Share your thoughts on what you think should be in a Halo mod... and some name suggestions would be great, as I haven't managed to come up with any."

I'm an Electrical Engineering student from India. I'm in my pre-final year now, and I recently fell in love with Neuroscience. I started studying Ion-Channels using the Hodgkin-Huxley model, modeled the circuit on Python and had fun with it. I read Phantoms in the Brain by Dr. VS Ramachandran and it made me even more interested in this beautiful field.

But the problem is that I have a very low GPA (2.2 out of 4) and I'm finding it extremely hard to figure out what to do in order to get into research in this field. My college does not have a neuroscience department and I don't think any professor will give me an opportunity to work in their lab, given my lack of projects/experience in the field.

My question is what should I do now to nullify my bad grades? I know I need to start working, but I have no direction, no one to guide me. What should I read? What online courses should I take up? How do I get an internship or a Bachelor's Thesis in a Computational Neuroscience lab?

Can you guys give me some advice?

Thank you.

2443xe,5,2014-04-27,"Ladies please help me make an important life decision, I am so stuck and confused.",merlinspants7,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2443xe/ladies_please_help_me_make_an_important_life/,"Hi 2x. I have been recently faced with a life dilemma and I would really appreciate some help making a decision of where to go from here. It's kind of a confusing backstory but I'll try to make it as clear as possible.

-I graduated college last year with my BS in Biology, and I want to be a physician assistant. I haven't been successful in getting into school yet, but I don't feel super bad about it because I know it's extremely competitive and I'm short on patient contact hours (so this would be like EMTing, nurses aide, phlebotomy, something of the like)

-I'm from the Northeast but after graduating I moved down to Texas where my dad lives to get into a new environment and take some classes. I got my EMT certification but don't want to work as an EMT down here because I was exposed to some serious sexism and horrible comments in the class and clinicals. I liked it otherwise though.

-I don't like Texas, I've found it really hard to make friends, I'm not a fan of my dad's wife and her kids, and it's just generally a place I wouldn't want to live even if it weren't for those factors. Basically I'm miserable here.

-My boyfriend is back up north, we've been together for 8 years and our relationship has been mostly long distance due to being at different colleges and me being in Texas for the last year. We're sick of seeing each other every couple months and I think we're both ready to take the step to move in together, at least until I go back to school, but figuring out logistics is proving difficult.

-I just finished up a phlebotomy class down in Texas. I still need to do a 2-week clinical portion. However this instructor is horrible and nobody in the class has a clinical placement yet, there is no indication I'll get one any time soon, and even though I need it to finish up the class, I don't want to sit on my ass for the whole summer waiting for one. Basically by the time I submit my applications in August I want to be doing something new for patient contact and I don't think I'll be done with clinicals and working as a phlebotomist by that time no matter where I go.

-If I move in with my boyfriend there is an EMS company that takes volunteers. I've been talking to them and it sounds like it would be a good opportunity with mostly young people doing the same thing I'm trying to do, so in short a much more comfortable environment than doing it down where I am now.

-Problem is it's volunteer, so I'll need a job, and I've been applying to multiple jobs every single day for months only to hear nothing. I got a call from an office that does internships with pre-med students and also has some jobs that might count as patient contact, but they pretty much told me that they're excited to meet me and to call and come in when I move up, which sounds nice but I don't want to depend on it.

-My boyfriend is visiting me in two weeks. If I want to drive up with him from Texas it would be most efficient for him to just not take his return flight and drive up with me, since I can't drive 1400 miles by myself and this would be one of my only opportunities to get up there before he starts classes for the summer and stuff.

-If I go up there without a job and I'm just EMTing until I do get a job, my savings can last me for at least a few months and since my dad knows that I'm trying really hard to do what I need to do, he's offered to help me out a little bit, so I have some time to play with as far as getting employment

So being a very thorough and logistical individual I've come up with the following options, and I'm sure you guys will probably think of others:

-Stay in Texas, wait for my clinical assignment which might take an unknown amount of time, and be somewhere that I really don't like being, away from my boyfriend, but it's free. Get work as phlebotomist in Texas which might be easier to do but I probably won't be able to get a job before I submit applications in August after the process of clinicals, examinations, certification, etc. Not something I want to do but if I need to then whatever.

-Go up with my boyfriend after he visits in 2 weeks, start EMTing to rack up patient contact hours right away, have a small possibility of an internship, but no guarantee of a job and a few months in which I need to get one. Be happy to be out of Texas and finally with my boyfriend, closer to home, friends, family, etc. My dad brought up the possibility of flying down to Texas for two weeks when I finally do get a clinical assignment

-Wait around for clinicals here whilst doing nothing, deal with the pain in the ass process of finding a way to get up to where my boyfriend lives after I'm done, hate being here the whole time for what I really think will be just wasting idle time when I could be doing something else

-Other option as yet unthought of by me or others I've spoken to.

So. Thoughts? Advice? Comments? I am very frustrated and need to make a decision soon. I know there are probably ladies on here that are older, wiser, more experienced, and/or more intelligent than I am so I would LOVE to hear everyone's thoughts. "
244bcz,3,2014-04-27,"HELP! Me [25 M] with my crush [21 F] of 1-2 months, need courting advice",OldSoulWarmHeart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/244bcz/help_me_25_m_with_my_crush_21_f_of_12_months_need/,"Hello fellow redditors,

This is my first post ever. I have been monitoring and scouring the depths of /r/Relationships for the past 3.5 months for healing. Here's some background first:


**Background**

My ex [26F] and I broke up in December. The relationship lasted a little over 3.5 years. It was a toxic relationship. I have slight codependent tendencies, however her BPD (suspected, however the traits match) made things worse. I was gaslit like no tomorrow. It was absolute hell in the last 1.5 years of the relationship and to this day I have that strange gut feeling that she cheated, and more than once. More often than not the gut is right, but I was caught in her fog and gave her the benefit of the doubt more than I should have. 


There were many occasions where, according to what I've seen in similar posts on reddit, I should have left. But I didn't. The sad thing is, I never thought this would happen to me. Good looking guy, good attitude, street smart, graduate degree etc. Street smarts and a degree isn't enough. This can and WILL happen to anyone if you're not extra careful. Hindsight is 20/20


**Healing Process from Dec '13 - April '14**

I have sought help for the codependency. It really allowed me to gain some perspective and detach myself from my emotions momentarily to take a look at the big picture and understand where they are coming from. 


Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sensitive guy. I just cater to people too much. It also doesn't help that it's a part of my culture to be super accommodating to people, regardless of whether or not they're friends or acquaintances. I've learned to lay off of it and be more selective with who I trust and give my all to. I learned my lesson the hard way, but at least I learned it before it was too late (marriage, kids, divorce, custody battle, split assets etc).


I also started picking up all the old things I used to do before I got into the relationship with my ex. I started reading books again: I've read 5 within the last 2 months. Done a lot of soul searching too in the process. I started skateboarding again, which I set aside 6 years ago. Art was a huge passion of mine during the earlier parts of my life, however I've picked that up again and started doing some sketches. 


I used to be heavy into music production, and just started a DIY project and am currently transforming my room into a recording studio. Things are going pretty great. Oh and also, going to the gym EVERY MORNING which I never did to that extent. Upgraded my wardrobe and going for the smart-casual / semi-casual look. New hair-cut etc etc. Needless to say, people have taken notice and I've made a lot of new friends recently. 


Above all, the thing that ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED ME yet accelerated my healing process was how fast my ex-gf moved on. She started dating her current boyfriend 3 weeks after we broke up. She had the nerve to tell me back in January that she loved me up until the very last day. Also that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend, it just worked out that way. If you ever met my ex, you would think ""okay there buddy we really do believe"". 


Since the break-up, I hear things aren't going super amazing with her new boyfriend. It seems to be a pattern she has in every relationship: instant idolization and then she paints you black when you can't meet one small expectation. I feel she's the common denominator. Either way, her behaviour post-breakup has helped me tremendously. She cut me off of all social media after we broke up. She blocks and unblocks me from FB and Whatsapp a few times a month for whatever twisted reason she has. 


We used to attend a lot of parties together, and I made a lot of friends and acquaintances through her extended network. Some of them I still have contact with. Others that were either her own close female friends, or boyfriends of those girls, have cut me off as well. However I have since become closer to some of the people, girls especially, that I treated as acquaintances and chose to ignore to a certain extent at parties out of respect for my ex-girlfriend.


Funny thing is, I hear my ex is FURIOUS. She is getting people to do investigative work and determine whether or not I'm dating any of these girls I'm talking to. It's really sad and pathetic. She's trying to get her friends to ask them to stop talking to me. They aren't having any of it and told her that they like me and get along with me and they owe her nothing. Clearly, this isn't how a 26 year old should be acting.


**Fast-forward to Today**
*Thank you for being patient up to now*

So as you all can tell from above, I got my swagger back *Jay-Z meme*. I'm confident again, and back to being social. I'm regaining the 15lbs I lost over the course of 3 weeks due to my breakup. I successfully defended my Masters. I'm involved in organizations related to my career. Landed an internship. Doing more research. Things are looking up in my social and professional life. I'm very happy Reddit.


There's a girl [21 F] that I used to see at some of the parties with my ex. In the last 1-2 months, her and I have gotten closer. She's attractive; definitely my type of girl. She seems like a happy person and has a joie de vivre. I saw her again at an event post-breakup, and she added me to all forms of social media. We've been interacting through there. Yea, not as good as in person. That's why I'm here. While I'm over my ex and confident again, I am nervous.


Her and I have the same taste in music. We get along well. She also enjoys reading, and sketches too. She's smart and just finished her undergrad last week. We have this little thing (huge giveaway here goddamnit hoping she isn't on reddit) where we take screenshots of the current song we're listening to and send it to each other with a caption. This has been going on for 2 weeks now. And it's in the middle of the night (11pm-1am zone, sometimes later). Judging by how fast the responses are, I can only assume that she is only talking to me. She seems to be interested in her interactions, sending me songs with ""hinting"" titles (Missing You, All of Me, etc)


So reddit, this is where you come in. Again, I'm nervous. I already told her last week that we should meet up when her exams are done. She said sure thing. Well, her exams are done. I want to take her out. Asking isn't the issue. It's where to take her. How to behave when I'm there. Like I said, I'm cool and level-headed atm but this is my first BIG CRUSH in a LONG TIME. Legit crush here reddit homies. I don't want to fack this up. Need your advices


Thank you for reading through this, I love you all.

SO JUST WALKED ALONG, THINKING THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE NOW, WHEN THE SKY TURNED RED FOR SOME REASON.

THEN I FOUND A YARD SALE THAT WAS SELLING GAMES. I FOUND A POKEMON ONE THAT WAS JUST A BLANK CARTIRAGE WITH POKEMON WRITTEN ON IT IN MARKER. I SAID ""I'LL TAKE IT.""

SO I DID AND THAT CREEPY GIRL WAS THERE AGAIN, NOT DISEMBOWELED FOR SOME REASON. I PATTED HER ON THE HEAD, THEN WENT BACK TO THE GAME. I DECIDED TO TAKE A BREAK (BUT I COULDN'T TURN THE GAME OFF, WTF?) WHEN I FOUND SOMEONE PM'ED ME THIS THING THAT I COULD HACK THE GAME WITH,

SO I DID WITHOUT QUESTIONING ANYTHING. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WOULD DO. THEN CHARACTERS STARTED TELLING ME TO TURN BACK, TURN OFF THE GAME, AND TO NOT GO TO LAVENDAR TOWN, BUT I SAID ""FUCK THAT SHIT"" AND WENT THERE ANYWAYS. I WALKED UP TO SOME KID AND TALKED TO HIM. HE SAID ""BEN DROWNED"" I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THAT MEANS, BUT WHATEVER. SO I LEFT LAVENDAR TOWN BECAUSE THE MUSIC MADE ME WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE. SOMEONE SAW ME, THEN I FROZE. HE WALKED UP TO ME AND SAID HE WANTED TO FIGHT. BUT WE DIDN'T FIGHT. THESE WEIRD MUTATED CREATURES DID. MINE ONE, AND HIS SUNK INTO THE GROUND. THEN I STOLE HIS MONEY, AND THEN ROBLOX. THEN THE GAME DELETED ITSELF, AND I COULDN'T GET IT BACK. NOW THAT THAT WAS OVER, I DECIDED TO WATCH TV. BUT BEFORE THAT, I WENT BACK ON THE COMPUTER, AND A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS ALSO AN INTERN AT NICKOLODEN LIKE ME HAD SENT ME A WEIRD FILE. IT WAS CALLED ""SUPERSUICIDESPONGEMOUSE.AVI"" USING MY L33T SKILLS AND ""FAGGOT.EXE"", I GOT THE FILE ON MY TV AND WATCHED IT. IT WAS A LOST EPISODE OF SPONGEBOB SQUARPANTS AND IT WAS CALLED ""GOODBYE (INSERT MY NAME) SQUAREPANTS, WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO THEN THERE WAS ALL THIS VIOLENCE AND BLOOD AND SHIT, INCLUDING A SOVIET GULAG. THEN THE CREEPY LITTLE GIRL COMMITED SUICIDE, AND I FOUND OUT THAT A LOT OF CHILDREN COMMITED SUICIDE WHEN THEY WATCHED IT. THEN THE SKELTON POPPED OUT AGAIN AND KILLED ME. THE END.

244f9c,3,2014-04-27,"Questions about student internships: Is job shadowing the same thing? Does a combo of volunteering and free-lancing still count as good experience, or are internships necessary?",dragonscampfire,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/244f9c/questions_about_student_internships_is_job/,"I am studying PR and Marketing in Canada.  I am  29, and decided to go back to school for a career change.  I will graduate next April.  The economy is a bit better here, than in the states, but I kind of have a fear of unemployment.  I hope to have an entry level job in my field upon graduation, and then I can use that  experience to obtain a job in Toronto, where all of the PR/Marketing jobs are found.



Do I need an internship after graduation?  My school only offers to set you up with an internship if you have the highest marks in the class.   Is it possible to find one's own internship?  IF so, how exactly?  I don't have classes every single day, so maybe I could do a part time internship during the school year? Is that a thing that people do?   Will I be screwed if I don't have an internship?  What about job shadowing.  Is that the same thing?  




Also, since employers are simply looking for experience (hence internships), can't I replace an internship with a combo of volunteer work?  I already sit on two non-profit boards on a Marketing advisory committee, and a community relations committee.  I also plan to do some free lance work  with a class mate, and to volunteer as much as possible in my field of study throughout the school year.  



Also, I want to start a group on Meetup.com for my own interest, to show that I am a 'self starter', and to get experience in corporate sponsorship (many groups on meetup.com have them).   I will be doing lots and lots of informational interviews with people working in my field of study, as well as going to lots of networking events.  Of course I have a blog and am active on social media.   You would think that after all of that, someone would throw me a job.  Who can tell though ?!  :/



Will all of these things give me enough experience, if I cannot find an internship, or do I NEED an internship?  Of course I would rather be working than interning immediately after I graduate, and am prepared to do the work necessary to reach that goal.  



What do you think? Opinions/advice/comments?"
244nn1,0,2014-04-27,Why UNC is a good school for Hope,musingsontap,PKA,https://www.reddit.com/r/PKA/comments/244nn1/why_unc_is_a_good_school_for_hope/,"First I must admit I have some bias, since I graduated from there. So I will present my case subjectively. Fuck Dook.  

UNC-Chapel Hill is a great school, because it offers a wide array of disciplines, and offers them well. It has a competitive business school, journalism school, nursing school, and other such professional schools. In addition, their Comp-Sci program offers a ton of hands on opportunities..including robotics and an internship class where you work with real businesses.  

Astronomy/Physics is pretty amazing too. In my 101 class I was able to set up telescopes in Chile to take pictures of Saturn's rings. It was crazy. In 102 I learned about dark matter and the different theories of Universal expansion.  

They have a first class study-abroad program that'll open doors to most parts of the world. Live in someone's home in Spain for a semester, or venture out to Australia or Hong Kong.

Their Bio/Chemistry departments are pretty great too and will prepare you pretty well for any discipline you wish to undertake after undergrad...   

Except Engineering. Arguably if Hope wants to pursue Engineering she should go to NC State.  

Enough about academics.  

UNC is so freaking gorgeous, it has such a beautiful campus with tons of history. It is large, but not huge. You can get lost in the crowds if you please, but you can have your small community feel if you seek it.  

It has a pretty phenomenal athletics program. So many D1 teams that offer all sorts of entertainment and engagement, from Football, Soccer, Basketball (Obviously), to the more obscure such as swimming/diving, lacrosse, volleyball and fencing- where the Tar Heels represented at the National Championships. They also have a club team for almost everything else too including Ultimate Frisbee.  And duh basketball games are freaking exciting to go to, the energy levels in the Dean Dome are incredible to experience. Did I mention, fuck Dook?  

In addition, while I lived there I was able to work three part time jobs, and they were all super flexible with my schedule always putting school first. I lived in the dorms all four years and it felt like I was ensconced in a tucked away college away from the ""real world"". The campus is its own part of Chapel Hill away from busy businesses, other schools, or dense residential communities. It truly is magical. Oh, also the bus system is Chapel Hill is fantastic! It is free, and offers routes to almost any part of Chapel Hill you'd want to go. Live on South Campus? Hop on the RU and get to class right on time. Having a night out? Hop on the P2P (point to point) for a safe and fun night. Want to go to Southpoint and watch a movie? Pay $2 and get on the Triangle Transit and hang out there all day.  

It has amazing in-dorm tech support (that was me). Vast libraries. Awesome spacious quads to skip class and sleep under the sun..ahem.. I mean eat lunch. The dining halls..well they're trying to renovate them I really do hope they improve by the time Hope gets there. But Franklin St. .5 miles away has all the cuisine you can possibly desire.  

Finally, it is a very practical school for Hope to go to. North Carolina has great in-state tuition for the public schools. 1 year here is the equivalent of about 1/4 year at Duke in tuition. Also,  Durham is ghetto. Leave the campus and you get mugged. Even walking around at night feels like someone's going to jump out from around a tree at you. It is very close to home, less than an hour so she can see family often and do laundry. Lastly, especially in NC, but in other parts of the US too, UNC is very well recognized name giving it plenty of value on a resume.  "
244ujj,9,2014-04-27,Planning a Halo Total Conversion mod,_Nakamura,halo,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/244ujj/planning_a_halo_total_conversion_mod/,"Original topic on Bnet: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/12675247492

Hello everyone,

I'd like to start off this topic by properly introducing myself, as I intend to lead a project with the goal of creation of a Halo mod for SC2. My name is Nakamura(as you can see), the project leader of the Age of Mythology: The titans Fan Patch, the Complex Enhanced mod for Homeworld 2 (and balancing associate of the Complex mod), and assisting developer of the Sins of the Prophets mod for Sins of a Solar empire. Some of these you may have heard of.

My focus as a mod developer is mainly in the design and balance area, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to programming, too. Currently I don't have much experience with the SC2 editor, but it seems less complicated than the naked code I'm used to working with - by the time the mod is bound to leave concept stages, I will have the necessary skills(and helping hands hopefully) to create the mod.

Recently I've played around with the thought of creating a Halo themed total conversion mod for Starcraft. This would basically create a huge opportunity to undo the damage that Ensemble Studios did to the Halo franchise when they released Halo Wars for the xbox.

Clearly Starcraft 2 is the best modern RTS out there, both when it comes to mechanics, accessibility to modding and the game itself (free arcade is HUGE for modders) along many, many positive features.

What I would like to do here is assembling a team that would be willing to carry through with this immense project.

But before that, I would like to share a list of main concepts that I wish to enforce on the mod in order to make it as professional as possible, and in order to satisfy you, the potential fans.

So the 10 point list is as follows:

1) The mod will retain the main, non racial mechanics of Starcraft 2. Minerals, vespene gas, supply, main unit commands, unit energy for given abilities will all be in the game, as you are used to them.

2) Asymmetrical design and balance will not be taken to the extremes. All races will be able to deal with what is thrown at them, given proper preparation and execution. The goal is to keep the skill requirement to be near-equal between factions.

3) Units, with the exception of workers will not be able to shift into each other. This design decision provides battles on a larger scale, including multi-pronged skirmishes. It also effectively fights the much complained about ""deathball"" phenomena.

4)Each ability will require a certain type of mechanical skill to be used. Each ability will also have counters, either through moving units away from the effect, or setting up different, specific countermeasures (counter-spells, perhaps).

5) The mod will run on the ""normal"" speed. This will make newer players more easily get into the game, as the timer doesn't appear to be ""off"". The fast pace of SC2 will be achieved through unit stats, not through a time speed manipulation. If my information is correct, this taxes the hardware less, too.

6) The UNSC and Covenant will definitely be featured. Further factions will be up for internal discussion. The multiplayer aspect of the mod is not for storytelling. Sub-factions such as the insurrectionists, Covenant loyalists/separatists would only make the design clumped and overlapping. If we are to build a campaign, things like factions can be featured there, maybe.

7) No copyrighted material will be used - most assets will be created, but hopefully other mod teams will be lending us assets to speed up development.

8) The scale of the mod has no limits. If we can get popular enough, becoming an E-sport would be desirable, if legally applicable (such as DOTA did). Otherwise, community based events can go a long way, too.

9) The development team will consist of 4 departments: Designers/balancers, programmers, artists, and testers, who are going to be interns of the design/balance group mainly. It is recommended for each applicant to stick to only 1 department, as working in multiple can be quite tasking - just like with ""real jobs"".

10) Further into development, donations will be possible. These will be obviously greatly appreciated and spread out evenly for motivating the team. Donations may see use in cash tourneys as well, if legally applicable.

So these are the (very basic) concepts I would want a Starcraft based Halo RTS to have. Please add me on the sc2 client on AM servers (Nakamura #474), or join the ""Halo total conversion"" group, which is also on the client. A dedicated forum is in the making, but not completely ready yet.

If you wish to help out, you need to qualify to be in either of the following : Programmer(works in the editor, codes stuff) Artist(makes models, etc) Designer/ Balancer(the creative mind behind the scenes/polishes design and unit stats)

Testers will be only needed when the mod is in alpha.

Share your thoughts on what you think should be in a Halo mod... and some name suggestions would be great, as I haven't managed to come up with any."

I attend school in upstate New York and it definitely gets very cold in Winter. Currently I live on campus and pay about $8000 a semester (it's ridiculous, I know), hence I am looking to potentially buy White Cargo Van and custom build the inside to live in. 

I guess I'm looking for a bit of advice on a few things. Most importantly, how do I convince my parents this is a viable option. They seem to think it is an awful idea and I'll turn into a ""hippie"". Second, I am majoring in a computer intensive major and am wondering if anyone has any experience powering a laptop and monitor with solar panels (How much would this cost). Also, after college, and this summer/fall I have a paid internship. Is it possible to hold a professional job while living out of a van?

TL;DR; College kid looking to move into a Van and eventually hold professional job looking for advice.

Thanks for the advice in advance."

I'm heading out to California this summer for an internship. I'm from Oklahoma and from what I can tell, we are the last state to get any unique or rare bourbons (one store hasn't seen Pappy in 15 years).

- EH Taylor Single Barrel
- Knob Creek Small Batch 9 YO

- Breckenridge

- Woodford Double Oak
- 4R Single Barrel &amp; Small Batch

I really would like to stay friends with her, but not sure what the best way to go about it would be.",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/245s9i/true_to_my_17yearold_kid_form_i_have_a_crush_on_a/,"Met the girl I'll call Sally a couple years ago, really hit it off with her and loved talking to her, then started to develop feelings for her.  Around the same time we both meet a guy known in this thread as Dave, and the three of us are pretty close.  Dave's had a rough life, struggles with a couple different problems, and clearly has a crush on Sally.  Not wanting to cause any problems, I keep my mouth shut about my feelings.

I notice they start getting distant from each-other, and I start talking to Sally more than Dave.  She explains that he confessed he had strong feelings for her, and while she liked him it wasn't fully reciprocated.  She's also not really looking for a relationship, she's got a full schedule with plenty of credits, a job, and an internship.  However, Dave sees it as her choosing me over him even though nothing has even come close to happening between us, and is just stressing Sally out.

When I talk to Dave he hasn't changed at all, doesn't show any signs of hostility or jealousy towards me and though we don't hang out as much, nothing's really different than it was before.  

Everything for the most part is fine, except that Sally has been basically ignoring me whenever Dave's around, which obviously makes me feel horrible.  Not that big of a deal, except I think she's realized that I'm crushing on her and now is more stand-offish like she's trying not to lead me on.  I'm not really looking to win her over or anything because I understand her situation and frankly I just don't want to cause more problems when she's already stressed out with how busy she is.  

I'm looking for a solution to this.  I searched through this subreddit looking for similar questions and the main answers I saw were basically ""wait it out"" and that it happens to everyone at this age.  I get that, but I'm also wondering if simply being more transparent about everything would help.  

Would opening up to Sally and letting her know that she doesn't have to worry about leading me on be a good idea?  Do I talk to Dave about the situation and make sure he understands that it's not about him or me but it's Sally that just has too much going on and doesn't want any kind of relationship?  I'd really rather not just break off contact with either of them, and to be honest it's not really an option.  Any kind of advice would be appreciated.

**TL;DR Bro and I interested in a mutual friend, starting to ruin the friendship between the three of us**

Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented, ironically I think I will end up waiting for a bit before I decide whether I'll bring it up with them or distance myself a bit.  Even though I'm not doing anything right away, I feel more confident about the situation now that I have a better idea of my options.  I'm glad I didn't throw another teenage relationship question at this subreddit for nothing.  Really appreciate all the advice."

Everything for the most part have been good and despite being in different colleges, we are still together. However, I constantly feel like I'm the one putting all the efforts into the relationship and I feel like that's the case because it's expected of me. For example, last month, we were Skyping and she kept saying how much she missed me. So I visited her during my Spring Break even though that meant missing work and spending time with my friends. But if I ever were to ask her to do the same for me, I know that she'll tell me she'll try, but always find an excuse not to. This summer, she was going to apply for an internship here in my hometown because she used to live here and knew people around. But today, I just found out that she never even applied to work here. When I confronted her about it, she said that she didn't do so because of reasons she doesn't want to talk about (which I respect), but the part I feel bummed out about is that she wasn't as excited to spend time together as I was for the summer. She then mentioned it's her life and that it was none of my business to control her academic life. I guess in the end, the difference between us is that we react differently to bad news, such as if I ever offend her, she would say too bad and if she ever offends me, I would try to defend myself. 

Well, I am also clinically depressed and have anxiety, so I was wondering if I was overreacting or being too attached? 

I feel like I left out a lot of details, so if you have any questions let me know."

I'm a 20yo girl and I'll be studying in Shanghai from April to July 2015 (will be 21 by then). After that, I'll have finished my degree and that's why I'd like to take some time to travel in SE/E Asia.

I would love some advice on my itinerary, on the travelling itself, etc. Since I still have a year to plan all that, I am open to other suggestions too, as long as they aren't too expensive!

So:

-I have a pretty tight budget once I'm there, but my parents agreed to help me do the journey preparation: vaccines, visas, etc. and part of the accommodation and plane/train/bus/etc. expenses

-I am a girl traveling alone

-I don't speak any Asian language (but I'll have studied Chinese for 3 months and lived in China during the same time), but I speak fluent English. I'm French.

-I don't have that much time, since I won't have much money and will need to come back to France and find a job

-I'll be carrying all my stuff from the 3 months in Shanghai, which means I probably won't have very appropriate gear and my backpack will be pretty heavy (I will try to let go as much stuff as I can before leaving, but my 19"" computer will be coming with me, for example.)

-I love museums and cultural visits, I like eating cool stuff

-I need advice on my itinerary and my way of traveling (couchsurfing, hostel, more high-end hotel?)

246as9,0,2014-04-28,When will I [fucking] learn.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/246as9/when_will_i_fucking_learn/,"You would think I would have learned when I damaged my car and had to pay $1000 dollars to repair it,  and got away without getting a DUI.

You would think I would have learned when not two months later I backed up into a pole and dented my trunk, because I was drunk.

I hope I'll learn after this weekend. 

I wasn't supposed to drive. I gave my friend my keys at the beginning of the night. But I don't know what goes through my mind when I drink. I managed to get my keys back and drive. And this time, although I don't remember it, I somehow managed to get my car stuck on the railroad tracks. The cops came and my car had to get towed. I spent the night in jail for the first time. I got a ticket for public intoxication and another for interference with railroad property.

I had my whole summer ahead of me,  an internship with an organization I had been hoping to work with since last summer in a beautiful location, money saved up to support me and allow me to travel.

And it all went away in one night. 

I don't blame anyone but myself and I know there's no point in moping about it - all I can do is accept the responsibilities and learn from it. 
But it absolutely sucks and I hate myself for it. Everything I had worked for is gone.
My friends keep telling my they're glad no one got hurt, but that phrase should never have to be said in the first place. 

Im a pretty rational guy sober,  but I have no clue what the hell goes on in my mind when I'm drunk. 

Which is why I've decided to stop drinking for a while. Lately all its gotten me is into destructive tendencies, and that has to stop. 
I really hope I've learned my lesson this time, I hope I can prove this through my future actions. 

Thanks for listening."

246q7t,2,2014-04-28,"I know it can't be too late, but it sure feels like it. Help me live my dream?",dabears554,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/246q7t/i_know_it_cant_be_too_late_but_it_sure_feels_like/,"I've never been struck with the idea of what I'd like to do for a career.

Currently, I'm about to finish my junior year of college at a highly ranked school in the Midwestern US. I came into freshman year undecided in my major. I thought about pre-med, but quickly realized I'm too squeamish. I also took an advertising class, which I loved. I've always enjoyed advertising as a consumer, and I enjoy expressing myself creatively. Then I found out about how difficult it is to secure a solid job in the industry, and how long the hours are and how low the pay is once you get there. The end of my freshman year was the only time I'd be allowed to apply to the business school, so I did, and was accepted as a marketing major. I chose marketing because it's similar to advertising in many ways. It didn't take long for me to figure out that marketing was kind of a BS major and I wasn't really learning any technical skills. I got an e-mail about the supply chain management major within business. It promoted 100% job placement and the highest starting salary of any business major at the school. This was enough for me and I jumped on.

I don't hate the material, in fact, I find it rather interesting for the most part. For the last couple months, however, I've been thinking a lot about whether or not I can see myself in this field, or any business environment, for the rest of my life. The answer I keep coming back to is no, but I could never figure out where it is I would like to be.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I went to go visit another school for a campus-wide party/celebration. I found myself talking to a girl and found out she's an atmospheric sciences major. She expressed jealousy about how highly ranked the same program is at my school. I asked her about what she studies and it started to dawn on me that this might be the calling I've been looking for. Ever since I was little I've been fascinated by weather. In elementary school I would sometimes spend hours watching the Weather Channel. Whenever it stormed I would stand in the garage to watch lightning. In junior high I took an economics class and was asked by my teacher what I wanted my profession to be (just to give an example starting salary for an activity.) This was the first time I ever had to name a realistic profession (not a football player or something like that) and I spouted out ""meteorologist."" All of these memories came racing back to me converging into a ""holy shit"" moment. ""Holy shit: I want to be an atmospheric sciences major.""

As this thought swirled in my head, I began realizing the actual value to it. With climate change being an issue that will continue to grow, and WILL have an impact on the survival of the human race, this could actually be a field where I could make a meaningful difference. I was never going to revolutionize the way companies order raw materials, but what if I made a breakthrough discovery to help maintain our planet? My first thought while re-reading those last couple sentences is that I'm getting carried away. My second though was THAT'S THE POINT! I've never been as excited about business as I am right now thinking about the possibilities, however unlikely they might be, within atmospheric sciences. It's the first time I've ever had a fantasy about a career that could be a reality.

Here's where that reality escapes me. I'm 2 semesters away from graduating. My supply chain major requires me to have an internship before senior year, so I have one lined up and I'll be working full time in that field this summer. I've already racked up tons of student loans. All of this is in play, and all I want to do is start over. I want to begin all over again as an atmospheric sciences major, but I've invested incredible amounts of time and money into a pair of business degrees.

What are my options here? What can I do? What can I do to avoid working a passionless job for the next 40 years?

TL;DR Met a girl studying weather and realized I've been in the wrong major for 3 years. Want to start over but have invested enormous loads of time and money. Looking for options."
2470q9,7,2014-04-28,"(Spoilers All) Mirror, Mirror on The Wall - A theory on the Night's King and his Bride",OneRedBeard,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2470q9/spoilers_all_mirror_mirror_on_the_wall_a_theory/,"History repeats itself. 

This is not only true for the world we live in, it is also a main motif in A Song of Ice and Fire.

&gt; *“It all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.”*

Today, the way we look at the most ancient history of Westeros has to change. We now know that the Others can turn humans into Others; and that there is an entity north of the wall, that is – at least by the HBO intern charged with synopses – called The Night’s King.

What we know of this entity can be gathered from the story Old Nan told to Bran:

&gt; *The legends say that the Night's King was a warrior without fear, and when he saw a woman atop the Wall with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars, he chased her and loved her though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well. He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years he ruled until finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden.*

&gt; *Some say the Night's King was a Bolton, or a Magnar out of Skagos, others say he was an Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Others still say he was a Woodfoot, who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came, but others still say he was a Stark who was brother to the man who brought him down.*

&gt; (ASOS Chapter 56)

My theory builds on the idea that the wall was never build to guard the realms of men against the Others in the first place. This has been discussed multiple times on this subreddit and elsewhere. After all, a magical ice wall does not appear effective for the repelling of magical ice creatures. Rather, what if it was a demarcation line? There once might have been a great civilization of ice creatures in the area now known as Beyond The Wall. They would have been creatures of a god of ice, as the Children of the Forest were creatures of the gods of nature. Such a god of ice is mentioned as The Great Other by Melisandre.

When the first men came out of the plains of Essos, they appear to have threatened the native inhabitants of Westeros with extinction. The Children of the Forest shattered both Stepstones and Neck to hold their progress, in vain. When the First Men finally came to the Haunted Forest and the Frostfangs, and the Others were facing the same fate as the Children of the Forest before them, what did they do? Had their god more power than the intangible Old Gods of the Children? If he indeed is a counterpart to R’hllor, the answer could well be yes. So they prayed to their god for their life, and The Great Other listened. He brought a catastrophic winter upon Westeros, and a night that lasted for a generation. The Others had halted the approach of the First Men by literally freezing it in place.

So, a peace was brokered between the Others and the First Men. Possibly between an emissary of The Great Other and one of the leaders of the First Men – A man with the name Brandon Stark. He built the peace that saved both sides from extinction, and was thus known by the name “The Builder”. To mark the demarcation line between both realms, the realms of men and the realms of winter, the Others built a wall of ice along the newly established border. They would stay north of it, and the First Men would stop their push of settlements.

And what to do with those men that had already settled north of the new border? Showing grace, the Others might have even allowed them to stay. They would have to promise to behave, and maybe cement their promise by sending some of their children to the Others as a token of their fealty, as squires, or wards, or hostages, name it as you will. It might even have been an honor for their families, back then.

How the wall was exactly guarded and manned, is still shrouded in mystery. We know that the 13th Lord Commander was a human. Of the first twelve, we know nothing. Maybe they were Others? Maybe they were Men? Maybe the wall at first was guarded by both sides, and the Lord Commandership alternated? Who knows. What we know is, that the 13th Lord Commander took an Other as his wife.

Now, how did that happen?

We know that he found her and chased her and brought her to the Nightford. That sounds suspicious – doesn’t it? A southern conqueror who used the unwitting trust of Northern lords to steal his bride and carry her away? What if the Night’s King stole his bride from the Others, as Rhaegar stole Lyanna from the Starks, 8000 years later?

Such a deed would undoubtedly have endangered the whole peace treaty with the Others, as Rhaegar’s deed destroyed the peace that Torrhen Stark had made with Aegon the Dragon. What if the Others took vengeance, and cast the continent into icy devastation again? Those men that were most endangered by this possibility – The North and The Men Beyond The Wall - gathered their strength and marched against the Nightford. And as Rhaegar fell, the Night’s King fell.

We do not know what happened to his Queen. We do not even know for sure what happened to himself, even though the show’s vignette narrated by Ygritte tells with some certainty that he was slain. Interesting – if he was slain, then who is the Night’s King that we saw in this last episode?

His son. We know that not only did he give his soul to her, but also his seed. This is too specific to only be a word for lust. She gave him a son. A bastard, born of the blood of Northern natives and Southern invaders. After the Nightford had fallen, that son would have been given back to the Others – and might today be still alive, in the Lands of Always Winter.

How interesting would it be, if the one bastard brokered a new peace with the other.

TL;DR: The Night's King got his bride the same way Rhaegar got Lyanna, endangering a peace treaty that is symbolized by The Wall and fathering a bastard son. 

stillTL;DR: NK + NQ = NK²"

247i6k,62,2014-04-28,Birth story: Ramona born March 2nd,buzzdoit,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/247i6k/birth_story_ramona_born_march_2nd/,"I obsessively read birth stories before my daughter was born so I thought I would ""give back"" by posting mine in case others are the same!

I woke up at 5am with contractions on March 2nd.  I’d been having “prelabor” contractions for about 2 weeks that felt like mild menstrual cramps.  I had wondered if I would know when the real contractions started.  And there was no comparison,I could definitely feel the difference!  They started at 6.5 minutes apart and were very light; I was able to doze in between.
 
About an hour later, I found it difficult to sleep so I got up and took a shower.  Around 8am, I timed them again and they were 4.5 minutes apart.  I decided to wake up my husband and we called L&amp;D.  They said to come in and get checked out.  The hospital was about 15 minutes away and although I could tell the contractions were getting stronger they were still doable.  

I got to triage at the hospital and I was only 2cm dilated but the contractions were getting much stronger and were now only 1-2 minutes apart.  Also the baby’s heart rate was not reacting well to the contractions so they decided to admit me.  I would have continual fetal monitoring throughout labor because of that.  

My husband and I went to labor and delivery room where I labored through the contractions for about four hours.  I did not handle them well.  I had to lay on my left side for the fetal monitoring and I basically was curled up in a whimpering ball.  They were so strong and coming so quickly.  It was also more than just the pain.  There was a surreal feeling and I felt like I was going in and out of reality.  Sorry to scare anyone but I was not prepared for that!  The contractions were not bearable so I decided to get an epidural.  

As a sidenote: I didn’t take any natural birthing classes or anything and the hospital I delivered at has a 80% epidural rate.  It wasn’t important to me to have a drug-free birth. But I think that if it was and I had prepared more and delivered in an environment supportive of drug free births then I could have done it.  Before the epidural, the nurses and doctors were just kinda standing around me and staring.  I’m sure at a clinic with staff training in non-drug pain relief it would have been different.  Just a comment for those planning on a non-drug birth!

Getting the epidural put in while dealing with contractions is no joke.  They also had an intern do it which is fine – it is a teaching hospital.  But she did have a lot of trouble getting it in.  I was breathing so fast that I started to black out and they laid me on my side.  Fortunately the resident took over and he got it in quickly.  I LOVE EPIDURALS!  The relief was immediate and I felt like a human again.  I told the nurses that everyone should have an epidural even if they aren’t giving birth!  After the epidural was in, they checked me and I was 7cm dilated.  I went from 2 to 7cm in four hours!  Probably why the contractions were so strong.  

One of the risks of epidurals is that it does stall labor.  The doctors actually told me that before putting it in and sure enough I stayed at 7cm dilated for the next six hours.  But during that time, I napped and relaxed.  Later that evening, the doctor gave me Pitocin to speed up the process and broke my waters.  Finally it was time to push.  

Pushing is exhausting although there was little pain because of the epidural.  And it’s also difficult to know where to push.  It took me a while to get the hang of it.  Another side effect of the epidural is that I didn’t feel an overwhelming urge to push.  I knew I had to push because I could feel a contraction coming but I didn’t get that urge that some women get.  Just an interesting observation!

I pushed for a while and finally the doctor could feel her head and she was sunny side up.  It’s weird because I got an ultrasound two weeks before and she was in the right position so babies can definitely move!  And also another reason why the contractions may have been so strong.  

After pushing for two and half hours, she finally came out!  No forceps and no tearing!  Because she hung out in my birth canal so long she did have a lot of mucous in her lungs and had to have some help breathing but she was able to clear it quickly.  Her apgar went from six to eight in five minutes.  My husband cut the cord and even guessed her birth weight to the exact ounce!  I had a very quick recovery and almost felt 100% within the week after she was born. 

Ramona was born at 11:37pm on March 2nd, twenty minutes before my birthday!  She was 8lbs 7oz and 20 inches long at birth. 

So there you go, postpartum is a story for another day but here’s her cute little face now!

247k8t,49,2014-04-28,The Sorrow of Sir Mike: A Neckbeard Origin Story (Part 1),wikifido,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/247k8t/the_sorrow_of_sir_mike_a_neckbeard_origin_story/,"**PART 1**

Through reading this subreddit I found myself torn about posting a story from my own life about one of my friends. I like to think he’s not that bad of a guy, I've known him since 2005 and I’m slowly coming to realize that he is one of the people that this subreddit is focused on, a neckbeard. 

As this realization came to fruition I began to look at myself and say “Is it me too, am I one of them?” I meet many of the “classic” criteria, such as being a comic reader, enjoying DnD, playing video games *(Assassins Creed being the favorite)*, an atheist, a libertarian, environmentally induced asthma and sleep apnea, work in IT, and a terrible past history with social interactions *(it was in middle school to be fair)*. 

Fortunately I am not overweight, 6’ 4” and 240lbs and 24 years old. I have a decently successful career as a Cyber Security Analyst, and US Army Soldier. I work out at a Crossfit gym 5 days a week, enjoy hiking, and running obstacles races. I have never owned a fedora and I have a great girlfriend of 2 years.

So personally *(and I know many here agree)*, I don’t think that neckbeards are defined by their interests, medical conditions, or attire. They are more defined by the way they interact in personal and professional situations with a sense of entitlement that often seems so out of place with their appearance and demeanor. 

This story is the 9 year process of my realization that one of my best friends is a neckbeard, and my attempt to grasp if he was always a neckbeard…or transformed into one by a controlling ex.

This story, as much mine as it is Mike’s, begins in 2005 when we first met. It was the first day of 9th grade and it was my first day in a new school. I had made a switch because of bullying issues at my old school, in short I arrived as the new kid in the middle of 6th grade after my father retired from the military and I was plunged into a terrible socially awkward state by being the way too tall gangly new guy. 
 
I finally convinced my parents to let me change to a local charter school which functioned as an ‘Island of Unwanted Toys’ for schools in the area, a meeting ground for the socially awkward. My first day had already been pretty awkward, getting shown around by some red headed girl who a year earlier had gotten way too deep into my personal space, and didn't even remember who I was.

We finally got to my first class and I was turned over to Mike. It was a relief to be away from the ‘personal space invader’ *(seriously people…arms length)* Mike seemed like a great guy he was outgoing, knew everyone’s name, and was fun to be around. After my train wreck experience at my last school, I decided this is a guy I should get close to. 

Well, we ended up becoming good friends throughout High School. Relevant information from this time includes the fact I dated two girls. One that I was basically peer pressured into dating and ended terribly, and the other which lasted about 2 years and ended with her changing her relationship status on Facebook after not talking to me for 4 months, *(long story, but it was terrible and I’m a better person because of it)*. 

Mike, however, dated no one, he did constantly hang around and sometimes make out in the back of his late 80’s, retirement community style, Oldsmobile with a girl named Melissa. Despite him wanting to, no dates and definitely no sexy times were had. She was a year ahead of us and eventually graduated, moved to college, became a juggalo, dropped out, married some guy, and moved three states away. 

Isn’t that always the worst. 

At this point Mike bounced from having interest in girl to girl, while still being broken up about the Melissa situation, of course never addressing his feelings with these other girls, and always making his voice more effeminate when talking to them on the phone. As I was just about to deploy to Afghanistan he became interested in a girl he worked with named Maddie.

It’s always the M names with Mike…I think he seeks out the relationship alliteration.

Throughout my deployment I worked nights, I was able to talk alot to my friends back home, but had no real face to face speaking interaction with anyone for about 12 months. Mike was always telling me about Maddie and I encouraged him to ask her out on a movie date or to dinner, and frequently offered him advice on how to proceed. *(All of which he ignored apparently)*

When I returned, I viewed the world a bit different and had some seriously lingering social issues having not interacted with anyone for basically a year. So I arrive home and I want to meet up and see Mike.

 He says, 
&gt;“Sure man mind if I have Melissa V2 and Marcy tag along” 

Another girl named Melissa *(who shall be referred to as Melissa V2 from here on out)*, and Marcy…I’m telling you the M names cannot be an accident.  

I guess I don’t mind. We meet up in a McDonalds to grab some food. This is my first time seeing my friend in a year, maybe I’m just sensitive, but attempting to reconnect with my friend while he plays tickle-fight over the last chicken nugget was nauseating. I give Marcy an apologetic look and found a reason to leave. 

The next day I talk to Mike. 

&gt;“Bro, I thought you were into Maddie…she’s all you’ve been talking about for a year” I say.

&gt;“Naw bro I’ve been over that for a while, isn’t Melissa V2 great though.”

Yeah. Great. Truthfully she was really damn annoying, and would go out of her way to invite herself to any event where I tried to catch up with my friend. Thus making it impossible to catch up, and not be thrown into a socially awkward semi-coma, as they basically finger-banged under the table at a Chili’s.

Other relationship no-no’s that were committed included hand-kissing and un-ironic swooping romantic, leg lifting, end of romcom, kisses over the 5 dollar movie bin at a Walmart. 

At this point I decided to put some distance between myself and them. I was going to wait until my other friend returned from deployment and we could tackle this together. It’s not that I don’t want my friend happy, but I also didn't like seeing his life run by someone that wasn't him.

Once David finally returned, a full 3 months later, we got back ahold of Mike. He was fully owned. She had him dressed in V-Necks, Plaid shorts, and Mandals. He was buying her lavish gifts every other week in the excess of 200 dollars, an amount far outside his spending ability. He was burning through his checking and savings account to appease her.  He was also stripped of what few interests or closely had beliefs that he had, and had simply become a ‘gray person’

She was using him and it was becoming very apparent. 

&gt;“Bro, We don’t like Melissa V2…we think she’s bad for you, this relationship just isn’t healthy.”

We had the sit down talk, addressed our concerns with him like good friends would, the response we got…was not exactly what was expected,

&gt;“Well she’s going to Detroit in a couple months for an internship, I’m trying to get the most quality time I can in with her”

Alright…cool. We’re going to be rid of this witch in a couple months, here’s to hoping Mike will be able to eat in the interim because he's running low on money.

*Authors Notes: This is a 100% true story on how a friend and genuinely great person went downhill to the point of becoming a neckbeard. Hopefully you enjoy it, it will have some funny,cringe-worthy, and depressing moments. I don't know how many parts it will have....but I will finish it. So yeah....TEXT WALL. All names and locations in this story have been changes for PERSEC reasons. Because duh*

I make more than he does waitressing for 3 shifts on the weekend and I go to graduate school full time and I intern three days a week for eight hours a day. Basically, I am pulling 50+ hour weeks to support myself and I do just fine. I don't mind hard work, and I thoroughly enjoy social worker. I am also pretty intelligent (at least, school wise) so school isn't that hard for me. I know not everyone can do what I do.

My s.o., on the other hand, has to keep time free so he can attend band practice. For two bands, with band members much younger than him (They don't have to make rent or pay for anything so they just schedule practice whenever). He has only had one paid gig in 4 years and he works 4-5 days a week. He barely has enough money to feed himself and make rent, and it has been this way the entire relationship. He is very thin. He has this mindset that he works a ""full time job, so that is enough."" It isn't, though, when you are literally starving and can't afford gas or food or car insurance after rent (Which is VERY cheap for this area). He NEEDS a second job or a better job that actually requires effort. If he could get a second job paying even minimum wage working an extra 10 hours a week, he would be doing... okay.

If I were him, with no loan debt and living on my own, I would be working my ass off and laughing all the way to the bank. I would enjoy my weekends with friends at the pub and buy 6 flags season passes, or going out to eat with my gf (We rarely, if ever go out, because I always have to pay for both of us.) and enjoy my 20's. He just wants to sit around and smoke pot and jam. 


I am realizing now that I need to take some things into consideration. I am a very driven person, I like buying things for myself when I need them (school supplies, new car, etc.) and I am pretty financially responsible. He, on the other hand, seems to be perfectly content with being PISS POOR because he a) wants to leave time free for music and b) truly thinks he ""deserves his two days off."" (HAHAHAHA. DAYS OFF. OK WHTAT ARE THOSE.) These priorities absolutely do not fall in line with mine. Even though we are VERY VERY close and important to one another, Is this the kind of person I want to spend my life with? To have kids with? To be legally bound to? To share my finances with?

**My point isn't to be on some soapbox saying I am so great and he is a music slacker. My point is, I don't want to spend the rest of my life with someone who I will always have to support. I don't want to spend my life with someone who seems to be taking the easy way out and who does not want to work hard and gets mad and often claims I don't support his music when I remark that his fridge is bare.. I am a public servant, I will never be rich, but you can guaran-fucking-tee I will be comfortable**  "

I am a guy in a straight couple looking for living arrangements in San Francisco from June 1st - August 15th due to her internship, which will be in the South Beach District. 

Our ideal place is a furnished one room sub for $800-1000 (max of 1200 I guess) with cool roommates that are all ok with having a stable couple live with them. We would love to make new friends, so if you are are like minded or aged, that is a plus. We can split the utilities evenly as well. Pets are a plus, but not necessary. The closer to the South Beach District, the better, but we are flexible as long as it's within the city and public transportation is available. We are very responsible people, and we will have money ready each month. If we could work something out for leasing the bedroom for 2.5 months, that would be fantastic. We cannot stay for the entire month of August as she will have to be back at university in time for classes, and I will likely leave earlier because I need to move into my apartment in Chapel Hill for the new school year, so probably August 5th-10th or so for me. If that's not possible, no worries.

Some information about her: she is 20 years old, currently residing in Cary, North Carolina, and a junior at North Carolina State University. She is double majoring in Computer and Electrical engineering, and her internship is at Verizon. This will be our first time in San Francisco, so we will be spending lots of time outside sightseeing when she is not working. She plans to work full-time (8am-5pm) over the summer so she will be quite busy. She is generally a quiet person on my own, and we are both very clean, always busy with something or another, easy to get along with, and love to chat. She loves fitness, reading, watching movies, and taking long walks on the beach.

I am a 21 year old junior at UNC Chapel Hill majoring in Mathematical Decision Sciences and minoring in Spanish. Since I am of age, I may have a drink or two, but not much since I will be focusing on my fitness this summer. I am looking for an internship/job, but until I can find somewhere to work, I will just stay around the house, so I can help clean or whatever to keep myself busy and help around. I am also a very friendly person, and I would love to become friends with your roommates. I like video games, basketball, soccer, fitness, computers, typical guy stuff.

If anyone has advice on what else we can do to find housing, that would be great. We are kind of desperate at this point, but our budget is still limited. We will take up very little space, so one bedroom is fine.

Thanks"

However, sometimes I find myself second guessing if accounting is the right choice for me. I worry about getting a job after graduation and having no clue what to do.

1) Will the reserve unit cover transportation costs to/from or just the hotel? If the former, is that a universal rule or does it depend on the unit? (not a huge deal, it'll just impact whether or not I decide to travel via plane or Greyhound).

2) Before I graduate there's a good chance I'll land an internship in a different time zone/side of the country for anywhere between 3-6 months. In this case, will I be able to temporarily transfer to a unit closer to that location or will I be flying home every month? If the former and they have no particular need for my MOS at the temp unit, would I just cross train under a different one?

3) If the answers to any of the above are unit-dependent, between now and the time I get out of MOS school what are my options (if any) of getting in contact with a Marine at my unit who'd be able to clarify.

249df7,6,2014-04-29,"Not sure I am capable to finish this PhD, or if I even want to.",[deleted],PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/249df7/not_sure_i_am_capable_to_finish_this_phd_or_if_i/,"I'm trying to keep this as short as possible, but it's a bit of a thesis in itself. I'm sorry - I don't know how to make it shorter without leaving out important things. There are also some naughty words below.

After graduating my honours year, I did an internship at a company via the university and was offered a full-time position afterwards. Collaboration continued between the company and the university, and talk of a PhD came up. Everyone kept repeating to me how much of a fantastic opportunity this is because I get my salary, the PhD is paid for by the company, and I get to work on a real world problem and not some esoteric academic's project. I knew then how much work and commitment a PhD would be, and I'm not ashamed to say I wasn't very keen on doing it. But after literally months of discussions, mostly them insisting how much of a fantastic opportunity it is, I agreed.

The project I was supposed to be working on ended up not going ahead due to political reasons within the company. Instead, I'm working on something else, albeit somewhat related to what I was originally supposed to be working on. The political issues also meant the contracts didn't get signed and exchanged, and, long story short, I lost at least 6 months of my 4 years that I cannot get back. (I couldn't just work on the project anyway while waiting for the signatures, because I didn't even know what the project would be).

Now I've finished my 2nd year, into the 2nd quarter of my 3rd. (Although you have to remove half a year from that for the reasons mentioned above). I have a little over a year and a half to go. I have a tonne of results but it's all over the place - there is no logical flow of ideas, concepts, methods, and results, it's all just random results about closely related ideas. Actually, it does very little to answer the question the PhD is posing in the first place.

Without being specific, the project I'm working on is an extension of something I've done for this company before. What I did before works great, works fast, is extremely customisable, and does exactly what they need. The success of that solution was a deciding factor in my position at the company and in moving me forward onto the PhD. What I'm working on now is in the same area, but the approach is totally retarded. It's complicated, convoluted, and many, many, many orders of magnitude slower. It requires the purchasing of prohibitively expensive commercial software whereas the existing system was totally self-contained. I feel like the whole thing is just a giant circlejerk - trying to devise something fancy and complicated, and come up with increasingly absurd reasons to justify said approach, just so there is something publishable, ignoring the fact that it's no practical for the company and far inferior to the existing system.

So there's one problem: I can't see where this research (which isn't what we were supposed to be researching in the first place) is going, how it's justified, how it's useful, etc.

Then there's my supervisor. He is the ultimate control freak. Imagine the most control freakiest person you know, and that person is a reclining rastafarian compared to this guy. I literally cannot email a bio about my undergraduate study and/or motivation for higher study to the faculty secretary without him calling her up and frantically telling her to disregard the email; then sitting with me for 4 days (I'm not fucking kidding) to re-write it. This is pretty stock standard for him. We know a deadline is coming, we know what's involved and what we have to do, but somehow, every. single. time. he ends up sending emails pleading for the deadline to be extended, and we end up working on it day and night together for a week after it was due. Everything I write is meticulously critiqued by him to the point of insanity. Words in sentences are reversed, thought about, and reversed again. ""That""s are changed to ""Which""es and back again, and back again. We spend two evenings working on a single paragraph that should take all of 10 minutes to write. But if he had a super power, it would not be his super-human ability to make time disappear or control his students every move; it would be his super-human powers of disorganisation. The amount of time I have spent re-explaining things I have explained to him before is probably enough time to write a thesis in itself. He never writes anything down, and it's probably for the best because it would just get lost anyway. He basically comes into every meeting as a blank slate. If I send him an email of something I've done (usually because he asked me to), he won't read it. Months later, he usually ends up asking me to send it to him again - but don't worry, he still won't read it. My first year progress report, 30 pages, was with him for over SIX MONTHS and he never bothered to read it. Then, when the faculty had put its foot down and said ""right, this is getting ridiculous, you absolutely MUST hand it in by this date"", literally the DAY BEFORE it was due, he made up some bullshit excuse about how he couldn't read it because he had to give up his seat on the bus for some old lady, BUT, here's a long list of things you need to have and need to say in your report. Basically, ""Yes, it took you a month to write it, I had 6 months to read it and I didn't fucking bother, it's due TOMORROW, but I want you to rewrite most of it to match what I'm telling you now"". Then, when I handed in the changes he told me to make, I got negative comments from my reviewers specifically about the things I changed according to his instructions. There have been some conferences we've submitted to, and were accepted to, but we have never gone because of various reasons. They have all been suspicious reasons, and I am of the strong suspicion that he doesn't want his name to be attributed to the particular direction of research we are currently doing because it doesn't match what he normally does, and he is concerned it won't look good for his reputation. (He has, on at least two occasions, said things to indicate this).

Anyway - I could go on and on and on and on about him. I'll just summarise it as: He is a control freak, he is disorganised, he is unreliable, he cancels meetings constantly - usually just beforehand.

Doing this PhD from the company I work for, there is the occasional task I'm asked to do which is unrelated to my research. Technically, the contract between the university and the company prohibits this, but everybody agrees that I can't just barge into my manager's office waving the contract furiously in my hand whenever he asks me to do something, especially considering people are being let go left right and center due to budget cuts - I'm in the somewhat safe position due to the PhD. Unfortunately, these occasional tasks aren't as occasional as they should be. I have lost entire weeks at a time, sometimes even longer, working on reports or software or something else. I also feel bad for saying no to these because, unlike the research, these things are actually useful to the company. The other thing is the pay. I know I shouldn't be complaining since my PhD is being paid for AND I get my salary, but I was already in a full-time job before I started my PhD and I took a pretty massive pay cut when I joined this company. When I speak to others around here who are in basic administrative positions, I've learned that a lot of them are actually being paid more than me. My wife has said all along that I'm not being paid well for what I do, and that I could do a lot better at another company.

I've also been getting migraines on an almost daily basis, ranging from a constant dull throb to my head feeling like it's being crushed by a vice. I've seen doctors and a neurologist, and there appears to be no physiological explanation except perhaps stress.

I feel like, especially given the history to date of the research, the final part of my PhD will be an absolute shitstorm of epic proportions. I will probably throw myself off a bridge half way through next year. Just given everything that's happened so far and everything I know will happen in the remainder, I've pretty much already made up my mind that I don't want to continue. This isn't a snap decision - I've been seriously contemplating this for over 6 months. 

It's not an easy decision though, and the longer I put it off, the closer I get to the end, the harder the decision is.

**Reasons To Continue:**

* Finish what you start
* ""PhD is a fantastic opportunity"" - *everyone*
* PhD could potentially lead to good career opportunities down the road

**Reasons To Quit:**

* Pay isn't great (mortgage doesn't pay itself, wife wants a kid = one income, etc)
* Supervisor is intolerable in every conceivable way
* Research is circlejerk and impossible to justify in practice
* Unrelated work getting in the way of research and unlikely to cease
* PhD could potentially hinder career opportunities down the road
* High likelihood of better pay at other companies

**Consequences of Continuing:**

* I will probably jump off a bridge

**Consequences of Quitting:**

* I won't have a PhD
* Supervisor and potentially employer may be upset"

they told me i have about 15days to leave before they cancel my visa and they want to see a plane ticket that shows im leaving the.country.

im sure they cant or wont cancel my visa, so im thinking of booking a refundable ticket to HK, getting my deposit and stay my full duration. zmsounds stupid even to me, but i think it will work. 

or i can go to hong kong or busan, korea and get a 60 or 90 day L visa. that should cost me about 1500 rmb. So i have two options

1. Lie, book a ticket and refund it. get my deposit back. Cost maybe 200 rmb.
2. go to hk or korea and get 60,90 da L visa. Cost 1500~2000 rmb
 im not 100% sure about the costs for this and whether i will get the visa, pretty sure i should but not 100%

3 just stfu and go to school. Cost ~3500~4000

Just want to give a clear story with background.


To avoid confusion with he/she, I'll use fake names. My girlfriend is hereby ""Lisa,"" and our friend/her ex is hereby ""Sam.""


---


Context of their relationship and friendship: Lisa and Sam grew up in the same small New England town. They met in highschool. He was a senior, she a freshman. He left for college in the Midwest. During the winter break of his freshman year in college (her sophomore year in highschool), they began a relationship. This ended abruptly by the end of he school year (May, 2010). 


Fast-forward a few years, and she's looking at colleges. They're friends again, so all is good. His college is a good fit for her, and he was in a relationship, so that had no part in her decision (supposedly). She enrolled, began her freshman year in August, 2012, which is the beginning of his senior year.


Winter break of the 2012-2013 school year, they hook up. She told me last night that it was a one night thing. This was before we met.


---


Context of my friendship with Sam: we were in the same grade and we knew eachother as acquaintances for the first two years. Our friendship grew stronger by junior year, and we were close by senior year.


---


Context of my relationship with Lisa: Sam introduced Lisa to me in the spring of 2013, a few weeks (month?) prior to spring break. We hit it off, and everything is great, so great that I work in her hometown for the summer of 2013 after I graduate. We begin a long distance relationship. She starts up school again, and I move back home (a few hours away from her college), and things are good. In the mean time, I prepare to move to a city in New England that is close to her hometown as well as apply to grad school. We spend winter break together, I move into my new place, and all is well. There was the rough patch of the lack of communication bc of our work/school schedules, but we smoothed it out.


Looking towards summer 2014, she has an internship in the city with me, we have a sublet lined up, and I'm prepared to enroll at a prestigious East Coast grad school in the fall. Awesome.


As with Sam, we are both close friends with him.
He moved to a large city in the Midwest in June, 2013. We even visited him in October. So far, he has been lonely and his drinking has escalated.


---


What happened: Sam visited Lisa's college to catch up with friends a few weeks before their graduation. Lisa hosted him and he brought an air mattress. I thought nothing of it, and neither did Lisa. He even crashed at another place Saturday evening. 


On Sunday evening, Lisa said she got upset and nostalgic and went home to go to bed. Sam called Lisa to get into the house and fall asleep as well. She climbed into her bed, and he followed her in. She wore a shirt, underwear, and leggings (no bra). He wore a shirt and boxers. He was rubbing her back suggestively and wrapped his arm around her. He even put his hand up her shirt and on her back, as well as touched her butt. Basically they spooned. They fell asleep at 1 am, woke up at 4 am, he was rubbing her back some more, and she freaked out. He got out of the bed and both fell back asleep separately.


On Monday, they had lunch with friends and they talked privately. Both of them regret it.


Around 6 pm, she skyped me. She told me about it, and an hour into our conversation i logged off to breathe. At this time, she made it sound like they were snuggling for a few minutes in their day clothes. I talked to her about two hours later. For the next 2 or 3 hours, she disclosed that they actually fell asleep together and that it was more intimate (everything that I described above). She swore that nothing else happened.


I asked her to limit her contact with him. I'm going to talk to him today. I plan on driving there in two weeks to pick her up over graduation weekend, and he might be there.


---


My feelings: despite her saying nothing happened, I feel like something did happen. Falling asleep while spooning is intimate, and it's something that I don't do casually. She claimed that it felt innocent at first, but that she also missed the physical nature of our relationship and that, in some twisted way, she did it because she missed me. She was crying the entire time that we spoke.


I also feel betrayed because he is (was?) my friend. I would never disrespect my friend's boundaries like that.


I also feel stupid and emasculated because I was naive enough to think that Sam could stay in her room, and that other people saw him go into her room. I don't know if I'll be over it by the time I have to pick her up.


---


My reaction: Lisa seems apologetic, and we talked it out. We think that we can work it out and that it won't kill the relationship. I asked her to limit her contact with him, and that she doesn't see him over graduation weekend when I'm not there. When she said that we can negotiate with Sam, I told her that he does not have the privilege of that. Lisa and I are in a relationship and we can talk. Sam is not, and I think that he should do what I tell him to do with the threat of Severing ties. 


I told my roommate/close friend about it, and he said that I was too forgiving.


---


Going forward: In another context, this might not seem like a big deal. However, we have a LDR, and even though she claims it won't happen again, I don't know if I can take her word for it, especially in the moment. 


I want to tell Sam that he shouldn't go to graduation weekend. I don't know if that's asking too much.


We have a sublet lined up. If things go south and I discover that she did not tell the whole truth, what the hell will I do about that? Both of us are on the sublet agreement.


Not to be a dick, but I also don't know why she would have residual feelings for him. He just talks about his loneliness and drinks non-stop. I'm here for her and working shit hours to afford a great summer with her, and I have my shit together. What gives?

---

Your verdict: am I overreacting? Am I too forgiving? Have you had a similar experience?

---   
**tl;dr**: GF fell asleep with good friend/her ex. She's apologetic, but my emotions are mixed.

Anyway, glad to be here and ready to get started!

When I first arrived at my university, I knew something was off. I was an international student in Singapore and I felt very different. I wasn't completely certain about my choice of course as well, and that made me even more uncomfortable.

My first semester was probably the only good one, it was filled with a lot of hope. I worked hard, was very social and made sure to make a lot of friends as I was far from home. It all went downhill from there.

Each passing semester was met with the realization that I did not love what I was doing. My friends drifted away and formed relationships, I was always single. I did a few internships but did not enjoy them. I got rejected by overseas programs and resented it. I tried to put myself out there in the dating world and was sexually assaulted by the first guy I expressed an interest in. 

Every single decision I made seems like the worst one and I kept making a series of terrible decisions that piled up and have resulted in this horrible feeling that I can't shake off. I feel like a huge loser and am so afraid of making any decisions because I know I will regret any that I make.

I can't share my problems with my family. They have such high expectations of me. I have never felt so alone.

I have also been rejected by every single graduate job I have applied to, and I have applied to over 50 of them. I feel like the interviewers can see the dead look in my eyes, no matter how I try to mask it.

To add to all of this, I am bonded to the Singapore government for the next 3 years, as I was on scholarship. With no job yet, I will be forced to stay here over the summer, alone and looking for a job.

The thing that makes me the most depressed is the fact that I think I had so much potential that I threw away.

For those who read this, thanks for taking the time to listen. I don't know what to do with myself but would appreciate any advice."

&gt;&gt;No we don't need to beat Sopa or anti net neutrality, we need to beat the senators and politicians that keep introducing such legislation into a pulp as many times as it takes until they realize introducing such will guarantee them another beating.

&gt;Absolutely. Convince reddit-usa to give a crap about voting first. Lazy fucks spout reasons not to vote far more than why you should, and how stupid easy it is too. Fucking Afghans turn out despite death threats and I hear people who complain not vote because their cat box needed to be emptied instead.

&gt;&gt;i voted for a president who promised to protect net neutrality, and looked what happened. it is discouraging and it seems like it doesn't matter who you vote for, everyone just ends up pandering to the big corporations.

&gt;Cash is KING.

And:

&gt;If you beat one crooked legislator another one will pop up right behind him, it is essentially whack-a-mole. What needs to be stopped is the corporate control of our government.

And: 

&gt;How exactly? Until you remove money from politics your voice means nothing to the political system.

And:

&gt;Do you think a politician who does not take campaign money from corporations has any realistic chance of winning? I do not think they do. So the only way they can navigate election process is to sell their soul.

Plus a minijerk: voting doesn't matter, the game is rigged!

PART 2: Should we have a Constitutional amendment to Save the Internet?  Reddit discusses.

&gt;&gt;Honestly a constitutional amendment is probably needed. Attacks will never stop without something binding. I'm not as concerned about net neutrality as I am making sure internet traffic is treated as protected speech.

&gt;Internet traffic is not protected speech. That kind of protection only exists for really important things, like **unlimited campaign contributions.**

Emphasis his.

&gt;Seems the only way of fighting back against any such bills that would restrict the internet would be to first get an amendment passed that guarantees the internet to current and future generations. Anything short of this will be attacked, challenged and eventually be bought and sold by corporations (via politicians).

And:

&gt;The best bet would be pushing Congress to pass strong net neutrality laws or bypassing Congress altogether and pushing for a Constitutional amendment to protect net neutrality. However, the current net neutrality concerns have absolutely nothing to do with Congress.

But if the government doesn't protect our rights, what will an amendment change?

_____________________________

PART 3: We.  Are.  Freedom Fighters!

&gt;Whatever happened to our spirit of Revolution? We need to rise up like we did in the 1960s. Unless we effectively stop our work day and school day to protest and rally, they won't see it our way.

&gt;Human rights is an endless struggle. That's why they call it a struggle. We beat SOPA and we'll keep beating the zombie SOPAs and every other fucking thing they will inevitably throw at us.

&gt;I'm not even close to tired and will fight with others until the day I die for human rights.

And then:

&gt;No. No. I'm tired of struggling. I'm sick and tired of having to sign petitions and donate to organizations who have to fight to get congressmen to see it our way. I'm tired of attending peaceful protests just to get maced in the face and beaten to a pulp. I'm sick of playing these damn games.

I'm 19F and just landed an internship this summer (yay!) so I need an entire business casual wardrobe, pretty formal is what they told me, so suits. I found one skirt suit I absolutely love and was on mega sale and have an old one of my sisters that fits me great.

I have had trouble finding dresses and dress shirts that fit properly. I have a very hourglass shape 38-27-38 and am very busty. All the shirts I try on are either far too much cleavage, they pull too tight on my breasts, or I'm swimming in them but they contain my chest.

I've been looking online for help and have found suggestions of a more vintage style of dress shirt (like 40's-50's) that tapers below the breast that is great with hourglass shapes. The problem is, I have not found these anywhere.

So help!! Any stores or online places I could check out? And also remember I'm 19 and this isn't a paid internship and I'm broke so please not too much $$

By all means feel free to skip most of this, but if there's anyone willing to read it all (that would make you a saint in my eyes) I would love to hear any and all advice there is to offer. Brevity is really not a strong point for me, I have a tendency to explain everything so apologies for incoming wall of text. I’m just going to put my TL;DRs up here at the top to save anyone who doesn’t want to go through all of this.


**TL;DR for The Short Version** *Can anyone outline their application experience for a MAC counter position in a department store? Preferably specific to the UK, but any and all advice is appreciated!*


**TL;DR for The Long Version** *Graduating uni soon and I’m aiming to work in the marketing side of the beauty industry. Is taking a year to work in retail for make-up a good idea, and does anyone have any more general advice for getting into the industry?*
 

**The Short Version.** Right now there’s a vacancy in a MAC counter in a department store near me, and I’m considering applying there. The issue I have is that I don’t have any prior experience in make-up (read “The Long Version” if you’re interested in knowing exactly the position I’m in right now). As I understand it, the process for applying for MAC seems somewhat stringent in the US.  I’ve read a few experiences of the process, and I know generally speaking they have a kind of two-stage interview process; the more typical one-to-one interview with the manager, and then the actual make-up application interview. I’ve also read that they like to see a portfolio of previous work, but as I said, I don’t have any formal experience working in make-up. That’s not to say I can’t apply make-up on other people, I’m most definitely comfortable doing so - I do it fairly regularly for friends and family - but I’ve never been paid for a make-up job. 


Putting the physical make-up application thing aside, I feel as if I have pretty good knowledge of make-up. I’m not saying I know everything; I’m a firm believer that there’s always something new to learn and gaps in my knowledge. But if friends or family have questions about make-up, they will generally come to me, and for the most part I feel like I can provide a pretty good answer. Similarly I feel as if I could do the same for MAC; if someone were to ask me, I think I could pretty confidently explain which foundations provide what kind of coverage, the difference between different finishes on products and so on. So I think for the sales side of things, I wouldn’t be that concerned about being able to describe products and so on (I’m also familiar with the ethical side of the brand what with Viva Glam and all that jazz).


So the kind of point of this ramble - I was wondering if it’s the same application process in the UK? Are they expecting a formal portfolio, formal make-up training, etc etc? Generally speaking, how does the application and interview process go, and am I unlikely to be rejected on the grounds of not having any prior experience working in retail for make-up?


**The Long Version.** I feel like I’ve ended up in an odd place asking for sort-of-careers-advice, but hey ho, here goes nothing. I’m graduating from university in the summer, and with an obsession with all things beauty having flourished in the time I’ve been at university, I’ve come to the conclusion that I want to work in the beauty industry. I’d like to start in the marketing side of things, and I have more long term ambitions of ending up on the product development side of things. I’ve looked around to see what’s about in terms of graduate opportunities, but I feel as if for the most part I’m currently under qualified for most of the positions I’m seeing.  


When I chose what I wanted to do at university I was really unsure as to what I wanted to do career-wise so I chose a fairly broad degree – English (mine is a literature based course as opposed to language). Most of the positions I’ve looked at are asking for a degree “in a related field”, i.e. Marketing. A lot of them are also asking for prior experience in similar positions - for candidates who have done a year in industry or similar. (I don’t know how it is in the US, but in British universities if you’re doing a Marketing degree or similar it’s becoming quite common to do a “sandwich year” and take a year’s work placement between the years of academic study, so that you have experience when you graduate). In short, I didn’t do that, so I’m feeling largely under qualified for a lot of jobs that I’m seeing.


Having thought about it quite a lot lately, I feel like my best option is probably to take a year to try and get some relevant experience, which is why I’m also looking for advice for applying for counter positions. I'm also planning on trying to find internships in marketing, even if they're unpaid and not necessarily related to the beauty industry. If there’s anyone out there who does have any advice, is this the right sort of approach? Will I benefit in the long term from having some experience on the floor, as it were? Is there any more general advice for trying to get into the industry?


Thank you to anyone who’s read my ramblings up to this point; as I said, any and all advice for anything I’ve mentioned here is appreciated!

**EDIT: Forgot to add, please feel free to use this post as a more general place to discuss the matter of careers and jobs in the beauty industry, regardless of whether it's in the realm of being an MUA or on the more corporate side of things. It's Text Tuesday after all, we're supposed to encourage discussion, right? :)**"

Eat Fresh.,Crazyphapha,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/24b40b/the_jambon_chronicles_episode_5_eat_fresh/,"Hello FPS, it's time for a new story. Haven't been able to post for the past few days, work and stuff. Anyways, let's get to it.

The characters:

&gt; Still me, Crazyphapha, French guy now exiled to northern France

&gt; MonkeyMartin. Roommate, hairy, short, muscly, vocal about stuff. Laughs loudly.

&gt; Roman Polanski. Still didn't direct any movies, but he watches a ton of them. Tall, lanky polish guy.

&gt; BlackForest. The ham of the story. Called BlackForest because a) she was black and b) this happened in the Parisian Subway (that we call metro)

Now, onwards with the story:

Every week-end, after the week at my boarding school, most interns would go back to their homes by bus, then train, then subway, and I was no exception. Bus and train went smoothly, but things started getting hairy in the Subway.

The Subway was relatively full, so Martin, Roman and myself sat in those fold-away seats, with our suitcases in front of us. I was facing both of them, when someone came in.

BlackForest hopped on the carriage, who tipped slightly in her direction. She waddled over to me (closest to the door) and asked me to get up.

&gt; BlackForest: ""Get up young man, I need to sit down.""

&gt; Me: ""Excuse me? There's plenty of seats in that carriage, just go sit in this one over there."" I motioned at a free seat that was about 10 feet away, a few rows back.

&gt; BlackForest: ""No, you need to move, I can't walk because of my bad knee. I get tired very easily.""

&gt; Me: ""Sorry, but my friends are here. I'm sure you can walk 10 feet, I believe in you."" Damn my big mouth. Martin started cackling, and BlackForest lost her shit.

&gt; BlackForest: ""GET UP NOW! You have no right to shame me like that in public. Go sit on your damn suitcase if you want to stay near your friends!""

&gt; Me: ""Alright, I've had enough. Get your damn seat, I can stand up since my knees don't have half a ton to carry around.""

She shot me a deadly glare, then to Martin who was openly laughing now, and sat down. The seat disapproved. It creaked, and obviously wasn't built for such a large mass. I would have said something, but I ignored her and walked forward to face my friends. We start to chat again while the subway starts again.

However, next station didn't come without incidents. As the train comes to a halt, I hear something break behind me. Instinctively, I leap to the side, and BlackForest comes crashing down where I stood a moment ago. Her inertia carried her too far forward, so the seat had given in and let her roll. I looked back up, already laughing with Roman, but I was surprised not to hear Martin's laugh. He was cursing, and his eyes were getting teary. It took me a while to understand.

Turns out, my suitcase (looked similar to [this](http://www.foldabikes.com/PriceListPict/suitcase/trollyhandle.jpg)) didn't have the instinct to get out of the way. And upon the impact, it was tipped over with great force, driving the still-raised handle... Into Martin's crotch. I laughed even harder, which eventually motivated BlackForest's shame enough to get up and waddle out of the subway.

I leaned towards Martin, and told him: ""This is karma for that time when you spread that rumor about me and Mobbie. Rumor born from a ham, amidst salt and smoke, and now a ham taketh away your manhood."" Then I got back up and carried on laughing with Roman. We went on with our trip, and everything was right again. For now."
24b42v,20,2014-04-29,I'm sure I'm the first person ever to post here looking for a place to live...,rolandofeld19,memphis,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphis/comments/24b42v/im_sure_im_the_first_person_ever_to_post_here/,"Hiya, so, like the title says the wife and I are looking for a place in Memphis while she does her internship.

Based on discussions with a few locals and some research of our own, not to mention her work location in the Medical District, we're focusing our search on the Cooper-Young or Overton Square area.  Both of those places seem to be a good fit for our situation (and pocketbook we hope) but we'd be open to other comparable areas the same distance (and price bracket) from said Medical District.

We've heard places tend to be advertised via word of mouth or via casual advertisements like signs.  That, combined with us being quite far away and pressed for cash and time, see bullet point #3 below for why, has us wanting to spread the word any way we can that we're looking for a place.

If there are any landlords out there, a bit about us:

1. I'll be working from home for the duration of my wife's internship, which is 1 year long.  
2. We're willing and able to pass whatever background/credit check you throw at us.
3. We have one (1) awesome daughter who will be a few months old when we move up.
4. We also have two kind and non-aggressive dogs that are housetrained, fixed, and get along well with people (babies and adults) and other dogs.  
5. Reasonable pet deposits are, of course, understandable.  We have faith in our critters but we know they're unknown variables to you.
6. We're open to considering any sort of rental, from a large studio up to a few bedroom house, assuming it's a good fit otherwise.


So, uh, yea, please if you're renting and your lease is ending between now and August or if you're a landlord and have something that might work, here we are.  Or if you see a sign for a cool place near your abode and want another set of nice neighbors. Or whatever reason you need really to help us find a place to live in your city, that reason, use that.  

I'm sure a beer, wine, flower, or gift card bribe, I mean finders fee, could be arranged if that helps grease the wheels and things work out for us.  Just having housing taken care of and off our, stressed and sleep deprived due to the whole new-parent thing, minds would be quite worth it.

We thank you for your time and look forward to any and all help/tips/messages this community has to offer and will be monitoring my inbox for the same.

24bq3h,53,2014-04-29,I have zero fashion sense and am starting my career (22),ccthefrog,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/24bq3h/i_have_zero_fashion_sense_and_am_starting_my/,"Hi female fashion advice,

I've landed myself my first full-time position in the corporate world and I'm looking for some fashion advice. I've never needed to express any sort of fashion in my life as I had a uniform in high school, and wore sweaters and sweatpants literally every day in university. Now that I'm starting a career in downtown Toronto in the corporate world I've got to change that about myself. 


That's where you come in - I don't know how to change or even begin.


I've had three intern positions in the past in corporate bank and each required dressy casual, but they were extremely lax. I could get away with a collared golf tee and pair of jeans with sneakers daily. Now I’m going to be working in a corporate bank position but I don’t think I can get away with these things.


I’ve read both ‘dressy casual’ guides in this subreddit and am still very lost. It seems I need to have a fashion style before I begin shopping. Now I recognize that one of the number one rules is to find your own style using polyvore or a similar online service, but after looking at approximately 300 different outfits on there, I am even more overwhelmed than before. The issue isn’t that I don’t see myself in any of those outfits – I see myself in everything. So I feel like a child being given the responsibility of putting together my own outfit for school the very first time. My instinct is to find one shirt that I like and buy that same shirt in 12 different colours.


So help save me from myself! So far I have a few pieces – two pairs of work trousers (one gray, one navy), and two soft dress shirts (one white and one navy with a collar). All of which my mom picked out for me.  So in total I have two outfits – gray pants with navy shirt, navy pants with white shirt. I also have a pencil skirt that I got myself last summer that I like but I am not sure if it’s fashionable or not. [Link here!](http://imgur.com/VyOCMvH) I’m actually pretty peeved with this skirt – I got it from eShakti with my measurements, and its far too large (in both width and length).  I also have a coral pink short-sleeved dress shirt that I got four years ago that is wrinkled to hell [(album link here!)](http://imgur.com/a/tHHb9#jfdEPMy)


I’m 22, turning 23 in a few months. 5’4”, 120lbs. I’m pretty sure I’m hour-glass shaped (39-28-40), and one of the reasons I hate shopping is because I either find clothing is too tight in the chest but fits everywhere else, or fits in the chest and is loose everywhere else.  I also prefer plain clothing and rarely go after patterns. I also don’t accessorize in the slightest and don't want to.

So here are my giant list of questions.

1.	In regards to the skirt – is this fashionable or a mess? What could I wear with this? Where in the leg should it hit? Is it in fact a pencil skirt or… something else? I honestly don’t know what different things are called. I can put it on and take a picture if you would like, but I don’t think it fits properly.

2.	In regards to the dress shirt. I recognize it is wrinkled as hell and doesn't fit properly – as it pulls in the chest. I actually got this at Cleo four years ago in XXS, and it was the last one left. What would you call this dress shirt? It’s short-sleeved and it has seams all over the place.  Assuming it wasn't wrinkled is it fashionable? Where could I find other similar pieces?

3.	I hate layering my clothing and have many fights with my mom about this. I know that both guides mention how cold air conditioning is, but I’m constantly 1000 degrees. What is a type of shirt that would look good on my body without needing a … camisole or sweater to cover it? I would prefer to show zero cleavage and when it comes to straps I definitely prefer thick. 

4.	Where can a 22 year old find good quality, fashionable work clothing in solid prints? Every site I’ve been on has been favouring patterns and to be honest I just don’t know where to begin with any patterning. I’ve looked at Loft and Ann Taylor so far.

5.	In terms of dresses can I get away with a floral summer dress? I know I’ve talked about solid prints but I’m comfortable with a floral dress. [Could something like this be okay for work?](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/bountiful-blooms-dress)

Thanks in advance for your help!

24bt3m,5,2014-04-29,How to boost your confidence without being a jerk.,rockybalboapark,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/24bt3m/how_to_boost_your_confidence_without_being_a_jerk/,"Five Pillars in Building Confidence Without Being a Jerk

I was like you.  I got nervous when talking to women, public speaking, or even striking up a conversation with the new intern at work.  As a guy, we WANT to show the world what we are proud of and to be a success.  We are all good at something.  

However, there is something inside holding many of us back.  If you’re like me, you’ve probably asked yourself, “Is there something wrong with me?”  Our inner voices dictate what we can and can’t do- analyzing what seems so simple to other guys but is absolutely terrifying to you. I’m not talking about delivering the State of the Union Address here.  I’m talking about approaching a girl and feeling absolutely frightened of what you might say or how you will be perceived.

At the same time, we don’t want to become THAT guy.  You know who I’m talking about- the cocky dude at the work party where every conversation seems to revolve around him.  He is loud and obnoxious.  Screw him.  We don’t want to be like him BUT we marvel at his incredible ability to make girls laugh.  

And so on and on the same story unfolds in our life.  Instead of taking action, we just beat ourselves up and don’t get anywhere.  Our stomach continues to churn and our glands continue to sweat.  The whole process repeats itself again and again.  

Well, I was tired of feeling this way.  I was ready to take action and figure out what worked for me after YEARS and YEARS of discomfort.  Yes, YEARS.  I will begin to show you how to start becoming more of the man you already are and want to be.  Here are the five pillars I live by.

(1)  Slow Down

Rome wasn’t built in a day, month, or year.  Best advice I ever got was to slow down.  One way to do this- focus on your breathing.  At first, I thought it was bull.  I breathe to survive and why would I want to pay any attention to it?  

But in fact, that was the point.  So many aspects of our life start to become our identity that you forget to just take a step back as an observer and just be ourselves.  So I tried it and you can too.  

Find a comfortable position, reduce outside noise, and close your eyes.  You can do this anywhere.  With every breath notice your chest coming in and out.  Picture your lungs filling up with oxygen and what they look like as you exhale.  

If you find you are distracted by thoughts, keep coming back to your breath.  Picture that breath reaching every cell in your body and every fiber of your being.  Do this for just 5 minutes.  We all have 5 minutes and I guarantee you will start to notice a difference.  

Or, watch the Cosmos series and you start to realize, “Holy shit, it took billions and billions of years just to create me.”  Keep things in perspective.

(2)  Keep it simple

I don’t like to make things complicated.  I am a guy.  I am going to show you something else that you can do right now.  This will begin to shift your mindset.  

When you are doing something you are really good at, say doing the dishes (yes, I am a master), give it your full attention.  

Pay attention to the feeling of the water as you sink your hands into the soapy bath.  Notice the smell of the lemon soap.  Listen to the sound of your tap water rushing out into the sink.  Instagram your superhero stacking abilities in the dish rack. (Don’t do this) Observe how water is slowly running off the dishes.  Love the music you are listening to and notice the mood it puts you in. 

Now, you may be saying to yourself “this guy is nuts- just do the dishes bro.”  Sometimes I just do the dishes bro, but the purpose of this is start rebuilding your thinking patterns.  You begin to see that everything you are good at now was once a tedious learning process and yet, now you’ve lost that sense of accomplishment with that otherwise mundane task. 

It seems so simple now.  You learned how to do it and over time it became rather easy.  Remember what you ARE good at.  

(3) Your perception is YOUR perception

In other words, you are your own worst critic.  How you view and feel about yourself can be vastly completely different than what others think. 

Let me tell you a story. 

I had convinced myself that I was in fact a failure- disregarding any accomplishment I had ever achieved.  I started to believe that it was ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE to talk a girl at a bar.  After all, whenever I thought about it, my stomach started hurting, my blood pressure would go up, and my palms were sweaty.  I would work myself up so much and then I just couldn’t do it.  Every time.  

Then one of my friends stated simply, “Dude, just ask her about her day.”  Of course, I thought and thought about it, replaying what she might say or how I would come across.  Then it dawned on me.  All of these feelings were a story that I had created exclusively in my head.  All of it.  The actual act of talking to another human being should not be causing this.  

We get so wrapped up in our own world that it becomes THE world.  In these types of moments, I find it helpful to remind myself that this moment is the only moment and then the next moment is that moment.  That’s all.

Remember that your perception is subjective to you and you only.

(4)  Challenge Yourself to Break Out of Your Routine

If most nights you come home to watch TV, cook dinner, and get on the computer, you need to change it up.  

Routines are only natural to us guys and humankind in general.  I always brush my teeth twice a day or in the morning shower and THEN shave.  I’m not talking about those things.  I’m talking about changing up some of your same patterns and having fun with it.

Do something different.  Anything.  (Guys, don’t get dirty here).  

Go for walk.  Call a close friend.  Go out for a drink with a co-worker.  Play some pool with a friend.   Do something different during the week- something that breaks up your day from the norm.  Even at your job, take lunch at a different time, introduce yourself to a new employee, bring your lunch to work and eat outside.  Heck, call your mom when you get home!  (That one’s for you, Ma).   

Starting doing things that are a little out of the ordinary and be creative with it.  Do some more things that you love.

(5) Focus on Small Wins

For so long, I wanted to be a man who had it all- have the cool car, the big house, and find the perfect woman (I did find the last one.).  I woke up everyday with that in the back of my mind never coming close to achieving it.  Then I was like, “Whoa self, I’m 25 years old and I want to be a 45 year old?  I probably won’t even be like that when I’m 45!""

Instead, I began to focus on small wins and so can you.  For me, it was pushing myself just a little bit and taking action. 

For example, giving a speech in front of my colleagues was a huge hurdle for me and really worked hard at preparing for it.  Afterwards, I felt great and received many compliments.  Also, I took an improv class and had so much fun with it and really got out of my comfort zone.  Small wins. 

If talking to girls is hard for you, try approaching the barista at a coffee shop.  Now, you don’t have to fall in love with her, visit Paris with her, and take her on your yacht that you don’t have.  

Just say hello and make small talk.  Tell her a joke or compliment her in some way.  Talk about the weather.  Something.  

At this point, it doesn’t matter if you stuttered, were sweating, or your stomach was in knots. You probably won’t ever see her again but you talked to her.  Small wins.  Let’s not try to be our hypothetical future selves; let’s just be who we are right now.

These steps are just the beginning.  I know that you don’t want to hear about all these theories, the famous men who created them, and why you can or can’t do something.  

You just want to know what to do.  You want to take action to make those changes. We all have these inner voices, however, it’s when those inner voices start to dictate who we are and what we do that it starts to cripple us as men.  

Maybe it’s society we blame, maybe it’s our parents we blame, maybe it was our first love who broke our heart.  All we want to do is to act normal and live our lives.  Practice these steps and you will start to see yourself as the man you were always meant to be."

I'm looking for a summer sublet starting around May 10th until mid August (around the 16th, but that's flexible). I'll be working in Van Ness and would prefer living on the red line, but I'm not too particular about location as long as it's near a metro. Looking to keep rent below $1000, but the cheaper the better.

About me: 22 year old, coming back to DC for yet another internship. Female, but I'm fine with living with whomever. Clean, friendly, alright with hanging out but also keeping to myself depending. Also, I used to work as a pastry chef and can bake some delicious pastries, if that's what you're into. Let's be realistic though, who doesn't love pastries.

PM me if you have any questions or are looking for a roommate/subletter.


Thanks, y'all!"

Now that I'm in University, it's really becoming quite noticeable for myself.

It's becoming one of the main reasons why I don't study as hard anymore and i really want to fix it. I've grown into the mindset that if i enter an exam with little preparation and study and come out with a 52, I'm actually ecstatic that i passed, it doesn't matter if a close friend got 90, because as far as I'm concerned I barely even tried.

This semester, I've actually been trying for my units. I got 76 for a midsem which is a Distinction and above average. But my friend, whom I've been studying at uni with, gets a 90. And I don't understand why, but I'm just depressed. It almost feels like his time is worth more then mine.

It's also been happening when I do assignments at University. Just 2 weeks ago I was working on an assignment outside of my major(I'm majoring in Econometrics and the assignment was on finance), and it just so happened that the group close to mine was also working on the same thing but further ahead. For about 2 hours, i just sat there unable to make any progress, just listening to them talk about successful interns and turning down companies and things on the assignment which i just didn't understand. I just felt useless and demotivated hearing the success and differences of someone my own age.

As a CS Major, I consider myself doing pretty well here. So far, I have a 4.0 Computer Science GPA (3.53 Overall), I'm a first-year student, I am a Undergrad Lab TA for CSCI 1301, and I'm surprisingly getting replies on computer science internships and summer jobs that I apply for. My biggest fear at Tech is having to kill myself to stay in pace with the Tech CS students and possibly lose my scholarships and things like that. I love the UGA atmosphere, but I know Tech is where I need to be for CS. I've been really torn about this for the longest time, so I come to Reddit for advice! Please put in your two cents!"

24ch5n,1,2014-04-30,(Spoilers All) I think all the Night's King theories are close but a little off the mark. Here's mine.,FinishTheBooksGRRM,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/24ch5n/spoilers_all_i_think_all_the_nights_king_theories/,"So, in the HBO synopsis, the Other at the end of S04E04 was referred to as the Night's King.  I don't buy that this was a simple mistake, because why would someone associate a random high-level Other with the Night's King from the past?  It's is oddly specific, as we've all noted, and hints that someone (maybe an intern or a low-level employee) took the name from the script without realizing the identity wasn't to be revealed yet.  From this, I think we can reasonably conclude that the character we saw is called the Night's King by the showrunners or in the script.

The thing is, I've noticed the majority here seem to think that this means it is THE Night's King from lore.  I think that's doubtful.  The Night's King of lore was only the 13th Lord Commander of the Wall, which was built about 8000 years ago.  So, even accounting for a generous reign for each of the first 13 Lord Commanders, we're talking about someone who lived almost 8000 years ago.

It seems unlikely to me that, even accounting for the idea that the Others may be long-lived, that this is THE Night's King from that far in the past.  It seems more likely to me that this is the current Night's King and that there has been some sort of succession from the original over the centuries.

Some of the rest of you have speculated this as well and what it means.  Some of you have suggested that maybe the Wall was originally manned and built by the Others to keep out man and that the Others were overcome during the reign of the Night's King and have lived in exile ever since.  I think this is close, but again off the mark.

There's too much evidence that the Wall was built by men.  The forts seem built for men, not for Others.  Also, Coldhands (and presumably the Others) can't yet pass the Wall.  This makes it seem unlikely that the Wall was built for Others by Others and there's some kind of revisionist history going on.  Plus, GRRM likes to foreshadow the fuck out of things.  There's been absolutely none that would lead us to believe the Wall was manned and built by Others.

So what's my theory?  It's pretty simple and based only in what we ""know"" so far.

The Night's Watch was founded, as stated, to keep watch from the Wall for the Others after the Long Night.  Presumably, the war heavily dwindled the Others' numbers, maybe even decimated their society altogether (or it's doubtful they would've given up the fight).  The 13th Lord Commander, just as stated, eventually fell in love with an Other woman, became one, and used ""sorcery"" to control his brothers (which was most likely either turning them into Others as well or perhaps wights but maybe something else).  The King in the North and the King Beyond the Wall eventually teamed up, according to the stories, and ""defeated"" him.

This is the end of what lore we have about the situation.

I believe, because we aren't explicitly told he died, that the Night's King and the brothers he controlled or turned fled back into Other society or what was left of it.  It may even be that while the Night's King and his bride briefly ruled from the Wall that they were the last remaining power structure in Other society (maybe this was a last ditch effort by the Others after losing the war with man).  Whatever the case, it appears to me the Night's King and his band somehow became rulers of the Others, maybe by way of a power vacuum from the war.  Or it may be that the Other woman who married the Night's King was some kind of Other royalty to begin with.  However it happened, it appears to have continued on to present day, with the current leader of the Others still claiming the title of Night's King.

It's simplistic, but makes the most sense to me.  It also explains a few things, like why the Others seemingly have much more animosity towards the Night's Watch than they do toward the wildlings and why the Night's King and the 12 Others standing with him seem to resemble brothers of the Night's Watch."
24citc,8,2014-04-30,"Me [22 M] with my Ex [20 F] of 4 1/2 years, wanted a break, emotionally cheated",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24citc/me_22_m_with_my_ex_20_f_of_4_12_years_wanted_a/,"I have been reeling for the last week.  I am in severe emotional pain and I clawing my way through finals week.  My girlfriend of 4 1/2 years came to me the other day and told me that we needed a break.  She was leaving for the summer for internships and than leaving for China in the fall. She told me we could use this time to grow and become more independent and have a stronger relationship after.

However, it wasn't the whole truth.  I was suspicious and decided to snoop.

I found out that a guy I knew about and her were much closer than I thought.  When I confronted her she told me a month prior she had made out with him and decided after that that she needed to rethink our relationship and what she wanted out of life.

If she had ended it with that guy there I think I could be ok.  But she didn't.  After breaking up with me she went on a date with this person.  It honestly is breaking my heart.  I tried to tell her that if she continues to be with this person I don't think I can handle going back to a relationship.  

I know now before she broke up with me that I could have been a better boyfriend.  After four years together I took her for granted sometimes.  Because of that maybe she just needed the feeling of a new relationship.  The entirety of my being right now wants to be back together with her, even knowing that she emotionally cheated and physically to an extent.  But I don;t know if I can trust her again.  What is to happen if we get back together and she feels like the relationship becomes to comfortable.  

I know I am ranting, I am just very confused.  I told her that unless she breaks it off completely with this person that there is no future for us, but I don't know if my resolve can hold.  I wouldn't care if she dated other people while we were on a break, but that fact that she is going on dates with a person she made out with before she broke up with me tells me that she doesn't want to be an independent person, just that she wants temporary independence from me.  

Should I give her a second chance?  Part of me thinks we could be happy again but the other part of me is so unsure.


Edit:  She has told me that she wants to meet in two weeks to discuss things.


Also the thought of her with this person makes my blood boil and the tears flow.

I have developed a pretty comfortable niche in my lifestyle, and I have previously managed working as a cashier and stock clerk pretty well even with my hands, but the thought of a new job with new things to learn really scares me. The stress is too much sometimes and the only thing I want in this world is to not have worry about sweaty palms and worry about things normal college kids worry about. I have used certain-dri for my armpits and it works wonders. Ive used other topical treatments for my hands, but it only seems to irritate them. I have also started taking Robinol but it only works a little bit. I am just looking for some words of wisdom or any possible solutions because I am getting pretty desperate. Thank you."

I’m 23 and work full Time in P&amp;C auto, currently in underwriting for a major insurer. I have no degree and will be going to school for the first time as a computer science major.

 I have had a hard time deciding which path I wanted to venture down, the challenge of becoming an actuary excites me.  What math classes should I focus on in school that will help me prepare for the exams?  I understand I need up to calculus 3, and obviously probability and stats.

 What are some other high level math classes I should focus on that would be beneficial? 

Also, can someone give me a reality check of what I would be getting myself into I understand the 100+ hour rule, what does that really looks like on a day to day bases and whats was you experience like? 

I have the option of getting a mentor at work that’s the closest thing I could get to an internship without quitting.

If I passed a couple of exams and hold a degree in Computer science would that be marketable, or should I focus on a degree in math? Would a degree in Statistics be more benficial then a degree in Mathematics?

Thanks for any feed back.
