I've had this plot kicking around for awhile and finally feel comfortable enough to share it with all of you. If you're interested, please PM me with your character idea, kinks, and limits. Any reply not containing all three will be ignored. Please be willing to write at least a paragraph per reply. Ages will be determined in PMs.

Tommy Daniels is one of the hottest young commodities in Hollywood. Despite being under 16, the actor has earned praise from A-list celebrity co-stars as being a talented professional, fun, and incredibly entertaining, Producers are lining up to cast him in movies, and Directors sing his praises. He had, by age 10, already starred in big-budget films as a main character, and doesn't seem to be stopping soon.

What no one except those around him knows is that the blond-haired and blue-eyed Tommy is a desperate, eager little bottom even in spite of his age. He goes out of his way to find at least one person to fuck him on each film he does - be they co-star or producer or director - and wins them over by indulging their darker sides: their kinks, their secret shames. He'll do anything to get the cock he's picked - and for his newest film, he's picked yours.

******

So are you a fellow young actor Tommy has set his sights on, or an older celebrity he's starring with? Perhaps you're the director or producer, or even the college intern who got stuck as Tommy's assistant. Anyone at all is welcome to be the object of the young star's attentions, and so long as you're willing to fuck him, he'll do anything you want to get your cock.

My only limits are Scat and Snuff, anything else is absolutely on the table, and kinks can be hammered out over PM. I hope to hear from you soon, APP!

6qst2p,15,2017-07-31,Advice on making connections?,PP8900,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/6qst2p/advice_on_making_connections/,"I often hear about the importance of connections in advertising. ""It's the only way in"" I'm told.

You all know the story by now - doing it on my own, in-house writer, so on and so forth.

I'm in NYC and open to pretty much any of the major cities to get my start as a junior or even intern.

But how does one go about making connections? Here's what I've done so far:

- emailed ACDs and CDs that I admire and/or whom are at a large agency in interested in working for and have asked for a portfolio review.

- started seeking out copywriters, CDs, etc. who have taken a similar route - doing it through continuing ed. and clawing out a job. They've been far more sympathetic and receptive. I'm meeting one for coffee Friday.

- I've connected with tons of recruiters on LinkedIn. I send a request with a small note as to who I am, what I'm looking for. The ones who respond seem to like my book, but very rarely offer to pass it on or actually help. They just give a nice review and move on.

Is there a certain or better way to approach people? I usually give a quick backstory, say how I'm trying to improve and ask for a review. If they give a good review, should I be asking for another connection or to passbook on my book?

Tl;dr: what's the best way to make connections that lead to jobs? Not just messaging on LinkedIn or emails - what should I be saying, etc."
6qt7m3,5,2017-07-31,"Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [21 F] of almost 3 years, she accidentally destroyed my confidence (long rant)",probablybadeverywher,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qt7m3/me_22_m_with_my_girlfriend_21_f_of_almost_3_years/,"So I'll preface by saying my girlfriend is amazing, and I love being with her. 

   Before we even knew each other, she was polygamous. She was very afraid of commitment from previous relationships, and was romantically involved with many of her friends. I was a shy, awkward guy and was never involved with any girls before her. We met and became great friends, and she also had a huge crush on me. 

   For over a year she hit on me and dropped hints that she wanted to take it further, and after awhile I developed feelings too. We hooked up a couple of times, and one night we were laying in bed and I asked what we were. I told her that I was not the kind of guy for polygamy, and if we were going to be romantically involved I could only be in a couple. She thought about it for a day or so and said she wanted us to be a monogamous relationship.

   Over the next couple years we fell deeply in love, talked about marrying and kids, lived together, I wont go into it but typical couples in love stuff. We would constantly tell each other that we wouldn't be able to handle seeing each other with another person. I would never tell her if I had a little crush because she would always get upset when I even showed any feelings of attraction for someone else. This past year we have been getting into arguments, not big ones but not small ones, typically just stemming from us living together or accidentally being altruistic about something. This would happen about every couple of weeks to once a month. It felt like we moved on from the honeymoon period but we were even more serious about each other. 

   This summer she stayed home while I went to NYC for an internship. I was so excited, and over the summer we didn't talk as much as normal, maybe once every few days. I was fine with it, until I got a phone call from her. She called me sobbing and freaking out, saying that she was playing an online game with a clan, and got really close with this one guy. She knew that he had a crush on her, and they would talk all day, and then eventually it led to them telling each other that they liked each other and talking until 4am about it. All I could focus on was calming her down and not letting her have a panic attack, and I was telling her over an over ""its okay, its fine, I'm fine, don't worry."" And I thought I was, crushes happen, its okay.

   A couple of days later it popped into my head, so I asked her about it. I was curious why she told him that, and what they talked about. She said she has to be honest with her friends, and they talked about their friendship and said pickup lines to each other and flirted all night. That led to a huge argument and she brought up opening up the relationship. I was destroyed, and I told her once again that I could not do that, and if that's what she wanted we're done. She stayed with me, but I told her I didn't want her doing that with another guy and she was reluctant about that. I told her I was uncomfortable with her talking to him, and she said that she wouldn't give up the friendship. After a couple of days I cooled off, we made up, and all was kinda well.

   I was feeling insecure today so I asked her who was more attractive objectively (dumb I know) wanting some reassurance. She said that we both were in our own way, and after a little prying she admitted that he was because he works out. I feel destroyed, I'm a really skinny guy and pretty self conscious about it. I feel like when I see her I cant take my shirt off because I just feel so ugly. It's like every time she complimented me or told me how cute/handsome/whatever I was, she was lying. I feel like I'm over reacting but with everything that happened I'm just more vulnerable to being insecure. Sorry for ranting.

TLDR: Girlfriend got intimate online with another guy and after we made up, told me he's more attractive than I am and I don't know how to handle it.

6qtmqe,1,2017-07-31,I [25F] feel like I really need to see a therapist but I'm scared to do so.,ScaredofTherapy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qtmqe/i_25f_feel_like_i_really_need_to_see_a_therapist/,"I have been having  a tough time for a while now. I am unhappy with work, distant from my friends, feel lonely all of the time, no longer enjoy any of my hobbies, have become sexually promiscuous, and it's become difficult to make myself get off the couch and actually do anything. I always regarded myself as an optimist but now it feels like nothing is worth being optimistic about. I've felt this way for a while, but the last several months I have often and overwhelming feelings of 'is anything worth it?'. I do not want to end my life, but I often daydream of sleeping for a whole month or living far, far, away from people in a cottage alone where no one can find me. 





All of those things scare me- and I acknowledge all that I've stated is a problem. I know the right thing to do is to seek help, see a therapist/counselor to help get myself back to the happy person I used to be. My problem is that I have been to therapy three separate times in my life and each time (with one possible exception, explained below)  I felt like it didn't provide any help or I wasn't taken seriously. 





The first time I was around 10. The reasoning I do not feel it has any relevance, but can be summed up by a rough upbringing. I remember feeling like it was a waste of time, but I was so young, I'm not sure it's fair to group it in with my bad experiences. I think I went for around 6 months - year. 







The second was at 17, after my Mom had more or less gave me no choice after struggling with some family issues and she found out I had been drinking fairly often. I met with a nice enough woman who asked me about my goals and relationships and hopes and dreams and yada yada. I was reluctant to be there but I was also internally excited to be able to talk to someone. It all felt so surface level though, and like she was going through the motions. I know I was pretty reserved, it takes a lot for me to let someone in and it felt like she wasn't even trying or taking me and my issues seriously. I only saw her for about three months, then college started and I just sort of stopped, it didn't feel worth it to continue.







The third and last time was when I was 23. This is when the feelings I spoke about earlier started. They were not as bad, and I was having some anxiety too, finding it difficult to transition into ""adulthood"" after graduating college when I was 22. I saw her for about 4 months. She did get a small crack into the surface of my problems, and came across at least mildly invested in helping. I don't feel like she really ""understood"" me though and she had what I felt like was a hard time understanding what my ""problems"" were and therefore how to ""fix"" them. I felt like she would try to minimize the hard times or problems I was having. I was no longer covered under insurance and in order to be able to afford to see her I had to go through some service that meant she was basically only an intern (her email tag said she was a MSW-intern, or something like that? MSW wasn't the name of the place.). After 3.5 months she informed me of when her last day was, leaving us only two sessions left, and asked if I felt like I wanted to speak to someone else there that she could refer me to after she left. This was super awkward, I wanted to say yes but I felt very pressured to say no, like she felt that I didn't need to, so I said no.








I can't live my life the way it is anymore and I need help. I want help. I just can't bear the thought of having another experience like any of the ones I previously had. I don't want to see someone who is going to make me feel like I'm overreacting and like my emotions and feelings are no valid, silly, and unimportant. I am afraid to go and then what if I do feel like that? What if it doesn't help? Did I just not spend enough time with any of the other therapists to ever actually see any results? How do I get over this fear? Maybe I am being overreacting  and my issues really aren't all that bad? 






I am ashamed to speak to my friends about this, and I would really appreciate any advice that may help. 








TL;DR- My life is crap. I'm unhappy, can't find joy in anything, and cry a lot. I think seeing a therapist might help but I've been to therapy three times previously and felt it didn't help and I wasn't' taken seriously. How do I get over this, or am I just being foolish and not in as bad of a place as I thought?

6qtmsc,10,2017-07-31,What I found in the Ashland Police department's evidence locker / The Worst Thing,professionalsuccubus,professionalsuccubus,https://www.reddit.com/r/professionalsuccubus/comments/6qtmsc/what_i_found_in_the_ashland_police_departments/,"In my senior year of college – this would have been in ’93 – my degree required an internship. Luckily, the local police department had a friendly relationship with the criminal justice faculty at my school. It was easy for me to nab a position in my fall semester, and most of the cops seemed like they enjoyed showcasing their expertise to a newbie. I enjoyed a couple weeks of ride-alongs and tours of the headquarters, but soon I felt like I’d gotten the gist of it, to be honest. This was a college town in rural Illinois, so it was basically drunk kids, meth cooks, meth users, and traffic tickets. Sprinkle on some bar fights, shoplifting, and domestic violence, and you had Ashland figured out.

My internship was made even better by my cousin, Frank, an Ashland cop, who saw to it that I wasn’t bored. He would show me which parts of town to avoid, tell me some of his “war stories”, and once, when we were patrolling late at night, he sped down a stretch of road while blasting the theme song from “Cops”.

It’s been long enough, so I’m not worried about getting myself or Frank in trouble now. He left the force in 2007 and has been working happily in private security ever since. I ended up staying on the academic track and am similarly unconcerned about getting in trouble for something I did over two decades ago.

The thing I shouldn’t have done was photocopy police evidence without permission and keep it. I still have the copies - one letter and some journal pages - sitting right next to me as I type this. I had forgotten about it, until I read my email this morning and saw a message from Frank. Then I went to the basement, where I kept all the nostalgic junk from my adolescence and early adulthood, and started digging through boxes.

I can’t explain why I kept those pages for so long. The shock value alone is probably a sufficient enough explanation, but there was something else...some sentimentality or something. The woman who wrote them is gone and has no family, and some part of me hated the thought of her existence winking out of memory, like a dying star.

The night I copied the evidence was a Friday. I was scheduled to be at the police department from 4:00 PM to midnight. Frank was working, so he scooped me up, and we set out in his squad car. A couple speeding tickets, a wellness check, and one sub sandwich later, the sun was setting. Frank turned around in a cul-de-sac to begin patrolling his sector again. Navigating the winding neighborhoods, he slowed as we passed one block.

“Has anyone told you about the murder that happened over here?” he said with dramatic intonation.

My interest was piqued. In three weeks of shadowing, one noticeably absent part of this internship was the regaling of famous local crimes. Tempted by the prospect of an eerie tale to usher in the fall evening, I told him I hadn’t.

Frank pointed to one of the homes, a small farmhouse with a wraparound porch. Its white paint was peeling, and although it looked small, it had a second story with a large balcony.

“So, in the 80s, a lady named Alice Weiss lived in that house. A guy named Colton lived over there.” He pointed to the powder blue house next door. It was in better shape than the white house, but it still looked pretty run-down. The vinyl siding was dirty. Unkempt vines choked the porch’s latticework. Unlike the rest of the homes in the neighborhood, this one still had a gravel driveway, peppered with tufts of weeds.

“Then around Thanksgiving, cops get a call about gunshots coming from the Colton house. They show up and find Weiss on his front porch with her brains blown out and Colton inside in the same condition.

“What got people extra riled up is that Weiss had pentagram-shaped burns on both of her arms. Coroner said they were a decade old, at least. Colton’s body had pentagrams carved into his skin too, but they were fresh. It looked like Weiss did it before she killed him.”

“Well, this was right in the middle of all the 80s Satanic panic, right?” I said (secretly hoping Frank would think I was knowledgeable).

“Right,” he said absently. “But that bullshit cropped up all across the country, and there were plenty of alleged cases without any real evidence to back up the accusations. Here, we had a case with flesh-and-blood victims, one of which had Satanic markings on her body predating that whole fiasco.”

“Fair enough,” I replied.

Frank made a right at the stop sign and continued through the neighborhood. “That’s kind of the end of the story, unfortunately. Weiss had been mentally ill for most of her life and people were exactly as understanding as you’d think. Everybody assumed she was just a crazy woman who worshiped the Devil because that’s what crazy people do, and when that wasn’t enough, she murdered her neighbor.”

I mulled over his words as a silence overtook the cruiser.

Frank broke the quiet a few minutes later, when we emerged out on the main road. “And as much as people tried to forget it happened, the Weiss case just stuck with people. Colton had been her neighbor since she was born, known her family, known her grandparents. They lived next to each other for over thirty years, and then one day out of the blue, she just murders him and offs herself –”

A tinny voice on Frank’s walkie interrupted him. Dispatch needed an officer to come back to the station and help with an emergency ex parte order.

When we got there, a distraught woman with a black eye was sitting in the lobby, rapidly tapping her foot against the tiles. Frank gave me a knowing look and told me to go find Sergeant Tate; he would come get me when he was done writing the report.

The Ashland Police Department was clearing out old files to be moved to off-site storage, and today it was Sergeant Tate’s problem. I helped him move box after box, looking longingly at some of the files. After thirty minutes, the sergeant told me in a low voice he was going out back for a smoke. On his way out, he called out over his shoulder in a teasing voice, “No peeking, now.”

Offering him an empty promise not to, I stood obediently until I heard the door shut behind him. Then I went to work. I rifled through every box, content to read a little here and there, but at the front of my mind was the story Frank had told me less than an hour before. After a few minutes of unstacking boxes and hectic shuffling, I hadn’t found any files from before 1979. The excitement I’d felt gave way to resignation. I wouldn’t be finding anything on Alice Weiss in here.

Nevertheless, I continued to look through the old files, though at a slower pace. There was still a chance I might find something. Plus, I reasoned that I might as well look while I had the time. My instincts ended up proving correct. My heart rate quickened once I started to see dates from 1980, then 1981. I kept going until, in a box of files from 1984, I saw it. One manila folder bore the label: “010111785--009 WEISS HOUSE”. I glanced around and pulled it out of the box.

The folder contained only a letter and a small journal, both bagged. Automatically, I threw it back in the box and carried the whole thing to the adjacent corner, where there was a small desk, a file cabinet, and a copier. I peered out the door frame, saw nothing, heard nothing. I cracked the photocopier cover and slid the letter, still in its plastic, underneath, and hit “Start”. The machine whirred to life, and I whirled around and started to loudly re-stack some of the boxes. I knew Sergeant Tate smoked American Spirits, so I had a comfortable eight to ten minutes before he returned, and I’d used at least five searching the boxes.

The second the copier had finished, I put away the letter, maneuvered the journal open, and began on the first few pages of that. I had never felt so tense, and the compulsion to duplicate those documents was not one I could explain. I had started, and I barreled on to finish, feeling dread at both the potential for trouble and the prospect of not succeeding.

When the final page came out, I returned the journal to its box, folded up the papers, and shoved them into my small purse. Then, since I didn’t hear Sergeant Tate, I decided to re-arrange some of the boxes to hide my unexplainably desperate search. By the time he returned, smelling faintly of smoke and humming tunelessly, I had calmed down and resumed my normal work.

I finished my shift, intensely aware of the paper crammed in my bag. When I got back to my apartment, it was blissfully empty, the remnants of my roommates’ pre-party lying scattered around our living room. Hesitant to look at my spoils, I changed into pajamas and reheated some leftovers. I eyed my purse as I ate. Once the food was gone, I retrieved the wad of paper.

The evidence tag was blurry, but legible on the page beneath the writing. Dated 11/17/85, it referenced a case number and listed case type as “homicide/suicide”.

I read the one-page letter first. It was written on lined notebook paper in confident, swooping cursive. I’m transcribing it below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*My name is Alice Weiss. I’m thirty-three. I still live in the house I was raised in. 3106 Birch Lane. I have been in and out of psychiatric care for over half of my life. Recently, my therapist and I have been doing some new things to try and get at some of my problems. Among other things, I’ve been having nightmares on and off for the past fifteen or sixteen years. I can’t glean anything useful from them. Just an unhelpful combination of darkness, candlelight, fear, pain, screaming, nausea.*

*So, after failed attempts at everything from cognitive-behavioral therapies to medication and dietary changes, she’s asked me to keep a dream diary. If I commit to writing down anything and everything I remember, she says I may understand a little more about what is actually happening in my dreams. The last few weeks, I’ve been writing down what I remember when the dreams wake me up in the middle of the night. I didn’t read any of the entries until earlier today. I was afraid of how it would all sound in the daylight.*

*It worked, but I don’t think this is what my therapist meant to happen. I remember where the burns came from it wasn’t something I did to myself like Momma told Dr. Colton I remember everything now and I’m going to kill that son of a bitch*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second item was a black notebook, one of the small, pocket-sized ones. The handwriting is barely recognizable, but the evidence tag says it was written by Alice and found in her house. The handwriting was a similar type of cursive, but the lines were bolder and narrower, like their author was stricken with urgency.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The day after my fifteenth birthday, Mr. Colton came over asking to borrow some sugar. Mr. Colton was my parents’ age but he lived with his elderly mother. Thus, he had acquired the label of “weird old man”, the kind of unspoken distrust that we kids felt towards unmarried adults. His eyes roved up and down my body as he asked. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*Before I could give him the sugar, he lunged at me, pressed a cloth over my mouth. When I woke up, I was blindfolded and bound at the wrists and ankles. I never found out where I was. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*I think I’m underground. I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days, at least. The room I’m in is small, no windows. I don’t think it was built by professionals. The room seems to be hewn out of solid rock. There aren’t the reassuring right angles of newer construction.*

*Mostly men, but sometimes women, come and go, bringing me food and taking it away and bringing me a chamber pot and taking it away. I think they’re all different but it’s hard to tell. They don’t speak much and their hoods cover their faces. Sometimes they forget to bring me food and sometimes they forget to take the chamber pot away. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*I think they drug me quite often. A few times I’ve passed out suddenly, and when I wake up, my body hurts. Sometimes I have bruises and cuts without knowing where they came from. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*The drugging, passing out, waking up with injuries has been getting worse. This last time, I woke up with my forearms all bandaged up. Whatever’s underneath hurts, it burns and itches. I’m too tired to look. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*They feed me bread and water once a day. Once, I complained that I was still hungry. My keeper suggested I eat some of the roaches. The candlelight twisted his grin into a cruel mosaic. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*I wake up to a new pain. My insides hurt...I don’t know what they’ve done to me this time. They treat me better now, so I try not to think about it. I get more food, candles, and a few extra blankets to sleep on. They’ve started posting someone outside my door at all times. The person is always humming something low and tuneless, like a Gregorian chant. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*Time passes. My belly swells. The bandages on my arms disappear one day. Two circles with a star inside. I might have been angry or upset about this once, but now I just don’t care much.*

*One night, I am ripped out of my sleep by a ripping pain coming from below. I scream into the tiny concrete room I am in. I keep screaming and screaming until they come. I don’t get any drugs this time. I feel split in half, before God and everyone, more opened and vulnerable than I have been this entire time. The pain is so bad I forget how much I hate Mr. Colton and his friends as they tend to me. I beg for them to kill me. It takes hours before the baby comes out. I thought this was the worst thing.*

*I rest, and they take the baby away. If this were one of Momma’s radio dramas, I would scream and cry more, rage until all of my energy is gone, demand to see my baby. But I don’t want to see it. I don’t want anything but my room, my school, old life back.*

*Today I hear footsteps approaching my prison. They tell me everything will be okay as long as I do one more thing.*

*The scream that erupts from my throat is louder than any noise I made with the baby. They bring me a platter with a tiny, frail human figure on it, the flesh charred and blackened.*

*They tell me to eat. This is the worst thing.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So yeah. I was a little shaken after reading. Luckily, I still had ten weeks left in the internship. I was able to get a little more information out of Frank and some of the other cops, including some who had been around when the murder occurred.

One of them, Lieutenant Mueller, remembered some of the facts floating around in the aftermath of the deaths. Roughly forty years apart in age, Alice Weiss had lived next to her eventual victim, Randall Colton, for her entire life (excluding her hospitalizations). Doing my best to act like just another college kid intrigued by cheap gore and true crime, I mentioned Frank had spoken about pentagram burns on Alice.

“Her psychiatric records specifically acknowledged the burns, because they were the reason she was admitted to her first facility when she was a teenager,” he told me. “Her mother says she found the burns when the girl started wearing long sleeves, even in July. Weiss claimed she had no memory of where they came from...but, even as a teenager, her records also spoke to a history of depression, hallucinations, and self-harm.”

I brought it up again with Frank, a few weeks later. Specifically, when I was at lunch with Frank and one of the Ashland PD’s detectives. I can’t remember his name, unfortunately. I do remember Frank telling me he was a Chicago cop before moving to Ashland, which is why “he’s the only one who doesn’t get fazed by this stuff.”

My biggest question was the connection between Randall Colton and the Dr. Colton mentioned in Alice’s final letter, and the grizzled detective answered it without even realizing it.

“I get why people react so strongly to the Weiss thing,” he said, in between French fries. “You live right up next to people, sometimes for years, and they’re never a threat to you, and then suddenly they’re the worst kind of threat. And in small towns like this it affects people even more powerfully because you’re naturally more interconnected. Hell, we even found out in the course of that investigation that Randall Colton’s brother was a psychiatrist over at Marion South State Hospital and he treated Alice Weiss back in the sixties when she had her first breakdown.”

So that’s all, right? A young girl in a small town, stricken with poor health at an early age, in a time when mental health treatment was still young, struggling for years before ending it all in a terrible fashion. Time goes on, family homes empty and refill, case files get put in off-site storage, people forget.

The reason I dug out my copy of Alice’s last words were because – as mentioned earlier – Frank sent me a short email this morning, asking if I remembered about the murder house from my internship. He attached an article from the Ashland local news attached.

3104 Birch Lane - Randall Colton’s old house - burned to the ground yesterday. The tenants were making meth there, and the house exploded. Three people died.

Once the flames were out and emergency responders were able to properly investigate the scene, they found a crude sub-basement. Frank told me he’d heard from one of his old buddies that the room must have been decades old, constructed well before things like home inspections and building permits were a reality.

Through a hidden door carved out of the foundation, they found small hallway leading to a smaller room. I didn’t ask Frank if they found any pentagrams on the walls. I’m sure he would have told me if they had.

The way Frank put it in his email, “hacking into the ground like that, it’s a miracle the house didn’t collapse twenty years ago.”

Although I know he didn’t mean to be ironic, I’m not sure “miracle” is the word I would use.

October 2015: 27 yr old me went straight from the US military to a job in sunny Spain. While I was in, I was stationed in a military town with hardly any civilians. Translation: A single young male had about as much luck of finding a S/O as the USA winning the World Cup next year. That meant that I kept myself clean of STD's and messy relationships by staying single my entire contract. 


When I arrived in Europe, I was blown away by the amount of pretty girls around. I am no model, but I would like to think that I am passable physically. So before long, a stunning young French student (20) became interested in me. On holiday with my new Euro friends, she became very drunk, cornered me in a club, and told me some very sensual things in my ear. Before long, she then went to flirt with another random dude. Confused, I waited outside with my Honduran friend, who was irritated at babysitting her. 20 minutes later, she walks back out, motions me inside, and upon re-entering, she presses her lips against me and we make out. I was bewildered, but ultimately forgot about her flirting and went with it. 



We began to see each other over the next several months, but in secret, as she did not want to tell all of our mutual friends. Being piss poor at hiding things, our friends found out and did not approve. They often made fun of her for not being the best student (this girl turned in assignments late, showed up to class late, was often yelled at by professors), and for being very ditzy. One friend specifically told me that she was playing me as she had others, utilising her good looks. I nodded my head, but continued to see her anyway. 


Over time I began to grow irritated at the amount of English I spoke, for I had ventured to Spain to finally master Spanish. I am hispanic but couldn't speak the language, so the time spent over there was VERY important. However, Frenchie loved all things USA including American English, so she made every effort to speak it with me, even getting irritated at me for trying to switch to Spanish. My level stagnated, and I began to distance myself. 


Off and on becomes the norm, and during each off time, I made a selfish effort to find other girls. I slept with a Spaniard and an English girl. This began to cloud my judgement, and made me feel proud for ugly old me to suddenly have options. During this time, she did the same and fooled around with three other Spaniards (how far they went I'll never know), and experimented with drugs. 


July 2016: she moved in and we continue, eventually going to her house in France after her internship ended and I meet the whole family. They loved me, especially her mother. We vacationed at her parents' house in the South of France. Afterwards, I returned to my job in Spain and she expected that we would continue a long-distance relationship. 


But I didn't. She called and skyped me dozens of times a day, but I remained distant. I continued with my friends, drank myself stupid, did my job, flirted with girls, and returned little interest in the relationship. She bragged about me to her friends and at her university, while I refused to communicate everyday. 


Nov 2016: It damaged her, and eventually she grew angry, telling me that she didn't care anymore. She went personal, attacking my level of Spanish among other things, and when I returned the animosity, she apologised, pleading for me to not hang up. I told her that I didn't think that this was going to last, due to it being a long-distance relationship and my interest being more in Spain rather than France (which I still want to go for the language). She said that she was done with my immaturity. 


But she still called in, sent texts saying that she missed me. I offered to go see her at Xmas 2016, but she refused, citing not enough room. The messages continued up until March 2017, when she embarked to NYC for a marketing internship. The first two weeks she texted me, marveling at her first time in the US, asking me to come visit her. One day, she texted me making fun of my teaching job, my lack of a Master's degree (she is currently getting hers) and how I never spoke good English with her, saying that it was refreshing to have people speak normal to her (I used to joke with her accent at the beginning of our relationship). I responded saying that we should stop talking, because it was clear that she was sending little jabs at me. She grew angry, told me to stop talking to her and blocked me on Whatsapp. I went to Messenger and sent a long text, reviewing our relationship, the good and bad, saying that I meant her no ill will, did not hate her, and wished her the best. 


She didn't answer, and I began to regret doing that. I sent another message saying that I was sorry and that I was available to talk when she wanted. She never answered, and that was that. 


Fast forward a month or so, I stumbled across her Instagram. She had it full of pics from her new internship in the greatest city in the world, along with gym shots with her new bodybuilder boyfriend, who looked strikingly similar to me (just more buff than me, obviously). Same ethnicity, facial structure, hair, eyes, etc. She also has a ton of quality model pics where she looks amazing. 


This began a pattern of checking every bit of her social media everyday under fake profiles, sometimes up to 12x a day. I learned that she is doing quite well, making great money, and building contacts in freaking NYC. 


Meanwhile I have returned to the States, broken-hearted, depressed in my podunk country Southern town, and lament for what I've done. I can't stop fawning over her new life, and hate the monster that I was. I was the scum that treated her like dirt and I am truly sorry for what I have done. My own family has suffered divorce twice, and I had vowed to never become a bad man, but I was with her. I thought with my manhood rather than my brain. 


To top it off, two weeks ago I got a message from her on Messenger saying in Spanish that she missed me along with a few sad emojis. I should have thought before responding, but I jumped at it and said that I was glad that she responded to me and that I hoped that she was doing well. A few minutes later, she coldly answered, claiming it was her bf that had taunted me with that message, ending with a harsh, ""Bye."" She did not block me, however. 


From there, she took off all pics from Instagram relating to the city where we met, and I have not heard from her since. 


I write to ya'll because I need help. I don't know what to do, as my work involves me being on a computer, which makes it super easy to sneak peeks at her new life online. My job in the fateful city where we met has offered me more money to fly back across the pond, but it is a teaching job, which she made fun of. Meanwhile, she is on her way to massive success, her Master's, money, along with a rich, younger, bodybuilder boyfriend. I feel so depressed, but am not mad at her; I hate myself her for being such a douchebag. I hate the garbage that I was, and have vowed to never, ever be a Don Juan again. 

It's just hard suffering the consequences.

6quafx,4,2017-08-01,Looking to try to land an internship for next summer. Wondering if it's possible to teach myself a relevant programming language.,superduperm1,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6quafx/looking_to_try_to_land_an_internship_for_next/,"Greetings, /r/actuary. Been browsing here for awhile, now posting for the first time. Let me explain my situation.

I will be a junior this coming fall, and I'm aware that come late-September, I'll need to start shooting out as many applications as I can to even have a chance. I go to a small university on the west coast (major disadvantage in this field, I know) but I have a ~3.92 GPA and currently have one exam passed (Exam P in May). I'm currently studying the ASM Manual for Exam FM, which I will take in two weeks. I'll be brutally honest, I'm pessimistic and feel like my chances of passing are a coin flip at best, but who knows.

I've also worked a part-time (20-40 hours/week) summer job last year and this year (work as a lego engineering camp assistant for children), am currently the sports section editor for my campus newspaper (a lot of communication, obviously, so I feel its relevant) and I grade Calculus/Statistics assignments for certain classes in my department. This is all the work experience I have over the past two years (my advisor insists I exclude anything I've done in high school.)

The one key thing I feel I'm missing (and feel free to comment if there's any other key components I'm missing) is knowledge in a relevant programming language. I've taken classes in Java and C++ (which are a requirement for my major), but these are apparently not important at all in the actuarial world. For this reason, I feel that I should spend the last couple weeks of my summer and early part of the school year taking a break from exam studying and try to learn something. Is it by any chance possible to teach myself VBA and its applications over the course of a month or two? Perhaps I could do a couple projects in my leisure time just to understand how to adequately use it? How could I go about doing this? I want to know enough so that in an interview I am capable of explaining how I learned it, what ways I've practiced it and of course be able to use it in the real world, at least on a basic level.

P.S. If I fail Exam FM, will my odds of landing an internship be significantly diminished?

Thanks!"
6quwgu,1,2017-08-01,Sigh,corjizzle,SeawhalessWrites,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeawhalessWrites/comments/6quwgu/sigh/,"I continue to fall asleep and wake up hoping to see her name on my phone, and then get extremely sad when I don't. I'm up to four pills to sleep, now. 

I'm struggling hard. This shit blows. We are basically cut off now that I deleted my social medias, and I know she won't text me but I keep getting so hopeful. Why? I couldn't tell you. It's 430 in the morning and I'm more or less crying currently. 

I continue to sleep with this little pillow of hers. It freaks me out when I can't find it. I should throw it away, or hide it, same with the pictures of us. Every time I see her name or face it gets worse, I think.

ugh.. 

It's weird to me also, that like a month before it happened, I had been having a lot of convos in my head about how I would ask her dad for his acceptance to propose. Like at least one a week I was considering how it would go and how I would approach him about it. It was setting up to be the perfect time line: propose before she graduated, we live with each other for almost a year and a half while she finishes school and does her internship, and then before she gets her diploma she would have the chance to take my name if she wanted.

Fuck. 

I thought that after a week or two this sick joke would be over. 

I just weighed myself. 204.6 for like the third day in a row. Since It's the first of the month, I'm hoping I can get to 195 by the end of it. I've got a lot of extra skin hanging around that I can dispose of, hopefully. 

She always jokingly said that I was a fat ass, but I was so comfortable in the 'ship that it didn't matter. Now I need to win her back and I'm dropping it like crazy, and eating way better too.

One thing I'm hoping to do is challenge her with the FitBit I got. That's a thing, right? You can compete against other people within the app?

Either way, I'm still a nutless POS that is doing a lot to win her back, and I hope it's enough in the long run. "

I always thought I could fight it on my own but guess it just wasn't enough. I started taking Prozac a couple of weeks ago and it hasn't gotten any better. I took a blood test and apparently I'm anemic as well. This might explain why my hair has been clogging the drain lately. I used to have so much hair too..


I just don't feel like doing anything. I'm tired all the time. A new semester has started and I really need to up my game but even getting out of bed takes so much effort. I wanna eat a particular food but even chewing food seems to need effort. I'm having smoothies a lot more lately just cause I don't feel like chewing. I stopped taking care of my appearance long time ago. I only really shower when I have to go out.


I really hope prozac will kick in soon and help me. At this point I'm dying for it to work. I have dreams, ambitions, and things to look forward to but I don't have energy to do anything about it. I wanna get fit, I wanna get good results, I wanna find an internship but damn it's like I'm possessed and can't do anything. It makes me even more stressed that I'm not doing anything. Life sucks..

Is anyone on prozac? I've been on it for 4 weeks now and nothing has changed.. my doctor said to give it another 3 weeks and see how I feel.. does it usually take this long? :c"

Growing up in Southern California, Mai-Ling Garcia’s grades were ragged; her long-term plans nonexistent. At age 20, she was living with her in-laws halfway between Los Angeles and the Mojave Desert, while her husband was stationed abroad. Tired of working subsistence jobs, she decided in 2001 to try a few classes at Mount San Jacinto community college.

Nobody pegged her for greatness at first. A psychology professor, Maria Lopez-Moreno recalls Garcia sitting in the midst of a lecture hall, fiddling constantly with a cream-colored scarf. Then something started to catch. After a spirited discussion about the basis for criminal behavior, Lopez-Moreno took this newcomer aside after class and asked: “Why are you here?”

Garcia blurted out a tangled story of marrying a Marine right after high school, seeing him head off to Iraq, and not knowing what to do next. Lopez-Moreno couldn’t walk away. “I said to myself: ‘Uh-oh. I’ve got to suggest something to her.’” At her professor’s urging, Garcia applied for a place in Mt. San Jacinto’s honors program—and began to thrive.

Nourished by smaller classes and motivated peers, Garcia earned straight-A grades for the first time. She emerged as a leader in diversity initiatives, too, drawing on her own multicultural heritage (Filipino and Irish). Shortly before graduation, she won admission to the University of California, Berkeley, campus, where she could pursue a bachelor’s degree.

Today, Garcia is a leading digital strategist for the city of Oakland, California. Rather than rely on an M.B.A. or a technical major, she has capitalized on a seldom-appreciated liberal-arts discipline—sociology—to power her career forward. Now, she describes herself as a “bureaucratic ninja” who doesn’t hide her stormy journey. Instead, she recognizes it as a valuable asset.

“I know what it’s like to be too poor to own a computer,” Garcia told me recently. “I’m the one in meetings who asks: ‘Never mind how well this new app works on an iPhone. Will it run on an old, public-library computer, because that’s the only way some of our residents will get to use it?’”

By its very name, the liberal-arts pathway is tinged with privilege. Blame this on Cicero, the ancient Roman orator, who championed the arts _quae libero sunt dignae (_cerebral studies suited for freemen), as opposed to the practical, servile arts suited for lower-class tradespeople. Even today, liberal-arts majors in the humanities and social sciences often are portrayed as pursuing elitist specialties that only affluent, well-connected students can afford.

Look more closely, though, and this old stereotype is starting to crumble. In 2016, the National Association of Colleges and Employers [surveyed](http://ift.tt/2uU5XU6) 5,013 graduating seniors about their family backgrounds and academic paths. The students most likely to major in the humanities or social sciences—33.8 percent of them—were those who were the first generation in their family ever to have earned college degrees. By contrast, students whose parents or other forbears had completed college chose the humanities or social sciences 30.4 percent of the time.

Pursuing the liberal-arts track isn’t a quick path to riches. First-job salaries tend to be lower than what’s available with vocational degrees in fields such as nursing, accounting, or computer science. That’s especially true for first-generation students, who aren’t as likely to enjoy family-aided access to top employers. NACE found that first-generation students on average received post-graduation starting salaries of $43,320, about 12 percent below the pay packages being landed by peers with multiple generations of college experience.

Mai-Ling Garcia (Elizabeth Corcoran) Yet over time, liberal-arts graduates’ earnings often surge, especially for students pursuing advanced degrees. History majors often become well-paid lawyers or judges after completing law degrees, a recent [analysis](http://ift.tt/2qcUfSa) by the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project has found. Many philosophy majors put their analytical and argumentative skills to work on Wall Street. International-relations majors thrive as overseas executives for big corporations, and so on.

For college leaders, the liberal arts’ appeal across the socioeconomic spectrum is both exciting and daunting. As Dan Porterfield, the president of Pennsylvania’s Franklin and Marshall College, points out, first-generation students “may come to college thinking: ‘I want to be a doctor. I want to help people.’ Then they discover anthropology, earth sciences, and many other new fields. They start to fall in love with the idea of being a writer or an entrepreneur. They realize: ‘I just didn’t have a broad enough vision of how to be a difference maker in society.’”

A close look at the career trajectories of liberal-arts graduates highlights five factors—beyond traditional classroom academics—that can spur long-term success for anyone from a non-elite background. Strong support from a faculty mentor is a powerful early propellant. In [a survey](http://ift.tt/2ve8OKn) of about 1,000 college graduates, Richard Detweiler, president of the Great Lakes Colleges Association,  found that students who sought out faculty mentors were nearly twice as likely to end up in leadership positions later in life.

Other positive factors include a commitment to keep learning after college; a willingness to move to major U.S. job hubs such as Seattle, Silicon Valley, or the greater Washington, D.C., area; and the audacity to dream big. Finally, students who enter college without well-connected relatives—the sorts who can tell you what classes to take or how to win a choice summer internship—benefit from programs designed to build up professional networks and social capital.

Among the groups offering career-readiness programs on campus is Braven, a nonprofit founded by Aimée Eubanks Davis, a former Teach for America executive. Making its debut in 2014, Braven already has reached about 1,000 students at Rutgers University-Newark in New Jersey and San Jose State University in California. Expansion into the Midwest is on tap. Braven mixes students majoring in the liberal arts and those pursuing vocational degrees in each cohort, the theory being that all can learn from one another.

One of Braven’s Newark enrollees in 2015 was Dyllan Brown-Bramble, a transfer student earning strong grades in psychology, who didn’t feel at all connected to the New Jersey campus. Commuting from his parents’ home, he usually arrived at Rutgers just a few minutes before 10 a.m. classes started. Once afternoon courses were done, he’d retreat to Parking Lot B and rev up his 2003 Sentra. By 3:50 p.m., he’d be gone.

Brown-Bramble’s parents are immigrants from Dominica. His father runs a small construction business; his mother, a Baruch College graduate, manages a tourism office. Privately, the Rutgers student is quite proud of them, but it seemed pointless to explain his Caribbean origins to strangers. They typically reacted inappropriately. Some imagined him to be the son of dirt-poor refugees struggling to rise above a shabby past. Others assumed he was a world-class genius: “an astrophysicist who could fly.” There wasn’t any room for him to be himself.

When Brown-Bramble encountered a campus flier urging students to enroll in small evening workshops called the Braven Career Accelerator, he took the bait. “I knew I was supposed to be networking in college,” he later told me. “I thought: Okay, here’s a chance to do something.”

Suddenly, Rutgers became more compelling. For nine weeks, Brown-Bramble and four other students of color became evening allies. They met in an empty classroom each Tuesday at six to construct LinkedIn profiles and practice mock interviews. They picked up tips about local internships, aided by a volunteer coach whose life and background was much like theirs. They united as a group, discussing each person’s weekly highs and lows while encouraging one another to keep trying for internships and better grades. “We had a saying,” Brown-Bramble recalled. “If one of us succeeds, all of us succeed.”

Most of the volunteer coaches came from minority backgrounds, too. Among them: Josmar Tejeda, who had graduated from the New Jersey Institute of Technology five years earlier with an architecture degree. Since graduating, Tejeda had worked at everything from social-media jobs to being an asbestos inspector. As the coach for Brown-Bramble’s group, Tejeda combined relentless optimism with an acknowledgment that getting ahead wasn’t easy.

“Keep it real,” Tejeda kept telling his students as they talked through case studies and their own goals. Everyone did so. That feeling of being the only black or Latino person in the room? The awkwardness of always being asked: Where are you from? The strains of always trying to be the “model minority”? Familiar territory for everyone.

“It was liberating,” Brown-Bramble told me. Surrounded by sympathetic peers, Brown-Bramble discovered new ways to share his heritage in job interviews. Yes, some of his Caribbean relatives had arrived in the United States not knowing how to fill out government forms. As a boy, he had needed to help them. But that was all right. In fact, it was a hidden strength. “I could create a culture story that worked for me,” Brown-Bramble said. “I can relate to people with different backgrounds. There’s nothing about me that I have to rise above.”

This summer, with the support of [Inroads](https://inroads.org/), a nonprofit that promotes workforce diversity, Brown-Bramble is interning in the compliance department of Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical maker. Riding the strength of a 3.8 grade-point average, he plans to get a law degree and work in a corporate setting for a few years to pay off his student loans. Then he hopes to set up his own law firm, specializing in start-up formation. “I’d like to help other entrepreneurs do things in Newark,” he told me.

Organizations like Braven draw on “the power of the cohort,” said Shirley Collado, president of Ithaca College and a former top administrator at Rutgers-Newark. When students settle into small groups with trustworthy peers, she explained, candor takes hold. The sterile dynamic of large lectures and solo homework assignments gives way to a motivation-boosting alliance among seat mates and coaches. “You build social capital where it didn’t exist before,” Collado said.

For Mai-Ling Garcia, the leap from community college to Berkeley was perilous. Arriving at the famous university’s campus, she and her then-husband were so short on cash that they subsisted most days on bowls of ramen. Scraping by on partial scholarships, neither knew how to get the maximum available financial aid. To cover expenses, Garcia took a part-time job teaching art at a grade-school recreation center in Oakland.

Finishing college can become impossible in such circumstances. During her second semester, Garcia began tracking down what she now refers to as “a series of odd little foundations with funky scholarships.” People wanted to help her. Before long, she was attending Berkeley on a full ride. Her money problems abated. What she couldn’t forget was that initial feeling of being in trouble and ill-prepared. Her travails were pulling her into sociology’s most pressing issues: how vulnerable people fare in a world they don’t understand, and what can be done to improve their lives.

Simultaneously, Berkeley’s professors were arming Garcia with tools that would define her career. She spent a year learning the fine points of ethnography from a Vietnam-era Marine, Martin Sanchez-Jankowski, who taught students how to conduct field research. He sent Garcia into the Oakland courthouse to watch judges in action, advising her to heed the ways racial differences tinged courtroom conduct. She learned to take careful notes, to be explicit about her theories and assumptions, and to operate with a rigor that could withstand peer-review scrutiny. Her professors would stay in academia; she was being trained to have an impact in the wider world.

What can one do with a sociology degree? Garcia tried a lot of different jobs in her first few years after graduation. She spent two years at a nonprofit trying to untangle Veterans Administration bureaucracy. After that, she dedicated three years to a position at the Department of Labor, winning many small battles related to veterans’ employment. She had found job security, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that a technology revolution was racing through the private sector—and leaving government far behind.

Companies like Lyft, Airbnb, and Instagram were putting new powers in the public’s hands, giving them handy tools to hail a ride, find lodging, or share photos. By comparison, trying to change a jury-duty date remained a clumsy slog through outdated websites. Instead of bemoaning this tech gap, Garcia decided to gain vital tech skills herself. She signed up for evening classes in digital marketing and refined that knowledge during an 18-month stint at a startup. Then she began hunting for a government job with impact.

In 2014, Garcia joined the City of Oakland as a bridge builder who could amp up online government services on behalf of the city’s 400,000 residents. This wasn’t just an exercise in technology upgrading; it required a fundamental rethinking of the way that Oakland delivered services. Buffers between city workers and an impatient public would come down. The social structures of power would change. To make this transition, it helped to have a digitally savvy sociologist in the house.

Over coffee one afternoon, Garcia told me excitedly about the progress that she and the city communications manager were achieving with their initiative. If street-art creators want more recognition for their work, Garcia can drum up interest on social media. If garbage is piling up, new digital tools let citizens visit the city’s Facebook page and summon services within seconds.

Looking ahead, Garcia envisions a day when landing a municipal job becomes vastly easier, with cities’ Twitter feeds posting each new opening. Other aspects of digital technology ought to help residents connect quickly with whatever part of government matters to them—whether that means signing up for summer camp or giving the mayor a piece of one’s mind.

**Players In/Retained Comments**

**Bennett** is the big external signing of this group. Bennett is the day one starter at TE and is a straight upgrade over last year. To add to the TE party we brought in **Kendricks** so not only did our #1 get better but our #2 did as well. Our top trio of TEs right now looks very good. With the departure of Lang on the OL we brought in **Evans** at RG, while he may not be the player he once was he should be a more than serviceable stopgap for a season, especially as a pass blocker. **House** and **Jean Francois** bring solid veteran presences in two defensive groups, something that has sorely been lacking the last couple seasons. **House** returns to the Packers after a stint at Jacksonville, while he never lived up to his contract in Jacksonville he was actually a pretty decent player with us in the past, hopefully switching up schemes will see a return to form.

In regards to in house signings **Perry** was the big catch here. He might be sliding under some peoples radar but over the past season he put up double digit sacks while also being a plus run defender. **Barclay** retains his spot as the do-it-all OL guy, **Elliott** brings some much needed EDGE depth, and **Tripp** was quietly one of our best special teams contributors at the end of last season.

**McCray** most likely doesn't make the roster after coming from the Arena Football League (interesting tidbit, we had his twin brother in camp previously) and **Hart** is interesting because he was completely out of football last year and is currently the only LS on our roster so he stands a good chance coming from the street to starting.

**Players Lost/Released Comments**

---

Well, I'll be the first to say this looks like a bunch of big losses. However, considering the pieces we picked up in replacement it isn't as terrible as it could be. In terms of positional talent drop off the biggest concern is probably CB. Even though **Shields** missed almost the entirety of last season his loss leaves us in another year of lots of questions at the CB position, our most veteran guy back there now is **House** who really hasn't been that great of lately and the rest of the CB roster is on essentially rookie contracts. Losing **Lang** hurts but **Evans** should be a serviceable stopgap. **Tretter** we realistically couldn't maintain, but he would have been a fantastic backup. **Cook** we upgraded on. **Lacy**, and really all the RBs, will be missed just because it leaves us with a lot of questions but Lacy didn't want to stay and the other RBs weren't terrible impressive.

The two most intriguing losses might end up being **Hyde** and **Jones**. Hyde was always a solid field player and above average punt returner with us and it will be interesting to watch how he does with more opportunities at his more natural safety role in Buffalo. Jones really got screwed with the Packers in terms of positional usage, and the reality is, he was never actually bad for us. Not great. Not first round pick worthy. But, not bad. Jones was actually 3rd in total pressures, 1st in knockdowns, and 3rd in hurries on the Packers as a rotational guy playing out of position last year. Given the opportunity to move back to a hand-in-dirt interior pass rushing role at Minnesota might do wonders for him. Both guys were really Swiss Army Knife players for the Packers last season and it remains to be seen if or how those roles will be filled in 2017. The losses might not show up at all for us come game day, but it will definitely be interesting to see what happens.

##Draft

---

Round|Position|Name|School|Notes
:------:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:---:
2|CB|King, Kevin|Washington|Has all the physical tools with but there are some questions about game speed and general polish and NFL readiness. Should very much be an option to start day one though considering the current state of our CB group.
2|S|Jones, Josh|North Carolina State|Probably the most hype inducing prospect, Jones was an aggressive  punishing college player with great size and speed and projects to fill in the newer $LB role for the Packers. Expect him to get a fair amount of playing time in sub packages this year. 
3|DT|Adams, Montravius|Auburn|Versatility shines in a player that played all over the line in college and projects to do the same for the Packers. Quick and disruptive in the gaps as a run defender but needs some pass rushing work. Disappointingly, he has a stress fracture in his foot and might miss the start of the season. Depending on when he makes it back he should work his way into rotational DL snaps.
4|EDGE|Biegel, Vince|Wisconsin|The hometown hero of the class, growing up a Packers fan and playing for Wisconsin was a dream come true getting drafted by the Packers. Not the most explosive or physical player but good agility, awareness, technique, and drive. He has missed most of camp with injury so far but considering our lack of depth at the EDGE spot he should be able to work his way into the group quickly on return.
4|RB|Williams, Jamaal|Bringham Young|The first of our triple RB draft. Williams comes in as the most traditional RB on the roster. Between the tackles runner with solid vision. One cut guy who sees the hole and hits it hard. With Montgomery being the only returning RB from last year Williams should enter as the season #2 back.
5|WR|Yancey, DeAngelo|Purdue|Not the most physically impressive specimen but still frequently managed to find himself catching deep balls in college because of good hand usage and good ball tracking. Needs work and with the depth at WR on our roster will have to show something on special teams. Fighting for a roster spot.
5|RB|Jones, Aaron|Texas - El Paso|The second of our RB trio Jones brings a dramatically different skill set then Williams. Much smaller back at 5'9"" but very explosive, managing 40+ yard runs in eight games his senior season. His skill set overlaps a bit more with Montgomery so it will be interesting to see where he ends up.
6|OL|Amichia, Kofi|Southern Florida|A powerful project interior OL guy. Projects as a guard at the next level but is also taking snaps at center. A reasonable chance he might get stuck on the practice squad this year.
7|RB|Mays, Devante|Utah State|The final of pick of the RB trio Mays is a physical freak. Injuries really hampered his college career but his workout numbers were top tier in every category. At 5'11"" and 230lbs with a 4.5 forty, 40.5 inch vertical, and a 420lb bench press to his name he is a patient power runner who will be interesting to watch.
7|WR|Dupre, Malachi|Louisiana State|Labeled an early steal of this draft with many people having him as a mid round talent Dupre is already making some acrobatic catches in camp. College production was limited (partly due to the team around him) and he has learning to do but if he tightens up his game he might end up being that steal he is already being labeled.

---

Also worth taking a look at our UDFA signings, the group this year isn't as exciting as years in past and with the general talent on the roster there is really only one guy that really seems to have a shot. Realistically too, a shot is putting it lightly, **Justin Vogel** (P) is almost a gaurunteed to make the roster at this point, he is the only punter on the roster and has looked very solid in camp thus far. Beyond Vogel it is probably worth keeping an eye on **Johnathan Calvin** (EDGE), **Geoff Gray** (OL), **Lenzy Pipkins** (CB), **Raysean Pringle** (CB), **Taysom Hill** (QB), **Kalif Phillips** (RB), **William Stanback** (RB), and **Colby Pearson** (WR) even though they are all probably pretty substantial long shots at the 53 at this point but all might end up on the practice squad.

---

##Starters

---

Before getting into the starters a couple quick comments:

- Using 11 man personnel package (1RB, 1TE, 3WR) on offense as that is our most common package.
- Using our nickel package (2DL, 4LB, 5DB) for the defense as that is our most common package.
- Returning starters were given starting spot in most situations, more on that in camp battles section.

##Camp Battles

---

**RB2+**

- Montgomery will start the season as RB1 but after that it is a wide open competition, and realistically I wouldn't crown Montgomery the starter for the entire season yet as he is still relatively new to the RB position. **Jamaal Williams** seems to have the inside track for the RB2 spot but we are loaded with rookie RBs so everything is up for grabs after that second spot. I also wouldn't count out **Joe Kerridge (FB)** talking a spot away from the RBs.

**DL3+**

- **Dean Lowry** seems to have control of the next DL guy in in camp currently, but we can't forget that despite his suspension **Letroy Guion** was a starter last year and should provide competition. **Ricky Jean Francois** a solid veteran, **Montravious Adams** (assuming health), **Christian Ringo** (a late round pick from a year ago), and **Brian Price** (an UDFA from a year ago) are all going to be fighting for spots 3, 4, 5, and 6 depending on how many defensive line guys we keep on the final roster.
 
**WR4+**

- **Geronimo Allison** was the WR4 to finish last year, but he has a single game suspension and we have a lot of WRs on the roster right now. **Jeff Janis** continues to try and turn his physical skills into receiver skills, **Trevor Davis** returns to fight for a spot again, two new draft picks in **Yancey** and **Dupre**, an intriguing 2016 practice squad player in **Max McCaffery**, and a couple UDFAs in **Michael Clark**, **Pearson** and **Crockett** round out what should be a very eventful nine person fight for at best four spots. Money is probably on **Allison**, **Davis**, **Yancey,** and **Dupre** but with the **Allison** suspension and lots of time left don't count anyone out.

**ILB**

- Probably the most confusing part to look at on the team right now just in regards to match-ups and the heavier use of $LB types. **Ryan** and **Thomas** look to be the generic starters but **Martinez** shouldn't be counted out entirely and $LB guys like **Burnett** and rookie **Josh Jones** could very well steal snaps too. Interesting group.
 
**EDGE3+**

- In an offseason that lost our #3 and #4 EDGEs there is now a wide open competition for this spot. **Jayrone Elliott** and **Kyler Fackrell** are probably the next guys up but **Vince Beigel** could make a push and someone like **Dean Lowry** could actually be used as an edge rusher in certain packages which might limit roster spots.
 
**CB**

- Wide open everywhere. Not exactly what people want to hear but it is reality. As it currently stands in camp the outside starters are **Davon House** and **Kevin King** with **Quinten Rollins** in the slot. However, **Randall** and **Gunter** have also been receiving starters reps at certain points (**Gunter** outside and **Randall both** in the slot and outside). Every spot here will be in open competition until game one this year, and even then it is quite possible to see a lot of turnover throughout the season. Very curious how this pans out.
 
**PR/KR**

- **Trevor Davis** seems to be in charge right now at both the PR/KR spots but he doesn't really seem to have a firm grasp on them. He is getting the starters reps in camp right now but a couple botched punts could send him back. **Cobb** would definitely be next on punts but we have been hesitant using him there in the past and he hasn't been doing any KR work recently. Really wide open competition. Roster spots can be found by any fringe guys if they can show a spark in either spot.

---

##Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses

---

**QB: Strength**

- If you didn't know **Aaron Rodgers** is pretty decent. Beyond that it looks like third year player **Brett Hundley** will be the number two. **Hundley** looked very solid in preseasons past and always seems to exhibit great poise in the pocket. While he isn't a totally polished product and his real NFL game experience isn't great he looks ready to fill in for a short period and the coaching staff has show faith that he can start and win games.

**Backfield: Debatable**

- Debatable? With your only RB being a WR?! How is it not a weakness you might ask? Well, mostly because we are a pass first team, have a good OL, **Montgomery** looked very solid in his stint last year with minimal experience, we some very good blocking FBs/TEs, and we have a ton of bodies at RB. It also helps that because **Montgomery** is such a match-up problem even if he turns out to be only a mediocre runner his utility helps.

**Pass Catchers: Strength**

- **Jordy** just put up ~1250 yards, **Davante** just put up ~1000, **Cobb** has shown he can put up 1000+, **Bennett** is a very good TE coming off a ~700 season, and our RB is a former WR. In terms of 11 man personnel we might have one of the most talented pass catching groups in the league.

**OL: Strength**

- Yes, we managed to lose an elite guard in TJ Lang. Yes, we managed to lose a top tier player in JC Tretter. But yes, we are still a top tier OL. We have some of the best bookends in the league in **Bakhtiari** and **Bulaga** with a center in **Linsley** who is just a tad behind them in performance. **Lane Taylor** filled in admirably last year at LG to the point nobody missed Sitton, **Taylor** wasn't as good, but he wasn't a cause for concern. **Jahri Evans** comes in at RG and while he may be on his last legs he was still a very good pass protector last year and that is what we need. We even have some decent depth in former second round pick **Jason Spriggs** at tackle and veteran **Don Barclay** who, despite his stints at the tackle spots, has always been respectable in the interior. 

**DL: Strength**

- **Mike Daniels** is a household name at this point (I hope). He is one of the best interior players in the league and is now getting some more help around him. **Kenny Clark**, our first round pick from last year, really came on strong late in the season and should be starting next to **Daniels** this season. **Dean Lowry**, a mid round pick last year, put together a surprising strong performance as a rotational guy last season to the point where he is getting snaps with the number ones in camp. Most importantly, we actually have some veteran depth for the first time in a long time on the line in **Ricky Jean Francois** and **Letroy Guion** who are both solid backups.

**EDGE: Strength**

- **Nick Perry** and **Clay Matthews** on the edge is a powerful punch. **Perry** is coming off an eleven sack season as a plus run defender and while **Matthews** production has slipped lately it wasn't that long ago where he was second in the league for linebackers in pressures per snap. The concern here is depth, and considering the injury history with **Matthews** and **Perry** it is a legitimate concern. However, if the two of them can stay healthy I wouldn't count out an easy twenty sack season between the two of them.

**LB: Debatable**

- A somewhat awkward position to talk about because we aren't really sure who will be playing there, but not really in a bad way. **Jake Ryan** has developed into a solid starter and **Joe Thomas** continues to improve inside and **Martinez** was respectable inside before injury. None of those three are amazing players, but, the game changes entirely when we start shifting to $LB looks and bring **Burnett** (or **Josh Jones**) into the box at which point we should have a very good coverage driven LB corps. The concern here is that outside of **Ryan** none of these guys really seem like plus run defenders in base packages.

**Secondary: Debatable**

- There is a pretty solid split here in that our safety group is very good but our corner group has a lot of questions surrounding it. **HHCD** and **Burnett** starting at safety are both very good players and behind the **Brice** had a respectable year last year as the #3 guy and **Josh Jones** looks like a very good option in the box. CB though is just questions on questions on questions. None of the returning guys (**Randall**, **Rollins**, and **Gunter**) have proven anything in the NFL, House hasn't had a really good season in awhile, and as physically gifted as **Kevin King** is he is still a rookie coming into a new system with much better competition. Having said that, **Randall**, **Rollins**, and **House** have all shown flashes of potential and **King** really does have a ton of physical gifts and while **Gunter** is a bit more limited he has been respectable in stretches. Looking at five guys all of which who come in as pretty bad or pretty decent. The safety group should at least prevent us from falling into the trash tier level secondary but beyond that anywhere from kinda bad to pretty good seems possible.

**Special Teams: Debatable**

- **Mason Crosby** returns as one of the best kickers in the NFL but beyond that we really don't know what we are getting. **Vogel** looks good in camp, haven't heard any complaints about **Hart**, but the return game is a huge unknown. I can't imagine the entire unit being bad, but with questions in the return game can't be called good.

---

##General Scheme Info

---

**Offense**

The Packers offense under Mike McCarthy has traditionally been that of a modified West Coast Offense (WCO). The WCO in itself is built upon the idea that short horizontal throws will stretch opposing defenses and open up the game for longer runs and more vertical passing. The WCO relies heavily on quick decision making by the QB and incredibly precise/timely route running by the pass catchers as well as the need to be adept at reading defenses to adjust reads on routes as plays develop. The understanding and communication between pass catcher and QB is incredibly important for the offense to function. Historically the system was a pass heavy one with a lot of passing early and running game late but with Mike McCarthy there has always been a very even split between the run game and the pass game throughout the course of the game. Other things to be aware of is that we primarily have run with 3WR, 1TE, 1RB sets lately but have historically played with a fair amount of 2TE sets and use our FB with more frequency than many teams in the league. Our current roster is very strong at the TE and FB spots so it will be interesting to see how many heavier packages we will deploy this year as MM has shown an affinity to that in the past.

---

**Defense**

While we technically run a 34 defense (3 defensive lineman and 4 linebackers) we spend a vast majority of our snaps in sub packages (over 80% last year), the primary one being nickel which places two defensive lineman (1T and 3T) in the middle, a more traditional OLB on one edge, a hybrid DE/OLB on the other who will play both with his hand in the dirt and standing, two ILBs, 3 CBs, and 2 safeties. With the roster this year though expect more traditional OLB play from both edge spots and more $LBs in at one (or both) of the ILB spots. In the secondary we have been playing a lot of Cover 1 (one safety drops deep, one in the box) and our CBs are asked to play press, off, and zone but with a primary focus on press and man. In the front seven our DL and OLB/EDGE players are all pass rushers first and foremost with minimal coverage/run responsibilities and our ILBs are expected to primarily clean up the runs that get through will providing a very minimal amount of support sitting in short zone coverage from time to time. We play pretty aggressively across the field on defense with a lot of trap coverage and exotic blitz packages. It is a defense that thrives on creating confusion for opposing offenses but also can get abused by teams with good decision making or the ability to play it safe and run it down our throats. We put a lot of hybrid type players on the field and show a ton of different looks, which of recent years has shown both positives and negatives.

**Final Record: 11-5**

---

It should be noted that I absolutely despise making predictions like this so early, there is so much unknown and it is a total crap shoot. I debated records from anywhere between 7-9 and 15-1 as so many games were virtual toss ups to me. Only thing I really know is that if Rodgers stays healthy the offense is going to be putting up a lot of points.

As the title states I will be starting at a mixed animal practice (strictly small animal and equine, no food animal) after working exclusively in equine medicine for a year (internship, grad of 2016).

6qwyv7,0,2017-08-01,"Me [21F] with my bf [20M] 7 months, was it a toxic relationship or am I in the wrong?",throwyyyy2222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qwyv7/me_21f_with_my_bf_20m_7_months_was_it_a_toxic/,"So me and my bf of 7 months recently called things off due to long distance. Basically the time before we started the long distance relationship things were a bit rocky. After a couple of months of dating he joined a fraternity and was very busy and a few things he did were very immature. He would never invite me to any of the events and was busy all the time, he’d come over to my place after the parties. He got angry at me before my birthday and ignored me the day of and decided to take another girl as a date to one of his events on that same week. Despite the bad things I stuck through with it because I couldn’t imagine myself without him. After the birthday and date thing (3 months ago), he was very regretful and started acting very differently, and things were going quite well.


This summer I got my dream internship in another city and he stayed in our college town. I’ve been working overtime every week and have been really happy with the work I’ve been doing. I would call him every night, and he would say that he needed more attention from me and felt that I didn’t miss him. Truth is, I started getting resentful for the way he behaved during the time he joined his frat. I felt (perhaps irrationally) that it was unfair that now that he was bored over the summer and I had a lot of things going on he wanted my attention and reassurance constantly, but that probably when school started and he would get busy again and he would go back to his old ways. Since he was so far away anyways I grew complacent to just calling him at night and did not try much more, focusing on my job. He drove up where I was two times, and the second time he did was this past week.


We got into an argument and one thing led to another to him saying that he was unhappy how things were and that I was different from the time we’d been at school together, not making enough effort in the relationship, not as much as he had been putting in. Also that I kept overblowing stuff in the past that he thought we had resolved. He said that he thought that even if he was busy with his frat he would take the time to see me and text me, and that it was more than I was doing now. But I felt that it was an unfair comparison, given that at that time we were in the same city, and of course if we were in the same city now I would have made more of an effort. And he was busy partying socializing with his frat bros and sorority girls (that he wouldn’t tell he was in a relationship), while now I was instead working and building up my network.


We broke up. After he left I started reflecting on how I was behaving and I did feel it was unfair to be so resentful towards him for things he had done in the past, and I couldn’t assume that he would behave the same way when we got back to school (I really don’t know how it would be). And that I should have listened to his needs instead of brushing them off. However, I reached out to him apologizing and he said he felt he had asked me this a few times already, and that he needed his space. Now I feel like it is too late and that the breakup is indefinite. I feel like I am the bad person in this relationship, and while sometimes I feel like it was for the best, other times I just think I shouldn’t have let someone that loved me so much go that easily, because it has been really the first time where I've been in love. I miss him, and I am feeling regretful specially since the long distance was going to be for only a month and a half more and I don't think it will be easy to find someone I had a connection with as him. At the same time I also feel like he just gave up too easily after being together for so long because of the long distance even though I wasn't treating him as bad as he did me on the previous term. I guess I just want outside insight on the relationship, on how I behaved etc..


Tl:dr; my long distance relationship ended, I was very resentful towards him but I am feeling like the bad person in the relationship and I need some guidance to whether or not it was the right decision.

1)	You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.

I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower. 

3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”.

I already hate the place I work, I'm a college student who is working an internship

I've been growing my beard for about 7 weeks, or a little over a month. It is FINALLY getting past the awkward stages and starting to look really good. To the point that even at work I'm getting compliments on it. So here I am at lunch minding my own business, with exactly 2 and a half weeks of this job left, and my boss stops as he's walking by and tells me that by the end of the week I need to be completely clean shaven (trim isn't enough) and have my hair cut. The hair cut I don't mind, I've been debating whether or not I want to grow it out or cut it for some time now, and it's not a big deal, but the beard...

It doesn't affect my work at all, I literally talk to maybe 4-5 people a day here asking what they need me to do, none of whom seem to mind that I have a beard, and I've been growing it for 7 weeks. I know that's not the longest time but it's still a considerable amount of time, especially considering I have 13 days left here. You're telling me you didn't have a problem with the patchy mess I had for about 6 weeks, but now that it's full you don't like it? I mean it's not even long, I've been trimming and keeping it clean.. 

Well, not really much point to this, just really needed to vent my frustrations with this place. "

My dilemma is that I find myself crushing hard on this girl at work, before anyone tells me ""Don't shit where you eat"", I am an intern and I will be down working at this place in a month. 

So initially I got her to go out with coffees and lunch with me but only in the work setting. They were mostly 1 on 1s. I figured I should try and set something outside of work but found it difficult since she had classes 3 days a week, and does not drink. Also from a logistical standpoint with me living outside the city and her living in it, I just didn't bother putting in too much effort to set plans (I know stupid me). After a two weeks I said fuck and moved onto other girls. 

She then came to me a few weeks after and suggested we have lunch since I just did not bother talking to her anymore and then I pretty much found myself drenched in a emotion today. Historically when I get this way I find that I come onto strong and struggle to find a balance between desire and chill.

So my questions are 1)How should I progress with this girl (I'm feeling oneitis coming on) 2) How do I learn to balance my emotions? 3) Should I be more proactive with my emotions from the start?

I've never been good at judging if a person is interested in me and because of that, I've found myself in some awkward or shitty situations. Luckily for me, I've found reddit, where there's an answer for every question and maybe you can help me out.


My situation: 

I'm [w,28] doing some lab time at the university under supervision (all in all 10 weeks). Afterwards, I'll be staying in the same work group to do some research. I'm nearly done, I just have to finish my report of the internship.
My supervisor [m, 40] (I feel very attracted towards him) started to behave a bit strange some 2-3 weeks ago. We always got along quite fine, we share a lab and workspace and see each other 8-9h a day. He's a grumpy type of person, but always willing to help those who need it (like me).



So, 4 weeks ago, he started texting me about things we talked about during work (like video games), nothing too personal, but very consistent, and I noticed that he was behaving more relaxed, happy and outgoing. 


Well, I think nothing of it, we just get along fine as colleges. 
Then he started to get a bit more touchy. First, a pat on the back, then a fleeting but deliberate touch on my thigh or above my breast, not in a creepy way, just kind of casually during a conversation. 
I think to myself 'that's a bit more than friendly'.
He kept talking about how old he is until I told him, he’s looking way younger and certainly could be in his early 30s. He then told me, that his former girlfriend was 12 years younger than him… well, I got my hopes way up!



The funny thing is, now, 2 weeks later, he's changing between super grumpy/dismissive behavior and being super charming at an alarming rate. Still, he continues texting me. Sometimes in the middle of the night about some random stuff, sometimes about things that just happend or things he likes. 

The strange thing is, he kind of stopped talking to me at lenght when we’re at work. During lunch break we just stand side by side in silence for 10 min. I have to engage most conversations and oftentimes they end rather apruptly. We never talk about the things we were texting about. When we’re in a group he either keeps looking at me or ignores me. Sometimes he looks away quickly, sometimes he’s holding my gaze, sometimes he looks away scowling. When we’re both laughing about something, in a group of people, he’s looking and laughing right at me, and then proceeds ignoring me. 


When we’re talking, he mainly talks about himself and his interests and seldomly asks me any questions and rarely comments on the stuff I’m talking about. He might smile, or he acts dimissive. Yet, he remembers every inane or personal thing I say (he brings it up in another conversation, for example). He either get’s REALLY defensive when I tease him about something, or he’s teasing back as well. Honestly, he behaves totally bi-polar!


On the other hand, when I’m grumpy, he’s texting me and asking if everything’s okay, and I should not take his grumpy behavior personally. Very well, but that doesn’t explain anything.



As you can see, I’m at a loss.  This is too convoluted to make sense to me. What's going on? Is he interested or not? I'm too shy to ask him outright.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My colloge (and supervisor for another 4 weeks) who's 12 years older than me acts very inconsistently and I'm at a loss.


Additional info to clarify the work situation :

 the setting is very informal, and as I'm staying with this group, I'm treated by the others as a regular chemist. After I've finished my report there won't be any ""bounderies"" to break. So, while this situation is suuuuuper inappropriate in an conventional setting, in the lab we're all very informal and friendly with each other.  "

The Trump White House leaks like old rowboat, but it’s been uncharacteristically secretive about one thing: the Middle East peace process. For months, Trump administration officials have been meeting quietly with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to try to back up the president’s assertion that solving this decades-old problem is “not as difficult as people have thought.” But we have little sense of their strategy for making what Trump has called “the ultimate deal.”

Jared Kushner, the president’s 36-year-old son in law, is in charge of the process, and he’s said almost nothing about his plans in public. So it was fascinating to hear the leaked recording of Kushner’s briefing to congressional interns, in which he revealed much about his thinking on how to achieve a breakthrough.

I’ve met Kushner only once, at a social occasion at the Israeli ambassador’s residence. Only half-jokingly, I mused that I wished my father-in-law had as much confidence in me as his had in him, because Trump had given his son-in-law a mission impossible, or at least implausible – a conflict-ending agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.

Having spent much of my adult life chasing this holy grail, should he succeed I’d be the first to raise a glass. But that prospect seems dubious at best. Looking at some of the takeaways from the leaked transcript with the interns, Kushner’s thinking isn’t going to make his job any easier. And here’s why.

History and the past matter

Faulkner had it right in Requiem for a Nun when he wrote: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” But Kushner’s got it wrong when it comes to the Middle East. While he says he always tries to “study the historical context” of a problem, he then proceeds to dismiss it. “You know, everyone finds an issue, that, ‘You have to understand what they did then,’ and ‘You have to understand that they did this,’” he says. “But how does that help us get peace? Let’s not focus on that. We don’t want a history lesson. We’ve read enough books.”

I know how frustrating the past can be in Mideast peace talks: It’s where the parties retreat, far too often blinded by their own claims and grievances, which seem to hold the future hostage. But for a would-be peacemaker, if you ignore history it will bury you. Israeli and Palestinian officials can overwhelm you with intricate stories about which patch of land belonged to whom when and who double-crossed whom in previous negotiating rounds. You don’t need to be a historian to be a successful negotiator, but knowing which gripes matter and which ones don’t is crucial.

I was a State Department peace negotiator under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, the latter of whom desperately tried to make a deal during his waning days in office. Before going to the second Camp David summit in July 2000, we paid scant attention to the lessons of the first summit—hosted by President Jimmy Carter, which succeeded in laying the basis for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. Under Carter, we had strong leaders of states, a doable deal and a U.S. president who was tough and controlling. We should have known at second Camp David that none of those circumstances applied, and failure was almost guaranteed.
   
 I was stunned, too, by Kushner’s quip that “not a whole lot has been accomplished over the last 40 or 50 years we’ve been doing this.” Remember the Israeli-Egyptian and Israeli-Jordanian peace treaties? Those weren’t chopped liver. And even if he was narrowly referring only to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, Kushner’s still not correct—U.S. diplomacy has prevented a lot of damaging outcomes over the years, and helped narrow the gaps between the parties. But it’s important, too, to learn from our failures, such as the Oslo Accords. Kushner does say he “tried to look at why people haven’t been successful in the negotiations” and “spoke to a lot of people who have have been part of them.” But the conclusion he draws—“this is a very emotionally charged situation” – isn’t much of a guide to what to do now.

Captain Obvious: This isn’t your grandfather’s peace process

Kushner is also off the mark when he says “the variables haven’t been changed much” over all those years where nothing was supposedly getting done. Wrong again: The situation today is not even remotely similar to past periods when Arabs, Israelis and Americans succeeded and failed. The region is experiencing a degree of turmoil unprecedented in any other period of peacemaking (ever heard of a little place called Syria?). Arab countries—and here’s a positive variable—are more willing to consider supporting a serious process, as Kushner surely knows first-hand. But the two leaders—Mahmoud Abbas and Benjamin Netanyahu—are more constrained than their predecessors and are unwilling and unable to make the decisions on the big issues—Jerusalem, refugees and borders. Kushner’s casual assertion that you have to pick and choose where you draw your conclusions, presumably what kind of approach you will take—seems preternaturally naïve. A conflict-ending accord requires a comprehensive approach. This isn’t a menu from one of those old Chinese restaurants where you can pick one from Column A and one from Column B.

Don’t be Israel’s lawyer

Clearly, Kushner has a fondness for Israel and Netanyahu, through longstanding family connections and early childhood memories, that outweighs his regard and affection for the Palestinians. He sympathizes with the Israeli prime minister, and describes how he took Israel’s interests into account first in the recent controversy over metal detectors at the Temple Mount. That instinct isn’t fatal to his efforts—building trust with Israel is critical to success. But we have often overdone it.

In 1989, I resurrected a term from Henry Kissinger’s memoirs—that the U.S. couldn’t afford to be “Israel’s lawyer.” My then-boss, Secretary of State James Baker, loved it; I took my fair share of grief from American Jews and Israelis for saying it publicly. But the fact is we do have to see this conflict from both sides, regardless of our special bonds with the Israelis. Unless we’re prepared to exercise independence when it comes to mediation, we won’t succeed. The only three Americans to ever succeed in Arab-Israeli peacemaking—Kissinger, Carter and Baker—all operated off a pro-Israeli script. But they also were prepared to push the Israelis along with the Arabs. You can’t do Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking without applying ample amounts honey and vinegar. Nobody going to plant a tree in Israel in honor of Jared Kushner should he succeed – at least not immediately. If he’s not prepared to push both sides hard, he might as well close up for the season.

Maybe it just can’t work

Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Kushner’s talk occurs at the end, when he concedes the obvious—that this might not work. “So, what do we offer that's unique? I don’t know,” he says. “I’m sure everyone that’s tried this has been unique in some ways, but again we’re trying to follow very logically. We’re thinking about what the right end state is. And we’re trying to work with the parties very quietly to see if there’s a solution. And there may be no solution, but it’s one of the problem sets that the president asked us to focus on. So we’re going to focus on it and try to come to the right conclusion in the near future.”

This is exactly right. In the end, reality must be the point of departure. For too many years—and I’ll speak personally here—my own view was based on the illusion that there was a deal, that the parties could make it and that the U.S. could help them deliver it. I haven’t given up hope entirely; but I have abandoned my illusions. The fact is, you need real leadership and commitment by the two sides. Then and only then can America be a key force in peacemaking. My sense is that Kushner realizes that the peace process isn’t ready for prime time, and isn’t quite sure what do about it. (Neither am I.) There’s no mention in the transcript of a two state solution – an end state his father-in-law hasn’t endorsed.

Still, barring some unexpected move by one of the parties, he will—like his predecessors— remain trapped in a peace-process Bermuda triangle, wandering around between a two-state solution that’s too hard to be implement and one that’s still too important to abandon. I wish him luck.

6qz2n8,5,2017-08-01,Need Advice On Moving Out [Self-Improvement] (20/M),Madvillaner,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/6qz2n8/need_advice_on_moving_out_selfimprovement_20m/,"So I want to move out, but I'm not sure if it's the best long-term decision so I figured I'd ask a bunch of strangers on the internet.

I'm 20 (turning 21 soon) and a university student, going into my fourth and final year. I picked a university close to home and as a result I commute about 1hr 15mins each way, every day for class and I have been doing so for the last three years while living with my parents. I've always been a really reserved person but being a commuter student has really been terrible for me personally, I haven't made a single friend since starting university, haven't joined any clubs, or had any new experiences. I just go to class, study, and work my part time job. Personally I think the free time and the comfort that I get from living at home is making me soft, there's no struggle, there are times when I don't have to leave my house for several days at a time (other than the gym). However, since I never go out and I save all my money, I have about $16,000 in the bank (this is after I pay my tuition for this upcoming year). 

I can't say exactly why I want to move out but I just think it'll be better for me. I think my comfort has turned into complacency while at home and it contributes to my depression and social anxiety, for some reason I think that I need to get out of my comfort zone, moving into a shitty apartment and having to do it all myself might just be it. I also want to do new things, for example, there are jiu-jitsu schools near my university I'm really interested in. Also I spend 3 hours a day sitting on a bus or train, where all I do is ruminate and let shitty thoughts fester in my head, I think I'd be better off spending that time doing laundry, meal prepping, etc... 

The main thing that I'm worried about  when it comes to moving out is finances. Toronto is pretty fucking expensive and I'd be lucky to get a decent room for $700, plus food, transit, etc.. is all going to add up and with a part time job I'd barely be breaking even if at all. But even if it does get too expensive, I could move out for just one year (my final year of university) and then move back home for a bit until I get a decent job, but so far I haven't gotten any internships and my chances of finding a job even after graduation aren't looking too great. 

Anyway, I'd appreciate any input at all from you guys, what you think about the finance, the personal side, and I'd also like to hear about any of your experiences before I make my decision. Also, if anyone lives in Toronto and can give me a bit of guidance on their experience that would be great. 


TL;DR -- I'm a 21 year old commuter student that's been in a really shitty place for 3 years, I want to move out (for at least my last year if not permanently) as a way to grow.

Pt.1 
 
The Weakness Which Wills 
Life's getting to a start. I graduated a few months ago and I'm getting started at this new clothing design firm named Roaz today. The day's hot and humid out, but I've still got a lean suit on and a film of sweat to match. It's not unusual for the flies of the coast to go commando. But as I stop at a food cart and grab a ham and swiss melt, I notice a fly about the size of a juicy raisin. Just hovering and it almost looked like it was looking right at me, but I laugh and dismiss it as I walk off taking a chomp of the warm melt on rye.  
  
I've already killed my interview now I just got get in keep at the grind. The street is coming up with the firm and I eagerly kick up my pace as I near the corner. Then I hear someone.  
 
""Jimbo!""  
 
I look around and I see no one, so I shrug it off and finish the last bite of the melt. I wad up the aluminum wrapper and then approach the trash can.  
 
""Hey kid, I know you can hear me. Look up!"" 
 
I hear that voice again but I don't see anyone and I'm starting to get creeped out.  
 
""Hey are you even fucking listening? Look up Jimbo!"" 
 
""Holy fuck,"" I say as I look up and see that big ass fly floating right in front of me. ""What the hell? Are you talking to me?"" 
 
""Nah the other guy down the street. Yeah, you,"" the fly says to me sarcastically. ""Look you'd better stop talking to me in the open. People are staring kiddo."" 
 
I look around and and a few pedestrians have stopped to see what's my deal. I grin and act like I'm talking into my Bluetooth and walk off casually and that creepy fucking fly just follows me down the street.  
 
""Alright kid listen and listen good. The world it's a terrible place already you know. So here's the lowdown you's and me's gonna be a team. Because this place-"" 
 
I cut him off and frantically whisper, ""What the hell are you even talking about?""  
 
""Aw c'mon kid don't play dumb. It's circle of life shit. You ever seen the Lion King?"" 
 
""How do you even know about the Lion King?"" 
I ask absolutely perplexed and then I see the firm coming up on my left.  
 
""Man we flies know more than you think. You humans are on to some strange-"" 
 
""The only thing strange is you!"" I cut him off in a hushed voice. ""Look I gotta go to my job. Stop fucking following me. My mother said you tell a spirit to leave you alone when it's engaged in conversation. So please leave me alone."" 
 
""Hahaha!"" it laughs and I'm starting to lose my cool. ""I'm not a spirit. I'm a fly dingus and no can do."" 
 
""I'm asking you nicely then be quiet I don't want to be caught talking to a fly,"" I say as I push through the gilded double doors of the building.  
 
I hope he gets caught in the door but he just bobs through seamlessly.  
 
""That I can do,"" he says as I approach the front desk of the lobby.  
 
""Welcome to the Bohemian Building,"" a cute blonde haired haired receptionist says. ""How can I help you today?"" 
 
""Hello I'm here for my first day at Roaz. I was told to check in here before going up."" 
 
She leans forward giddily and pushes a clipboard to me, ""Sign here and head right up if you know where you're going."" 
 
I lean down and pull my silver pen from my pocket and sign myself in. Then look at her and say, ""Thank you, appreciate your help.""  
 
""Yeah no problem..."" she trails off and looks perplexed.  
 
I stop and ask, ""Um is something wrong?"" 
 
She points above my head. ""There's a fly that's been like just hovering around you."" 
 
""Oh shit really?"" I say to her and roll up a magazine on a table nearby.  
 
""Hey kid don't,"" the fly says. ""This is how they play it. I'm warning you, you do this and you'll regret it. It's all a lie this is-"" 
 
I happily swat the life out of him. His wings fluttering downward as his body is flung. After that I unroll the magazine and lay it down, then smile politely at the receptionist, ""Thanks that would've been weird."" 
 
She laughs and I just go on through the walkway into the corridor with the elevators. The building is full of all sorts of people. Each dressed in fine suits and dresses, a few are sprinkled with casual wear. I get on an elevator after waiting a moment. There are three others behind me, heading to a different floor.  
 
 'See kid. Now you fucked up,' a voice goes off in my head. 
 
""Oh shit,"" I say flatly to myself.  
 
""Yeah, thought it'd be sayonara? You fucking swatted me Jimbo. To be with these humans. That fucking receptionist is pretty much a crack whore, but you wouldn't know huh cuz you ain't a fly.""  
 
I palm my face with wide eyes, ""How-How can this be real?"" 
 
I feel someone tap me on the shoulder and I look over to a round faced man in slacks and a white collared shirt.  
 
""Hey man are you alright?"" he asks with concern. 
 
Spaced out I reply, ""Yeah, I'm fine."" 
 
""You love lying,"" he says again and I try not to respond. ""You know these are vipers kid. If you don't learn a song to charm a snake or two you're screwed."" 
 
I look forward as the elevator comes to a slow and I'm at my floor. I step out of the elevator and into the lobby of Roaz. 
 
""Hello,"" says a tall man with a clean shaven face,  sporting a lavender suit. ""My name is Raphael. I'm guessing your Jimmy right?"" 
 
""Yes I'm Jimmy..."" 
 
""Take your time and get acclimated today you'll be shadowing me, so you can learn our processes."" he goes on some more but I zone out.  
 
'He's raped four interns... Two of them were males. He even keeps the evidence in his office, the piece of shit. You listening kid?"" He chuckles eerily and goes on. ""Oh right you fucked up. Now I'm in your head for good. Don't kill what you don't know kid. You were going to run in snowblind. I'll still help but there will be a bit of a....."" 
 
I block him off I block the world off to stop hearing him. Then I realized conversations help me ignore him. So I talked and talked the day away. Before I knew it, I was heading down the street with a beautiful redhead girl name Jacey. She lives on the same city block with me and I think she likes me. Or just the fact that I seem bent on her every word. Either way she's decent company.  
 
 
Once I'm home I lock the door and head right up to my bed room.  
 
""Can't run now Jimbo,"" he says simply. 
 
""Get out of my head!"" I yell. Dropping to my knees clutching sides of my head in a vain effort to cover my ears. 
 
""No can do,"" is the stiff reply. ""You know sleep on it Jimbo. You're not going to be helpful to me or even yourself if you go insane."" 
 
I hate his almost apologetic tone and sincerity, but if this spirit is offering me a stay of rest then I'll take it. Hell hopefully I wake up in the morning and this will all have been a dream. Yeah. A dream.  
 
Sleep comes quickly and I do my best to maintain it. Still I wake to the fly, no it's just a voice now. 
 
""Men in this world have destroyed people like you for fun. The business you're in seems harmless right? Until you land a design or find your niche and then someone becomes spiteful and thirsts for your success... You get strangled, poisoned,  and the lucky ones get blackmailed."" 
 
""Why are you telling me this?"" 
 
""Because I'm attached to you. I'm here for my own entertainment. You get rich, I get to watch you a bright eyed young fucker bury the high minded scum and shit in their graves. Not literally of course, but you should get my point."" 
 
 
I give in and reply, ""Where do you want me to start are you going to steal my body?"" 
 
""Heavens no. I know about you humans but not enough to live as one of you. The motor functions are very distant from a fly. It would take time. It would take becoming a child."" 
 
""Are you saying to give you my first child?"" I say back still groggy but quickly becoming alert as alarm rings through my soul. Have I really been damned enough to run into a Devil? 
 
""Don't make me sound so evil. The soul comes with sentience. I am roaming sentience, I do not desire to have a human body.... Yet. I would much rather something of the reptilian variety,"" he goes on in a jolly tone. ""I'm glad you see things my way now. We'll get you on the fast track to greatness!"" 
 
""We?"" I ask curious about the wording. Hoping not to hear- 
 
""Oh, there's more....""

The Powers That Be 
 
""I've heard of that, but I never thought it was true..."" Sarlen said into the phone. 
 
""Yeah,"" Cal's deep raspy voice replied. ""These things are able to inhabit almost any living creature. They call themselves Will."" 
 
The night sky is aglow, as the two discourse on the matter and seek a plan of action. 
 
""Cal!"" Sarlen cried out with frustration. 
 
""They are NOT Will.. They are Ethers. Those things are the spirits of evil humans incarnate. They ""assist"" humans, but the trade for the help is a vessel."" 
 
Cal's rasped voice clambers through the phone, ""Yeah, yeah the monks told me. I was just telling you what I heard. So how do you even know about that if you didn't think they were real?"" 
 
Sarlen goes silent for a moment and lets out a deep sigh, memories of his past rushing to him as he watched his father die. With a cringe he throws his head back on his headrest and answers. 
 
""I was a kid that was supposed to be taken,"" Sarlen replies with a tinge of desperation in his voice. Not because his situation is desperate, it's the desperation of a man wishing only to forget a sordid past.  
 
His mother died giving birth and Sarlen's father died to keep that thing away. Leaving an already painfully aware Sarlen orphaned,  but that's when Tamaga took him in and raised him per his father's request. He knew the evil that was meant to be the boy's fate, so he turned his life over to the Powers. The Powers are an organization which works to limit the effect of wandering Ethers, a name for an enigmatic race of destructive beings that live within the realm of mind and soul, occasionally granted bodies of their own. 
 
""Tamaga says this one can lead to a generational infestation if not dealt with,"" Sarlen goes on. ""Meet me at Migra, we'll get everything we need at headquarters and then we'll move after. Is that understood?"" 
 
""Yeah,"" Cal says back over the sound of his engine kicking to life. ""I'm on my way now, see ya in about ten."" 
 
Sarlen hangs up and throws his phone down onto the passenger side, running his right hand over his face.  
 
""All these years I've never seen one... I thought it was a story Tamaga told me to cover up a darker reality... Or just the painful truth."" 
 
Sarlen leans forward soberly, turns his key and stops once he hears sputtering from his engine. 
 
""Damn it's already on,"" Sarlen shakes his head vigorously and rubs his face up and down. ""Gotta stay sharp. This is our first Ether, but we've been training for years to deal with this! I can't get flustered now... I can't."" 
 
He heads to the headquarters, within the Migra Temple where Tamaga is awaiting Sarlen's arrival with Cal. 
 
""What happened you stop for a drink and a piss?"" Cal calls out sarcastically. 
 
Tamaga winces at his language and turns away, heading within the temple. 
 
""Time is short, as this Ether is quite impatient. Come quickly and gather your tools. The Ether is streamlining many others already, but it's main host seems to be with a young man named Jimmy Sarnacs."" 
 
Tamaga says as Sarlen and Cal follow him wordlessly. Soon they reach the inner sanctum and Tamaga signals for them to wait as he goes on ahead. After a couple of minutes he returns to the leaning pair, with two daggers and sutras for sealing. 
 
""Ehhh, so where's the rest of the stuff?"" Cal asks while scratching the back of his head. 
 
Tamaga looks at him apologetically, as he hands them the daggers and splits the sutras in threes between the two. 
 
""I do wish I could better prepare you two with tools, but these will do. Our main retinue of monks are dealing with the deluge near Mount Litrachu. However with your training these should prove more than ample to seal away the Ether."" 
 
Neither is satisfied with the reply, but they know arguing is pointless. Instead both bow and Sarlen follows as he rises. 
 
""No, master we are honored to be of service to the Powers."" 
 
""It gladdens me to hear it. Your target will be on your radars. I am not as young as I once was but even for you two I recommend waiting until the Ether is away from it's host before banishing it. If not possible you will have to deal with both at once. And make no mistake they are very much combat capable when near their"" 
 
The two listen to their elder's council and leave shortly after with the sheathed daggers tucked at the waist underneath their casual clothing.  
 
Cal hops into the passenger's side Sarlen's car and they peel off in the direction of their targets home. The drive takes about ten minutes, but the real wait time comes when they arrive outside of Jimmy's house. After about and hour and a half Jimmy comes out. 
 
""Hey, is that the kid?"" Cal calls to Sarlen, who's head is slumped over the wheel resting on his hands. He looks up sluggishly and then with a more alert gaze.  
 
""Mhmmm, looks like it's show time. Let's establish our mental links now. You got the boy?"" 
 
Cal gets out with a wordless nod and follows Jimmy on foot. Leaving Sarlen in contemplation as he ogles the home to be sure no one else is within. After a few minutes of surveiling the abode, he concludes it's safe to enter. Never having encountered an Ether face to face Sarlen found himself anxious nonetheless.  
 
""In and out, the sooner I secure my end, the sooner Cal can sever their link. No time to waste."" 
 
Sarlen says to himself as he crosses the yard to the front door. He uses a surge of energy to activate the locking mechanism and slides into the house swiftly after laying a sutra on the entrance. The home is heavy with an otherworldly energy and gives Sarlen a chill.  
 
The aura intensifies as he reaches the stairs and walks up them to the one bedroom door slightly ajar, across from the bathroom that's wide open. He places another of the sutras atop the doorway and enters the room.  
 
'I've got the kid unconscious,' Cal calls out telepathically. 
 
Before Sarlen can reply he cuts on the lights and sees a large anaconda hanging from the room's fixtures. It has it's gaze heavily resting on him with what seems the sliver of a grin.  
 
''Welcome to my home,"" it hisses. 
 
He's frozen a moment with fright, but Sarlen knows well not to entertain bemusement. He then flings himself across the room and it moves just as quickly, if not faster. It doesn't go to wrap around him. Obviously wary of the sutra. It tries to slide to the door and comes up against the field. Writhing in agony as the volts of energy visibly surge through it's massive body.  
 
""Ataramalis.... Aux'Varrem.... Tierma"" 
 
Sarlen bellow seven times as he pull the dagger from his waist. Cal does the same in an alleyway with Jimmy on the ground beneath him struggling for freedom, with his dagger in hand. 
 
The Ether decides to head for the window, but Sarlen's aura has coated the room by now and it is greeted by the same jolt.  
 
''Asalamai Pax Tu Layka'Alma Sol!"" 
 
Sarlen roars and uses it's confusion to get the jump on it. He lays the sutra on it's body right as the Ether wraps around his leg in a desperate attempt to incapacitate him. Unable to make it in time the Anaconda shakes violently and loosens as it is jolted ferociously by the Sutra and Sarlen goes on chanting the same phrase.  
 
""Asalamai Pax Tu Layka'Alma Sol!"" 
 
Cal does the same on his side. 
 
""Asalamai Pax Tu Layka'Alma Sol!"" 
 
When each says it a third time they drive their daggers down. Cal's in the solar plexus of Jimmy and Sarlen's right in the Ether's skull. It realeases a banshees shriek and with a burst of light it vanishes, leaving the shell which crumbles into a plume of ash. 
 
Cal pulls out the dagger and Jimmy's eyes jump open and he immediately goes to feel at his chest but finds no wound. 
 
""I swore you stabbed me..."" he says in bewilderment as he leans up and Cal offers him a hand. ""What happened? Who are you?"" 
 
""You ask a lot of questions kid,"" Cal grunts in reply. ""Just know you have your life back."" 
 
With that Cal heads back to the car where Sarlen is waiting, already very anxious to go back to Migra Temple.  
 
""Have fun with the Ether?"" Cal asks as he slides in. 
 
Sarlen thinks a moment and recalls the black being he remembered from his youth and smiles as he shifts into drive and they roll on. 
 
""Actually, yeah I did... It gave me a kind of closure that I've needed for a while."" 
 
""Don't go making everything personal kid. You'll burn yourself out before you know it,"" Cal advises lightly, but he knows deep down the kid needed this. Just like every warrior ultimately must swing their sword for their first time. 
 
Now Sarlen's life with The Powers truly begins.

6qzygh,3,2017-08-01,Indifferent towards my family.,TheRealPhoKing,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6qzygh/indifferent_towards_my_family/,"[No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad 

I'm Asian-American and pretty much all the stereotypes about the parenting is true.

I don't feel anything towards my family anymore. Recently got into a fight with my dad over some stupid crap, TL;DR I'm fed up with being treated without respect and getting scolded for stupid things like a little kid. I'm 22, just landed a decent paying internship and I'm now planning on officially moving out in 4 months.

My sister is borderline obese (not kidding lol) and she's lazy to the point where she left empty shampoo bottles in the corner of our shower stall until there was mold growing. When I came back from my school semester I saw that and was completely horrified. I detest that kind of laziness, as I keep myself fit and I'm relatively responsible (as much as a 22 year old can be).  Of course I ended up cleaning it up. That's just the tip of the iceberg as there's a myriad of other things I'm fed up with.

I'm tired of being in this kind of environment, and I cannot wait until I can walk away and have my own space. I guess the only thing is my Mom wants the family to be together and she feels as if me leaving would leave a rift between my father and myself. My sister also blames me for living at the city where my college is located, leaving her to deal with my parents.

I honestly could not care less. I just want out. I don't want to make up with my dad. He's done this kind of thing before (3-4 times since I came back home) and I know it might seem spiteful, but really I just don't want to deal with it. Not because I'm angry or anything, I just don't want to have anything to do with it. I worry about my mother a bit, but there's a big part of me that really doesn't care. I can see that I'm a horrible person but I honestly don't care. I'm extremely selfish, but I'd rather be happy on my own than unhappy with people I already don't care about.

I know it's very unlikely to get an engineering internship after freshmen year because we still haven't learned the core curriculum of our major, lack of experience, ect, but I wanted to ask anyone who did find a way to get an internship after their freshmen year about how they got it, what they had to do to prep for the internship and when they applied. 

(I wanted to work in a biotech/medical related field and I'm in a location where there are a good amount of startup/big companies around me (San Diego area). While that is a big priority for me, I'm willing to explore other areas as well if that field requires more experience)

6r0le8,1,2017-08-01,I'm (23F) ready to come to my parents (50s) about my secret relationship of 5 years...,i-can-keep-a-secret,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6r0le8/im_23f_ready_to_come_to_my_parents_50s_about_my/,"EDIT: words
EDIT 2: more words

Hi reddit! I'll try to put in as much detail as possible without rambling...but basically, I've been hiding my relationship from my parents for over 5 years (details below), and I'd like some advice on how to approach them about it?

Greg (23M) and I have been together for a little over 5 years. We met in high school and went to university together. Mom found out something was going on about 2 months in, so I told her and she made us break up, citing that she wanted me to finish school before dating, but that we could remain friends and if it was meant to be, we'd end up together again. (Well, now we've both got our degrees, yay!) Not sure if she told my dad. I'm assuming she didn't because he would have freaked (he's not as open minded). Thus begins our secret relationship.

So all these years, my parents knew we were friends. My mom has referred to Greg as my best friend in some conversations without me labeling him as such, so I'm thinking she knows we have a close relationship, if she doesn't know fully what it is.

Idk if this info is really relevant, but I think my parents might know for these reasons:

1) Mom sometimes packed him food whenever he made trips home from school and picked up my food on the weekends I couldn't come home, but never did the same for other friends.

2) Mom helped him land an internship at her previous company and always spoke highly of him, helped him with interviewing, job search etc. 

3) Dad taught him how to fix his brakes, but refused to help any other friends with car problems in the past.

4) A not-so-reliable family member has brought to my attention that my entire family is aware of my relationship, including my parents; but then again, I don't trust her very much because she &amp; her mom are gossip queens. She told me her mom and my dad (siblings) talk about it all the time, but idk...

My parents and I have a complicated relationship...we're a very close family; we share almost anything and everything, but when it comes to boys, that topic has always been shot down since my childhood (""don't talk to boys, don't talk to anyone who talks about boys"" etc). Soooo, relationships have never been talked about. (Also helps that Greg is my first boyfriend, so I've never had to bring up boys ever except as friends lol). And they've always shed a bad light on my cousins who have had boyfriends. And they're even super strict about friends!! They fuss when I hangout 1-2 days out of the week, and don't even get me started on sleepovers...bottom line, I've never been to one nor have I been on a friends' trip. This streak of strictness has created some kind of ""fear"" in talking to them about friend/relationship stuff.

So advice on how to bring it up? I was thinking of talking to my mom first because she would have a more calm reaction, if they absolutely don't know. I just don't know how? Should I just spill it all at once? Prep her and gauge her reaction for a later discussion? Should Greg be there so we can tell her/them together? Help!!

Forgot to add that I'm currently looking for a career, and hopefully an apartment soon after to get some independence. Should I wait until I've secured something?
 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have no idea how to approach my parents about dating, let alone about my secret 5 year relationship. Ouch."
6r0mw4,89,2017-08-01,Stop trying to rebuild Buckingham Palace in every defense mission.,randomZ0MBIE,FORTnITE,https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/6r0mw4/stop_trying_to_rebuild_buckingham_palace_in_every/,"First off I don't care what you do in your homebase. You want to build an eighty foot tall Pac-Man with a swimming pool and a McDonalds inside? Go nuts.

&amp;nbsp;

What I'm talking about here is people in Ride the Lightning, Atlas, and Data Retrieval type missions trying to build forts four walls high and eight walls wide. Then come here or the official forums and complain that no one is helping them gather or upgrade. 

When it takes over 900 metal to upgrade one side of the Atlas fort you built, you think that might be why no one is helping you?

&amp;nbsp;

Now I could spend this time to berate you and belittle your intelligence, but Instead I am going to share with you 'randomZOMBIE's Guide to basic building for simpletons: From Dumb-Dumb to Intern in one easy chapter'.


&amp;nbsp;


Chapter One - Crafting Materials, Structures, and the Efficient use there of

Let's start with crafting materials. There are three type of crafting materials. Wood, Stone, and Metal. Stone is a little stronger the wood, and Metal is a little stronger then Stone. A lot of you just read that and thought to yourself ""Metal is strongest! Metal is best! BUILD ALL THE THINGS OUT OF METAL!"" 

*smacks you upside the head with rolled-up newspaper* NO! WRONG! BAD DUMB-DUMB!

If the devs wanted you to only build out of metal, then metal would be the only building material. Now to explain the usefulness of each material type I am going to first explain the three basic types of structure.


Floors are any flat panel you place on the ground. All enemies ignore floors. The only time a floor takes damage is when it is hit by a stray artillery shot from the fire hair lady or you let a bomber blow up to close to it. Wood is really useful for building floors because rarely take damage.


Ceilings are any flat or angled panel attached to the top of a wall. Most enemies ignore ceilings. Ceilings are only damaged by artillery shots, bombers that blow up too close and Smashers. It takes at least two hits from a smasher to destroy an upgraded stone ceiling. You make all your ceilings out of stone and it won't matter that they are not as strong as metal because they aren't hit that often anyway.


Walls are any panel that obstructs enemy movement through a tile. Basically if the enemy has to knock it down move on, it is considered a wall. Walls take the most hits. Everything will attack your walls. Build walls out of metal. If you have a team of more combat oriented people capable of proper threat prioritization you can make your walls out of stone.



&amp;nbsp;


Now that we have discussed the basic use and function of materials and structures I will move on to basic building techniques for efficient defense. For this I will be using the Atlas as an example.

The basic Atlas defense starts with what I call the floor ring. You build a one tile wide ring of wood floors around the Atlas.


Next you add metal ramps so the top of the ramp attaches to the top of the Atlas.


Next fill in the corners with metal steeples and cap the top with a stone ceiling. I said ceiling not steeple, Dumb-Dumb.

You now have a standard defense pyramid that when Fully built and upgraded costs you a grand total of 480 Wood, 480 Metal, and 60 Stone.

You can have this resourced built and upgraded in under five minutes, by yourself. And you would still have over 400 Wood/Metal and over 900 Stone for funneling and trap placeholders. 

I realize that some of you read this and asked yourself ""How am I supposed to get in to activate the Atlas if I completely closed it off."" This is a stupid question Dumb-dumb, and shows your lack of understanding of the basic building mechanics. Walk up to one of the corner pieces go into edit mode and turn it into an arch-way, walk in activate the Atlas, walk out and turn the arch-way back into a corner piece.

This basic pyramid defense structure can be used for almost every defend mission with little or no changes to the basic design. There are some missions like Ride the Lightning that require a little more ingenuity for efficient defense building but those are covered in 'randomZOMBIE's Intern Handbook.' That will be sent to all interns at a later date.

&amp;nbsp;

Congratulations! You have graduated from Dumb-Dumb to Intern. Now get out! 

Don't forget to grab your Red Cap, Speedo, and Glock on your way out.


*NOTICE! Interns are no longer issued Glocks. For Insurance purposes a single Glock will be provided for interns to share.*"
6r0rbp,28,2017-08-01,[MAIN SPOILERS] Gendry in Volantis?,Ryanfarrellstl,gameofthrones,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6r0rbp/main_spoilers_gendry_in_volantis/,"So during the latest episode, I got a thought about how Gendry could logically be reintroduced to the show.

When Melisandre told Varys that she was going to Volantis it got me wondering what business she'd have there.

And after some thought, I think that she might be going there to meet our boi Gendry.

Last we saw gendry he was fleeing dragonstone.

And when you think about it, why the fug would he just row on back to Westeros where's he's been routinely fucked with?
Instead he caught a ship and made his way east to Volantis.

There he became a blacksmith again by becoming an apprentice under the same smiths who Tywin had reforge Ice into Widows Wail and Oathkeeper.

During this apprenticeship, he learns to forge valyrian steal.

In the show, Tywin mentions that he sent for blacksmiths in Volantis to do this.

Melisandre bumps into him there. Admits that she was a bit of a bitch back on Dragonstone. They have a good laugh. She finds out that he can make weapons that kill white walkers. And then convinces him to join team Stark in the war for the dawn.

TLDR: Gendry rowed his little boat to Volantis and leveraged his vast internship experience from working with Tobho Mott in Kings Landing to land a nice little entry level position at one of the only shops that know how to work Valyrian steel. Eventually learning to make it from scratch. Melisandre then finds him and somehow convinces him to come back to Westeros to arm the living.

You know... or something like that.

What say you?"

Hey!

I woke up at 3:30 AM to my crying daughter, got her back to sleep but couldn't fall back asleep. Great, I figured, I'll get up and write for a few hours like I've always wanted to. I wrote. It was great. Solid seven pages. 

Sometimes it feels like you're making progress and then later in the day you get hit in the face with a dose of reality. Now, there's an item in today's issue that made me jealous. I'll admit it. A 23-year-old screenwriter sold a spec in a bidding war after landing on the Blacklist last year. I'm a geezer compared to him at 30.

Deep down, I'm happy for him and any writer who can sell a script or get something made. It's a great feeling. But damn. I say this mostly to vent, to save me from a therapist's fee... but I also mention it because this guy (Shay Hatten) was an intern at a company. He wrote nights and weekends. He got his scripts into the right hands and focused on his craft. 

It makes me ask myself a question. What the hell did I do today? The answer: Not enough. So I'll keep the commentary short and the links long and get back to my spec.

Because it's time we focus on the craft. You with me?

* ANALYSIS: [One Way To Deconstruct There Will Be Blood — Or Any Movie - YouTube](http://bit.ly/2uilKu7)

&gt; I'll kick it off this week with analysis and a video on the craft. Deconstructing a film and analysing it is a great way to learn how and why the writer did what they did. For example, did you know that Harry Potter receives the invisibility cloak because the story is told in a third person limited style. That means that it's third person, but you only really know what is in Harry's head, every scene has Harry. However, Rowling needed to tell the reader about certain events. Voila, an invisibility cloak that Harry can wear to witness it.

6r2s60,2,2017-08-02,How competitive are internships??,Hearakok,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6r2s60/how_competitive_are_internships/,"Hey guys, I'm going into my junior year of college this year at Rutgers university, not really a target university with a 3.25GPA as a finance major. I have very little work experience (worked as cashier at convenience store for 3 months) and i have Exam P and FM. I passed P last July and FM this June. I have enough time to learn 1 (maybe 2) programming languages before September starts and I have to start applying for internships (do people apply in August?). Anyone know which programs I should prioritize? Im still not sure what field I want to go in but i imagine that will be decided based on whatever internship/job I can get my hands on. Also, what can I do to improve my resume to increase my chances of landing a summer internship?

Also, with all the posts about how difficult it is to get experience/internship/jobs, do I stand a chance? I know my GPA isnt ideal and I imagine that is what recruiters care about most. Thanks guys!"

It’s not our fault,” Jacob Rosales said. I had asked the recent high-school graduate what he wants people to know about life on the reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. “There’s a liquor store right across from the border,” he continued after a pause, pointing off into the distance. “Right over there.”

The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is a striking 3,469-square-mile expanse of sprawling grasslands and craggy badlands that sits in the southwest corner of South Dakota, touching Nebraska’s northern edge. Traversing the reservation by car, along its rugged matrix of two-lane highways and unmarked roads, reveals just how vast it is.

Park the car and wander around the softly bustling community hub of Pine Ridge town, and it’s clear there’s also a lot going on beyond the bluffs and tree groves and decaying trailer homes. There are the men in braids and jeans waving at each other from across the street, there are the teen girls drinking frappés at the colorful Christian coffee shop, and there are the “[rez dogs](http://ift.tt/2ujK4vI)” scouring piles of trash. There are also the young people, like Rosales, who are on a mission to make the world understand that it’s not their fault that this reservation—home to an [estimated](http://ift.tt/2u3H3UQ) 20,000 [Oglala Lakota Nation](http://ift.tt/2ujAfhi) members—is one of the poorest, and most underdeveloped, places in the country.

Pine Ridge doesn’t get much national attention except when the news is sad. Unemployment and gang violence are rampant. The life expectancy for men is just 48. A [youth-suicide epidemic](http://ift.tt/2u3r21i) has plagued the reservation in recent years, with a cluster of nearly [200 teens](http://ift.tt/2ujK1Qy) killing or attempting to kill themselves in the span of a few months starting in late 2014. And even though Pine Ridge remains a [“dry” reservation](http://ift.tt/2pDtAAc), alcoholism is widespread; [until recently](http://ift.tt/2ujjUJq), residents could, as Rosales pointed out, easily drive just a few miles south into Whiteclay, Nebraska, to buy booze. Mary Frances Berry, the former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, [once remarked](http://ift.tt/2u3BUMJ), “Whiteclay can be said to exist only to sell beer to the Oglala Lakota.”

Signs mark the entrance of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) When Rosales spoke about culpability, he was referring to both present-day realities—the liquor stores in Whiteclay, for example—and historical ones: the legacy of centuries of oppression at the hands of European settlers and their ancestors. _It’s not our fault that_[_one-third_](http://ift.tt/2qB0d25)_of us drop out of school. That we participate in the labor force_[_at a lower rate_](http://ift.tt/2ujK7aS)_than any other racial group. That our men are incarcerated_[_at four times the rate_](http://ift.tt/2iiL02k)_of their white peers._Those realities help explain why, as Rosales explained, “it’s kind of unheard of for Native kids to go far and be successful.”

But it’s becoming less unheard of, and that’s largely because of students like Rosales who see educational attainment as key to reclaiming Native identity and culture. He is spending the summer in the Washington, D.C., area for an internship at the National Institutes of Health, after which he’ll be heading up north to start college at Yale University. Rosales has long been on a mission to attend a prestigious university, but if he hadn’t gotten in to Yale, he had plenty of backups: He was accepted to six other Ivy League schools.

Rosales, who plans on going to medical school after college and eventually working as a primary-care doctor on the reservation, is in many ways the poster child of what students at his alma mater, [Red Cloud Indian School](http://ift.tt/2ujlviE), can achieve despite growing up in one of the most destitute places in the country. A Jesuit K-12 institution at the end of a pine-tree-lined driveway in the town of Pine Ridge, Red Cloud boasts an ever-growing [roster of alumni](http://ift.tt/2u33Osa) who are leaders in fields ranging from medicine to the arts and [a network of faculty members](http://ift.tt/2ujK8eW) with elite-college degrees. Red Cloud also has a record-high 72 [Gates Millennium Scholars](http://ift.tt/2u3TxvN), more than any other school its size in the nation.

Yet Red Cloud isn’t just some prep school that hones promising Pine Ridge kids for post- and off-reservation success at the expense of their Native identity and community—at least it doesn’t try to be. Many of its educators and staff are themselves alumni of the school, people who left for a few years and then returned to give back. At Red Cloud’s high school, students must take four years of Lakota-language classes in order to graduate—on top of “spiritual-formation” courses that incorporate Catholicism and Lakota spirituality—and they can choose from a menu of culturally relevant electives, including [ethnobotany](http://ift.tt/2uj5Dwm) and [Native American literature](http://ift.tt/2u3kCPV). College and after-school-club posters line the halls, as do signs with inspirational quotes in both Lakota and English from Oglala Sioux leaders and the Pope. Its campus houses [a Heritage Center](http://ift.tt/2oqVIqu), which includes an art gallery and a gift shop that features work by Lakota artisans.

The atmosphere primes Red Cloud’s students to be both community prodigies and the young leaders of an indigenous renaissance of sorts: The reservation’s young people are [driving a new wave of activism](http://ift.tt/2mvCeeO), like that seen in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. It’s a subtle yet intense movement that promises to define the future of Pine Ridge. After all, roughly half its population [is under 25](http://ift.tt/2ujK92u).

“We are part of the Seventh Generation ... prophesied to be the generation that creates those individuals that will spearhead the economic, spiritual, and social renewal,” Rosales said. The tall, slim 19-year-old sported a sharp haircut, Nike skate shoes, khaki-colored jeans, and a thick, crew-neck sweater when we spoke. Rosales was referring to a prophesy made by the Oglala Sioux leader Crazy Horse, who shortly before his death in the late 1800s predicted that a cultural renaissance was afoot. “We are going to be that group of people that makes that prophecy come true,” Rosales said. “Red Cloud is helping us to do that.”

Rosales at Red Cloud Indian School (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) But for youth on Pine Ridge, life—and the educational opportunities that shape it—is not confined to a single narrative. Rosales, who grew up visiting his mother’s hometown in Germany every summer, is somewhat of an anomaly even for Red Cloud’s standards. The day-to-day experiences on this immense South Dakota reservation both confirm and challenge stereotypes, complicating pervasive assumptions about the educational needs of Native Americans—and of rural Americans more generally.

As a private school, Red Cloud requires families [to opt in](http://ift.tt/2ujlxqM)—to be proactive about their kids’ education and literally invest in it by paying nominal tuition. The return on investment is huge: Just over 95 percent of this year’s graduating Red Cloud seniors are headed off to college in the fall, compared with [roughly 70 percent](http://ift.tt/2iFCMhy) of recent high-school graduates nationally. But Red Cloud, which is funded mostly by private donations, is different from most private schools in that it serves a population that’s almost universally poor—all but two members of the most recent senior class are eligible for Pell grants. Well over half of the kids enrolled at Red Cloud lack internet access at home, and the school prohibits teachers from assigning homework that requires a computer. Tuition costs a mere $100 a year. Families with more than one child enrolled pay an annual maximum of $200.

Araceli Spotted Thunder moved here from Oklahoma City when she was 13 precisely so she could attend Red Cloud. Neither of her parents graduated from high school and they wanted more for their daughter. For Spotted Thunder’s mom, whose family was originally from Pine Ridge, the school’s reputation and close-to-nothing price tag were enough to convince her that this is where her bright and promising child needed to be. Now a recent graduate of Red Cloud, Spotted Thunder—who has straight black hair, glasses, and a magnetic smile—will be driving 600 miles northeast in the fall to major in sociology at Minnesota State University. “It’s scary thinking I’m going to be the first to be going to college,” she said. “But I’m also really excited about it.”

Inside Pine Ridge High School and Red Cloud Indian School (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) Yet Spotted Thunder’s trajectory toward college has been far less linear than that of Rosales, and not only because she’ll be a first-generation college student.

“Throughout my entire 17 years, I was told that I wasn’t going to be going to college, [that] I wasn’t going to do anything because I was going to end up like my parents, who were both alcoholics,” said Spotted Thunder, who’s now 18. Unfortunately, it was a message she started to believe. A few years ago, she hit a tipping point and attempted suicide. After taking a short break from school to recover from the incident, Spotted Thunder, at the encouragement of her English teacher, decided to join the poetry-slam team. She had never been part of a group that allowed her to express her feelings so viscerally and honestly. “Having these options that I didn’t really look at beforehand was really eye-opening,” she said. Since then, the poetry-slam community has served as somewhat of a lifeline for her: “It got me thinking that I need to not fall back into that rhythm that I was in before, to start looking at the brighter side of things, which I have, and it’s helped a lot.”

Spotted Thunder’s complicated relationship with her mom has also pushed her. “I didn’t really think I was going to college until last year,” she said, her voice wavering as tears started to set in. “The summer before junior year ... my mom was, of course, drinking one night, and she told me that I can’t end up like her. And so that really sparked a big thing in me to want to do better.”

For Spotted Thunder, staying on the path to college required far more than ambition and exposure to a college-going culture—it required an outlet, a place to reflect on things, cope with hardship, and boost her self-esteem. It also required confronting the generational poverty, trauma, and cultural disconnection that forced her mother and so many other Natives into addiction. She had to really commit to breaking those cycles.

When I asked Spotted Thunder the same question I posed to Rosales—_What do you want outsiders to know about Pine Ridge?_—her response was almost identical. “It’s not that nobody wants to help themselves; it’s just that they don’t have that help in order to go about that,” she said. “I would just want to say that it’s not entirely our fault.”

Just a small percentage of Pine Ridge’s youth end up at Red Cloud, of course; the rest are scattered across the extensive reservation’s ecosystem of educational settings. In addition to the private schools, there are the tribal-grant schools, which are overseen by a local governing board. There are the county schools, which fall under the state’s jurisdiction. There are the Bureau of Indian Education schools, which are federally funded and often federally operated.

Deanna Mousseau recently graduated from Pine Ridge School—one of the reservation’s Bureau of Indian Education schools, located five miles south of Red Cloud.

Mousseau was working on an assignment for her Native-studies class—using colored pencils to shade in a map of different indigenous populations “before the white people came”—when I approached her in the campus’s small, sunlit library to see if she wanted to chat. Pushing her backpack aside to clear the table, she shrugged. “Sure,” she said without making direct eye contact. With a slight smirk and black bangs nearly covering her eyes, the 18-year-old explained that she only recently moved to Pine Ridge from Pierre and had spent nearly her entire life in the foster-care system.

Pine Ridge is her fourth, and favorite, high school. But if she had been able to choose, she would have skipped high school and gone straight to college. “High school has been really stressful for me, so I’m ready to move on,” Mousseau said, noting she had a “horrible” attendance record and rarely did any homework. “I went through a really bad experience in my life, and it makes me really anxious,” she told me. She alluded to growing up too fast but didn’t elaborate. “So sometimes, I just take breaks. Sometimes maybe too long. Maybe it’s just me being lazy.”

Mousseau’s classroom experiences didn’t play much of a role in inspiring her to come up with a postsecondary plan; she told me she found support and encouragement from other places. From her difficult childhood experiences. From her involvement in social-justice volunteer work. From her boyfriend, who, she noted, was one of Red Cloud’s Gates scholars.

Despite a spotty academic record, when I spoke with Mousseau, all she could talk about was college and beyond. At first, she told me, “I was seeing myself, like, way out of state—like, as far as I can go.” But then she lost her grandparents, home, and belongings in [a propane explosion](http://ift.tt/2u3r1dK) last fall, and her plans were thrown off track. “I had to kind of start over, so now I think I just need to regroup and make sure I’m stable enough to go live in a place where I have no resources and no network of people.” She’s going to Black Hills State University, a two-and-a-half-hour drive northwest of the reservation close to the Wyoming border, for a year or so before transferring to an out-of-state school. It’s all part of Mousseau’s “weird, long eight-year plan,” a detailed blueprint that involves her pursuing a Ph.D. and working as a child psychologist. She’d like to incorporate Lakota traditions into her psychology practice and travel to various reservations to work with Native youth. “I plan to do everything different in college,” she recently told me, noting that she has already secured grants to help pay for tuition, and “I have already enrolled myself in some programs that will help keep me on target.”

Mousseau (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) That post-high-school ambition is matched only by her passion for social justice. Mousseau is on the youth advisory board of a group called [the Encampment](http://ift.tt/2u37qdX)[,](http://ift.tt/2u37qdX) which encourages youth activism and brings members together to engage in community service and workshops, among other activities. Mousseau’s involvement with the Encampment even brought her to Mississippi for six weeks to help residents on the Choctaw Indian Reservation with their powwows and ceremonies.

“I think there’s this new atmosphere, this new optimistic thing for Native youth,” Mousseau said. “I don’t know what it is exactly—there’s just something where we’re changing, we’re starting to realize the mistakes of our parents and our grandparents.” _It’s not our fault._“We don’t have to live like this.”

Pine Ridge, like so many other Native American reservations in the United States, bears the scars of a history defined by discrimination and injustice and abuse. “Since the white man first trespassed on these lands known as _He’ Sapa_[Black Hills], there has been an open season on the lives of the Lakota people,” explained Tim Giago, an Oglala Lakota journalist, in [an op-ed](http://ift.tt/2uj1Yij) for _Native Sun News Today_earlier this year_._“Entire Lakota families were shot to death by the gold miners, trappers, and settlers that invaded their lands.”

The Wounded Knee massacre of 1890 is a particularly macabre example of Pine Ridge’s tainted history. There, American troops slaughtered at least 150 Sioux natives—roughly half of them women and children. The carnage, which was instigated following a minor clash between a Lakota and a member of the U.S. Army’s 7th Cavalry, was [the last major confrontation](http://ift.tt/1o2UvZF) of the so-called American Indian War in the Great Plains region. The year before the Wounded Knee massacre, the U.S. government [confiscated millions of acres](http://ift.tt/2ffqB9J) of the Sioux’s sacred _He’ Sapa_territory and assigned the Lakota to reservations.

It was more or less around the same time that, across the country, the U.S. government started forcing Native Americans to attend boarding schools to assimilate them to Eurocentric education and cultural norms. A [motto](http://ift.tt/1CZ30kU) attributed to Colonel Richard Henry Pratt embodies the philosophy behind this practice: “Kill the Indian and save the man.” At these boarding institutions, which were often run by Christian organizations, students were prohibited from speaking their own languages and forced to adopt European American customs. Children, many just a few years old, were often forcibly removed from their parents; some never saw their families again. Tens of thousands of Native students continued to enroll in these schools through the latter half of the 20th century—students who would become the parents and grandparents of today’s Native youth.

A roadside memorial on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) This context—the massacre, the Eurocentric boarding schools, the attempted annihilation of Lakota identity—underpinned the conversation  a couple of Lakota elders were having on a brisk, overcast morning at the [Lakota Prairie Ranch Resort](http://ift.tt/2u3JW8d), a motel complex of single-story rooms located in the dusty town of Kyle, South Dakota. The elders get together once a month to discuss the state of education and related issues; my visit to the reservation happened to coincide with their March meeting, so I asked Dayna Brave Eagle, who oversees the Oglala Sioux tribal education agency, if I could stop by.

Hardly noticing me as I tiptoed into their meeting space—a room adjacent to the motel lobby whose walls were lined with mounted deer, moose, and bison heads—the elders were eating breakfast at plastic folding tables, chit-chatting about Lakota identity, and trading jokes about white people’s confusion over Native American names.

The conversation eventually segued into one about college-going culture on Pine Ridge—a discussion that made it clear that for students like Mousseau, Spotted Thunder, and Rosales, the decisions around where to go to, what to study, and even whether to go at all are incredibly thorny. Pine Ridge has a complex relationship with the _college-isn’t-for-everyone_[mantra](http://ift.tt/1JJd5Ry), because for so many generations its people had been told college wasn’t for any of them. The local reality of unemployment and poverty—combined with the fact that [just 14 percent](http://ift.tt/2u3A26v) of Native American adults have bachelor’s degrees or higher, a lower rate than any other race in the United States—arguably makes college attendance an even greater priority for youth on Pine Ridge than it is for their peers elsewhere. But blindly pushing reservation youth toward college, particularly when campuses are far away, can set them up for failure. It can also mean depleting the reservation of human and social capital.

“If anyone wants to go to college, there are opportunities, and we will support them, but maybe they don’t want to go,” Brave Eagle said. “Maybe it’s _our_dream for them to all go. I’m starting to realize that not everybody’s college-bound.” Maybe some are meant to enlist in the military instead, she suggested, albeit skeptically. (Native Americans serve in the military at a higher rate than any other ethnic group, [according to some statistics](http://ift.tt/1ApCj9I), and that has been the case since the American Revolution.) Maybe the best option for others is to go straight into the workforce. The path that isn’t advisable for anyone, though, is not having a post-high-school plan: 41 percent of Pine Ridge youth ages 16 through 24 [are neither employed nor in school](http://ift.tt/2nkgW4K)—as compared with 25 percent of Native Americans in the same age range nationally and 10 percent of their white counterparts.

But things get tricky even when talking strictly about the Pine Ridge youth who are college-bound. Should they stay on the reservation and go to one of Oglala Lakota College’s nine campuses? Should they go off the reservation to one of South Dakota’s state universities? Should they leave the state altogether? The answer is different for every student, of course, but it’s tinged with all kinds of trade-offs.

Leaving the reservation for college often means more than just moving elsewhere to get a degree—it can also mean landing in a place where your ethnic and cultural identity is no longer baked into the fabric of everyday life, a place where that identity is treated as insignificant or exotic. College life often amounts to a culture shock that can be especially overwhelming for a student who’s already one of the very few people in her community to even consider college in the first place. “We kind of laugh about it,” Brave Eagle said. “When you go off [the reservation] and you’re hungry, you’re hungry … You’re just gonna be hungry. If you stay on the reservation and go to [Oglala Lakota College] and you’re hungry, you’ve got relatives. You can go to their houses and eat, and you won’t be hungry.”

Of course, staying on the reservation has downsides, too. “You get the peer pressure from others that aren’t in college with you, just saying, ‘Ah, you don’t have to go to class. You don’t have to do that. Let’s go do this,’” she said. “When you’re out there on your own, you have no choice but to go and get it done.”

Then there is the battle of expectations. Every student who leaves for college and doesn’t come back is just another drip down the reservation’s brain drain. And every student who leaves and comes back prematurely and never manages to return to school is just another Native who failed to fulfill her higher-education goals.

“We lose too many of our kids because somebody from the outside, with good intentions, based on their perspective and their values for us” told them to go to college elsewhere, said John Haas, one of the elders and a veteran educator. Such advice led two of Haas’s daughters to the University of Iowa, both of whom lasted only a year before coming back.

Programs like the American Indian College Fund’s [Native Pathways to College](http://ift.tt/2ujAKrD) exist to provide Native students with advice and support that are tailored to their unique needs and developed with these cultural challenges in mind. Native Pathways sends coaches to high schools across South Dakota, North Dakota, Washington, Montana, Wisconsin, and Alaska to conduct workshops and provide one-on-one guidance. Perhaps most importantly, the coaches rigorously engage with prospective college-goers through social media and text messages to make sure students are on track in the search process and confident in their application choices. I accompanied Davida Delmar, the coach assigned to Pine Ridge, as she visited schools across the reservation. She consistently encouraged students to friend her on Facebook, to add her on Snapchat, to take down her cell-phone number.

Indeed, while a big part of the College Fund’s work involves helping Native students find a way to pay for college, the Pathways program is dedicated largely to helping them find the best postsecondary match. Stationed at a round table in Pine Ridge School’s library and facing shelves of basketball trophies, Delmar encouraged kids who trickled in between classes to apply for travel scholarships so they could visit campuses before applying. Actually experiencing a campus before attending is especially key for Native kids, explained Delmar, a Navajo who went to Brown University as an undergraduate and returned to her home state to pursue a graduate degree at Northern Arizona University. She made it through her four years in Rhode Island, she said, largely thanks to a core group of friends she made through her university’s Native Americans at Brown student organization.

Delmar (right) helps Pine Ridge High School student Aisha Helper apply for college financial aid. (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) Lyle Jacobs, who graduated from Red Cloud in 2012 and attended Duke University on a full-tuition scholarship, likewise stressed the importance of finding peer groups. Speaking on an alumni panel hosted by Red Cloud one afternoon, he admitted to an audience of high-schoolers that he was close to dropping out his entire first semester. “I go from living on the rez for 18 years to I don’t know anything,” he said. “I went from being one of the top students here to [a place where] everyone took 15 A.P. classes in high school … Everyone sounded so smart. I wanted to go home.” But he eventually realized those were just growing pains: “After the first three months, by November, I had a bunch of friends. I had stuff I was doing; I joined clubs and stuff. And Duke was the best four years of my life after that.”

Being a person of color at a predominantly white college can be overwhelming, and that feeling of isolation can become unbearable when that person is a Native who has spent her entire life in a place where her cultural identity is integrated into every institution. From Red Cloud to Pine Ridge School, students and counselors and teachers cited homesickness as one of the biggest obstacles to postsecondary attainment for reservation youth. Nakina Mills, the director of advancement and alumni support at Red Cloud, has witnessed too many students go off to college with big dreams only to return to the reservation months later overwhelmed with a sense of detachment from those dreams.

Mills spends much of her time striving to prevent that from happening—ensuring students not only end up at a college that’s a right fit for them but also persist once they’re there. Which is why, on top of helping kids figure out the financial picture, Mills tries to ensure everyone has a post-high-school plan that’s tailored to their needs. Does the school offer supports for Native students? Is the school too far away? Too close? Is the campus diverse enough? Is college even the appropriate next step? (She doesn’t make that concession often, but it happens.) The warm, no-nonsense 37-year-old constantly quoted current and former Red Cloud students, citing a litany of hypotheticals that can make or break a Native’s chance of success after high school.

For example, sitting across from me at a table in the principal’s office at Red Cloud, Mills recalled a former student who had just finished his first semester at a small, liberal-arts college in Pennsylvania. After returning to campus from Pine Ridge following his first winter break, the student told Mills that he wasn’t fitting in at college, that he wanted to come home. “I was trying to get him support … to try and get him to just wait,” she said. “I told him: ‘This is part of the process. You’re homesick. This is gonna happen every time you get back to school. You just gotta get out, get involved, do things.’ Blah, blah, blah.” Mills even connected the student with someone on campus who took him out to dinner. “Come to find out, his mom ended up buying a plane ticket home for him that weekend,” she said, “so he withdrew.”

The student was one of the few high-school seniors Mills didn’t have a one-on-one conversation with the previous year.

Charles Cuny Jr., the superintendent of Little Wound, a tribal-grant school in Kyle, agreed that whether or not a student stays on track with their postsecondary plan—be it in college, the military, or the workplace—is just as important as whether or not she had a plan to begin with.

Cuny stands in a hallway at Little Wound High School in Kyle on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) Far too often, where Native students are at socially and emotionally is not where they should be. According to Cuny, that’s largely because schools lack the resources to adequately equip kids with the skills they need to persist once they’re no longer engulfed by the safety net that is high school on the reservation. “Schools—their primary responsibility is education, but particularly in circumstances like this, teachers are also tasked with being counselors and social workers and nurses,” Cuny said. “This mental-health element, it’s not separate from this question about college attainment, and college retention, because you can’t improve their educational-achievement levels without addressing first their mental health and their well-being.”

After all, even when students do have support from people like Mills and Delmar and Cuny, getting through college is a daunting task. At the Red Cloud alumni panel, one of the students was candid about how tough her experience at an Ivy League school has been and how eager she is to finish. Her sophomore year was particularly bad, she noted, as she was in and out of the hospital on suicide watch. Life hasn’t gotten much easier: She doesn’t have many friends, and the few she does have are her middle-aged coworkers at her campus job.

“It’s really difficult because I get homesick a lot ... I’m 1,800 miles away from home,” she said. “I mean, occasionally I get good grades and I think I bounce back, but on my most recent midterm I got a 39.5 [percent] … My professor emailed me, and she emailed my dean, and it made me mad. I was like, _Why can’t you just leave me alone?_I know what kind of grade I got, but it’s hard because I don’t care. I’m just trying to graduate.”

In part because of how strapped it is for resources, and because of how deeply entrenched [historical trauma](http://ift.tt/2u3BV3f) is in the lives of those on Pine Ridge, the reservation’s education system often fails to give its youth the variety of opportunities that it gave to people like Rosales and Spotted Thunder. Official high-school graduation statistics for Pine Ridge are hard to come by, but one official estimated that, for every 100 children who enter kindergarten, just 30 will get their high-school diplomas. Native youth, in general, have the lowest high-school graduation rate of students across all schools, and the graduation rate for Native Americans in South Dakota [is roughly 50 percent](http://ift.tt/2ujlwCT). Finding a decent-paying job can be challenging even for the small percentage of kids who do manage to get their high-school degrees. The limited support students get in school and the limited employment options they have outside of school help explain why poverty and drug and alcohol abuse are so widespread in Pine Ridge.

Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local nonprofit, strives to fill in the gaps for these non-college-bound young people and to empower Lakota families [with a grassroots approach](http://ift.tt/2u3KqeQ). Working in seven core themes, from [language revival](http://ift.tt/2ujK274) to [food sovereignty](http://ift.tt/2u3dFOT), Thunder Valley steps in where, and when, schools fall short. Its slogan: “Native youth on the move.”

One of Thunder Valley’s programs focuses on workforce development by engaging young adults ages 18 through 26, many of whom dropped out of high school, in construction. They’re in charge of building a housing development with energy-efficient townhomes and rentals that could eventually serve as many as 900 people. But the 10-month program involves much more than a vocational-training course: Built into the model is an emphasis on social-emotional health and cultural revitalization, with activities such as trauma-sensitive yoga and equine therapy complementing the workforce-development projects.

Trainees with the Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation (Kristina Barker / The Atlantic) “We really try to arm them with not just construction skills, but [also] coping skills,” Andrew Iron Shell, Thunder Valley’s community-engagement coordinator, told me as he showed me around the construction site in the town of Porcupine one blustery morning. “Yeah, it’s nice we’re going to have a physical structure, but the process is way more powerful … That just gives people something to hang on to. There are not a lot of success stories that people here see every day.” Off in the distance sat several unfinished two-story houses, blue tarps blowing in and out of the holes that would soon become doors and windows. The slap of the sheets were met by the sounds of tractors and hammers; a few trainees were lifting wooden pillars into one of the homes.The workforce-development program has swelled in popularity over the years: For this class of participants, according to Iron Shell, it received more than 100 applications for its 15 spots. Perhaps that is in part because it’s a paying gig—participants get paid $6.25 an hour plus bonuses. But the demand can also be explained by one of the program’s core goals: to not only to give students job-training, but also to give them the confidence and financial savvy to become homeowners themselves.

“They come in with a deer-in-the-headlights look because a lot of them—maybe it’s their first job or they grew up not seeing people get up and go to work—don’t really understand the work culture,” Iron Shell said, pointing out his favorite highlights as we toured the lot—the chicken coop, the greenhouse, the bright mural of two Lakota children surrounded by dragonflies. “My sales pitch to the community is that the young men and the young women building these houses could technically buy one of these houses.”

That morning had started as it always does, with the students and trainers standing around tables arranged in a rectangle in a dusty room in Thunder Valley’s trailer complex. After a sage-smudging ceremony, the participants proceeded to go around the table and say what they were thankful for that day. Almost everyone said they were grateful to be there.

A mural at a Thunder Valley workforce-development site (Kristina Barker) Earlier this year, just before I traveled to Pine Ridge, I spoke with a man named David Espinoza. Espinoza is a Lakota Indian who was born and raised on the Rosebud Reservation, which sits just east of Pine Ridge, and who cofounded a group called [Boys With Braids](http://ift.tt/2ujlyLm) that promotes cultural pride in Native youth.

“This cultural shame, it was a tool designed to dehumanize us,” he told me, “to basically just destroy our idealism, the foundation of who we are as people.” He spoke of the “intergenerational trauma” that has permeated reservations over the centuries—of his mother who abandoned him when he was 15, of his time spent in federal prison, of all the Lakota people who end up lost or in trouble because they don’t know how to deal with the stress that’s ingrained in them. “We’re operating out of pain,” he said. _It’s not our fault._

Young Natives today are starting to peel back the layers of that trauma and confront it in a meaningful way, largely through the pride that education is helping them cultivate.

“[Crazy Horse] said, after that seventh generation … there will be a regeneration and a regrowth and a remembering within our people of who they are, and we’ll start coming back,” Espinoza said. “We’ll start coming back and coming to fruition. It’s happening.”

6r3ydc,73,2017-08-02,GF left me. This is a wake-up call.,Jimmyjim1024,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6r3ydc/gf_left_me_this_is_a_wakeup_call/,"Hey everyone, 
I'm a bit of a lurker here, I have a ton of respect for you guys, you inspired me a lot to start working out and I lost 10kg in the past year.

Been trying unsuccessfully nofap for more than a year, got up to 30 days I'd say, and very seldom held longer than two weeks.

I don't care if nobody sees this, I just need to vent. I'm abroad now and I don't know how to speak of this to my family of friends back home.

I've been in a long distance relationship for 2 years, and as said in the title my GF of 4 years left me last week (we were living at ours parents the 2 previous years). Now I don't think porn was the reason for the breakup: we're both 23, it's our first relationship and we have changed a lot because of the distance, but in different ways.
But it was definitely a factor for me. 
The times when we saw each other, I had always been doing pmo before, and I realize now that having a clear mind could have helped, as it was tough and we used to fight on the smallest things, instead on just focusing on enjoying ourselves for the shourt time we were together.

She made the decision to breakup, but ironically, I feel like I deserve it. Call it Impostor Syndrome maybe, but I have always felt culpability about fapping, and now I cannot feel even slightly angry at her. Im just so heartbroken and maybe writing about it here will help.

Obviously I relapsed just after she ended the Skype call, but I never felt so dirty inside, and I never felt so strongly the will to stop fapping. I am going to be serious about this one ! I can't become some slug avoiding his feelings and crawl back to her begging to take me back.

I come back in one month from my internship, and we may try again or we may not. I don't really care now and I have to focus on myself. It kills me to write it, but if someone else makes her happy, that's the most important thing. I've become too dependent on her.

The universe sent me a sign: I have to get my shit together, and nofap is one of the many steps I have to take. It's gonna be a long and hard road, but I sincerely hope I will make it.

Thank you if you read all this. I for one feel better, much better than if went to do you-know-what. 

PS: I also installed Tinder immediately after that, just to have the possiblity to hurt her I guess, but I realize now that it is toxic and completely opposite to what I am trying to accomplish with nofap, so I am uninstalling the app right now. I'm not ready to date again.

So for my internship my boss wanted me to create a script that generates documentation (in this case a table full of method headers) and upload to sharepoint. I got the documentation down in the form of a html page. I'm able to create a page and copy paste the html code into a web part no problem (Insert -&gt; Embed Code). However sharepoint seems to dislike my hoverover code and highlights the entire web part instead of the individual row. How would I go about getting hoverover to work? I'm working for a big corp so I won't be able to get the sharepoint software (just been using the browser page). 

CSS code causing issue on sharepoint but not when run through browser:

    tbody:hover td[rowspan],tr:hover td {
	    background: orange;
    }

Thanks. 

Edit: found solution, see my comment below."
6r4ebu,1327,2017-08-02,Mama Nurgle took my son and wouldn't give him back,maowsers93,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6r4ebu/mama_nurgle_took_my_son_and_wouldnt_give_him_back/,"Nurgle was supposed to be here at 6:30am to take my kid to her house for two days because his daycare is closed for the rest of the week. Did Nurgle show up at 6:30? No, no, no my friends. 

7:30; when I need to leave for work: Nurgle finally shows up without the car seat installed. Then her first order of business when she gets here is taking a nice long shit while her car is locked so I can't even put his bags in her car. When she is done taking a shit she must have immediately started loading him in, right? Haha no. Instead she does a load of laundry with our bathmat that I can only assume she got shit on. I'm still calm at this point.

8am; 30 minutes late for work: I try to install the car seat and realize I can't because the straps are tangled. I'm not strong enough to untangle them. I'm still quiet and calm at this point. 

8:15, 45 minutes late to work: I finally realize the car seat doesn't work. I'm still calm. Husband calls and tells her to watch the kid untill he gets off work and she throws a fit. I finally lose it. 

Nurgle tells me I am not allowed to be frustrated because it is not her fault she was late, or that the car seat wasn't installed. Her car seat. That she's used for years for her grandchildren. It's not her fault she didn't install her own car seat in y'all. Then, she tells me it isn't her fault she is late because of bullshit excuses about her alarm not going off, and oh..... Her legs kind of hurt. 

At this point I inform Nurgle I'm an hour late for work at a job I am about to put a full-time job proposal into (I'm an intern) and that she is fucking my chances for employment. She tells me I'm not allowed to talk to her like that. I inform her that she does, in fact, have to deal with the consequences of her actions. She plugged her fucking ears and went lalalalalalala. I swear to God y'all. I inform her that she is 60 years old and not a child. I'm told again I can't talk to her like that. I inform her that actually, I can.

I tell Nurgle to leave because at this point it is clear I can't work. She refused to. Says she has a right to her grandchild. That he has a play date. I tell her to stay then and wait for my husband while I go to work. She screams she won't. I ask, ""Why? Where you gotta go today? Work? Like me?""

She informs me everyone hates me and I piss everyone off. Y'all I've been with my husband for 8 years. I've never once been honest with this woman about how I felt about her. But the time I finally snap apparently everyone already hates me. She then tells me I shouldn't get involved in her marriage. Lol wut??? K, good pivot. 

I tell her to leave. She does. Nurgle comes back and tells me I have to be nice to her and talk to her in her preferred way. I inform Nurgle that she doesn't get to come back and tell me how to speak. She holds my front door closed so I can't open it. I inform her it's my door. I'm gonna open it when I want. She comes in and I, again, tell her she will have to deal with the consequences of her actions... Then shit got live. 


Y'all she took my son from me. Picked him up and carried him into his room and tried to lock the door. I get in the room and tell her to give me my son. She won't. Nurgle is blocking him with her body. I snap and physically grab Nurgle by the arm and scream, ""GIVE ME MY SON!"" she tries to resist me but I get him back. I scream at her to get out of my house. Y'all I had to threaten 9-11 to get her out. 

Edit: Doing an update. Talked to husband. He says fuck them all and that he is down for NC. I wasn't waiting to talk to him for permission to call the cops. I just needed to calm down and talk to someone before I took any action. We are going to call and file a report so there is documentation. Fuck Nurgle. Now she's posting pictures all over Facebook about having a great time with her grand daughter (rich S-I-L's kid). "

6r4qgb,0,2017-08-02,I need an ~~adult~~ senior programmer:,hpwu,web_programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_programming/comments/6r4qgb/i_need_an_adult_senior_programmer/,"[serious]

[TL;DR It sucked]

My question is this: how should I proceed? Go back to C# or risk getting a job as a jr web dev with no real experience? More than that how could I get an internship? I think thats really where I need to be at with C#, and not with PHP/Javascript.

Ok so I've attended a programming bootcamp, and I'm coming up on the end of the camp. I know people have mixed feelings on programming bootcamps but just hear me out and give me a bit of advice.

I'm fairly disappointed in the bootcamp. My opinion on it waxed and waned through the camp but its settled on being more a waste of time/money. 

Now to be clear I think a bootcamp is really good for someone with no intent on getting a job in programming who just wants to learn a thing or to about it. Its also good for someone to capstone themselves at the end of their own learning (out of college or being self taught.)

This however is where things take a turn: I had the opportunity to either self study C#, ASP, and .Net or go to the camp which was going to teach me 2 new languages. On top of that we would be learning angular/gulp/laravel/some other stuff but beyond that is a stretch (Spending less than a day on it.) 

The bootcamp lacked focus. Up to about week 7 the bootcamp was going in a really good direction: We learned HTML/CSS/Bootstrap really well. We moved to javascript and I think the instructor did a pretty good job with it, not a master of the language, but I know it well enough to complete several of the hackerrank modules in full. Sweet.

Then week 7 comes around and the entire class changes structure. Honestly the class should have ***STOPPED*** on javascript. We move on to php, the next 4 weeks are spent watching the instructor program with no time of our own to program. Around week 2 the instructor says ""You should be practicing at home."" This is not what the bootcamp stated in any capacity coming into it. I'm in a situation where there isn't ""At home"" time to practice/study. Its the reason I elected to go to the camp in the first place: They were advertising that everything we would learn would be expected of us in class. 

...Not quite how it turned out...

Now two things are apparent to me:

1. Bootcamps can be good. If they are like the first half of my camp you can get something out of them

2. They don't last long enough, and the instructor (in my case) isn't good enough at teaching to really help us.

Turns out the only reason we got time in class to practice Javascript is because the lead instructor didn't know the language before taking this job, and the instructor who did know it argued to give us time in class.

The bootcamp has mostly lied about things, and is constantly doing scummy things: Just the most recent of which is lie to the instructor. I called the entire previous graduating class. Asked them their opinion and here is what I got from them: ""Its great!"" ""Its amazing"" ""you should do it"" I got into contact with more than half of them. 

WEEEELLLL as it turns out these are people who all had either degrees or a background in programming. I just started working on C# a year ago, and paused to do this. So did 100% of the last class get jobs? Yeah of course. Will this class? Unlikely.

Final note: My biggest complaint is that the place has blatantly lied both to me, employers about me, and to the instructor, but is otherwise well connected. For instance we are supposed to be showing off final projects to potential employers, but not a single person from the last class actually got employed through this method. They are currently jumping down my throat for what I have, despite this really being the first time I've ever used PHP. Other students have literally banned together (against their rules) and they are 'over looking it' because 'at a real job you will have a programmer you go to for help.' (Yeah, right, only I've never met a single programmer who thinks this, even the instructor has corrected them on this point.) 

So most of the students ""Final"" projects are not their own work. Fuck one guy just has a blank laravel application with no php/javascript and they haven't bitched at him because another student designed all of his HTML and it will ""Look good."""
6r59g8,21,2017-08-02,"In a purely financial sense, joining the military makes a ton of sense, right?",Hologram22,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6r59g8/in_a_purely_financial_sense_joining_the_military/,"So a bit of background: I'm a 26-nearly-27-year-old former enlisted Marine (5 years active duty) about to start my master's degree in mechanical engineering. I'm also a Pathways Intern with the federal government, which means that I can, with a pretty high degree of confidence, expect to convert to a full-time employee at my agency at the GS-9 level at the end of my program in June, and rise to the GS-12 level in a year and a half after that. 

For reasons, I've also been looking at getting back into the military game, and in the course of my research I decided to compare pay and benefits to see if I would be as able to support my family in the armed forces as I would with my civil service career track. On the face of it, the base pay of a brand new O-1E would be quite the pay cut compared to a GS-12. However, after factoring in the housing allowance and/or free/cheap base housing  (I'm honestly not exactly sure how housing works, especially for officers. I lived in the barracks back in the day) the pay suddenly becomes very comparable, and that's before considering the tax-free nature of the housing allowance and any other allowances I may be recipient of. Add on to that the lack of having to pay for healthcare and the military starts to look pretty good. The disparity gets even bigger as I would climb the ranks.

And of course there's the DoD retirement schedule. You can retire with 50% pay after 20 years in. Compare that to FERS, which would take about 45-50 years to get the same deal (and at a likelier lower pay rate). The DoD doesn't have the 5% match for service members that the civil service does, but it seems that's overcome by the pay disparity and tax benefits. 

Obviously there are other things to consider, such as work-life balance, having to move kids around all the time, and my spouse's career interests (my spouse is an aspiring artist, so she works for herself; the hard part is breaking in, which can be hard to do when moving around all of the time, often to places without an established or emerging art scene). These are separate conversations to have, and are weighted just as much, if not more, than the money issue. But this is r/personalfinance, not r/worklife or r/kids, so I'm after the dollars and cents question here. 

Am I right in my estimation, or is there some big piece of the puzzle that I'm missing?

Ethan Brenthouse took a long, slow sip from his mojito, draining it down to the ice. He had to admit, as much as his preference was for American rye, the Dominicans made a damn good cocktail. He lazily signaled to a wide-eyed waitress, who quickly shuffled over.

""Another please, mamacita"" he sneered in his distinctive, privileged drawl.

""Of course sir,"" the young girl quietly responded, giving him a pained smile before hurrying back to the bar. In the meantime Ethan sat back on his chair, folding his arms and listening to the waves of the Caribbean crashing into the white sand of Puta Cana Playa, just a hundred or so feet away.

It was good to be American again.

It was hard sometimes to process how much the country had changed in a few short years. Ever since the astonishing electoral victory of the Founding Father's Party in 2020, America had finally fulfilled its Manifest Destiny and become the Empire it always deserved to be. The red, white and blue juggernaut had steamrolled through Venezuela in 2021, crushing the socialist uprising and liberating the world's largest proven oil reserves. Across Latin America rebellions and left-wing insurgencies everywhere from Honduras to Peru were crushed by US-backed dictators using America-made weapons. And yes, the FFP had also built the big, beautiful wall on the Mexican border.

The entire southern continent was now nothing more than one huge maquiladora, making American goods for next-to-nothing and pumping money into the glorious US economy. Places like the Dominican Republic had become veritable gold-minds for American investors. In the morning they could grease some palms, and displace a few hundred favela-dwellers to build a new luxury hotel for American tourists. In the afternoon, dine with corrupt government officials to ensure that US corporations could have monopolies on the country's natural resources. And in the evening, party with an army of Latina sluts, all desperate for a principe blanco to take them to the US.

Which brings us back to Ethan Brenthouse.

Tall, blonde, and chiseled from years of polo and lacrosse, Ethan was about to enter his final year at Dartmouth, and had decided to take the summer to ""intern"" with a venture capital firm down in DR - one owned by an alumni of his frat. Ostensibly Ethan was there to help find new, market-friendly investment opportunities for the growing and dynamic American market. In reality this just involved a lot of partying and drinking, for which Ethan would receive an extremely generous stipend and a job after he graduated with one of Washington's biggest lobbying companies.
Tonight, however, Ethan wasn't interested in business. He was interested in pleasure.

He had tried to make some vague promise to himself to stay faithful to his girlfriend back in Dartmouth over the month he was down in DR - after all he'd cheated, and been forgiven, so many times it was honestly farcical at this point. That changed his second night in Puta Cana however, when he found himself in a strip club's VIP room with some whore on her knees in front of him, head bobbing up and down. The women down here were just so...desperate and servile. Was it the Catholicism? Their sense of inbred inferiority? Or just the fact they knew 21-year-old Ethan was in possession of more money than they could ever dream of?
The waitress returned a deposited his mojito with a timid smile before disappearing. Taking a drink, Ethan's eyes scanned around the hotel's restaurant. It seemed the Mandarin had taken extra care to have plenty of eye-candy on display for their Western visitors, so Ethan wasn't exactly lacking for options. Waitress? Hostess? Classily-dressed girls, here all alone, who were likely hookers?

One way or another, his privileged white seed would be flowing down some puta's throat tonight...

Hi there! Do taboo themes like corruption and raceplay turn you on? Do you want to explore the sick, dystopic side to American colonization? Do you want a well-written, eloquent roleplay that can be either short-term or long-term? Well then you're in luck. 

This is a story where, together, we craft the downfall of a beautiful, [young Latina girl](https://gfycat.com/AggravatingComplicatedDassierat). Maybe she's a waitress, struggling to make ends meet, and sees Ethan as a ticket to the top. Maybe she's a student, wide-eyed by Ethan's riches, or maybe she's a high-class escort, surviving a dystopic world, who knows how to give boys like Ethan the Latina experience they crave. Whatever character you choose, it'll be one where Ethan gets to realize his innate superiority over the mulatto hoards of Latin America, fucking their women just as his country had fucked over their people.

I realize the prompt is quite dark but I'm far, far more interested in mental degradation and corruption than anything physical. I find it so much hotter when a girl forces herself to willingly submit to an arrogant guy then any actual rape scene.

If you're at all interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you!"

I'm an incoming Pratt freshman and originally planned on doing BME/ECE, but now I've become a lot more interested in programming and am strongly considering software engineering or something in quantitative finance. I've seen a lot of ECE/CS Pratt students get great internships and jobs in these fields, but I feel I might be wasting time taking science/ECE  classes instead of CS classes (for example, I won't be able to take CS 201 until my sophomore year given my schedule). I am certainly interested in electrical engineering, but I'm afraid it might not be worth taking a ton of tough engineering classes while I could be focusing on CS more. Would I be better off transferring to Trinity to major in CS and perhaps Math or Econ, or will I be fine with ECE/CS?

Right now, my schedule is PHYS 151, EGR 103L, Math 212, and EGR 190L (the new engineering design class they're piloting this year).

TL;DR: Stay in ECE/CS double major in Pratt or transfer to Trinity CS major for software engineering?

Thanks so much! "

In my senior year of college – this would have been in ’93 – my degree required an internship. Luckily, the local police department had a friendly relationship with the criminal justice faculty at my school. It was easy for me to nab a position in my fall semester, and most of the cops seemed like they enjoyed showcasing their expertise to a newbie. I enjoyed a couple weeks of ride-alongs and tours of the headquarters, but soon I felt like I’d gotten the gist of it, to be honest. This was a college town in rural Illinois, so it was basically drunk kids, meth cooks, meth users, and traffic tickets. Sprinkle on some bar fights, shoplifting, and domestic violence, and you had Ashland figured out.


My internship was made even better by my cousin, Frank, an Ashland cop, who saw to it that I wasn’t bored. He would show me which parts of town to avoid, tell me some of his “war stories”, and once, when we were patrolling late at night, he sped down a stretch of road while blasting the theme song from “Cops”.


It’s been long enough, so I’m not worried about getting myself or Frank in trouble now. He left the force in 2007 and has been working happily in private security ever since. I ended up staying on the academic track and am similarly unconcerned about getting in trouble for something I did over two decades ago.


The thing I shouldn’t have done was photocopy police evidence without permission and keep it. I still have the copies - one letter and some journal pages - sitting right next to me as I type this. I had forgotten about it, until I read my email this morning and saw a message from Frank. Then I went to the basement, where I kept all the nostalgic junk from my adolescence and early adulthood, and started digging through boxes.


I can’t explain why I kept those pages for so long. The shock value alone is probably a sufficient enough explanation, but there was something else...some sentimentality or something. The woman who wrote them is gone and has no family, and some part of me hated the thought of her existence winking out of memory, like a dying star. 


The night I copied the evidence was a Friday. I was scheduled to be at the police department from 4:00 PM to midnight. Frank was working, so he scooped me up, and we set out in his squad car. A couple speeding tickets, a wellness check, and one sub sandwich later, the sun was setting. Frank turned around in a cul-de-sac to begin patrolling his sector again. Navigating the winding neighborhoods, he slowed as we passed one block.


“Has anyone told you about the *murder* that happened over here?” he said with dramatic intonation.


My interest was piqued. In three weeks of shadowing, one noticeably absent part of this internship was the regaling of famous local crimes. Tempted by the prospect of an eerie tale to usher in the fall evening, I told him I hadn’t.


Frank pointed to one of the homes, a small farmhouse with a wraparound porch. Its white paint was peeling, and although it looked small, it had a second story with a large balcony.


“So, in the 80s, a lady named Alice Weiss lived in that house. A guy named Colton lived over there.” He pointed to the powder blue house next door. It was in better shape than the white house, but it still looked pretty run-down. The vinyl siding was dirty. Unkempt vines choked the porch’s latticework.  Unlike the rest of the homes in the neighborhood, this one still had a gravel driveway, peppered with tufts of weeds.


“Then around Thanksgiving, cops get a call about gunshots coming from the Colton house. They show up and find Weiss on his front porch with her brains blown out and Colton inside in the same condition.


“What got people extra riled up is that Weiss had pentagram-shaped burns on both of her arms. Coroner said they were a decade old, at least. Colton’s body had pentagrams carved into his skin too, but they were fresh. It looked like Weiss did it before she killed him.”


“Well, this was right in the middle of all the 80s Satanic panic, right?” I said (secretly hoping Frank would think I was knowledgeable).


“Right,” he said absently. “But that bullshit cropped up all across the country, and there were plenty of alleged cases without any real evidence to back up the accusations. Here, we had a case with flesh-and-blood victims, one of which had Satanic markings on her body predating that whole fiasco.”


“Fair enough,” I replied.


Frank made a right at the stop sign and continued through the neighborhood. “That’s kind of the end of the story, unfortunately. Weiss had been mentally ill for most of her life and people were exactly as understanding as you’d think. Everybody assumed she was just a crazy woman who worshiped the Devil because that’s what crazy people do, and when that wasn’t enough, she murdered her neighbor.”


I mulled over his words as a silence overtook the cruiser.


Frank broke the quiet a few minutes later, when we emerged out on the main road. “And as much as people tried to forget it happened, the Weiss case just stuck with people. Colton had been her neighbor since she was born, known her family, known her grandparents. They lived next to each other for over thirty years, and then one day out of the blue, she just murders him and offs herself –”


A tinny voice on Frank’s walkie interrupted him. Dispatch needed an officer to come back to the station and help with an emergency ex parte order.


When we got there, a distraught woman with a black eye was sitting in the lobby, rapidly tapping her foot against the tiles. Frank gave me a knowing look and told me to go find Sergeant Tate; he would come get me when he was done writing the report.


The Ashland Police Department was clearing out old files to be moved to off-site storage, and today it was Sergeant Tate’s problem. I helped him move box after box, looking longingly at some of the files. After thirty minutes, the sergeant told me in a low voice he was going out back for a smoke. On his way out, he called out over his shoulder in a teasing voice, “No peeking, now.”


Offering him an empty promise not to, I stood obediently until I heard the door shut behind him. Then I went to work. I rifled through every box, content to read a little here and there, but at the front of my mind was the story Frank had told me less than an hour before. After a few minutes of unstacking boxes and hectic shuffling, I hadn’t found any files from before 1979. The excitement I’d felt gave way to resignation. I wouldn’t be finding anything on Alice Weiss in here.
 

Nevertheless, I continued to look through the old files, though at a slower pace. There was still a chance I might find something. Plus, I reasoned that I might as well look while I had the time. My instincts ended up proving correct. My heart rate quickened once I started to see dates from 1980, then 1981. I kept going until, in a box of files from 1984, I saw it. One manila folder bore the label: “010111785--009   WEISS HOUSE”. I glanced around and pulled it out of the box.


The folder contained only a letter and a small journal, both bagged. Automatically, I threw it back in the box and carried the whole thing to the adjacent corner, where there was a small desk, a file cabinet, and a copier. I peered out the door frame, saw nothing, heard nothing. I cracked the photocopier cover and slid the letter, still in its plastic, underneath, and hit “Start”. The machine whirred to life, and I whirled around and started to loudly re-stack some of the boxes. I knew Sergeant Tate smoked American Spirits, so I had a comfortable eight to ten minutes before he returned, and I’d used at least five searching the boxes.
 

The second the copier had finished, I put away the letter, maneuvered the journal open, and began on the first few pages of that. I had never felt so tense, and the compulsion to duplicate those documents was not one I could explain. I had started, and I barreled on to finish, feeling dread at both the potential for trouble and the prospect of not succeeding.
 

When the final page came out, I returned the journal to its box, folded up the papers, and shoved them into my small purse. Then, since I didn’t hear Sergeant Tate, I decided to re-arrange some of the boxes to hide my unexplainably desperate search. By the time he returned, smelling faintly of smoke and humming tunelessly, I had calmed down and resumed my normal work.


I finished my shift, intensely aware of the paper crammed in my bag. When I got back to my apartment, it was blissfully empty, the remnants of my roommates’ pre-party lying scattered around our living room. Hesitant to look at my spoils, I changed into pajamas and reheated some leftovers. I eyed my purse as I ate. Once the food was gone, I retrieved the wad of paper.


The evidence tag was blurry, but legible on the page beneath the writing. Dated 11/17/85, it referenced a case number and listed case type as “homicide/suicide”.


I read the one-page letter first. It was written on lined notebook paper in confident, swooping cursive. I’m transcribing it below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*My name is Alice Weiss. I’m thirty-three. I still live in the house I was raised in. 3106 Birch Lane. I have been in and out of psychiatric care for over half of my life. Recently, my therapist and I have been doing some new things to try and get at some of my problems. Among other things, I’ve been having nightmares on and off for the past fifteen or sixteen years. I can’t glean anything useful from them. Just an unhelpful combination of darkness, candlelight, fear, pain, screaming, nausea.*


*So, after failed attempts at everything from cognitive-behavioral therapies to medication and dietary changes, she’s asked me to keep a dream diary. If I commit to writing down anything and everything I remember, she says I may understand a little more about what is actually happening in my dreams. The last few weeks, I’ve been writing down what I remember when the dreams wake me up in the middle of the night. I didn’t read any of the entries until earlier today. I was afraid of how it would all sound in the daylight.*


*It worked, but I don’t think this is what my therapist meant to happen. I remember where the burns came from it wasn’t something I did to myself like Momma told Dr. Colton I remember everything now and I’m going to kill that son of a bitch*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The second item was a black notebook, one of the small, pocket-sized ones. The handwriting is barely recognizable, but the evidence tag says it was written by Alice and found in her house. The handwriting was a similar type of cursive, but the lines were bolder and narrower, like their author was stricken with urgency.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The day after my fifteenth birthday, Mr. Colton came over asking to borrow some sugar. Mr. Colton was my parents’ age but he lived with his elderly mother. Thus, he had acquired the label of “weird old man”, the kind of unspoken distrust that we kids felt towards unmarried adults. His eyes roved up and down my body as he asked. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*Before I could give him the sugar, he lunged at me, pressed a cloth over my mouth. When I woke up, I was blindfolded and bound at the wrists and ankles. I never found out where I was. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I think I’m underground. I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days, at least. The room I’m in is small, no windows. I don’t think it was built by professionals. The room seems to be hewn out of solid rock. There aren’t the reassuring right angles of newer construction.*


*Mostly men, but sometimes women, come and go, bringing me food and taking it away and bringing me a chamber pot and taking it away. I think they’re all different but it’s hard to tell. They don’t speak much and their hoods cover their faces. Sometimes they forget to bring me food and sometimes they forget to take the chamber pot away. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I think they drug me quite often. A few times I’ve passed out suddenly, and when I wake up, my body hurts. Sometimes I have bruises and cuts without knowing where they came from. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*The drugging, passing out, waking up with injuries has been getting worse. This last time, I woke up with my forearms all bandaged up. Whatever’s underneath hurts, it burns and itches. I’m too tired to look. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*They feed me bread and water once a day. Once, I complained that I was still hungry. My keeper suggested I eat some of the roaches.  The candlelight twisted his grin into a cruel mosaic. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I wake up to a new pain. My insides hurt...I don’t know what they’ve done to me this time. They treat me better now, so I try not to think about it. I get more food, candles, and a few extra blankets to sleep on. They’ve started posting someone outside my door at all times. The person is always humming something low and tuneless, like a Gregorian chant. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*Time passes. My belly swells. The bandages on my arms disappear one day. Two circles with a star inside. I might have been angry or upset about this once, but now I just don’t care much.*


*One night, I am ripped out of my sleep by a ripping pain coming from below. I scream into the tiny concrete room I am in. I keep screaming and screaming until they come. I don’t get any drugs this time. I feel split in half, before God and everyone, more opened and vulnerable than I have been this entire time. The pain is so bad I forget how much I hate Mr. Colton and his friends as they tend to me. I beg for them to kill me. It takes hours before the baby comes out. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I rest, and they take the baby away. If this were one of Momma’s radio dramas, I would scream and cry more, rage until all of my energy is gone, demand to see my baby. But I don’t want to see it. I don’t want anything but my room, my school, old life back.*
 

*Today I hear footsteps approaching my prison. They tell me everything will be okay as long as I do one more thing.*

 
*The scream that erupts from my throat is louder than any noise I made with the baby. They bring me a platter with a tiny, frail human figure on it, the flesh charred and blackened.*
 

*They tell me to eat. This is the worst thing.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
So yeah. I was a little shaken after reading. Luckily, I still had ten weeks left in the internship. I was able to get a little more information out of Frank and some of the other cops, including some who had been around when the murder occurred.
 

One of them, Lieutenant Mueller, remembered some of the facts floating around in the aftermath of the deaths. Roughly forty years apart in age, Alice Weiss had lived next to her eventual victim, Randall Colton, for her entire life (excluding her hospitalizations). Doing my best to act like just another college kid intrigued by cheap gore and true crime, I mentioned Frank had spoken about pentagram burns on Alice.
 

“Her psychiatric records specifically acknowledged the burns, because they were the reason she was admitted to her first facility when she was a teenager,” he told me. “Her mother says she found the burns when the girl started wearing long sleeves, even in July. Weiss claimed she had no memory of where they came from...but, even as a teenager, her records *also* spoke to a history of depression, hallucinations, and self-harm.”

 
I brought it up again with Frank, a few weeks later. Specifically, when I was at lunch with Frank and one of the Ashland PD’s detectives. I can’t remember his name, unfortunately. I do remember Frank telling me he was a Chicago cop before moving to Ashland, which is why “he’s the only one who doesn’t get fazed by this stuff.”

 
My biggest question was the connection between Randall Colton and the Dr. Colton mentioned in Alice’s final letter, and the grizzled detective answered it without even realizing it.

 
“I get why people react so strongly to the Weiss thing,” he said, in between French fries. “You live right up next to people, sometimes for years, and they’re never a threat to you, and then suddenly they’re the worst kind of threat. And in small towns like this it affects people even more powerfully because you’re naturally more interconnected. Hell, we even found out in the course of that investigation that Randall Colton’s brother was a psychiatrist over at Marion South State Hospital and he treated Alice Weiss back in the sixties when she had her first breakdown.”
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
So that’s all, right? A young girl in a small town, stricken with poor health at an early age, in a time when mental health treatment was still young, struggling for years before ending it all in a terrible fashion. Time goes on, family homes empty and refill, case files get put in off-site storage, people forget.


The reason I dug out my copy of Alice’s last words were because – as mentioned earlier – Frank sent me a short email this morning, asking if I remembered about the murder house from my internship. He attached an article from the Ashland local news attached.


3104 Birch Lane - Randall Colton’s old house - burned to the ground yesterday. The tenants were making meth there, and the house exploded. Three people died.


Once the flames were out and emergency responders were able to properly investigate the scene, they found a crude sub-basement. Frank told me he’d heard from one of his old buddies that the room must have been decades old, constructed well before things like home inspections and building permits were a reality.


Through a hidden door carved out of the foundation, they found small hallway leading to a smaller room. I didn’t ask Frank if they found any pentagrams on the walls. I’m sure he would have told me if they had.


The way Frank put it in his email, “hacking into the ground like that, it’s a miracle the house didn’t collapse twenty years ago.”  


Although I know he didn’t mean to be ironic, I’m not sure “miracle” is the word I would use.

6r6rxt,1,2017-08-02,Break up in hope of make up in 30's,Ginny_Leigh,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6r6rxt/break_up_in_hope_of_make_up_in_30s/,"My boyfriend and I were together for 3.5 years. When we started dating, I was 33 &amp; he was 31. He had previously been married &amp; divorced (one time each to the same woman) by the time we met. It had been a yr. since his divorce. Our relationship was healthy from the start. We fell in love w/ each other. We'd both met each other's family &amp; friends &amp; got along. About a yr. later, my bf was frequently saying how I was the one for him and even asked me if I'd ever thought about what kind of rings I like? This wasn't a proposal, to be clear. However; I was surprised, but nervously excited &amp; kept telling myself not to get my hopes up. One of his friends even had me trying on her wedding ring to gauge my size &amp; I told him about this. I was looking @ rings online because I had no clue which ones I liked, but I didn't push the subject. He gave me suggestions on which would compliment me. Within 2 months, this topic was gone. I didn't think much of it &amp; figured he psyched himself out, as maybe not enough time had passed since his divorce, BUT the idea of marrying him one day was still on my mind. A yr. later he began pursuing a new career &amp; we moved in together. Things were great! He always reminded me &amp; thanked me for giving him independence &amp; freedom in our relationship &amp; I always thanked him for being so patient, caring &amp; supportive of me. Within 6 months, everyone we knew was getting married, including ALL 3 of my siblings in the same year! I brought up the marriage issue on several occasions &amp; he would get a little frustrated &amp; say he wanted to some day but not right now because he wanted to be settled in his new career as a firefighter (he hadn't found a job yet) &amp; he wanted me to continue to pursue my dream of becoming an Occupational Therapist. I completely understood this &amp; agreed w/ it as I wasn't ready to get married right away either due to my career goals. Fast fwd. to year 3.1 to when I found out I got into a graduate program for Occupational Therapy &amp; I was going to have to move 6 hrs. away from him to pursue it. We planned on staying together, doing the long distance thing. He wasn't moving w/ me because while he didn't get a job as a firefighter yet, he still had his local real estate career to keep him financially afloat &amp; he was finishing a paramedic cert. program. He had planned on finishing the program, staying 3 months after to make enough money in real estate to get him by &amp; then hoping for a firefighting job near me. I was excited for our changes, but also VERY nervous, anxious &amp; sad we'd be apart. After this, we argued more than we ever did, normally. However, during specific discussions, he assured me that he wanted to marry me some day. We both still loved each other, but it was a very emotional time in our relationship. I moved mid June &amp; began my program immediately. It was stressful &amp; I was very negative &amp; had a lot of self-doubt (I was @ school 7 a.m.-8 p.m. M- Th. as it was an EXTREMELY intense 9 unit gross anatomy course condensed into 7 wks...future Dr.'s take this class &amp; fail it). At the same time, my bf was stressed back home w/ a paramedic internship, 2 volunteer firefighting positions &amp; doing real estate still. He offered to come see me for a day, brought me flowers &amp; we had a good time &amp; were intimate. The following wk., I found out that I wasn't going to be able to cont. in my graduate program because my score in this intensive, pre-qualifying summer class was too low (I had a 75%, but needed an 81% min.) It was heartbreaking. I had moved &amp; sacrificed all for this. My bf was very sympathetic. A couple days later, I had thought back to when my bf was visiting me &amp; talking to me over the phone about him possibly getting a job as a paramedic w/ the company he was interning for. To me, this meant he wasn't trying to move closer to me. I called him &amp; talked to him about it &amp; asked if he still wanted to marry me some day &amp; this time, he answered, ""I don't know. "" I was devastated because to me that is indicative of him being ok with losing me, knowing that's what I wanted in the long run. I told him that we could have a day to think about/process things &amp; that we should break up if he's no longer sure about marriage w/ me some day. The following night we broke up; I said the words, but it seemed a little mutual. When I asked if he wanted to break up, he told me he didn't ""want"" to but that if he couldn't offer me an assurance of marriage one day, than we should. I agreed &amp; we broke up. We were both crying, but we weren't mean or angry toward one another. Days later we had a few interactions via text &amp; phone (which he &amp; I both initiated) &amp; having second thoughts, I asked him if our break up was mutual. He said yes. I asked him if he thought we did the right thing. He said yes. I said that I thought we didn't, to which it was silent. I didn't want to beg him back to me, so I changed the topic and we said goodbye. It's very hard to accept our breakup and I keep holding on &amp; hoping that he'll come back to me w/ a change of heart, realizing what he &amp; I are losing. We both love each other very much still. We see each other in a wk. when he returns a lot of my stuff back to me. I'm not sure if I should be home or have him leave it on the doorstep? I love him, but unsure if I'll be able to keep composure in front of him. I also want to know if it's ridiculous for me to think he might come back to me one day w/ a change of heart. Well thanks for taking the time to read this. It was cathartic for me to write it, so sorry it's long."
6r7aoq,4,2017-08-02,"My [28 M] uncertainty with my gf/ex [25 F] of 6 years relationship, dealing with infidelity and trust.",nonisland,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6r7aoq/my_28_m_uncertainty_with_my_gfex_25_f_of_6_years/,"I'm honestly uncertain on how to do these things, seeing as this is the first time I've ever posted to this subreddit (this is an alt account, for obvious reasons). 

I've been in a serious relationship with my gf for the past six years, and I'm uncertain as what to do in this scenario I've found myself in. 

We started dating back in college and we had a rocky start with me just getting over an ex realizing that I liked her and didn't want her to be a ""rebound"". (My previous ex before this had cheated on me multiple times). We stayed friends for a little bit, but when I was comfortable enough with myself and willing to try being a relationship again started dating. Though it always seemed like I was trying to make it up for her for putting a stop on the relationship in the beginning. 

In the six years that we dated we saw each fairly often in the first year. I graduated but was able to find a job in the area to stay with her and we lived together in our second year. In our third year she had an internship in another major city, but we texted all day, talked on the phone when we had the chance, skyped every night, and saw each other every weekend. But, going into the 4th year she was accepted for graduate school in a different state. I was trying to get into my own graduate program in our home state and both are excellent programs. So we tried to make the long distance thing work. 

For two years we were in a long distance relationship. She was making new friends, and she found two guys roomates. I lived with a roomate one year and by myself the other. I worked fulltime (with flexible hours) and was a student fulltime (by academic standards). I pretty much was driven by this simple notion that as soon as I finished I'd get a job down where she was and move. All I would do is work, study, classes, and sleep. She, however, went out to bars, played on teams, and had a very active social life. 

During the long distance relationship we would see each other on holidays and during the summer. Everyday we'd text one another, call when we could, and skype every night. Though the content of the messages were becoming as if reflex or routine it lacked substance and I tried to be attentive but my every waking moment was spent trying to get down there, so it's possible that I could have done more. She had some rough emotional patches with what she was going through, and I tried my best to console her with my own situation. 

Right after I graduated I found a job in the state she was in within a month and put my two weeks in at work and packed up my entire life and moved across the nation to be with her. We moved in together, so it was now 4 people living in the place. I found that we were bickering more often, not seeing eye to eye, and that whatever I did either wasn't enough or that it upset her. I fell into depression from this because I spent the past two years trying whatever I could to make it down here only to find that it just wasn't how it was when we lived together. But after a few months of living together and fighting often we sought external help for getting the relationship back on track. 

We started going to relationship counseling, which didn't really help much, because it always boiled down into a state when she'd always take offense to something and get defensive and the conversation would end. I never could tell why she was in a bad mood or what was going on in her life. Counseling didn't seem to be of much help but we kept going for weeks. 

Then one of the people on from her sports team had pulled me off to the side and told me that I should know something and that I had to know something. I found out that she had been seeing another guy, in the romantic/relationship sense, since before I had even moved out to be with her.  

I broke up with her and have been distraught. I told her I knew and she confessed. I packed up everything I had and moved out as quickly as I could. She kept calling me, texting me, and showing up at my work to talk to me about it. I really just wanted to be left alone about this. But, eventually I relented and we talked for a while and started hanging out again. I thought that maybe I could get past it. I started seeing a different therapist in one on one sessions on how to cope with this situation. Things started to look as if it were able to work. 

One of the people in a different group of friends from work came up to me and pulled me to the side, told me that I should know something. During the first year she was down here she had been seeing one of other people in the program. Then another person that I met at the local bar told me that at the bars around town she would flirt with guys, ask them to buy her drinks, and give out her personal contact information. And that little flicker of hope that I had just kind of winked out of existence. 

I just have no idea who to trust, or how to regain it. 

I'm still living in that area, working in the same place. She's been away for work. But, I'm kind of worried of when she gets back since I work at the same place she goes to. Part of me still loves her very dearly, but another part of me holds this deep resentment. I haven't made any friends outside of her groups of friends, because dealing with this has gotten me into this depressive state and my social anxiety is now at it's worst. Pretty much all I do is work, go to the gym, watch netflix, and sleep. I just don't have any motivation to do the things that I used to enjoy doing. 

I just don't think I have any idea what to do.  
  
  ---   
  TLDR: Was madly in love with gf of six years. Long distance relationship hurt. Moved across the nation. Found out about multiple infidelities. No real friends in the area. Not a clue what to do. Any suggestions or opinions?"

I apologize if any of this post comes off as braggy/me being a diva/being ungrateful. I just need to vent and get objective feedback.

I would say nearly everything about my college career looks good on paper: Graduating early, 3.7 GPA, president of women in CS club, teaching assistant, 2 summer internships, on campus job since first semester of my freshmen year, won multiple scholarships, honors program etc. Now I have an awesome job offer lined up for after graduation. Even though I've done all of this stuff on my resume, I feel like a lot of it just fell into my lap/I didn't really try for any of it. I seriously feel like a phony. I pursued a CS degree after my parents suggested it...I didn't really know what else to do with my life, so I tried it out for the first semester and didn't hate it, and knew that it would open a lot of doors for me. I stuck with it, got noticed by professors, and I guess a lot of it paid off. Still though, I feel like it's not the real me and I just did it to appease my parents/because of my own greed. If it was not a lucrative field, I wouldn't be anywhere near it to be honest. At the same time though, I'm not sure what I would really be doing otherwise, since I have never been the person with a clear passion for anything. I was never the kid that always knew they wanted to be a teacher or doctor or whatever when I grow up. So here I am. I feel like people know it too. I don't fit the stereotype at all. I'm not a gamer, I don't program in my free time, I don't know a bunch of stuff about processors, I don't really even know that much about CS stuff in general. I feel like the boys know this and treat me like an idiot because of this. I'm reasonably attractive too and I enjoy girly things like makeup, fashion, nails, hair, and I feel like guys just look at me and think ""airhead"". I've been told that I don't seem like a technical person/""why are you even majoring in computer science""? I even feel like my girl friends that are not even CS majors think that I'm just faking it. I don't think anyone thinks I'm smart enough to do it. I also feel like some of my girl friends resent me for being ""successful"" with my grades/getting internships(I don't rub it in their faces though, I think they might just be jealous that there are a lot of opportunities in CS and not as many for their major) Anyways, I just feel foolish.

I just finished my summer internship and got a pretty sweet job offer from the company for when I graduate. Good salary for the area, signing bonus, relocation, and good benefits. I guess I am sort of excited/relieved that I have an offer. The main issue for me is that I have to accept or decline it by early September, which leaves pretty much no time for me to interview elsewhere since most companies do not start recruiting until mid September/October at the very earliest. My experience at the company this summer was very mediocre. It's a large company and I felt like no one really gave a shit about me or about anyone else. The people on my team were the classic CS nerdy brogrammer stereotype(condescending arrogant assholes that think they're the shit and will argue with me all day about everything. The full time people on the team were not so bad-although a couple were-but the other interns were terrible). They seriously made me feel so stupid and bad about myself. I cried driving home from work for a few days and just felt so out of place and miserable for the majority of time I was there. They're such a large company though that the chances of me being put on that team again or even seeing those people again is slim. I'm just worried most teams are like this because of their culture/the type of people they hire/just how software engineers are in general. 

I also do not really like the location of the company. It's 2.5 hours away from my hometown and 1.5 hours away from my college town. It's a good distance from home I guess, but I live in the midwest so it is ridiculously boring here. The location is basically my hometown just bigger. I didn't really do much of anything there this summer. I feel like it would be boring to live here and I would be miserable. I would like to move out of the midwest, but I go to a super crappy state school so I feel like no one would even glance at my resume. Also I'm dealing with a time constraint with my current offer and graduating in December is weird too, so getting interviews would be difficult even if some other company would notice me. I would really like to move to Denver or Chicago, maybe even Boston or DC or Cali, but feel like I don't have the skills or money or resources to do so and getting a job there would be very hard to achieve (which would be the first step on the list). So ultimately, I feel trapped.

TL;DR:

1. I've accomplished a lot but feel like a fake. I think this is pretty common among female programmers and I'm wondering if anyone here has insight on how to navigate being a woman in a field dominated by men.

2. I have a good job offer

3. The culture of the company didn't really fit with me, male coworkers made me feel bad about myself, miserable for duration of my internship

4. Dislike location of company and would like to leave the midwest

5. Have to accept or decline offer in 4 weeks so I feel trapped and like I have no other options.

I've had this plot kicking around for awhile and finally feel comfortable enough to share it with all of you. If you're interested, please PM me with your character idea, kinks, and limits. Any reply not containing all three will be ignored. Please be willing to write at least a paragraph per reply. Ages will be determined in PMs.

Tommy Daniels is one of the hottest young commodities in Hollywood. Despite being under 16, the actor has earned praise from A-list celebrity co-stars as being a talented professional, fun, and incredibly entertaining, Producers are lining up to cast him in movies, and Directors sing his praises. He had, by age 10, already starred in big-budget films as a main character, and doesn't seem to be stopping soon.

What no one except those around him knows is that the blond-haired and blue-eyed Tommy is a desperate, eager little bottom even in spite of his age. He goes out of his way to find at least one person to fuck him on each film he does - be they co-star or producer or director - and wins them over by indulging their darker sides: their kinks, their secret shames. He'll do anything to get the cock he's picked - and for his newest film, he's picked yours.

******

So are you a fellow young actor Tommy has set his sights on, or an older celebrity he's starring with? Perhaps you're the director or producer, or even the college intern who got stuck as Tommy's assistant. Anyone at all is welcome to be the object of the young star's attentions, and so long as you're willing to fuck him, he'll do anything you want to get your cock.

My only limits are Scat and Snuff, anything else is absolutely on the table, and kinks can be hammered out over PM. I hope to hear from you soon, APP!

Because of that, please forgive the 2nd person narrative below!  Here comes a wall-o-text!

---

Natalia Dubyenkov had arrived as the office intern in the beginning of the summer, making the expected splash amongst the younger office workers.  At 22, she could have easily been mistaken for one of the [new flock of Russian instagram models](http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/10076436/640full-galina-dubenenko.jpg) - long legs, tanned skin, and a delicate face, framing full lips, a dazzling smile, and warm brown eyes that you could sink into forever.  Thick, straight, brown hair cradled her face, just long enough to brush the tops of a bosom that still stood proud on her chest with the perkiness of youth.  Her clothing was always professional - though it flattered her young figure, it never strayed out of appropriate office wear.

Ms. Dubyenkov's attitude around the office was also very professional, and within the first few weeks there were the expected office crushes and broken hearts in the younger, aggressive male staff.  This didn't stop them from hovering around her cubicle every chance they got, joking with the young beauty and lavishing attention on the young 'Nat'.  More than once you made it a point to walk by her corner of the office and shoo the young men away - you understood their impulses, but they weren't being paid to flirt.

While you might have appreciated Nat's looks, you appreciated her apparent maturity more - you were long past the days of office dalliances, with a wife and young child at home, and had worked your way up the corporate ladder until you now sat in a corner office and oversaw much of what happened on your floor of the building.  It was a not-for-profit branch of a much larger parent company, sharing some resources, yet independent from the corporate masters in many other ways.  Unfortunately, one of these was the ready access to labor.  Everyone in your branch was stretched thin; hopefully Ms. Dubyenkov would prove a fruitful addition to the company.

In one respect, you were glad the Nat was so popular with the boys - doubtless they'd be willing to show her the office ropes.

---

Lunch hour, a few weeks later.  The hook:

""Would you mind helping me with something, sir?  I just need another pair of eyes for a second, and everyone else is gone.""  While most of the office was away at lunch, Nat had crossed your path in one of the hallways, waving a petite hand to get your attention.  At your silent assent, the young woman turned around.  Bending ever so slightly at the waist, she ran her hands down the back of her long legs, tracing the seams in her dark stockings that followed the tight curves of her thighs and calves.  Her voice was innocent of any ulterior motive as she explained, ""I snagged my stockings on something, and I'm not sure the seams are straight any more...""  She looked back at you over her shoulder, ""I know seamed stockings are a classic look, but its the first time I've worn them, and I'm not so sure about it.""  She turned back front, bending over ever so slightly more and hitched her pencil skirt up an inch or two past her knees.  Her next comment was delivered in an offhanded manner that carried the tiniest undercurrent of something more: ""How about you, sir?  Do you like my stockings?""

And suddenly, you **knew** you did.  For a moment the only things in your life were her stocking wrapped legs.  You imagined the fabric sliding over her smooth skin, from her 3"" heels, up past her knees, past the glimpse of thigh, and up under the shadowed hem of her skirt... In that moment, you gained a new touchstone in life.

As if unaware of the revelations bubbling up within you, Nat continued, ""I mean, I like how they grasp my legs... How they run up and down calves...  They're clothing, but they're also a little ... naked.  It just feels ... *nice*""  Even as her words tiptoed in one ear and out the other, your eyes followed her statements, wandering over the nylon-clad flesh as you felt the stirrings of a long forgotten response in your pants.  You wanted to run your hands up and down her calves; grasp her legs; feel her clothed and naked flesh.  Those *wants* - that **need** - felt ... nice.

Gulping down a sudden frog in your throat, you let Nat know that you *did* like her stockings - there was always something classy about a woman in nylons.  It was hard not to gush how much you liked them, but your professional mien managed to control your expression of appreciation. With shaking hands and a rapidly silenced inner protest, you reached out and put your hands on the back of one leg.  Your fingers wrapping gently around a thigh, your thumbs tenderly scooted a seam a fraction of a millimeter to align it with the rest.  What could have been a satisfied sound came from Nat, standing above you - though surely you must have imagined that half-heard sound somewhere between a moan and a deep-throated hum.  The feeling under your fingertips was heavenly - the smooth sensation of the nylons, with the girl's warm and tight-yet-yielding flesh underneath.  Although a saner portion of your mind was screaming at you about sexual harassment and what you'd do if anyone else in the office saw you fondling the intern, you backed up almost reluctantly, your fingertips lingering as long as excusable - longer even - on that smooth expanse of flesh.

And a moment later, the spell broke. Flushed and confused, you turned and rushed back to your office, wondering just what had come over you - what you had done.

Still, you found your eyes drawn to Nat's legs anytime they were visible.  More than once, you had to collect your thoughts while talking to her, distracted by a flash of leg as she crossed a leg or the pop of a knee as she shifted her weight.  More than once, you found yourself daydreaming of that moment that your hands wrapped around her nylon-clad thigh.  More than once, you found yourself fantasizing about a woman in seamed stockings, your hands running over her legs.

---

A few months later.  The line:

As time passed, you didn't have any more run-ins with the attractive intern; though you *might* have wandered by her cubicle slightly more often.  Ostensibly, you did so to chase away her young suitors; what you'd never admit, even to yourself, is that you hoped to get a tantalizing glimpse of Nat's legs.

Business in the office was picking up when the other shoe dropped.  It was a Friday afternoon, and piles of paperwork had risen on your desk with the company gala only a few weeks away - it was a major fundraiser for the non-profit portion of the business that you helped to run, and all the preparations seemed to have been left to the last minute.  Not only did the business of the gala need attending to, but you also needed a new tux - and you were sure that your wife was going to want a new gown as well.  Pulling the first folder off the top of the prioritized pile, you sighed, and got to work.  

It was only 30 minutes into the workday when Mrs. Gibson - an older ... *staid* woman ... came to you to complain.  ""Have you seen what young Natalia is wearing today?""  Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard, her complaints shrewish.  One could imagine her begrudging the young Natalia her youth and beauty.  ""I hardly think casual Fridays were meant to include an outfit like *that*,"" she finished, disdainfully inclining her head a fraction of a degree towards Nat's corner.

Craning your neck, you peaked across the office in the direction of the intern's cubicle, not having made your pilgrimage in that direction yet today.  Despite the fact that you had personally distributed guidelines as to appropriate office wear for casual Fridays, Nat's outfit was [decidedly not within the company's dress code](https://i.imgur.com/OQgH59P.jpg).  You were a little surprised - apart from the *incident*, she had seemed to convey herself as a consummate young professional.

The company's HR department was based in a distant building - and it wouldn't look good on your record to bring them in on such a small problem, anyway.  You were expected to manage your own people.  It looked like it was up to you to talk with Natalia about appropriate office wear.

It's not traditional hypnosis - nor traditional mind control.   Nat's trick is that when she asks if you like something ... you do.  Lastingly, and to the exclusion of all else.  And fixated more and more on Nat herself.  Perhaps with enough conditioning, she doesn't even have to ask you; it's enough that *she* likes it for you to connect the dots and start having the trained response.

Lots of the above is negotiable, if there's something that doesn't quite click.  To find out a little about me and my kinks/limits, please check out [my DPPprofile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/569un5/dppmezmer_its_all_in_your_head_or_mine/).  Fear not - as stated initially, the second person portion was just for the initial prompt; once we begin, we should each write **only** our own character's responses - there are ways of suggesting a response if you are a half-way decent writer, but it is a huge upset when I'm told by someone else what my character does.  This is especially important if you are interested in playing Nat.

I'd like to start the RP with her boss summoning her about her obvious dress code violation.  I enjoy a bit of a slow burn, so I *don't* want to jump straight to the hot &amp; steamy stuff, but figure that we can play with a little teasing and then jump to the company gala, where you, your wife, and all the big wigs have arrived, dressed to the nines...  I think it will be fun to observe some of her boss's downfall along the way. ;)

If that sounds interesting, drop me a PM!  Let me know a little about yourself (kinks, limits, etc), whether you'd like to play Natalia or her Boss, and anything else you'd like to discuss.  If you want to play the boss, let me know his name.  If you've gotten this far, write something in Russian in your post (google translate is your friend) so I know you've made the effort!

We text nearly every day and have hung out twice now. Problem is, I don't know if he likes me. We are both summer interns at the same tech company, but he goes to college across the country from me.

Out texting conversations range from playful banter to serious conversations about college and out futures. 

The reason I'm am so confused is because he looks me in the eyes all the time, and smiles as he passes my desk. But then some days he barely looks at me.

He is leaving in less than three weeks, and I kind of don't want him to leave without telling him how I feel. My mom says just tell him, but my dad and friends say if he likes you, he'll tell you.

So, dear reader, here is my question. Do I tell him or not? And if I tell him, how do I do it? Letter? In person? Over text? After he has left?

Any advice welcome!! I really need help for this one!!

Thank you!"

9:50-10:20 talking with my Key Holder and she sent me a few pictures and a short video, they had me rock hard and straining against the cage. Shortly after I went into the bathroom to check on the situation, and lucky I did so just then. There was a large wet spot seeping thru my boxers and had I left it alone it would have soaked into my pants. I addressed the issue by putting a bit of toilet paper into the end of the cage and put another layer over it and secured it with a rubber band.

12:00 finally got to stop and sit. As I was polishing that last entry I started to get horny again from thinking about what happened as well as imagining what could have. I was imagining the level of embarasment for having walk around with a large wet spot on my crotch.

12:11 was texting to my KH about how the day had been going and how the cage wouldn't allow me to forget it's presence, causing me to be even more aroused and how that was affecting me.

12:30 went on Reddit to check on my last post and ended up looking at a few gifs. This was not the smartest move, it only served to get me extremely worked up, twitching and pulsating in my cage. Just then I had to go a relieve that intern for her lunch. The entire area smelled like her perfume and as smells affect me heavily this only made my predicament worse. I was just praying that my solution to leaking would hold up. 

1:30 spoke to my KH again and we discussed how I keep looking at things that turn me on and she teased taking that liberty away from me. I explained that would be a double edged sword as it would stop me torturing myself when I can get no relief, but when I stopped myself it would remind me of her control over me and make me horny anyway. She agreed to allow me to continue my self torment.

1:45 she informed me of how she had played with herself several times while watching different things from a Tumblr that I sent to her and how much she enjoyed knowing that she can play and fun as much and whenever she wants while can do none of the above. This intensified my suffering as I imagined her doing exactly that right in front of me while I am retrained and helpless. She then made sure to remind me to bring toys when I get to see her. And she told me she needs to watch me suck her cock. In response i sent her a photo of my own cock straining against the cage.

I was soon busy again and lost track of time, and had to do a bit of physical work which caused me to get all sweaty and flustered. And due to the combination of what I was doing, the positions I needed to get into to complete the task and the weight of the cage it started to slip again.

3:30 I manage to get lost in thought and thoughtlessly started browsing Tumblr at my desk (which thankfully has a wall at my back)

5:00 I got home and spent some time watching videos and gifs, which got me so unbelievably horny, I started to leak excessively. So I sent her a series of Snapchats with pictures of my cock dripping and a short video of my licking my precum from my finger.

That was the last thing worth including as I spent the rest of my evening doing chores and taking care of boring household things. 

Until next time friends, I hope you enjoyed this installment. I am sure I willbe back tomorrow."

I am currently applying for graduate school with a degree in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) aka ESL and I'm hoping you can give me feedback on my statement of purpose. I'm about 100 words above my limit so if you have any thoughts on what to cut out that would be great! Thanks! Ok here it goes:

As a musician from a young age, I have had considerable experience transforming the notes on the page into an experience that often represented a culture, ethnicity, race, age or gender often different from my own and communicating it in a way that worked harmoniously with my fellow musicians. Through the “language of music” I was lucky enough to tell hundreds of other people’s stories. Now, I am dedicated to helping people develop their second language so that they can effectively and creatively express their own stories. I believe that this fluency in the ""language of music"" in addition to my academic and professional experiences have provided me with the skills necessary for earning a Master of Science in Education: TESOL at XX College.

In college, I participated in a faculty-mentored research project under the supervision of Dr. XX My research evaluated the specialized methods, techniques, and academic implications of two bilingual educational models used in American elementary schools. In comparing the two, I learned that the most prevalent bilingual program used today is actually the program that yields less than efficient results, both linguistically and academically. At the culmination of this project, I was invited to present my research at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research held at the University of XX. Presenting at a conference gave me a voice to educate others about the cognitive benefits of bilingualism and how young emergent bilinguals are being underserved in today’s current pedagogical landscape. Now, I am particularly interested in assuring an equitable education for bilingual children and advocating for cross-cultural awareness and culturally diverse points of view. 

With a foundation in bilingual pedagogy and a strong interest in other cultures, I decided to teach English as a Foreign Language in Japan and after this experience it has become clear that I would like to pursue a career in TESOL. Planning, preparing and delivering an average of six classes a day to a total of 95 students of all ages and levels while residing in a country where I didn’t speak the language presented a challenge, but ultimately I believe this experience has helped me to become an overall more culturally competent teacher because it challenged me to reflect upon my own communication practices and biases as an American and tailor them to the needs of those from another culture. I believe this experience makes me an excellent candidate for the program at XX College because I have not only developed and refined my presentation skills, classroom management, and time management, but I have also experienced the day to day life of an immigrant. I understand the necessity of clear language and directions, the incredible usefulness of gestures and the fact that one cognate can all be crucial for comprehension. While my time in Tokyo was absolutely invaluable, I am looking forward to expanding my understanding of pedagogical theory and ensuring a quality English education for students of all ethnicities and abilities within the framework of public schools during my Student Teaching Internship.

Steve Jobs once said, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards…Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart...” After reflecting upon my life experiences, I know that pursuing TESOL is the next step in my journey. I know that my passion for other cultures, research skills and relevant experience working as an English language instructor in Japan will prove unquestionably useful in pursuing my studies at the graduate level.

6raf92,5,2017-08-03,Is my adopted mom a narcissist?,sadbadman,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6raf92/is_my_adopted_mom_a_narcissist/,"When I left my biological N-parents, I started living with a woman and her husband who agreed to let me stay with them until I finished high school, and for the summers afterward during college.


However, her relationship with me is quite...strained. She doesn't like to be bothered (spoken to), but lapses in communication are grievous mistakes.

For instance, on saturdays I must vacuum the three bedrooms and clean the bathroom on my side of the house. Nbd. When I had free time last friday, I offered to do it that evening to make her happy. By the time I had finished vacuuming, we were eating dinner and then she wanted to watch a movie. I didn't finish the bathroom, and decided to do it the next day. Big mistake. 

I wake up to her loudly dragging the shower curtains, huffing and puffing as she loudly takes the trash from the bathroom. Note, she's being intentionally loud.

She assumed I was trying to leave her bathroom dirty. She wouldn't even look at me when I apologized for being *such* a poor communicator. She then took the opportunity to let me know how, as someone in charge of hiring and firing MANY people, I would be looked down upon by an employer.

Am I wrong for feeling like a normal person would ask why I hadn't cleaned it?

She frequently makes me feel like I'm less than her, quoting about her Ph.D from *obscure university*. 

When I didn't get a job quickly enough last summer, she reminded me that she wasn't lazy like me and worked two.

When I arrive for the summer with a job, well, why aren't I working an unpaid internship in our lovely town of the middle of nowhere? But even if I were hired, I'd be an poor employee anyway.

She says that I shouldn't be so lazy because I'm not like my adopted cousin, ""Who is pretty enough to get what she wants easily"". 

She also gets angry and ignores me if I ever mention how my birth N-father is trying to harass me at work. 

I feel like I'm walking on a minefield around her. Everything I do is grounds for her to say I'm a lazy, careless, millennial.

6rajig,10,2017-08-03,[Dataporn] 1 Month,SparklyMonster,eroticauthors,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticauthors/comments/6rajig/dataporn_1_month/,"Hello, folks! 
This is my 1st Reddit post ever (though I've been lurking in this sub for more than a year). I thought of waiting until I had more books before posting a Dataporn, but 1 month is 1 month. Maybe by making this public, I can shame myself into writing more, haha! I hope to show you a brighter (...sparklier!) side on future Dataporns!
Before I go to the numbers, please allow me to use this post also as an introduction. Please kindly bear with me, thanks!

**Background**

* Not a native English speaker (so I take this opportunity to apologize for any mistakes or awkward sentences);
* In high school (more than a decade ago! *cries*) I was very active with M/M fanfiction in my native language (at the time, I wasn't confident enough in my English skills to even try);
* Thanks to the above experience, at least I'm confident I can write long, very long works. Unfortunately, I stopped writing fiction once I started college and full time employment (in my country, you're expected to do both at the same time);
* On the bright side, my job requires me to write in English everyday, so I improved. I'm a fast typer but haven't tracked my hourly output yet. However, my writing is for communication with clients and suppliers only, and it's *not* with native English speakers. So, while my peers look up to me as the best English writer (and editor, for my colleagues' texts) in the company, I suppose my readers would disagree.

**The start**

* As I approached the 30's Crisis, I realized that, if I want any career change, I must do it before having children. As I've liked creating stories even before learning how to write, I started researching about it, found out about self-publishing being much more simple nowadays, and found this sub;
* I'm the kind of person who over-researches everything before doing it (INTJ much), so I spent over a year reading this sub daily. In hindsight, I spent around 1 year of research for each life decision I made;
* Now that I started, I plan to improve my output and my procrastination. Btw, this Dataporn is also for procrastination.

**The book**

* That's it. This month I published 1 short only. I'm not proud of it. I promise I'll do better next time;
* The book is a little over 5k words;
* I chose a niche that isn't very popular, but that I enjoy writing. I didn't go for the popular niches because they all inspired me to write longer works, and I'm not ready to start novels yet;
* The most popular works in my niche are within a subniche I dislike. It's very male oriented and have a clear 'male gaze'. I wrote the story I wanted to read. Based on an old post I found in this sub discussing this niche, at least it seems that my not-subniche is also ok-ish. My beta-readers mentioned that they dislike my niche, but the way I wrote it made it interesting to them;
* Btw, my beta-readers are also nonnative English speakers. Although both are fluent (one is even an English teacher!), I know this is not the optimal setup. I also used the Hemingway app and Grammarly;
* I made my own covers. Although I graduated in Design, I work mainly with Product, but I studied plenty of Graphic. Besides, if I ever make this a full-time job, I would like to have a side job making covers, just to freshen up from the keyboard; 
* I studied the style of the top selling works, but preferred to make my own illustration instead of using stock pictures (curiously, my also-bought shows that my readers also went for other erotica with illustrated covers). It takes me 1 free night to make it;
* Thanks to the papers requirements at University, fortunately I already knew all the formatting I needed in Word. Spent hours reading all the instructions at Amazon and Smashwords anyway;
* I like diversification, so I went wide. Once I publish a few more books, I plan to experiment a month publishing on KU;
* The book is live on Amazon, D2D (all stores that accepted erotica), and Smashwords (for all the stores not covered by D2D);
* My pricing is all over the place; it *is* $2.99 for most marketplaces, but I felt it was unfair for countries with undervalued currencies (I care because I live in one, lol). So I set the price manually to the lowest possible within 70% royalty and rounded them up so the numbers would still look pretty.

**The smutbucks**

* Amazon: 6 units sold, earned USD11,64
* Smashwords: 1 unit sold (on SW store), earned USD2.46
* D2D: *nada* (*cries in foreign language*)

Total: USD14.10

My country doesn't have a treaty with the US, so I'll lose 30% in taxes off the bat. The silver lining is that this amount will multiply once converted to my currency, so I can pay for a few meals with it (I was going to say I can pay my LP gas bill with it, but I don't know how popular it is in other countries for anything besides cooking).
Since I expected my 1st book to flop, actually I think it went really well. It makes me wonder how much better it can get once I improve my output.

**Lessons**

* A catchy title is not enough. The keyword being included in said title is also not enough. My niche has a slow turnover, so I was appalled to see my book on Page 2 on its very 1st day. Only later I found that if the intuitive search term is ""xxx"", titles with ""xxx"" will have priority over titles with ""xxxed"" (it's just an example, not the actual title / words). In my case, ""xxxed"" was the correct grammar within the title context. Once I typed ""xxxed"", my book was the top result. As of now, it's still on the top five results for ""xxxed"", while it's on page 5~10 for ""xxx"". Lesson learned;
* Although I read the majority of books in English (and I Google everything in English as well), I had a slow start as I fussed over formatting and everything else. For example, my beta-reader noticed that I used hidden/occult subjects, which would be great had I been writing in my native language. However, there are no hidden subjects in English (the horror!), so I cannot make short sentences without a subject (but with an implied, contextual subject). This forces repetitive use of pronouns and makes the prose wordier, which clashes with all the lessons about writing short and no-frills. I'm still coming to terms with it.

**Plans**

* To publish erotica only long enough to feel more confident and learn from my mistakes. When I wrote fanfics, the characters made out, but sex scenes were behind closed doors. Although I like writing some smut, writing a lot of it is a slog. Just let me go ahead with the plot already! Conclusion: I'm using this experience as a paid internship, but don't plan on optimizing my earnings in this genre (I mean I'll keep writing not as to-market as I could, and won't try more popular niches);
* Although I wasn't very productive with my erotica, in the meantime I completed the plots for a standalone novel and a trilogy of novels. I also have a list with a few dozens of ideas for other novels. So I really must do my best with erotica now: the sooner I accumulate xp, the sooner I can level up to novels!

**Everything else**

* Late disclaimer: I confess it's not exactly 1 month yet, but I don't expect to sell any more copies until I have another release. Besides, by posting it now, I can add it to the list of activities I do every turn of month (watering the cacti, reviewing my expenses, etc.);
* Now that I finished writing this dataporn, it seems my current output is at 600 words/hour.

Thank you for your time! A bigger thank you for all the amazing information you put in this sub, it's hands-off the most valuable community out there!

6rb99l,142,2017-08-03,[support] Friend flipped out at me after she found out how much I make -- what should I do?,narcisse1013,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6rb99l/support_friend_flipped_out_at_me_after_she_found/,"I was having dinner with a friend who I've known since high school, when she mentioned she had a crush on a guy who made X amount of dollars a year. I didn't know what she meant by bringing up his income, so I was like, ""Is that a lot?"" She instantly bristled. She was like, ""YES, that is a lot of money, and the fact that you asked means that you make more.""

I do make more, but I also don't ever talk about money with my friends, so I tried to make a joke out of it and was like, ""Haha, I'm not gonna say, no comment, let's move on."" But then she grew actually genuinely angry at me. She started saying how she worked SO HARD and had more schooling than me, and how come she makes so much less than me, and how privileged and out of touch I was that I was joking around and didn't think X was a big amount of money. She criticized me for not recognizing my privilege, for being in the 1% (I'm definitely not), why am I talking about money (she brought it up), etc. She had lent me $5 because I didn't have cash on me the other day, and I paid her back today -- and she looked at the $5 on the table and was like, ""If I knew you were rich, I wouldn't have lent you money.""

I was stunned. At first I tried to explain myself, like I'm NOT RICH, my career (entertainment) has ups and downs so some years I make more, and some years none, and that I'm currently making no money right now. I repeatedly stressed I wasn't rich. I asked her to apologize to me, and she was like, NO YOU SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE IT SO MUCH HARDER THAN YOU.

Eventually she did say sorry and left, but I'm very upset right now. I'm thinking about the situation and realizing how fucked up it is. EVEN IF I am objectively ""rich"" (for now), this was a long, long time coming. I toiled for years in the entertainment industry, penniless as an unpaid intern, getting coffee and dry cleaning for my bosses as an assistant, all the while working on my craft on the side before FINALLY ""making it"" and having ONE lucrative year. By the way, I live frugally (studio apartment, secondhand clothing, normal car), which was why I think she was shocked when she realized I was ""rich.""

Also, the saddest thing is that her first instinct upon finding out that I made more than X amount of dollars was indignant anger, and not being happy for me. 

And BY THE WAY -- this girl is NOT POOR. She is a lawyer who just went to Hawaii for vacation, and she has like 10 Longchamp bags.

I don't know what to do right now. The RBN side of me, the part that tries always to avoid conflict, is saying how I should be understanding at her unhappy situation because she clearly hates her job, etc. But I honestly don't feel like that's the way to go. How do I stand up for myself? Should I cut off the friendship? Write her a letter explaining how I feel? What are some of your thoughts?

EDIT EDIT EDIT - - - - - - - - - -

Thank you guys so much for your advice and insight and discussion into all things money. Loved hearing your stories as well. I think what I'm going to do is go very low contact for now. I'm not going to contact her. But if she reaches out to me in the future, we can keep a low-key acquaintance thing. If things flare up again, I may have to NC.

One of the challenges with this friendship is that I think after being raised by Nparents, I had a hard, hard time forming healthy friendships. Big surprise, ha. There was a lot of things my friend did before this that I found I let her get away with. I feel like I made a lot of excuses for her and also thought about our past good times and used that to justify the shit she pulled. With this reddit and with the help of a therapist, I'm starting to recognize where boundaries are crossed and how to stand up for myself."

We work with a lot of hotel brand sites, so we are doing SEO on specific sets of pages on a larger domain.

We do build and maintain several standalone sites as well which are much easier to perform full SEO on.

* Audit pages
* Make changes to pages as needed
* Report on the effects of the changes of the pages.
* Update OTA sites as needed (booking.com)
* Keyword research for new landing pages
* Creating new landing pages (working with writers as needed)

The ideal candidate will be a strong writer, have superior skills in Excel, a solid understanding of Google Analytics, some HTML/CSS experience (is PHP experience too much to ask for as well?).

While I would love to have someone who can swoop in and hit the ground running, I will train as necessary. 

We are an evolving company and are expecting rapid growth over the next 6 months which means ramping up quickly and a lot of opportunity to learn.

6rcuo2,2,2017-08-03,Information Technology Senior Requesting Certification Help,Envyforme,netsecstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/6rcuo2/information_technology_senior_requesting/,"Hello there everyone.

I am finishing my last year of my undergraduate at my local university. This will be information technology.

My degree allows for a specialized track. In this case, I plan on doing Cyber Security as I'd like to be a penetration tester down the road. I am taking a senior level networking course this fall, followed by a Cyber Security course in the spring.

As for the last part of my concentration, I can do a case study, internship, or get a certification. I already have used the Internship slot for my core, so that is out of the question. I don't really feel like doing a case study, so I believe the Certification here would be the best choice. 

So, I started researching certifications. The CISSP seems to be the industry standard, however, the 5 years experience really what hits me here. The Security+ seems to be entry-level, and I feel this certification is not the one I want to get to lead a job towards. 

Then, I saw the CEH. The certified ethical hacker seems to be a really good choice. After looking around, I see that you are required to have 2 years of experience previously. I recently did an internship that involved deployment services and network administration. I also have worked on campus for over a year doing network administration as well. After this spring comes around, I think I will have had the 2 years of experience to start looking at this certification. 

Now, do you think with the experience I do have, will I have enough experience to start looking at the CEH? Or do you recommend going for another certification in the field? 

Any other advice will be appreciated as well."
6rd1su,1,2017-08-03,Need advice on a situation regarding my summer preceptor.,MsBerg,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/6rd1su/need_advice_on_a_situation_regarding_my_summer/,"**Background:** I am already enrolled as an undergraduate in a Coordinated Program in Dietetics and I am going into my final year starting next week. I wanted to gain some more experience in a nutrition related job this summer, but I couldn’t find any paid positions. I ended up taking an unpaid internship at a private practice counseling office, which I was delighted about since that’s the direction I’d love to go in someday. I will not get credit for this internship, but I hope it looks good on my resume.

My preceptor has been an RD for 10 years and has already been wildly successful building her business. In addition to running her own private practice, she is also the co-owner of a juice bar, runs her own nutrition and wellness retreats, and is hired frequently to teach classes and give presentations. I was really excited to be able to intern for her and jumped in head first, doing whatever she needed me to do. 

The first week, I could already tell I may have gotten myself into a bit of a situation, but I had nothing else planned for the summer and decided to stick it out. She was hosting one of her wellness retreats at the end of my first week, but had spread herself too thin and decided I was going to be in charge of cooking most of the food she needed for the retreat. I gave it my all and got it done, but it was stressful and not exactly what I had signed up for. I then had to deliver all of this food to her house, which is over an hour away from where I live. 

This seemed to be the theme of the summer and this “internship.” One day, she told me we were going to make ice cream at her house and write a blog post about it. I drove almost all the way there before she texted me and told me she was cancelling because “traffic was bad.”

While I did get a lot of great experience that I will carry with me, I also felt taken advantage of quite often. The juice bar that she co-owned was scheduled to be at six farmers’ markets throughout week, however, they didn’t actually have the staff to be at all of them. Every Tuesday, without fail, I was asked to set up and sell juice at the farmers’ market without pay. I was also often asked to run errands for her that were 45 minutes to an hour away from where I lived. Occasionally, I would say no, but I would also like to be able to use her as a reference some day and I wanted to make a good impression.

**My situation now:** I started in May and told her that I would be available until the end of July. She knows that I am starting my dietetic internship soon, but keeps texting me asking if I can do various tasks for her. On my “last day,” I could tell that she didn’t want me to leave. She gave me a bunch of complements and was making suggestions about how I could work for her/with her in the future.

Yesterday, I received a text message from her asking if I would be interested in giving a presentation on dementia to a group of physicians and their patients on September 10. She told me the PowerPoint presentation would be provided and that I would be paid. I told her that I did not feel comfortable adding on the additional task while doing my dietetic internship, however, I was extremely flattered that she would ask me and I was thankful for the opportunity. She never responded back. I later realized she asked me to do this because she, again, overbooked herself and I was her way out.

**My question:** Should I have just sucked it up and done the presentation for the experience? I am not sure I felt totally qualified to do the presentation and I know it would have been incredibly stressful for me when I am already going to be stressed enough just from my DI. What would you have done in my situation?

**TL;DR** I am starting my DI next week, but my preceptor from my (unpaid, uncredited) summer internship keeps asking me to help her out. She asked me if I’d give a presentation on dementia to a group of physicians and their patients. I said no because I did not want the additional stress while doing my DI, however, I am not sure if that was the right choice. "

I currently have an associates in applied science with my major being computer programming. I did a lot of programming before I went to school and got pushed just to get the degree so I would have some education on my resume.

During my degree I got an internship as a junior software developer for three months, and they decided to keep the other guy (he was more social and friendly with the boss and they couldn't keep me busy enough).

Now I'm currently making $12 an hour at bestbuy as a CSS (customer service) part time, working at least 25 hours a week (Next up coming paycheck is about 61~ hours worth of work)

and I also have a full time job with medical benefits (health and dental) and I make $10 there in a small data entry department for a marketing company.

Currently I'm living with my grandmother and hope to move out by the end of the year, saving as much money as I can (I pay my grandmother $300 after two weeks for supporting me and paying off the money she had loaned me to get my car, etc).

My currently schedule usually looks like

MONDAY-FRIDAY (Full time Job) 9-5 (I get 40 hours here, maybe 20-30 minutes of overtime) and pay checks after taxes/insurance deductions looks around $580.

MONDAY/FRIDAY and Weekends (random hours) - I usually get at least 25 hours here, as mentioned above I pick up any shifts available so currently I'm closing every day after I leave from my full time reaching 60 hours for my next pay check.


Does anyone have any advice for me? Apartments in my area are usually $700 for a 1BR. I'm currently claiming 0 dependencies on my taxes (which I know isn't the best way to do things) but at least I'll have a decent tax return.

I'm still looking for a better full time job but it's hard to find one when you work 24/7, also most of the jobs in my area are fast food or retail because it's a small retired town.



EDIT: I have about $2,000 saved up and I'm 22.

We both are very busy with our schedules and do not have much time, being in the industry, I am a game artist currently on internship while she does motion graphics. For a long time now, we put the differences in our relationship aside,(she's Christian and I'm a free thinker with no plans to convert anytime soon). 


With all the time spent apart and her family's disapproval of her dating me, it finally fell apart today, as she wished that she had a boyfriend who shared her beliefs as well. Why did it have to be me? Or her? Is religion really such a big thing, to the point where people of separate beliefs could not coexist just because of family influences? 


Even more heartbreakingly, she still loves me and really wants to be with me, but she could not see a future with me together. No matter how bad it was, I really believed in us, and even now as I'm typing this, I still do, even however slim that little hope was. I loved her so so much and I believe that she did too. We've been through so much together, sbd all the little moments we shared once is now crashing through me.


This is my first ever relationship, and one that I took very seriously. It feels so terrible as I lay here, crying to the point where tears won't flow anymore. I'm still worried for her and wished that I could be by her side. Even though the relationship did not end on a bad note, I'm sorry that I can't really see her as a friend that I could hang out with as of right now. It simply hurts too much..."

6rfx51,5,2017-08-03,"Don’t work for Interior Whitewater Expeditions rafting in Clearwater, BC",ClayJ336,britishcolumbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/6rfx51/dont_work_for_interior_whitewater_expeditions/,"I worked at Interior Whitewater Expeditions for a couple summers a few years ago. I was young, naïve, fairly new to the raft guide industry, and on my own for the first time. If you are coming from outside BC or outside Canada and looking for raft guiding jobs I want to warn you about the owner. He’s charming and manipulative and his business is run more like a cult than a company. Again, I was young and fairly new to the rafting industry and this place offered a sense of belonging and “family” that quite frankly I was vulnerable too. I’ve never been good at much else besides boating and guiding. This “family” was all fine and good until you did something the owner didn’t approve of or you dared think of this as a job rather than a calling that you must sacrifice all your other needs or desires for. I worked there a few years back. Last time I visited and lived in town for a bit was 2016 and nothing’s changed.

1. Way too many staff so none of us make a decent wage. He doesn’t have to pay you if you aren’t on shift. Instead of telling maybe two raft-fulls of people per year that he’s booked and they’ll have to use the other companies he’ll let you earn next to nothing all summer so he can make a few hundred bucks extra on the rare busiest days. You won’t notice this until you look back because he goes on about how he gives everyone equal amounts of shifts. So even though he’s selfishly screwing everyone by over-staffing you’ll think he’s a wonderful leader because he’s distracting you from realizing that as he reminds you how equitable he is amongst the staff.

2. You are not allowed to say no to shifts. If you have left Clearwater and he wants you to work, you are to return. If you have plans to pick your friend up from the hospital or airport, but IWE needs you, then you are not allowed to take the afternoon off work (both these happened to me). This stuff puts a huge strain on your relationships and friendships. If you want a nice way to make your girlfriend feel like she’s not important, couldn’t be less of a priority and doesn’t matter; you should have her sit at a hospital for hours while you guide a raft even though she asked you to pick her up 2 weeks in advance and you told your boss this.  I’m sure I’ll get criticized for that, but I was young and a people pleaser and couldn’t stand up for myself. Also, the other guy’s girlfriends put up with straight out abuse and second-class citizen treatment so I rationalized that I wasn’t being that bad comparatively and treating my partner badly kinds started seeming normal. Doesn’t make it right. At all. I was wrong and I’m ashamed of who I became. But you know what? A near 60 year old man shouldn’t be taking advantage of someone’s lack of assertiveness. That’s not what good leaders do.

3. You are not allowed to have friends that work doesn’t approve of. If you do, you’ll be convinced they are using you or hurting you or are acting against you in some way. To MANY of us, the owner **implied** that people we know had done something bad to us and we retaliated or cut friends off or really burnt those relationships to the ground. We talked to each other about this wayyyyyy after the fact. You especially are not allowed to have a girlfriend who has any personality, dreams or mind of her own. If you have a girlfriend that wants to clean the office, answer the phone or serve clients coffee while having no needs/life goals of her own you’re great. You are allowed to have a girlfriend who quietly and obediently follows you around and doesn’t interfere with your job or the owner’s income. If she, perhaps, doesn’t want to live in Clearwater or any town of only 2000 people or is an engineer and might want to live somewhere where she can also have a real career you are to put her in her place. If not, it’s implied you are a pussy who’s letting a woman control you. She can either deal with the fact she’ll barely see you for 6 months or you can cut her out. I actually LIKED spending time with her. She made me laugh and we had such fun together. You can’t be a real partner or have any arrangement with IWE that would allow you to be an equal partner (ie only working July &amp; August since there basically isn’t any work outside those months and living in Vancouver where her internship is for spring &amp; fall.) Again, the other guys are doing this so you’ll think that’s normal and you’ll be convinced you are a pussy so you will willingly treat your girlfriend like she doesn’t matter and you are putting *yourself* and *your career* first without realizing that what the owner is really getting you to do is put *his company* and *his money* first. He has trouble finding staff that want to work in Clearwater and I think he was afraid I would move to a company closer to Vancouver. I didn’t see this until I worked for different rafting companies that were healthy and respectful of employees and acted like an employer not a river god and us his disciples.

4. No boundaries. The owner approves or disapproves of who you associated with based on who he sees as a threat to his status quo.

5. I was asked to cover up crime for the good of the team. In 2016 alone I saw 5 overdoses. I can’t even count the number over the many years in Clearwater. For sure over 20. But when asked about it by authorities I wasn’t to say anything so that the guys wouldn’t get in trouble. Lies of omission are still lies. I’ve since told the police, but in all seriousness someone could have died. Especially with that fentanyl problem ffs.

6. I developed a drug problem while I was here. I did drugs for the normal reason everyone does drugs. Acceptance. There’s a huge drinking/drug culture there so if you don’t have friends and family close by you’ll be alone a lot if you don’t partake.

7. The women. I think this is the thing I’m most ashamed about. I didn’t feel the impact of it until I watched 13 Reasons Why. I never perused the women myself but I did sit around with all the guys multiple summers and make degrading comments about their bodies or talk about any female raft client like she was potential a**. It was very predatory and not everything there was consensual. By that I mean, often they’d go after teenage girls (most clients are families so kids and parents) or they’d describe nights by saying “I was f*cking her so hard and good she kept telling me to stop. That’s cuz she needed to tap out it was that good”. Think about that for a second. He’s doing something sexually and she’s telling him to stop. That’s rape. No woman is like ‘wow I’m enjoying this so much I need a rest’. That’s not how sex works. He sat there and described a rape to us and we all laughed and high fived him. There were MANY instances like this and I literally threw up watching 13 Reasons Why. Don’t think I slept for a month after watching that. I’ve told the police since then, of course, but I just wish I had never worked here. Let’s be real, this garbage happens in all rafting companies (and even in the white house) but it was exponentially worse here out of all the places I’ve worked. The owner absolutely knows about this and is often around for these conversations. As long as he’s making money off those guides he doesn’t care what they do. He makes physical safety practically a religion on the river but after the trip is done the guides can harm the women clients in any way they like.

8. Staff would straight up bully each other and the owner wouldn’t care as long as it was done by his favorites. Those being the ones that would do weed with him every night and treat him like a hero so he can feel like he’s re-living his athletic glory days.

This place is more of a cult than a job. In a job there is boundaries between you and your employer and his authority doesn’t extend to your social life and moral choices. Also a good employer wouldn’t want you to make a living wage even if that means he takes home all of $1000 less per summer. Do we not criticize wal-mart and other business owners for that very thing?? Consumerism, bro. A healthy leader (as opposed to a toxic one) doesn’t act like you’re a family and we are all called to the Clearwater river by Jesus himself so we must prioritize and celebrate it above anything. Physical safety is treated like a religion here, but your emotional safety and personal boundaries are violated a lot. In all honestly your physical safety is at risk too because if you are injured and really should be resting you are to take painkillers and get back to it.  

Just remember a job is a job. Nothing is worth giving up your whole life for. Your physical health, mental health, relationships, friendships and sense of self-worth are just as much part of your life as your career. 

I am well aware that I am responsible for the choices I made, but so is the staff and owner of IWE. I just wanted to warn anyone who’s looking around at work visas in Canada or who is done school and thinking of working the BC rafting industry. I didn’t realize how toxic it was here until this experience was over and I worked for men or couples who did treat me like I was in a **HEALTHY** work family and honestly cared about the well-being of the staff. Before that, this was my favorite job and I would have taken a bullet for this company because of the sabertooth rapid and because I’d buy into the owner’s philosophy of being “river people”. I was also dependent on him for employment. As a young man starting out in life I badly craved belonging to a group. He’s a charming but very controlling and demanding man. My advice is apply elsewhere. Now that I’ve had good employers I see that this was my worst job and I was dreadfully unhappy but didn’t feel like I could talk about it with coworkers until we stopped working there. I hope this helps someone. Search elsewhere. Don’t work here, bro."

I have never lived in a new city and I am now moving over 1,000 miles away, so pray that God will comfort me in my move and build my reliance on Him through this move. 

Also pray that my finances begin to work out. I have an unpaid intern position and have been raising support. In my last week in town I am still only about halfway through my fundraising goal. I still am having a hard time calling people on the phone and asking them for their money, it fills me with fear and dread to do it.

6rg92r,1,2017-08-03,Hiring freeze 2 weeks before graduation... any advice?,DocRocks0,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6rg92r/hiring_freeze_2_weeks_before_graduation_any_advice/,"Hey everyone,

This is my first time posting here, and I'm not looking for or expecting any in-depth answers; just hoping for some guidance or tips people could give me to help me figure out what my game plan should be.

**Context**

Basically, I worked at X company for an internship and two co-op periods throughout my time in college. I had great performance reviews and both my boss and co-workers were very enthusiastic about the prospect of hiring me as a full-time employee once I graduated - several have directly spoken with HR and highly recommended me for recruitment at a semi-high level starting position in the company. 

When I left for my last semester, my boss guaranteed me at least the position I had while working on co-op, even if for some reason the position I was aiming for / recommended for wasn't open / hadn't yet opened. He said as soon as it did I would be the first person he'd call.

I just got a call from him this morning, less than two weeks before graduation, and he told me that regional management put a hiring freeze on the branch I work at, and that it may take as long as six months before I could work there at all. He was emphatically sorry, and said that he'd call me as soon as he was able to offer the job.

The thing is, I have only about $400 in my bank account, and (at best) a $1000 security deposit return at the end of next month from moving out of my apartment. Unless I get work soon, my funds will run out. I can live with my parents and do yard/housework instead of paying rent (a MASSIVE help) but I'll have to start paying back student loans soon (about $37,000 total iirc) and the last thing I want to do is burden my parents or other relatives if I don't have the means to afford the monthly payments.

---

What I was hoping to get advice on is the following:

* Should I try to get a quick part time job right away and wait for the company to get back to me? As much as I respect my boss I can't really rely on being guaranteed a job in 6 months - they said the same thing about getting a job after graduating.

* Should I try to live off the ~$1400 (I could stretch that for months if I don't have to pay rent) and exclusively apply to full time positions in my field?

* Should I do something else? 

I sincerely welcome any advice anyone is willing to offer. Thank you in advance!

I just started my first adult job at a media specialization company as an intern. I thought I would be helping create content for big name companies but for right now, I'm just the coffee errand boy who puts together meeting agendas and refills the water cooler.

I'm 5'9 with a slim athletic physique, dirty blonde hair with blue eyes. My girlfriend is 5'3, black hair, brown eyes with a petite and cute figure. We've been together since college and moved in together in the city after we both got jobs here. It hasn't been easy, to put it simply. We have been arguing and fighting a lot recently and our love life has become a bit dull.

http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mams4uMRWD1qf7cdjo1_1280.jpg

Our usual day consists of waking up in our small apartment, getting ready for work, watching Netflix or movies together, and then going to bed. I wish our lives were more exciting than this. I feel like we are starting to become a couple that doesn't do exciting or new things.

One day, I hear someone moving in across the hall into apartment 4E which has been empty for a couple of months. Later that night, I woke up suddenly to loud music and girls yelling and screaming. It was only Tuesday. After my girlfriend and I woke up several times throughout the night, she asks me angrily to tell whoever it is making that noise to keep it down. I angrily walk into the hall and bang on the door. Someone opens the door after a few seconds, the music gets louder, and my jaw almost hits the floor. A woman with bright highlighted blonde hair, smokey blue eyes surrounded by heavy eyeliner, thick juicy red lips, spray tanned dark skin, and humongous fake breasts barely held back by your bra and tank top. ""What's up?"" she says in a bored and playful way, blowing a large bubble with her bright pink gum. Her less attractive girlfriends still behind her giggle and then resume dancing and drinking. I pause for a moment, still in awe of your unbelievable figure.

https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/15043501_1077607605689537_1830411655922581504_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyMDYxNDA2MzYyOTIyNDIwOA%3D%3D.2.c

""Uh, it's three in the morning."" I say while trying to be serious and convey my point. ""Can you girls.. try to keep it down?"" I say while still eyeing you from head to toe. ""Sure thing, sexy. But next time you should come by and have fun with us."" You say playfully again. I reluctantly break eye contact and walk back to my room. I lay down next to my girlfriend and she asks tiredly, ""Who was that?"" ""Just some girls?"" I lie. The truth is, you're not just some girl. You're the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on, and the new sex symbol that just moved in across the hall.

The next few weeks turn out to be pretty difficult. I can't stop thinking about your body, flirtatious personality and my boring love life. Every time I see you in the hallway or elevator you throw me a wink or stretch showing off your body wrapped in your tiny inappropriate clothes. I start to think less and less about my girlfriend and think more and more about you. These days I seem to find any excuse to stop by your apartment or catch a glimpse of you as you head out with your girlfriends to have fun in the city. I just can't stop thinking about you..

Hey there and thanks for reading. The kinks I want to explore in this prompt are cheating, betrayal, hesitation, bimbofication, public sex, caught cheating, and corruption.

If you want to roleplay, I would like to discuss the character you will be playing a bit. Would you her to be a stripper, exotic dancer, or even a street walking whore? Do you take joy in helping break my girlfriends heart? Will you stop at nothing until I'm your play thing and I do everything you ask?

Let me know if you add anything or have any other ideas for the prompt. Looking forward to hearing from you :)"
6rh8u6,3,2017-08-03,Life is painful. So fucking painful.,BatofGotham666,Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/6rh8u6/life_is_painful_so_fucking_painful/,"I'm 25 and I hate my life. I cant do anything and cant close any thread.

I was born into a minority family due to which I got into good schools. (I am generally smart/capable but somehow, the precedent have been set by factors not under my control rather than me learning to/doing things.)

My parents took one of the largest leaps in economic self improvement conditions by being born/ growing in an utterly rural/backwards village to jumping to one of the largest cities in the world, and us going to a very modern set of schools with the homegrown natural folks. At the same time, either due to lack of their awareness and or encouragement or my/our own lack of desire, we never got into hobbies or passions or anything like that and simply never fit in. At least my brothers had friends as kids. I didn't even then. I never learnt the self discipline mindset or how to get good any ANYTHING. I cant fucking whistle properly for nuts!

To compound that, we grew up with very modern upbringing/thoughts/ideas, etc. For eg., I used to watch Friends on TV when I was something like 10-11 years of age. So, being cool, getting laid/into relationships, having fun/talking shit without having to do much was naturally ingrained in me.

Combine that with going to a top engineering school where I ended being stoned 24x7 hanging out with friends who were into music clubs, and had crazy football/guitar skills. I was brutally made fun of, not once or twice, but continuously for 4 years. I never learnt to play an instrument or a sport. Didn't focus on engineering as my friends were not doing shit either, so I didn't have to too. I didn't even learn to roll a fucking joint! It was 4 years of chilling with them and laughing and just being part of the group without ever doing really anything- laughing when the joke was about something else, weeping when it was about me.

Compound that, being decently smart, and from reservation, and I spent several months learning mnemonics and turning that into a mind palace (like on Sherlock), I got admitted into one the most exclusive Business Schools on the planet. All my friends went on overdrive and got into jobs etc and started to work hard and learn shit.

Me, I overcompensated my lack of having had ANY social validation, but pressuring this small town, poor girl into sleeping with me and breaking her personality (because in her culture virginity, etc mattered a lot). 2 years in B school I spent mostly getting her to heal and or getting her help to heal myself. Neither of which happened. People told me that I had a cool attitude and vibe and I should involve myself with others so they get to know me, etc. While I had a layer of ego, an outer shell, a projected self confidence to talk and make random/smart ass comment about stuff, it was all protecting a weak isolated highly vulnerable/highly susceptible to pain, insecure self. I dont know if I can do anything. Let's see:

When I run on the field, people made fun of me cuz apparently, my legs flailed about. When I spoke, my mouth moved in one direction. At home, I was the guy who's nose was ALWAYS running. When I wrote, my handwriting was horrible/illegible. When I sung, every one told me to stop. When I was narrating a story, I would lose interest in the middle because I realize mid way that my story was actually lame and to actually hold attention, I would have to exxagerate in which case, I would seem fake or otherwise, people would be like wtf is he talking about. I was cool once, that's because I stole my brother's ideas of tattoo drawing and poetry writing and sold it as my own. I got good grades in my finals because I took my brother's essay and wrote it as though it were mine. I got into B school because I took my brother's memory technique and turned that into a I'm going to change the world kind of pitch.

In my B school, placement season, i got a random rush of morality and did not even prepare. That's right. A random small town fuck who's been given the greatest set of opportunity in our economics to cherry pick from, thought that the system of judging people over a 20 minute conversation was too fake for me to bother. Instead, I slept on bed all day reading articles about Google's fancy internet projects. On placement day, I had 15 interviews including HIGHLY respectable companies and I would've made myself, my old friends &amp; everyone proud and redeemed myself and had a stable career path if I was in any of them. With preparation, I would've cracked most of them, without preparation I cracked none of them. Given I had no other friend apart my one girl friend whose life I had broken, I didn't have anyone to encourage me, talk me out of it, etc. I went off campus and got into a random company where I spent a year falling prey to the politics machine and getting spat out of the system. I spent another year with a friend not being able to start a small company. That girl is getting married to her boss, whose old friend has built this promising startup where he sold me as someone whose gonna turn things around (given I have large brands on my resume).

I joined this startup 2.5 months ago and I have not been able to contribute in any way. I thought let me first complete my first project before turning on my MBA soft skills where I would help in strategy, marketing, management, etc. But I have not been able to make any progress in any direction and every one is dissappointed with me to say the least. This progress lacking is due to several reasons:

1. Demoralizing: I have never had friends, at least in any healthy manner. It was either me being a bitch to a higher alpha male, or desperately holding on for basic validation. Due to this, I'm not sure how having friends feels like. Being isolated has turned me into having one on one relationships alone. I have OWN any conversation with MOST people ONE ON ONE. But I feel insecure almost exposed in groups. Due to this, I barely ever make any appearances/talk with multiple guys around. This sucks to a degree that even people who are SUPER FUCKING IMPRESSED with me one on one lose confidence because I dont have a public image. So, I'm the kind of leper no body wants to be seen talking too much with. And those who are seem weird, or at least pass on some form of social anxiety. I was brought in as a senior guy who'se seem how the best of the best companies work but am unable to find people to talk to/ have lunch with/ go out on breaks with, etc..

2. BASIC INEPTITUDE: I dont know whether it's I never learnt how to take responsibility, how to learn things, how to perform when the pressure is on, but even though I have good thoughts, I dont have the ability to connect the dots and close the thread. Over the past year, I got into pick up ( a lifestyle movement where you go out and talk to strangers to meet women &amp; improve yourself ). I have not found success yet but my normal level of confidence is of someone who should have by now. Last week, I met a girl who instantly connected with me on life and stuff. We end up talking for hours and hours and my friend set me up to take her home but once we became alone, I settled into the mindset of being totally a social dead weight. She had to say the funny stuff and the same time decide where to go or what to do next. She invited me home but I was like stuck in my head and shit and didn't say anything. Needless to say she gave me a pity kiss and once again reassured me that nobody wanted my genes or my contributions of any kind. Similarly, I never became good at anything- football, guitar, writing, whatever. At 25, life is so fast paced and all my college friends are doing so good that I am not sure if I have the patience to stick with things from basic stage. At work, I'm unable to follow through on my ideas. Sometimes, I feel I can automate the fuck out of things but I dont know programming. So I just sit on my ass, doing this and then little of this. End up doing one small thing over the course of the whole day and leaving/post-poning my main responsibility. In the moment, I feel like, let this go, it's not so important (sitting in the back bench and smoking weed impulse) and when the client asks hey where's the report, I rush to get it done (last minute smoke and mirrors or tricks to get the job done impulse). When I'm asked to lead, I dont know how that feels like because all the feedback and validation I've received has always been negative. When asked to follow, I lose my shit because I think it's all an insult to me and quite frankly I have good ideas (even though I cant make anything work for the life of me). So, it's safe to say I am not comfortable with anything because I have never received any validation and the expectations are crushingly high.

3. DEPENDANCE: To pay for my B school, I took out a large student loan. My father has terminally cancer and has high bills and isn't able to work. I dont want to live in the same city with them because I'm not strong yet and if I go back, I'll be a burden than anything. My brother is still studying and my brother is has business debt. Mom is life long homemaker with self confidence issues. Due to my lack of self confidence, lack of a real friends circle and network and lack of any solid skill, I dont have job options. Well I probably do or did but I can never convert. Let me give you an example: I was asked to travel to a company's headquarters for the final interview round. From the airport it was an hour drive. Instead I thought I would spend the hour preparing and for some reason I would instantly teleport into their office, by passing all the traffic. After a rushed breakfast/ last minute revision session, I reached their office 3 hours late. The CEO had gone and VP of product gave me a chance but it was the chance to get honest (because he read me and said I was disturbed by deeper issues), but I felt so odd because I prepared so much but what really was asked was my personal life story. In the end, I didn't get anything because I was asked about a time when I braved all the negativity and became good at something. I had nothing to show for it. So, yes, I am dependent on my job for dear life. Because of this, I somehow spend 24x7 on it and still not able to make progress. I dont know how, simply feel like time is just going. So, I feel I am here, because I desperately need a job/stability. But I was recruited with the mindset that this is what he wants to do, by choice &amp; passion.

So, anyways, I dont know what i need to do and am unable to follow through on my own thoughts and ideas. I wanted to live in a temple for as long as I needed, like (dare I say) steve jobs, but my father scolded me on it saying that I should be ashamed of my decision, after having gone to a conversation-breaking Business school. I'm currently, taking adhd meds (just been a few days) and looking for a flat to live with pick up artists (not so much about picking up girls but for the positivity and energy this lifestyle provides and I dont have confidence level to reconnect with friends who are all doing VERY well for themselves) and am hiring three guys my age from rural backgrounds to be my personal assitants because, I have dont have the moral fibre to figure out a dinner plan and end up sleeping on the floor of my room without dinner or water because I'm reluctant to spend too much, yet have fights with all the shopkeepers etc who snide me for looking like a bright educated guy but haggle over ever single ruppee. 

So, I'm living a dangerous set of patterns and unable to change or make real the change i see. Whatever i see/do, shit comes up. Like seriously, I'm so clumsy that when I get up from my chair, I trip on a laptop wire or when I'm disposing my lunch left overs, I drop the chicken etc on the floor and end up picking it up by hand and dirtying the floor etc. I'm the guy who steps in shit whichever road I turn to. Every professor ever I have had at all levels have had reasons to not like me. I was literally called the shit magnet, because I was in trouble with EVERY SINGLE professor. I got a reputation for being the ""bad boy"" which is all the cool I had and all the cool I got. But the disturbing thing is I was bad not because of a poor attitude, but due to inability. 

I didnt do my work but instead chased the good life without foundations. I want to change and genuinely feel the things that strong, confident, self satisfied people feel. I want to get comfortable in it. I want to lead, follow and have friends. I want to feel alive. This could be a turning point. So I need at least a couple of years of stability. I am going for a trial violin class tomorrow. Today I have to meet with a client. So, I need things to work.

But this again creates a dependance. I dont have a mentor, so I have hired three guys to be that for me. I dont have money, will have to learn to get by. Sometimes, I feel I should change the world, because I can and must. Sometimes I feel I getting run over by a bus. I haven't had sex in 2 years and ever done it with only one person whose virginity I had stolen. My life and source of my professional confidence and personal confidence has been a steady stream of lies I have self rationalized over time. Even when I was a kid, all I did was day dream where I was the hero doing this and that which I used as a source of self confidence and which later turned into an escape mechanism that I held on for too long.

I felt I was finally going to change myself last week. But last saturday I met this girl who was the perfect person for me to heal with. Not to mention, she wanted to have sex and I was literally desperate, begging to god for it for so long now, but when the time came, I lost all my momentum. I froze, i wasn't able to talk, to lead, to change the conversation, to be romantic, to be funny, to be confident, when in reality I can be all those things in isolation. Every morning I motivate myself that today will be different, but I go to office and its the same. So many people behaving in their own patterns seems overwhelming to change.

People get scared in my office, at any sign of self confidence from me- they all think I'm uber smart and are intimidated whenever I speaking a bit assertively/ hold eye contact. But most times, I dont feel like it doesn;t come to me because of well, all the stuff above. And I dont want any more fake stuff. I have the chance to be a god or someone like a pre ""steve jobs"" steve jobs to them but first impression has been pathetic. People think I'm some random intern or something, nobody bothers to ask me for lunch/dinner/breaks, nobody knows my name, nobody gives me the amazon orders that get delivered there. In my previous job, I got drunk at an office party, and puked and passed out and stuff. Nobody picked me up off of the fucking floor. Apparently, I was beaten up &amp; thrashed and my boss whom I fucking showed the middle finger to in the same party called my father and got my brother's old friend to come and pick me up. Sad as fuck!

Current job, this startup / tech scene is what I was looking for. So I'm not even sure If I can perform when the time is really on. Actually time to perform is already on and I'm sitting here for two hours writing this reddit post. I'm always slow to realise.

For the love of mother fucking god, someone say something!!!! Whether it be, advice, thoughts, jokes or whatever, someone say something. I am totally alone trapped in my consciousness. Whatever is the higher purpose a conversation or a dialogue serves, I need that shit!!!


tl;dr; My life is sad, tragic, can you help me end make a permanent change?"

6rigee,3,2017-08-04,Biophysics future advice for a computational biology major student,ahmedoosh,Biophysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biophysics/comments/6rigee/biophysics_future_advice_for_a_computational/,"Hey guys! Before Explaining my case, I would like to point out that I am from Egypt, which is considered a developing country. I am studying in a newly founded university called Zewail city for science and technology, which is considered the first institute in Egypt to offer high quality education for science majors. 
I about to start my third year, and exactly a year ago I was really confused whether to major in Biomedical sciences or in physics. I just simply adore both biology and physics (and math and chemistry and related disciplines of course!) I finally decided to major in biomedical sciences with a concentration in computational biology, and to take electives that are related to structural biology and biophysics. I guess that was a fine decision because our physics program is highly directed towards high energy and particle physics which, despite being quite interesting fields, I do not intend to complete my studies in (because, well I really love biology too and I am not ready to give up on it). I tried to take a physics minor, but due to some problems in the university (being new and everything), I wasn't successful in starting the minor courses. I decided, however, to try and start self studying the physics I need with the help of my dear friends majoring in physics. So far, this project proved successful. I studied analyical mechanics (from taylor's textbook) and electrodynamics (from griffith's text book) so far, and I am intending to study quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics as well. I know that I have no way to prove (in my graduate admission) that I have studied this stuff, but I am mainly doing this for myself to have enough experience and conceptual as well as quantitative knowledge in the field of physics to give me an advantage during my phD itself. I am planning to take the physics GRE next year, and I am planning to study hard for it and score (hopefully) a 900+. My GPA is so far 4.0, and I will also try to maintain it as much as I can. I also happen to have participated in quite a lot of student activities. 

Now that I have explained my situation, here is the problem. I am really skeptic and doubtful of myself, and I am not sure whether I am on the right track or no. The problem is that I have no major goal that I am trying to achieve, I am just studying what I like. I am not sure if it was a good idea to take a degree in computational biology rather than physics, at least when it comes to graduate admission. I haven't done enough research so far, and I am kind of lost trying to look for a nice research internship abroad (but not quite successful so far). At this point, I am just psychologically tired of exerting tons of effort self studying physics (which I enjoy regardless of anything), and in the same time doubting my self and feeling that I am not on the right track. I know that there is not definite ""right track"", but I am righting here as a desperate shout for help. I want you guys to give me some motivation and to guide me a little bit on what steps I should take in the following 2 years. I am not planning to stop self-studying physics, and I am planning to take the physics GRE. What else should I do? If you recommend that I start looking for research internships, do you have any idea where to look? Was the choice of studying computational biology a good choice, or will I struggle to get accepted in a good graduate school? Please help me out and give me your opinion, and put in mind that, although I might seem academically achieving, I am quite doubtful of myself, and this doubt can destroy all the potential that I could possibly have, so please help me out :D"
6rjnad,1,2017-08-04,Abusive Ex-Girlfriend Story – Seeking Advice,CauseMassHysteria,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6rjnad/abusive_exgirlfriend_story_seeking_advice/,"[Conflicted]

I'm a 27-year-old guy from the U.K that's just come out of 5-year roller coaster of intense love and intense abuse. I feel totally abandoned, utterly depressed and hollowed out, as if all of my energy has been siphoned. Please offer me some support, advice, encouragement and maybe even some tough love (if you think it's necessary, but please go easy). Here's my 5-year story:


Spring 2012: We started dating in 2012. I was 22 and she was 19. I was DJing at university and she fell for me instantly. She walked into our relationship after a 3-year relationship with another guy. I was in my final year of University and she was in her first. She was my first girlfriend. I had 3 months left before I had to leave university, so the relationship grew intense very quickly as our time together grew short…


For me, the feelings of love came slower, but I loved her very much and our personalities complemented each other perfectly so they kept growing. We were instantly best friends as well as lovers. We were both sensitive, kindhearted &amp; emotionally connected people, but she was extroverted whereas I was introverted; she was structured where I was creative; and made clear judgments about the future whereas I was more perceptive. She was very ambitious: the school president of her year from a prestigious family; she was privately educated, had lived abroad as a kid, and had completed internships in Europe at the highest-ranking marketing firms in the world. I was much less so, coming from a poor family with very little ambition or drive - my fire had always been internal, and not externally supported. However, I’ve got spirit, fire and creativity. Grit that haven't had handed to me. She motivated me further - pushed me and gave me structure. In hindsight, she wanted to mold me, and wasn’t really content with who I was. Our personalities synced perfectly. And on paper, we were the perfect match. Everyone else thought so too. We smashed the Myers Briggs personality love match test, and our star sign compatibility is the strongest across the whole zodiac: Scopio (me) and Pices (her), if you believe that shit…

After a few weeks of intense passion, she told me she’d been suicidal at 15 and had attempted suicide twice. I accepted this calmly, and didn’t fuel it too much. I wanted to support her and encourage her in the right direction, but not make it a defining factor of our roots together. However, she pushed it, and she said that if I were to leave her after I graduated (which I wasn’t going to), then she was worried that she’d sink back into this suicidal state. I know that alarm bells should have been ringing - but I didn't feed it. I accepted that this was the 'old Alison’, and that this was just a phase of her teenage years, as she clearly wasn’t this girl now. I could clearly see that she was not depressed and suicidal: so why feed that belief? Instead, I gave her real support and the ability to grow as a person by showing her the door, and by encouraging her to be the best version of herself that she could be. It’s in my nature to want people to grow and be the most authentic and happy person they can be in life. So I supported her in the most loving way without amplifying the problem – and encouraged her to embrace her strong, infectious personality, warmth and charm! It turns out that in regards to the suicide attempts, she was greatly exaggerating, and possibly making it up completely. The reason she tried to ‘commit suicide’ was because she had to live in the Caribbean growing up instead of the U.K. I understand that uprooting like this can be traumatic for kids and teenagers… but in hindsight, it’s clearly not worthy of suicide, as she had a very supportive and privileged upbringing. In my past, my father had broken my hand, assaulted me, and intensely bullied and belittled me for the entirety of my childhood whilst never having a job and using me as a punchbag for his mental condition. He also emailed me ""by mistake"" in January 2016, stating he was having an affair with a woman that wasn't my mother. In 2012, I had never even left the U.K at any point in my life. And she was crying about the fact she had to move to the Caribbean and Switzerland, a thing that could be seen as an absolute privilege, and in the most positive way as a seemingly very mature 19-year-old woman. Her parents are domineering, judgmental people that focus on their careers more than their families, but ultimately they love her a lot and show her so much support, love, direction and kindness. She has an incredibly kind and supprortive extended family. I fail to see how this suicide attempt was even relevant, and in hindsight after a few conversations with her, it appeared that it was a pure fabrication of the truth in order to create within me, some sense of responsibility for her. I didn’t realize this or conciously accept this role, at the time.

Summer 2012: I I finished university and was madly in love. I’d been supporting this girl through her difficulties – whilst also feeling an incredible sense of love being returned. She was warm, friendly and very sociable. Very upbeat and positive in public, but cripplingly insecure and anxious whilst alone. A true extrovert. I think in hindsight, I needed love, as I’d lacked that in my childhood. This positivity came as a blessing and filled me with the complimentary energy I sought in a partner. She offered something I’d never had: and I was on Cloud 9. 

She had planned to travel Thailand in the summer of 2012 with her ex-boyfriend, and it was already booked. I stayed at home and went to some festivals in the U.K as I had planned. And when she came back, we reunited. After a few days, and some feigned tears - she told me she was 'raped' in Thailand. I was absolutely shocked, and I reacted very calmly. I didn’t ask too many questions and offered her boundless levels of support. I had obvious questions, but you can’t ask too many questions when someone tells you they’ve been raped… So I acted with absolute care and support, whilst being the best boyfriend I could be. I found out in 2016, that this was a lie. At the time, she broke down during sex with 'flashbacks of the rape'. It sounds fucked up, but she must have really thought about the production values (or at least felt really fucking guilty for cheating on me?). 

Not only did she say she was ‘raped’, but insinuated that it happened on the night that I was 20 minutes late to Skype. She made me believe all the way up until 2016, that I was responsible for her being raped (which she eventually confessed was bullshit). In hindsight, it feels like she was testing me and becoming incredibly reliant on me for my support, and eventually I naturally just started to restructure my own goals and ambitions and life plans in accordance with her needs, and put my own needs and independence by the wayside… (a HUGE error, I know!).

August 2012: After summer, I moved back up to my old university to be with her, instead of carving my own path. It felt like a step backwards. I’d already finished university, but I wanted to be there for her. Especially after what happened. But I hated living there. All of my friends had moved away, and it made me bitter as I had to accept a lame job in a call centre, instead of pursuing my dream to travel the world and teach English abroad for a while… Eventually, this dream I kept avoiding became so powerful, that I approached her and told her I wanted to move to Vietnam for 6 months to help developing communities, and to teach them English. She freaked out and couldn’t handle it. I unwisely conceded and decided to stay. I chose her, over my destiny, and this mistake led to a series of problems. I felt held back and cropped as a person. She had travelled everywhere as a kid, she had been given so many experiences, and had a CV worthy of the best job – without ever having to raise a finger. I, on the other hand, had a mountain to climb: and I was being stifled.

Summer 2013: I didn’t act irrational or get caught up on this, as ultimately I was happy to be with her, and I wanted her in my life. In the summer of 2013, we both decided to move to London together so that I could build some real experience whilst she was on her summer break from university between her 2nd and 3rd years. She lived in London for 3 months with me during the summer. I found an internship in Digital Marketing. We found an awesome flat, but I had to work hard in two jobs to support myself as the internship was virtually unpaid, and London is VERY expensive. It put pressure on us, especially since the move to London was a total compromise, and I never wanted to live there. I felt like I was sacrificing my own dreams, in order to be closer to her. It created a weird dynamic. I never wanted to move to London, it just had to happen for us to be together. I studied Sociology at University, which ultimately attacks advertising/capitalist ideals; so I felt like I was doing myself a disservice by being so corporate and soulless. I’m from a small village in the U.K, so the idea of London felt intense, oppressive and almost Orwellian to me! It felt grey, stifling and rigid to me. And without money, there wasn’t much room for enjoyment.

The first three months with her, however, were fairly good. But by September 2013, she entered her 3rd year, and I lost my paid job. So now I had an internship and no income… Suddenly, I had no girlfriend with me, no flat (as it was a temporary sublet!), no job, no money, and no one to help me out to offer support. It built character. I panic-found a new job – and landed on my feet. I freelanced with an international events company and got to travel all around the world for 3 months whilst working with them. I found a new place to live, but it was rushed so I didn’t make the right choice as it was too expensive. The company paid well, but it was freelance, so it was risky and financially insecure. The job, however, was great! And I was back in the UK 10-15 days per month, so I got to see her a lot and travelled to see her at every opportunity. Ultimately it was the best position for her, so there was very little to complain about.

However, when I was away I would frequently get frantic and emotionally distraught calls from her in the midst of my conferences. She was literally freaking out about being at university and didn’t want to be there on her own. Essentially she was addicted to me and couldn’t cope without me being there, and was intensely inconsiderate about the fact I was working in a professional environment and could not spend all of my time glued to my phone texting her whilst I was catering for VIP clients at international conferences. Every spare minute was spent consoling and dealing with what could be described as borderline mania. My colleagues caught wind of this and saw it as extremely unprofessional (who wouldn’t – I was being an idiot). It made me feel very unprofessional, as I was dealing with utter drama and immaturity/lack of respect for my duties. I think she was reliving her childhood traumas: i.e. her dad’s away at conferences, and she’s at home upset without a supportive parental figure?

Anyway, I was paying £750 per month to live in a trendy converted warehouse in London, but I could never spend any time there or make any new friends post-university because ALL of my waking moments were spent seeing or consoling her. At the time I was happy to do that, and I thought she’d truly appreciate and value it. She did, but it created this weird toxic dependency on both sides. It got to the point where I was completely and utterly exhausted with no energy left for my own space. I even helped her with essays and projects at university, because she was so frantic and distressed that I just wanted to help calm her down and give her some peace, at least in her academic endeavours. All of this made my life incredibly stressful and prevented me from ‘building a life’ after university (as she was still there).

Winter 2013: I was suddenly informed there would be no work for 3 months between December 2013 - February 2014. I suddenly had to scramble to find another job. I landed on my feet and found myself a much less desirable job in a marketing firm as an Account Manager. It looked great on paper, but I hated the work. It involved cold calling. And brands. And advertising bullsh*t. And again, I couldn’t make meaningful connections with my coworkers as every evening was spent focusing on her as we had to put extra effort in due to the everlasting long-distance. I just wanted to explore the world and live my life, and I was caught in London, doing a job I didn’t want to do, for a girl who wasn’t there! I’d never left England as a kid, and I was itching to get out see things. But I was stuck here in a mechanical machine-like job. Alison had lived in Switzerland and Antigua, and she’d already travelled Southeast Asia twice, and been away with family to almost every country and ski slope you can imagine. Yet she held me back from this same experience. It eventually made me resentful as I sat in solitude typing and clicking away in an embellished hipster office, with my “dress down Fridays” and candy-coated cold calling job. Even worse than the resentment, was guilt I felt within myself for being resentful like this. I had read “The Alchemist” prior to this, and I knew I needed to be ""following my dreams"" and achieving a state of flow/happiness in my life… I knew that I would find myself caught in a spiral of chaos and unhappiness by trying to sail headfirst into the wind and doing something I didn't feel natural doing, instead of listening to my heart. I absolutely knew this mentality would manifest itself. And it was pissing me off that this was playing out how I predicted it. Here I was, hating my job and feeling like an automaton with no friends or family around me. I wasn’t even saving money, because… London prices. We started to argue. She would scream and shout at me, and misinterpret things that I said, gaslight me, setup Wickerman arguments, and generally be pretty vile towards me, especially after a few drinks. She’d manipulate and warp my words whilst I was trying my hardest to keep things calm, supportive and rational. She would push and push until I got angry and joined in with the argument, thus justifying her and making me look abusive.

Summer 2014: The long distance and the continued stress of my London life and this scenario caused us to break up, right as Alison had finished her degree. I was distraught that I’d waited for her for so long, and that it had led to nothing. We were finally free to be together without all the long-distance. To counteract this, I quit my job, moved back home and made plans to travel to India for 3 months. It was the sense of adventure I had been craving for two years. 1 month before I left, we made amends. She didn’t want me to go and fought it for a long time. She got super emotional, but we were officially together again before I set off.

Autumn 2014: India was incredible. I loved it. It invigorated me and I felt truly alive. My life had a purpose again. And my eyes were bright with positivity and opportunity. I audited my life and my future in anticipation of returning home. I assessed what I wanted, and didn’t want from my life. I thought about friendships to enrich, and ones to ditch. I made plans to restructure my future in the way that I wanted it. I thought about how to improve my relationship with Alison. Halfway through the trip, she called me to say she was pregnant. She’d stopped taking the pill and hadn’t warned me. She had to have an emergency abortion: one of the most heart-wrenching experiences of our lives and something I can never truly appreciate or understand as I wasn’t there. In hindsight, I should have flown home instantly. I feel bad that I didn’t. But she was going on a cruise vacation with her family just two days after the abortion, so even if I did go there, then it would raise the alarm to her parents who had no idea about this. And if I came back, I wouldn’t even be able to spend time with her because she was on the cruise. The worst part is that she was meant to be under general anaesthetic (asleep) for the operation, but she ate breakfast on the morning of her operation. This meant she had to have the operation whilst she was awake… I can’t imagine the trauma that would have induced, and I felt awful for being in India. But ultimately I couldn’t get home, and even if I did, she wouldn’t have been there.

Winter 2014: I continued my trip to India, and came home with a renewed sense of self, balance and purpose. I committed to Alison fully and gave her support whilst applying new principles to my life and future. I wanted to work for something good. I wanted an authentic, meaningful job which gave something back to society. I applied for marketing jobs within charities, NGOs, health food brands etc. but after a couple of months of trying, we decided to become English TEFL Teachers and move to Vietnam! It was my idea, and it was what I had wanted to do in 2012. She was super keen as well, as she’d always wanted to travel and live abroad off off her own steam…

Spring 2015: We moved to Vietnam, and everything was great. We had an amazing flat, good friends and a great life! We landed on our feet. We whizzed around on motorbikes, drank great coffee, explored lots of cool places together and drank lots of cheap beer! It was fantastic. She randomly brought a wild bunny home one day without any preparation and without asking, and it ended up shitting all over the house and eating all of our electronics and clothing. It was super annoying. It was like 40 degrees Celcius in the heat of summer, and we only had one laptop to share, as mine had broken for a third time (after being repaired twice, thanks, Apple). It was hard planning lessons and applying for extra work from one incredibly slow MacBook Air from 2010, and I think Alison found life there harder than she let on. She was very tense.

After some time she started to become hyper critical of me again. In social situations, she would criticise my way of speaking to people. She’d comment on how I was acting, and require me to behave in a way that was unnatural. She was incredibly warm and friendly in social situations, but she would crave all of the room's attention and would get upset if another hugely charismatic soul in the room was taking the limelight. This desire for attention made me feel uncomfortable, as I like to be more subtle and laid-back in social situations. She started to bitch about people a lot which annoyed me, as I’d just wanted to be open and communicative with everyone – I didn’t want to judge people and sit around gossiping about minor flaws and weaknesses. We became lazy together. She didn’t encourage or support me in having my own friends. We ordered lots of takeaways and stayed in. I felt like my independence was being encroached upon. I wasn’t free to do things on my own. EVERYTHING revolved around us and our relationship. It became too intense for me, as it took away my aims and my independent nature, and the need to have a sense of integrity and privacy. EVERYTHING revolved around her. Things became very toxic and argumentative. She said she didn’t love me after some drinks. She would often try and control me and would talk to me in the most aggressive tone. She was an emotional manipulator and a bully. She was the same height as me, or slightly taller. She was verbally intimidating when she didn’t get her way. She was super beautiful and skinny but had a strong build as her father was like 6’6.

Summer 2015: One morning in Vietnam, we had a heated argument and as she left for work, we were screaming and shouting about splitting up. Then 10 minutes later, she broke her leg in a motorbike accident on the way to work... I took time off and gave her my full support whilst looking after her in the flat for two weeks. It was such a bad time for her! She had to fly back to the U.K for an operation and treatment for 3 months. Once she got home, I came out of my shell a lot. I met with so many new people, I built myself a very strong social circle of expat friends. I was more sociable than I’d been in 3 - 4 years, and I felt a sense of relief at being able to ‘be myself’ again. I’d been lacking this sense of community and new friendship since 2012. I felt a sense of relief that she was back in the U.K. We didn’t really speak about splitting up again – it was put down to a heat-of-the-moment thing. She changed her tune and acted like a sweet little puppy dog whenever we Skyped from Vietnam to the UK. It was a head-fuck! But I loved her and just went with it. It might be worth noting that I have an extremely hard time leaving relationships that are toxic and emotionally damaging – it’s apparently my personality types’ main weakness. Anyway, after she recovered she returned to Vietnam in Winter 2015.

Winter 2015: When she got back she was socially uncomfortable and she kept saying that ""she didn't know her place, or where she stood in the social circle"". She was freaked out that I’d built a strong solid social circle without her, which she was completely welcomed into with a welcome party that I planned. She kept expressing how she felt destabilized and that she didn’t know where she fitted in. She, for some reason, felt like an ‘outsider’, but it was all in her head and nobody understood what she was talking about. She was clearly upset and confused that she wasn’t the centre of attention for once, and that it wasn't a social group that she had built and had 'control over'. As soon as she got back, she took away the closeness I had with these friends and broke up the consistency and closeness of the group. She started to talk to them about our relationship problems and disrupted the groups' integrity. It created social instability again, and replaced something that was so warm and connected before she got there. She would embarrass me socially, and say passive aggressive things to me in front of people. I felt embarrassed to be shown up so much in front of these people that I deeply respected. I’m reserved, laid-back and socially accepting, yet she made me look like an idiot at almost every opportunity. My confidence and friendliness retracted back into its shell when she returned, and everyone clearly noticed the difference within me. The social circle became focused around Alison again, with her trying to take the centre stage at every social occasion and event, and people noticed. I think she resented the fact that I had built strong friends, and that I was in a state of flow and happiness. It freaked her out. At this point, my alarm bells were going haywire, but I was almost 4 years into the relationship at this point, and didn’t know what to do…

Spring 2016: In January I received an email from my father, which revealed he had been cheating on my mother. He sent an email to me by mistake. Given my abusive past with him, I became depressed as my sense of ‘home’ was already in tatters. I needed Alison to give me some space to deal with this alone, as I didn’t want her to be involved. Our two-close friends arrived in Vietnam and we all went travelling in Myanmar. One night Alison started lying to my best friend about having Bulimia. It was another total lie. And after we got back to our hotel I called her out on it. I began to have glaring obvious warning signs that ‘the suicide attempts’, ‘the rape’, and ‘the bulimia’ were all bullsh*t. I started questioning her about it and she raised the temperature rapidly. She got hysterical and then pretended to be violently sick. It was mania! I felt bad for pushing her, but I needed answers and authenticity in my life – not drama. I didn’t know whether I had solid ground beneath my feet, and I couldn't believe anything she said. The next morning, I told her I needed some space. I held her hand and walked with her, I was totally calm and trying to be as communicative and caring as possible. I told her needed space for all of this, and the intensity of our relationship and her way of handling things, so that I could sort out the problems in my life between my father and my own personal life. She proceeded to tell me that evening that I had no direction in my life, and that I didn’t know where I was going etc. It got nasty. And in hindsight, she was right. The fact is, I don’t have a clear set path in my life. But I am ambitious. I have a general idea, but part of the wonder is to experience it and allow it to unfold: we can’t plan EVERYTHING. It’s about the journey more than the destination. I’m an honest, ambitious, and intrinsically good person. I have good values. I’ve stepped outside my family circumstances (low-support, low-income, low-drive, low-ambition) and pushed myself to go to University (the first in my family). I’ve moved to London off my own back, and funded the entire thing myself, whilst gaining tonnes of valid work experience in valuable roles. I’ve explored the world on my own steam without any financial support or encouragement to do so. Everything has been driven from my own heart. And it's made me a more serious/stoic person. But recently I've felt broken by this and have lost my drive... She had been given everything in terms of support, finances, career development, warmth, love, experiences etc. and then makes me feel as though I’m not progressing fast enough? It’s crazy. I did everything I could, and slowed down my own progression to be with her, which is what she wanted!

In March 2016: She sent an email to her father saying that I had split up with her in Myanmar and that she was flying back to England. It was open in a tab on her laptop. She had said that I’d been using her as an emotional punch bag. She lied about my father: saying that he’d been cheating on my mother for 20 years (total bullsh*it, again!). I felt like it was relationship suicide and I felt so betrayed. However, for two-weeks between her sending the email, and me reading it, she had been incredibly close and warm with me. I didn’t know about the email, but it was so refreshing to feel so intimate and close again. She had only been acting this way because she’d already made the commitment to flying home. And she was just going to leave me in a state of love and longing. She was using my house as a hotel for two-weeks whilst pretending to find another flat to live in Vietnam, and I was open to her moving in with me and inviting her to do so. She was just biding her time, acting very loving, and enticing me in. 

She told our friends that I’d split up with her in Myanmar (another lie). When I very clearly explained that I just needed space for all of the chaos and drama to calm down. There were more pressings matters in my life, and I couldn’t cope with the lies about the bulimia or that ‘she didn’t know where she stood in a social circle’.

I fought for her not to leave. I was now fighting for her when originally I needed space from her. And I needed to be resolving a deep family conflict, not focusing on this. We decided to leave it on a break when she went back to the UK (May 2016). She wrote me letters telling me she still loved me and outlined the rules and guidelines for this break which had no foreseeable ending etc. which she dictated towards me. She made me feel as though I had to play strictly by these rules else she would leave me. She made me feel expendable. I felt like a plan B. And my entire social support structure was destablised. My nearest and dearest became her supports, and I had no one (and she probably has 4 times the number of close friends than I do). I had to be in Vietnam for at least 5 months for dental treatment, so that was our loose aim. 

At first, it was torture. Everyone in Vietnam thought I split up with her. I was the bad guy. She attended festivals back home with my nearest and dearest – my friends from university. She spoke to them and told them our circumstances before I got to.  She posted up photos on Instagram and Facebook whilst partying with them. She spoke to my other best friend from home about the relationship problems from her perspective. I had NO ONE to talk to that knew us, and hadn’t already been pre-prepped by Alison. It was the most socially enveloping and isolating experience of my life. It caused deep mental trauma and depression. She had warped my social circumstances and I felt totally manipulated and powerless. I felt like I’d been completely and utterly fucked over, and I couldn’t express it to anyone that I cared about. And the situation at home with my father was not being resolved properly as he would not communicate.

Summer 2016: For the first 3 months I tried to gain clarity on what the break was whilst living in a different + 7 hours time-zone in Vietnam. It wasn’t black and white and it really fucked with my ability to be free and enjoy my life in Vietnam. She told me she’d hidden the spare key to her apartment, and that she didn’t want me to come back to the UK, and she actively rejected any sense of commitment towards one another: but she didn't want to split up... It was insanity. She wouldn’t offer any solutions as to how this “break” might end, or what we would be doing to resolve it, or what we were aiming for together. She was essentially telling me to get over her, but to not get over her. I didn’t want to get over her, I just wanted our problems to pass. I felt like she was leading me on whilst keeping me there as a plan B. But with all the social power and status that she had over me, I felt unable to move or gain advice from anyone. I felt truly and utterly trapped and isolated. After torrents and torrents of abuse over Skype, I eventually said: “fuck this” whilst working on an SEO strategy for her website… I was constantly doing everything to please her and building my life around her, and when she started an argument with me 1 day before her new job in London, I literally sacked it off there and then and cleansed myself from her choke-like grip on my life. I started dating other girls. I hooked up with a few different women whilst not looking for anything serious. I was incredibly hurt and broken, and I needed to become strong. I had some fun, and eventually, the dark clouds started to lift. I started practising yoga and meditation twice a week, and I started a weight-lifting program 4-times a week. I was getting incredibly healthy and strong. My social life began to pick up again, and I made more of an effort to go out and meet people, especially girls. I was still incredibly hurt and damaged by her, but I felt like I was healing and very gradually moving past her. I was angry at her. It was still technically ‘a break’ at this point, and we were together on Facebook and such… so I was never looking for or open to anything serious with anyone else. In all honesty, my impression was that she was acting free and single, and I was angry that she could move on so fast. Her social media super-ego suggested she was happier on her own. So I was processing all of this and moving past it. She messaged me abusive messages throughout this time to get me to ‘bend the knee’ and accept that I’d been “negatively this, that or the other”. I ignored her completely. A few months later in October, she calls me from Portugal with her friend… (It had to be a public drama, of course - no room for authenticity here).

Autumn 2016: She expressed this huge confession of love. My jaw hit the floor. I was wide open in disbelief. I had thought with all my heart for months that she had hated me and wanted to move on. I couldn't believe what she was saying. How could she love me when she abused me so heavily? How is that even possible? She has been indicating the complete opposite. It felt like a soap opera. And why were other people ALWAYS involved in the relationship drama? I didn’t reciprocate as I was extremely angry at her, and I felt extremely abused by this girl, even though I ultimately loved her. It felt toxic to instantly switch from anger and resentment to an addictive and smothering form of love. The purpose of the break had been to get rid of all the toxicity and damaging behaviour, so how could I brand this as healthy?

After some drunken nights, we had Skype sex a few times. It was confusing. Afterwards, we didn’t speak for a while because I worked evenings and weekends during the week, and it was almost impossible to speak except on Sundays. Time went by, and I couldn’t communicate the questions that had been hanging over my head. Ultimately I couldn’t believe that she loved me. I had just signed a contract with an incredibly well-paid company. My freedom and independence were now captive again. This contract was due to last until May 2017. It paid almost three-times the salary of similar job in the U.K. It was my decision to keep saving and building myself independence. This allowed me to put myself in a stronger position for the future financially.

I halted my process of loss. I stopped ‘getting over her’, and focused on regrowing my love for her and focused on myself and my goals. I stopped seeing other girls. By Christmas, I was desperate to come home. She was also desperate for me to come home. Many friends in Vietnam left in December, so that was another reason for me to leave. I cut back my social life and didn’t date, which brought me back into isolation and confusion. I decided to stay in Vietnam over Christmas because I hadn’t finished my contract.

Spring 2017: In the new year, I made it my mission to save $25,000 in Vietnam so that I could leave with something impressive to show for it! I saw this as a way to fund my future – a potential master’s degree, a business or a deposit on a house. I couldn’t earn this kind of money at home, and I wanted to achieve this goal. I brought Alison into all of these plans again based on her deep expressions of love, but I couldn’t talk to her that much due to the amount I was working, and the time differences. I took on extra work to ensure I hit my financial targets and I focused all of my spare energy on an intense gym program to lose 10kg and tone up. I didn’t date anyone, and it was an incredibly self-motivating experience which felt great! I made it really clear that I couldn’t just rush home just because she’d called for me and changed her mind again (I was taking a stand against her for the first time in our 5-year relationship.). By this point, we hadn’t seen each other in almost a year – but I felt that it was wise not to cave to addictive/toxic mentalities again, and I thought patience was the best way to tackle this. It was like we were addicted to each other. And I wanted to remove that, and ‘choose’ to be together, rather than ‘having’ to be together in future. Does that makes sense? I was incredibly loyal and driven: focusing on my two goals of $25,000 and building a stronger body whilst counting down the days until I could return. I found an online teaching job for the summer so that I could move anywhere with her. She told me she had applied for a job in Berlin (which is where my master’s degree would be), and she was also looking at jobs in Dubai (where we’d spoken about teaching English). Both of these places were convergence points, but ultimately I just had to just trust her and believe that it was all going to work out in a calm and non-forced manner. I think I was being mature about it by putting myself first, instead of her for a change. But maybe I’m wrong? Our way of interacting was so screwed, that I (and she) felt it needed to be totally reset so that we could meet, and talk about our abusive behaviours in the past and validate and accept responsibility for them; before moving on and creating the positive future and love that we wanted. I couldn’t just say: “Yes I love you unconditionally! Let’s abuse each other again!”.

In May, I booked my flight home. And I also met another girl. I hooked up with her and felt close to her like I hadn’t with anyone since Alison, but I didn’t allow myself to get emotionally attached. It had been months since I’d got laid (I hadn't been trying). I was, for the most part, being loyal to this absolute mind-fuck of an ex-girlfriend that I hadn't seen in a year. This new girl said that she wasn’t just looking to get laid, and she could sense that I wasn’t emotionally investing in her… I felt guilty as hell because I wasn’t – I was still heavily invested in Alison. I called Alison the next day... 

She then told me that she had 'checked out in December' without telling me, even though we were in a relationship on Facebook, and spoke whenever we could. It turned out that she had been in a private relationship with another guy 3 or 4 months without telling me, or even telling me her feelings were changing. She didn’t even call me, and there was no communication about this. She’d been hiding this from me whilst also leading me on. She then blocked contact with me for two months after 1 short conversation at 1 am in Vietnam, and then left me in chaos and confusion again from May - July 2017. I’d been pulled back in and I had reintegrated her into my life. I had made her my main priority and my focus, and then she screwed with my head AGAIN.

After this, I thought fuck Alison and went full power with this other girl. After a few dates, all of this stuff about my recent past inevitably came out in a pretty raw way, and it became apparent that there was too much going on with Alison and I wasn't ready for something new. I could’ve genuinely seen myself with this other girl, but this head-fuck that Alison put me through prevented me from living my life confidently. After this, I needed closure or understanding from Alison so that I could move on and clarify what was happening. I’d been waiting for a year to see her, and I’d made this ‘break’ the priority in my life again. If I had started a relationship with someone new, Alison would have publically executed me and ruined me socially… (which she already has, in a sense).

I’m a total fool for allowing myself to be walked all over in this way, and to be manipulated by this girl for so long. I feel utterly hollowed out like she’s taken all of my energy. I now haven’t seen her since May 2016, and its August 2017, but I’ve just got back to the U.K and I’m now totally lost. I have no job, hardly any friends, no sense of home (I don't live in a big city). I was waiting to reunite with her and I made that my focus. I grew and maintained my love for her for over a year, and now suddenly she is speaking to me in a condescending way from a place of power as if I deserve to feel like sh*t. 

I’m not in a good way. I'm eating healthily, going to the gym and applying for jobs - but my eyes look glossed over and depressed with big black bags. I’m always tired! None of my friends live in my hometown either. And the 3 main ones that matter, have already been her main supports. So I feel like everyone is giving me warped advice, and if I want to vent about this, it will find it's way back to her.

How can I forget this crazy, fucked up experience without the support of my friends? I’m 27 and this is my first major relationship, so it’s naturally hitting me hard. Ultimately, do you have any advice on how I can break this chain of chaos? And how I can be happy?

Thanks if any of you made it to the end of this. I wrote such a long account for my own record, but if anyone else is kind enough to offer some support, advice or validation on these things, then I would really appreciate it."

(You pick up the log.)

*Day 6655, Control Loss*

*****

They call it the Loss of Control.

The great cataclysm caused by our sinful selves.

We were all, to put it in an coarse term, screwed.

The last 15 million.

All of us, in a simple dome covered by the webbing of the Ancients we called *Jerienmirr*.

It meant Land of Despair in the Old Language.

I still recall R'teha before all this happened.

The lush, green land and blissful life, happiness and joy everywhere.

All granted by our God.

But underneath that cover of perfection...

The unspeakable was done.

Raped, tortured, killed. Each human suffered their terrible fate by these...

Vile, swarming creatures not worthy of being called human. They were overcome by greed, lust, gluttony...

They were the 7 Cardinal Sins humanized, all of them equally disgusting.

They said they were doing it for the greater good.

It was true, for our land lost its perfection when they stopped the production of this...

Sadistic power.

Thus, slowly, our kind was infected by this ""diesease"".

We lost our religion.

We stopped praying.

Our land started withering.

And we turned away from God.

And God tried to bring us back.

There were many attempts:

The return of the Messiah(shot, killed and burned on a cross).

The Plagues(we cared not for these as we were consumed by our lust for power).

The Death of The Builders.

The Expulsion of Evil.

The Destruction of the Earth.

The **Loss of Control**.

What now?

Permanently trapped in this place, forever staring into the dark abyss. We all knew: our fate was not far away.

Every day, some of us would disappear.

No one knew what happened to each of them, but it couldn't be good. Jaina would always ask questions.

Oh Jaina, my sweet child.

My precious. Would the Gods take mercy on my humble family?

I think not, for no day passes without many souls leaving this... prison.

But still, I pray. I pray for the safety of my people. That the God that we had all abandoned would save us. This life of fear was not for us humans.

For we turned away from God, and now he has turned away from us.

The Darkness is coming.

I have to hide.

*****

""Icarus! Hurry up, *Elvond'e!* We have to escape!""*

""Maria, where's Jaina?""

""I don't know, my love...""

""Cshk."" Icarus thought to himself, his eyes frantically darting across the dark outerrim.

Slamming open the door, he yelled out in a voice that would have woken those taken by the Ancients if they had not been silenced forever.

Jaina, hearing her father, quickly warped to her home.

Unknown to her parents, she could bend the distance of one place to another.

Her power was bi-location.

Those with abilities were, sad to say, corrupted.

They basked in the sadistic aura gained from torturing their own kind.

That, of course, was before the Loss of Control occured.

""Jaina, you can't scare us like that. Please, stay in the *Séhùo.*"" Icarus said, his face a mash of colours.

If only she would.

*****

*Day 6659, Control Loss.*

*****

Last cycle was... disturbing, to say the least.

Being the leader of the last of us, I had to stay strong and put up an act of confidence.

Inside, however, my organs writhed.

Our numbers plunged, taking us down to a mere 11 million.

It was like The Reaper himself came to collect all those souls.

This fear-rending experience brought a plague to the dome and now everyone is quarantined. No one knows how it happened.

If we don't escape soon, we're all ***doomed***

*****

""Jaina!"" Icarus rushed into the forest, having caught his daughter playing within the shadows again.

""Yes, Dad?"" The fourteen year old replied, her face pure and innocent.

""Jaina, stop playing in the forest. This is your last warning. If I catch you again, you're grounded. It's too dangerous, Jaina."" Icarus spoke, even though he already knew the inevitable would happen.

His child's... no, his spawn's face crumpled up into a sight that he would never forget.

Icarus could only watch as she slowly turned into her true form, The Darkness itself.

Icarus, taken aback at this sudden change, broke out into a run.

But then, he felt the cold touch of The Darkness.

Was he to be consumed?

Perhaps his only purpose was to be a sacrifice to the Ancients.

Muttering a prayer to the New Gods, Icarus allowed himself to be lifted up by the monstrous incarnation.

""Jaina... What have you done?""

Her only response was a hiss of the tongue.

His vision faded to black.

*****

Day 6666, Control Loss.

*****

I'm terrified at this point.

My child, my sweet, sweet Jaina, is Demonspawn.

She's uncontrollable.

Perhaps this is why all those people disappeared.

I let my child unleash her wrath upon all those pour souls. Although you may think it's not my fault, I should have noticed earlier.

Instead, I let her destroy our place of living.

She's killed over four million.

However, there seems to be something wrong with the Population Screen.

It's stuck at 10 million and 50.

50.

40.

30.

20.

10.

5.

3.

1.

I pray that the one person remaining from the million is safe.

Every million is a certain set of people.

And I pray that the last person in this set is safe for now.

Uh oh.

It ticked down.

(You find a second entry five minutes later.)

It still hasn't gone down.

It usually starts rushing down as soon as the last person is gone but...

Has no one really died?

I had better go in. She's cracking the dome.

I do not know if I may live to write another entry.

This may be our complete destruction.

*****

Icarus was hiding inside, fearful of the loud pounding coming from the top of the dome.

Suddenly, as though *it* had saw something terrible, *it* shrunk down, turning *it*'s head.

Was Jaina...

Crying?

Icarus was dumbfounded at this peculiar behaviour.

Christ... how was he supposed to deal with this child?

She seemed to be holding something bigger than herself.

No... not something. Some*one*.

""Jaina?""

She seemed to become human yet again.

""I'm... I'm sorry dad..."" She bawled, streaks of salty tears marking her face. Her petite figure was bending slightly under the weight of the corpse.

""What? Who are you holdi- no. No! Jaina. Why?""

Jaina, who was at a stage of paralysis, could barely say a word.

""Jaina.""

What was that voice pounding at the back of her head?

She did not acknowledge it, whatever the case.

Was it her own imagination or was her father...

Melting?

*****

*Day 6700, Regaining Control.*

*****

My grief is... immeasurable.

Jaina... my innocent child, has killed my wife, Maria.

I cannot describe my loss. My mind is flooded with dark thoughts.

Am I becoming like Jaina?

Am I now paying for my sadistic sins? My corrupted actions? My evil mis-doings?

All I know is that Jaina is no longer my pure daughter.

She is the Whore of the Devil.

The Devil's own wife, own servant.

I've seen her communicate with the Darkness.

She herself can control and seduce The Ancients.

She takes up the shape of an innocent child but yet, there is still darkness.

A deep shadow of death beneath the surface.

But perhaps, she is trying to repent.

She no longer talks to the unholy depths.

She does not change form.

She refuses to use her powers.

Shall I get this over with?

*****

""Icarus?""

""What... Who was that?"" Icarus said, wary of the voice.

""Icarus... it's me. Maria."" The voice spoke, its tone perfectly tuned to his sweet wife.

""No. You can't be. She's dead."" Icarus replied, his hands fumbling for a weapon.

Slowly, the shape and form of his repentant wife appeared just ahead of him.

""Maria..."" Icarus' eyes glazed over and dilated, locking onto the light hazel skin, those emerald green eyes, her light blonde hair.

Perhaps it truly was Maria.

*****

(You put down the log and open Jaina's Diary.)

*Day ????, Jaina's Diary.*

*****

I have been trying to keep the spirit in. It's still working but I feel it eating away at my organs, fighting to get out.

It's unbeatable. I can't do this anymore.

It numbs my senses... takes away my thoughts.

The shadow of death is permanently upon my father.

Speaking of Father, I saw him acting strange today.

He was talking to the air and calling out my mother's name.

I only pray that he's not speaking to the devil.

Ancients.

My mother.

The one I killed.

I'm so sorry, Father.

I... I don't want to cause us any more pain.

Please. End my misery.

I don't want to live **anymore.**

(The rest is ripped. You are unable to read further.)

*****

Icarus was in bliss.

His wife, the one he loved so much, had returned from the dead.

""Maria, my love, how did you escape?"" Icarus asked, a large grin on his face, all obligations forgotten.

""I..."" Maria seemed taken aback.

Icarus' grin disappeared.

""What's wrong, my love?""

""Icarus, I'm not here anymore. Look behind you."" What was supposed to be Maria seemed to be fading away.

Icarus, desperate, lunged for the fading shadows of his wife.

He looked behind him and saw the lifeless body of Maria.

He grasped his forehead, slowly spiraling into madness.

Looking up, he saw Jaina in her reformed state with tears shimmering within her eyes.

""Father..."" Jaina spoke, her voice quavering.

Had her father truly broken? Had he turned delusional?

Jaina, frightened by the mass of muscle and rage that was her father, felt the darkness inside her stir.

*The number of humans alive shifted to 999,9999.*

*****

(You find another piece of the diary.)

*Day ????, Jaina's Diary.*

*****

What have I done?

I...

I killed my dear daughter.

What monstrosity is inside me? I have no excuses for my actions. I guess the darkness inside took over and...

It simply destroyed the essence of my daughter.

I can still remember what happened.

My sight went purple, I locked eyes with her...

My mouth opened to scream and I charged.

Her body flew backwards, delicate and broken.

My vision cleared and...

She was slowly choking on her own blood.

I couldn't do anything.

I pray that my people may forgive me for this filicide I have commited.

I...

Reading through this diary, I realise that Jaina was a good person, through and through.

What am I saying? Of course she was.

She always had the best intentions. She tried to save us and I ruined our chance. The cracks in the dome only cause my heart to ache with remorse.

However, the official log has broken.

We dug it up and it led to pitch darkness.

Some people even swore that they saw faces swimming around, obviously in agony.

I hope that we may get out of here soon.

*****

Icarus had it planned.

He knew what was to happen next.

Although he was still broken, he had to be strong for the sake of his people.

No one knew what actually happened but they thought it was for the best that they did not ask lest they be shown his wrath.

They discovered, of course, that this wasn't a planet.

Anxiety was at a peak and some thought a genocide was about to occur.

""What if the hole opens up and absorbs all of us?"" Ishmael, Icarus' Vice-Captain muttered.

""Well, then we don't let that Ancient-forsaken hole even crack open you *rfc'keu!""

'Shit. He's real angry,' Ishmael thought, breaking out in cold sweat.

Suddenly, a man started screaming.

""Kill him,"" Icarus said, his voice cold and indifferent.

A gunshot.

The man fell and bled purple.

Another one dead to madness.

Perhaps this was their fate, to drop down one by one, losing their sanity to the Unholy.

Terror was instilled within the people as they watched their warm, kind and caring leader transform into a cold-blooded killer who slayed without a second thought.

Were they all doomed to die from either madness or their indifferent leader?

Slowly, more people started screaming from the insanity given by this dilemma.

Icarus raised an indifferent hand and said in that same fatherly voice, ""Kill them all. I do not care for them.""

More gunshots.

Standing up from his grand throne, he boomed out in a voice that was both caring and warped: ""You will all comply with my rules. And they are simple. Obey my every command, my every word, my every utterance. And dare not go insane or you will be shot like all the others.""

The firing squad, now terrified, turned towards him and fired a barrage of those same pellets that had massacred their fellow men.

Icarua raised his hand, grasping the squad with a shadow.

""Do not. DEFY ME!""

With a crushing motion, their necks snapped off in sync, bones and gore splattering across the parade of people.

Ishmael felt bile rising within his throat and immediately vomited on the floor.

The people were afraid.

Icarus smiled humourlessly, a loving father and husband turned psychopath by the tides of the world.

That was all he needed.

*Chapter 1*

(Newly written story)

*****

""Jesus Christ.""

Now, I learnt that the history of Earth, or as they used to call it, R'thea, was screwed up to the core but... this source was most definitely worse than those boiled down illustrations they put in the history textbooks.

""Dude. Can you believe this was only 200 years ago?"" My friend and colleague, Jeremiah, was reading the scraps of parchment over my shoulder as I shuffled through them.

""I never actually thought that what those books spoke of were real."" I replied, slightly unsettled by what I just read.

""Yup. It's a good thing we don't have any tyrants blowing up brains of unbelievers at the moment.""

We continued to work in silence. We usually were supposed to guard the Disks, each one containing the knowledge of a thousand years whih powered society. Every faction had them, just filled with what ever their element was instead of Knowledge. However, today, the archivists fell ill and us, having substitutes, were forced to do the dreary job.

We had four factions now, but at least we didn't have a fascist leader killing anyone in his path.

The four elements were Knowledge, Peace, Creation and Surprise.

We all had our differences. However, every decade, people had a chance to change element.

When you changed element, you lost the powers of your prior but gained those of the latter.

However, after the first attacks from Surprise, the sneaky bastards, guarding the disks was essential for every faction lest they lose their precious resources.

""Hey. Whatcha thinking about?"" Jeremiah queried, snapping his fingers beneath my chin.

""Uh- oh, yeah. Nothing.""

I continued sorting out the browned scraps, glancing over those which looked interesting. So far, no good discoveries other than the one.

""Ya know the new armour we got a week ago?"" Jeremiah said, a hint of a grin on his face.

""Yeah?""

""You know what company it comes from? Icarus Co.,"" he said, bursting into a typical Jeremiah grin.

""Strange.""

""Coincidence? I think not."" Speaking again with the ridiculous smile plastered on to his face.

""Please. Don't revive stale memes.""

Jeremiah chuckled, turning his head back to the pile of documents.

After a few hours of this mundane task, we finally got released from the Library. Jeez, no wonder the archivists called in sick. I would've quit in a week if I had to do that every day, so kudos to them.

Crashing on the couch, we each grabbed a tray and boiled some water. Instant Schnitzel, the typical student's food. Jam-packed with an additive named MSG, also known as Massive Salty Goodness, it was unhealthy but somehow, delicious as heck. Honestly, once we were done with this internship, we hoped we could actually move on to something productive.

'Ding!'

""Wait, are you sure you got the right Schnitzel?"" I said to Jeremiah, looking at the unappetizing heap which was supposedly the slab of meat.

""Yeah, Beef Schnitzel, right?"" He answered, looking confused.

""No! I told you to get chicken! Beef tastes like crap! Jeez, everyone knows Chicken Schnitzel is superior."" I replied.

With a glimmer in his eye, he spoke the following words of praise. ""I'd like to stop you right there. Beef Schnitzel is godly."" 

""No way. Chicken is the one and only true god.""

""Fine, fine, my fault. Just eat, alright?"" He replied, raising his hands in defeat.

I angrily grabbed my fork, ramming it into the peasant-like Schnitzel.

'Happens every day,' I thought to myself.

*****

The next day, we were back to guard-duty. At least we got to feel cool with the armour and guns instead of having to sort out some stack of parchment every day.

After an hour of waiting around, I had to go. ""Hey, I'll be right back.""

""Sure."" Strange. Jeremiah didn't seem himself today.

Finishing my business, I strolled back, whistling a tune from the old ages. A melancholy piece, it conveyed the chaos of the past. Truly, a harrowing song that invoked the spirit.

I believe... it was named 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'. A horrifying name for a song that mothers used to stir the darkness within their children. It gives me the shivers just to think about it. I only learnt the roots of the song a few days ago.

From a distance away, I noticed something was off. 

""Jere? Where are you?""

Thinking it was a joke, I tried to call him out.  ""Haha, very funny. I know you're hiding. You can come out now.""

I counted to three.

1,

2,

3.

Well then, shit.

""Sound the alarm!"" I yelled.

Jesus fucking christ. Who knew what could be inside the headquarters now.

Probably the damn Elements of surprise. I knew they would double-cross us.

When I looked in, raising my gun, I saw... well, it was disgusting. Jeremiah, standing up with a bent back,  feasting on one of the Archivists. I could see the red glint in his eyes as he whipped his head up, staring at me as though I was his next meal. 

""Holy crap..."" I backed away, still holding my gun.

I whispered into the console on my ear for backup.

""Exodus-187? Come in, Exodus."" The Administrator's flowing voice spoke into my ears. 

""Right here, ma'am,"" I whispered back. ""I need backup immediately. ""Exodus-187-2 has been infected by... something. I can't tell but he's staring at me as we speak.""

""Stay calm. Backup will be here soon, she replied, although she sounded uncertain.

""Oh shit. He's getting ready to pounce,"" I blabbed, pure terror coursing through my veins as I tried my best not to run. Come on, Ms. Dahl. Send someone. Please.

Jeremiah leaped.

Yelling as a release of my emotions, I raised my plasma rifle and fired straight though my ex-best friend. 

Expecting him to burst into dust, I let my guard down. Stupid mistake. He raked his claws against my chest, cleaving through my armour like it was butter. Close one. I couldn't do something stupid like that again.

Blasting in the face again, I ran out to find a whole squadron wait for me. 

""What happened in there, Exodus?"" Colonel Patriach, a great soldier, asked me.

""It's about Exodus-187-2, sir. He's been infected by something. I could tell by the dark aura around him,"" I replied, trying my best not to break down.

After a moment of silence, he asked calmly, ""Is he still in there?""

""Yes sir,"" I replied.

""Men! I'll need you all to guard the area. Should you see a breach, kill them immediately. Is that understood?"" He yelled in his booming voice.

After he got their consent... Jesus. He walked in alone, rifle at the ready.

We heard a bang, a shout, and hissing.

Colonel walked out, collapsing on the ground. ""Don't... go... in...""

His eyes rolled into the back of his head as he took in his last breath. The man that I had looked up to for so long... dead on the ground. He had sacrificed himself to kill the creature. But why had he said not to go in? 

That night, I had a nightmare. 

I was back in the guard post.

Standing against Jeremiah with Colonel Partriach, we raised our guns in sync. 

Jeremiah leaped at the great man, completely ignoring my shouts and gunshots. 

""No!"" I shouted, trying to get him off the Colonel. 

Colonel fell to the ground, lifeless. Now the creature whipped his head towards me. 

""Oh crap... SCREW OFF!"" I set my gun to overdrive, blasting the being into darkness.

I woke, sitting bolt up. I was still in the infirmary. They had treated my scars and I was not in danger of anything. I was off-duty for a month.

Then, the alarm sounded.

I called the nurse on duty. ""What just happened?"" I asked as she ran in.

""Your friend is back. And he's raided your dormitory. He's after you,"" she replied, sweating.

*****

Limping along through the passageway with the nurse helping me along, this obviously wasn't the most ideal method of escape. I don't know how I got injured in my leg. I guess adrenaline got me through the pain.

""Come on, Mr. Yeo, you can do it. Just a few more metres,"" she encouraged, pushing me along.

A slight hissing sound came through. It sounded like a gas leak from a slight distance away, in the canteen. 

""Oh crap..."" I realised too late what the sound was.

A shadow leapt from the corner, taking down the nurse as she screamed in terror. 

""Shit... shit..."" I ran for the exit, one useless leg trailing behind me. 

The armory was just a few hundred metres away. If only I could run properly. 

I heard the hissing get closer as the thing that used to be Jeremiah caught up with my slow pace. It seemed to be playing with its food, like a cat playing with a mouse before it consumed it. It was running at a pace which was just fast enough to catch up.

Then I turned my head and saw its face. Christ... that damn smile is still plastered in my mind. It was Jeremiah's grin but just so screwed up... it just can't be described.

Getting bored of the game, it grabbed my leg, sending my whole body crashing to the ground, forcing me to eat concrete.

I turned over, crawling backwards away from the creature. It merely gripped my calf harder than before to prevent me from escaping. 

I kicked at it, hoping to dislodge my leg from its steely grip, but to no avail. I simply enraged it, forcing it to claw at my legs. 

All of a sudden, it stopped. Looking at me, it seemed to accept me.

I could understand parts of his words. ""One... of... usssss..."" he seemed to hiss, confusing me completely.

I took the chance to run from the creature as he stared at me as I sprinted. 

Looking back, I saw him evaporate into dust as backup finally arrived to finish him off.

All this happened in a single day. 

*****

""... and those are the fateful events that occurred during the month of Spes, where we discovered the final element, the now-eradicated Element of Darkness.""

""Thank you, Mr. Yeo, for your report of the story. However, some of your colleagues feel that you were hallucinating during the events you had just spoke of. What do you say to them?""

""I'll let them say what they want to say but you would have to be there to believe it. It was a harrowing experience, and, trust me, I don't ever want that to happen to anyone.""

""Thank you. Now, do you have anything else to say?""

""No, thank you. I've been feeling rather poorly recently and I would like to return to my dormitory.""

""Of course. Goodbye, Mr. Yeo.""

""Farewell.""

Some additional details, I previously interned with a company I will refer to as company A, and left on great terms after the completion of my internship. I had a brief encounter with my manager in public approximately a month ago and followed up with an email mentioning that I would be willing to come back for a second internship. Shortly after I received emails from him as well as a former co-worker who was in charge of intern selection expressing some interest in my return and letting me know that they would be in contact. Approximately one week ago the co-worker in charge of intern selection sent me an email requesting my current resume as well as to complete an application through their company website which I did. Today I received an offer from a different company I will refer to as company B. Assuming that company A is willing to pay a comparable salary I would prefer to work at company A.

How do I best notify company A that I have received another offer and need to hear an offer from them before Tuesday or I will accept the offer of company B?"
6rl79q,8,2017-08-04,Stress: Brought to You by the Letter P,jmsilverman,waiting_to_try,https://www.reddit.com/r/waiting_to_try/comments/6rl79q/stress_brought_to_you_by_the_letter_p/,"PRESENT. Prepared enough (for more than baby). Pregnancy. Promotions. Pay bumps. Parental Leave time? Post-natal job Prospects? Part-time work in my field?  

We're almost done with NPNT/WTT and going into full blown TTC territory. We're also at a point in my job where I should be nearly up for a promotion, which I'm realizing only one of my two managers thinks I'm prepared for. I work in advertising/media planning which is long hours, fast paced, and stressful. I changed into this very young field at 28, so now on the verge of 31 I'm in a position mostly held by 23-25 year olds. My 23 year old assistant was just promoted, and our 25 year old boss (2 up) was really a dick to me about being unprepared for the next level up.... meanwhile, the one between me and the dick thinks I'm on track. But the 2 up didn't even consult the 1 up. 

I spent 4 years bouncing around the non-profit world before I realized I liked marketing better than my social work/non profit management degree's roles. I spent a bunch of my mid 20's as an intern, and going back to entry level. Now with 2.5 years in this field behind me, I'm supposed to be ready for this promotion, but it will come around when we start TTC if it happens on time. 

I am SO scared that if I announce that I'm pregnant, this young boss will hold back on promoting me because of all the things stereo-typed about working moms. 

And I'm stuck here - I've been here 12 months, so in the US I now qualify for maternity leave from the company. If I leave, I won't qualify. I have to stay through maternity leave to get any kind of partial pay.

Worse, I don't even KNOW if I really do want to stay after? I might want to do something less stressful in the industry, or work part time, once a baby comes. I am out of the house from 7 am - 9pm currently, and I'll never get a chance to raise my kids. That's part of why I need the promotion. Truly, I need to ""catch up"" to my age group in the industry to have the flexibility to leave work at 5:30, otherwise its expected to work until 6 or 7 pm. Living outside of NYC, and commuting from the burbs means I don't get home until SO late. I can't do that and parent. I barely see my husband and puppy, or sleep. I'll never be present. For anyone. 

You're not supposed to talk about getting pregnant at work for so many reasons... but my team is all like I said 23-26, and they know I'm 30 and married. They also drink a lot. And I don't, So they KNOW something's up. I'm preparing myself for this life change. I temp, I track periods. I work out. I've started to cut out foods I won't be able to eat during pregnancy (not them all, just slowly so its not so jarring) and I'm overall trying to prepare my body because your body is what you ate 3 months ago - so if I spend the next 3 months treating myself well, my future baby will have a better shot in their first trimester. 

Have you gotten the vibe that I like to be prepared? And I research like a fiend? Because I know. My husband just keeps telling me to relax, and play it all by ear. That there's time. But I see my 31st birthday looming on the calendar... and I'm just annoyed that my work-life is in the hands of a 25 year old, that my future parenting and career choices feel so contingent upon proving something to HER right now... because if I want to pivot back to something less stressful - I feel so much pressure to show success here in the time I was in the fast paced piece of the industry. Its creeping into my dreams, and messing with my sleep the last few days. 

Any thoughts beyond ""try to relax?"" "

I'm considering switching a career into actuary. I've always love math and stats, did a major in CS and have been working for the past three years as software engineer. Looking to switch careers as I'm starting to find programming boring and i don't enjoy staying too long (8+ hours/day) at computers.

My plan is to take two or three exams of SOA and start applying for internships and jobs. I want to settle down in BC or Ontario area. Looking at the jobs online is quite bleak, with only limited number of posts. Other redditors are talking about the market being saturated and Canada is not the place for actuaries. Thoughts, guys?"

	An internship to me isn’t just a learning experience about the office like setting in my opinion It’s also a learning experience about finding out who I am as a person when it comes to professionalism and how to maneuver in an office like setting. Not only do I believe it would help me grow as an individual but it will help everyone whom I would be coming into contact with in everyday life. I have a strong belief that everyone we as humans come into contact with have not only a story to tell but experiences and wisdom that we are more than able to pass onto one another if willing. I also would like to intern at the City of Boca Raton to adapt a lot better to the reality that I want to live as a white collar professional and becoming a productive member of society. Adaptation is a part of my reasoning because this would be my first place of employment which work place is a more professional setting then before. I’ve worked in plenty of work settings which I had to adjust and work accordingly to the standards displayed. For example my first job at Ultimate car wash helped me develop the skill of being thorough with my work, even while being exhausted after detailing dozens of vehicle’s prior. My time  employed at Traffic shoe store located at the Town Center mall showed me how to be accountable for what I am put in charge of. Daily I had to keep track of the many shipments of shoes we’d received and shipped out with no one to oversee my duties but myself once I’d adjusted to the workload that in my opinion was more than one teenager should have been responsible for but as I stated previously I remained thorough with my work viewing it as a form of representation of me as an individual, and an employee giving my employer at the time my best efforts. My most recent place of employment The Little Chalet was the most influential places of employment for me it being a fine dining restaurant and me having no prior experience in this field of employment. The only reason I got the job is because close friends of mine I met along the way in the  many prior places I was employed at vouched for me and the fact that I even had friends willing to put there neck out for me was more than enough reason for me to not only give it my all but go above and beyond all I was requested to do. Working there was a learning experience that I take to heart because it helped me grow as an individual in more ways then I’d ever thought. This goes back to my first statement there are certain things you can’t learn on your own and having people around you, a team if you will to help guide you in the direction you want to be makes the experience grand. After my almost year and a half time of employment I learned not only about fine dining cuisine, and proper etiquette I retained knowledge on how to be a personal individual and the effects of putting in effort and pride in the work that you do. Though I was only a food runner at best there were many times that I was given tips from customers themselves for my hard work it became apparent to me that they could actually tell that I really was trying my best to make sure there dining experience was the best that not only me as an individual had to offer but my work staff as a unit had to offer to them. I’m very proud of everything that I as a person have achieved I’m not originally from Palm Beach and have had trouble adjusting to this suburban area coming from a background different than most who live here it’s easy to look at everything from a negative perspective but I finally understand what it truly means to put my best foot forward even when things don’t appear to be working in my favor. Even as I digressed on the topic of this essay I didn’t realize till now as I’m typing this how much I fake name have grown as a young man to be the person I am today. I believe I am the best fit as an intern of the city of Boca Raton because I feel I represent what the effects of living in such a high in regards held city where all I see Is opportunity when I step foot outside my home when once before all I saw were obstacles.

1)	You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.

2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower. 

3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”. 

4)	A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…

5)	Private tutoring for a young girl

6)	You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….

For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. And if you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!

Kinks: Cumplay, age play, lingerie, instructions, oral (giving/receiving), other vanillaish stuff

Limits: The usual, scat, gore, violence, rape, death, futa, furry, group, etc

6rm4pz,3,2017-08-04,Transitioning from Financial Analysis to Financial Advising,AReallyAverageGuy,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/6rm4pz/transitioning_from_financial_analysis_to/,"So just a little bit of background about myself, I graduated with a BBA in Finance in December 2016 from a large state university that ranks within the Top 25. I had an average GPA, participated in 2 summer internships with one being specifically geared towards financial analysis, and was decently involved on campus.

I am currently about 4 months deep into a job doing financial analysis work for a small business. A family friend owns the business and I got the job through that connection. Although the position pays well and I enjoy the environment/co-workers, I really have always been more of a people person and the analytical nature of the position does feel like an awkward fit, since it's not a natural strength of mine.

In addition, I really have developed a passion for investing, especially as of late. With income coming in from my job, I have started putting away money for both retirement and eventually buying a house, and I monitor my investments and the market daily to see how everything is tracking. In addition, my parents are getting ready to retire, and I have been talking with them about investment strategies to make sure they're comfortable with their game plan.

So with all of this taken into consideration, I have really started to reconsider my career path, and I am starting to think I might be better suited for financial advising. I understand the nature of the position is more geared towards sales, but between my people driven personality and my passion for investing, I still think it would be a good fit in theory.

So in short, what suggestions would you have for someone pursuing a career in financial advising, especially considering that I was tracking to work in a more analytical role. In addition, if I do go down the financial advising route, what steps should I take to get going in the right direction in this career path. Are there any reputable development programs that can get me in the right direction, especially if I am hoping to eventually be a fee-based advisor?

If anyone has any additional questions about anything I didn't clarify on, I'd be more than happy to answer those. I am looking forward to hearing back from you, and thanks for taking the time to read this!

TL;DR: Recent college grad w/ finance degree pursued career in financial analysis. After self-reflection, starting to think financial advising is a better path.

Simple right? Okay moving on. Below is my kink list along with the scenarios.  

https://m.imgur.com/a/1ePbu



**Teacher/student**


I have no idea your interested in me and you get my attention by dressing sexy. First its all just for my attention then It becomes about your grade.

**Classmates**


We were best friends growing up, but as we got older we started drifting apart. I went into track and you went into band/choir. Now I am the most popular girl in school and your one of the nerdy girls. I pick on you during school hours. Then I tell you I can make you just as popular as me. If you are willing to do as I tell you.

**Blackmailing the intern**


You have been working for me less then a month. So far you have managed to get away with embezzling almost fifty thousand dollars. Until I catch you. I can play as your boss or the bosses daughter who is next in line to the company.

**Mother/Daughter**


Its late I come home from work and you can tell its been a bad day. Just from the look on my face as I walk in the door. Its been very stressful since your father had left us.

**Sister/sister**


Its been almost a year since I left for college. Its almost summer break and time for me to come visit again. As I get to your door with my suitcase in hand to knock on your door. You open it with a smile. I drop my suitcase an lean into a hug with you. I step inside and look around. 

**Create your own**

6rnsl1,3,2017-08-04,"20-Year-Old in college, Personal/Financial advice for my situation",KickingCrave,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6rnsl1/20yearold_in_college_personalfinancial_advice_for/,"Personal background: I (M,20) come from an extremely low income family (about 17k a year) – single parent household. My mom works as a hotel maid. Father is non-existent, in addition to extended family. I also have a troublesome 12-year-old sister who’s in middle school. I am a first-generation college student. This upcoming fall semester I am going to be a junior taking 15 credit hours. I am double majoring in Computer Network Security and Spanish language.

I did well in high school and got scholarships to go to a local four-year university. Along with scholarships, I also receive government financial aid through federal and state grants. The governments financial aid alone covers my school’s tuition. The rest is refunded to me. The first two years I didn’t get as much refunded. The past semester I earned a scholarship from my honors program so I will be getting quite a bit of money, and they also pay for my books. My total refund for the whole year should be about $8,900, they give me half of it per semester, so about $4,450 in September and February. 

My university is about a 40-minute drive at best from my mom’s home. I commuted all of my sophomore year and it was too much for me. It took too much time and gas money (most of it is on the interstate). This year I will be sharing a three-bedroom place with another two friends right near the university. Once divided, rent will be cheap - $210. If you add utilities, phone and other bills I help out with at home it adds $230 (I help out with the internet bill and YMCA household membership at home). I plan to start cooking since I really want to get in shape this year, so I would expect another $130 per month I am guessing, I honestly don’t know how much to expect for food. I estimate $40 for gas. So it totals out to be about $610 a month for living expenses. I have no debt and no credit cards (although I am thinking about getting one to build credit), but also no savings. I haven’t worked much this summer because I did a study abroad program for most of it. Luckily, all my expenses were paid with scholarships as well. The little I have worked will help me get my room furnished. I already have a decent car (Toyota Scion) I bought with the past refunds. 

I have mainly worked on campus the past years as a tutor at minimum wage. I know I shouldn’t solely depend on the refund to live, I could, but I need to start saving money. However, I want to enjoy college and appreciate it while I am here. I want to get in shape for once, hang out with friends, and enjoy it. I worked an 8 to 5 office job half the summer and, although it wasn’t terribly bad, I saw a glimpse of the real world. There isn’t much time during the day, maybe I am just so accustomed to school schedule. This job let me value the college life a bit more. Before this job, during the school year, all I thought about was wanting to graduate already so I could work, be financially stable and help my mom out. However, I have begun to rethink things. I still want to be in the position to help out my mom, but I have to do with what I have now.
If you divide the refund over the course of the school year you get this (September to June):
(This is not even taking into account a part-time I’d probably get during winter break). 

$8,900/10 months = ~ $890 a month
Monthly expenses = $610
Free money to spend/save per month = $280 

I usually go home during the weekends (Fridays-Sunday, no classes on Friday) just to see how things are going. My mother and sister don’t have the best relationship. My sister is very troublesome and my mom finds a hard time with disciplining her (name-calling, yelling, along with spanking aren’t the best ways to control somebody). My sister is entering the teenage years and I want to be there to help her transition. I also help with the discipline by talking things through with my sister. 

I am debating if I should stick with an on-campus job (IT helpdesk for students) making minimum wage throughout the week, or work Fridays and Saturdays back near home who knows where. I’d prefer to choose just one, like I said, I want to enjoy my time in college and get fit. I can’t work too much on campus because I also have to fit in 6 hours of study lounge for a scholarship I received so I would only be able to work about 8-10 hours. That’d be about $280ish a month. OR, if I just worked a good shift Fridays and Saturdays I could do 16 hours a week and make about $500 a month (let’s say I get paid 8 an hour). I am kind of leaning towards the IT helpdesk on campus just to get some sort of technology related experience on my resume since it’s my major. I also hope to get an internship next summer so having that experience should help. 

I just need some guidance right now. Like I said, my dad doesn’t exist in my life and my mom can’t really give me quality feedback. I just want to make sure I’m making the best decisions in life in order to have the best future for myself. Any advice would be appreciated, both personal or financial. Thanks!"

1)	You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.

2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower. 

3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”. 

4)	A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…

5)	Private tutoring for a young girl

6)	You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….

For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. And if you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!

I'm working on an energy savings project for my engineering internship, and need to estimate the costs to insulate some equipment. We're recommending that our client insulate exposed copper pipes in an outdoor boiler area (open air, but under a roof.) I'm using RS Means to calculate the cost per linear foot, and would like to know if my estimates are reasonable.

To insulate 90 feet of 4"" dia copper hot line (160 F), material and labor add up to about $1k, does this seem correct.? This is with 1.5"" fiberglass and an ""all service jacket."" I'm also wondering if this jacket would be sufficient for the application. The average annual temperature is 60 F, and with summer highs over 100 F, and winter lows above 30F.  Should I add a more robust jacket to my estimate?

Also, there's a condensate return tank at the same site. It's a 1.5' dia, 2.5' horizontal steel tank, at about 190F. Could I insulate it with 1.5"" fiberglass and aluminum jacketing? Would 3"" Calcium Silicate block be better? Last question- would a jacket be recommended for the Calcium Silicate block?

I was honestly shocked. I couldn't believe how stoical she was and most importantly how she didn't once think to think about how she honestly was a terrible person. Whatever, I can rack up yet another success by the wonderful redditors here on r/relationships. I'll stick around here and use my experience to help others in shitty relationships.

Once again, thanks to all who pent up the courage in me to continue onwards despite a social anxiety. 

Below is the recantation of my experience and context.
______________________________________________________

Hello, r/relationships 

It is important for me to spill out a lot of what I have been going through, to seek an ends to my confusion. 

I'm currently 18, and the relationship I am currently in started one year ago. Now, despite what you think, New York's age of consent is 17. Thus, none of what I've been doing is illegal, but to some may seem rather peculiar. This, in short because the woman I have been dating is around 12 years older than me. 

I first met her when I began working as an HR Intern for a financing firm on Wall Street. It was great; the pay was amazing, the office wide and comfortable, and the working times were flexible. In short, I was finally experiencing the euphoria of what I perceived to be the ""perfect job"". There was just one issue.

I worked along side an older and attractive Asian woman in this office. She was tall, slender and as I would come to realize very smart. She had graduated from an amazing university in LA and was working full-time as a stock analyst. I never seemed to notice her until she came into the office I was working in as my superior who I was interning for was out. As we talked about setting up an appointment between her and my boss, the conversation began to shift to education, to politics, to economics. As I am thoroughly interested by these topics, I was awed by how enthused she was in talking about this. The conversation in whole probably lasted 5 minutes, but up to that point, it was the most exhilarating time of my life. 

It took around a week or two after we talked until we really began getting to know each other during a lunch break. We remarked on our similarly absent fathers, our interests, and our life events. In all, she was enticed by how intelligent I was with regards to my age. However, from this point on the situation became very strange. She started talking about how she enjoyed dating in high school and college, and how lucky I was to still reap the fruits of my youth. I was flattered by this statement, and as we talked about youth we had gone on to my SAT tutoring that I had been doing on the weekends. She said that she would be glad to tutor me on Saturday. I agreed, and she set a time at her apartment.

As I visited her apartment that Saturday, I had brought the usually school supplies and Princeton Review books I so religiously studied. However, things had gone far from studying. She began rubbing up to me and soon began touching me in my nether region. As I tried to say no, she simply kept going, and I had nothing to do but go with it. Frigid like a rock, I complied without any further resistance. That was the first time I ever had sex, and it was perturbing.

From then on, the relationship went further. She took me out on dates which she paid for, and introduced me to ""femdom BDSM"" (male submission). All of these, of course, under what I could see was her obsession with power. She always kept tabs on what I was doing, interrogating me for simply talking with another girl on Instagram. She sometimes would go very far on her BDSM sessions, inflicting legitimate pain from which she may have derived some sort of pleasure. I continued to comply, because I was socially isolated and had an unstable home life. She was like a mother figure, except very sexually exploitative and controlling.

Now, the reader is wondering ""well why don't you leave her?!"" Well, it was very simple. She paid me sporadically for staying over at her house, money I used for my leisure and at certain times for my studies. She was the one who raised my wage at my internship. She was the one who helped write my college essay, and she was the one who wrote the recommendation letter for me to go to college in LA. She knows the professors there, and she's been guiding me through the admissions process. She also gave me attention I have been lacking at school and at home, an affection I desperately needed. She had found me at a young age, when I was mentally still a kid. 

Now, I'm unsure as to what I should do. Should I leave her? How would I accomplish this? Am I simply overreacting? I'm starting to think it is likely the latter, but I'm just so confused. So many things are going through my mind right now, and I'm unsure as to how to move forward with a ""plan-of-action"".

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with a significantly older woman and I am unsure as to whether or not I should leave her or whether I am overreacting."
6rpz5f,1,2017-08-05,Paying for Master's Degree,poor_af_throwaway,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6rpz5f/paying_for_masters_degree/,"Hi all,

First time poster here. I am a recent Bachelor's graduate with a degree in computer science. This coming year, I plan on pursuing a Master's degree (also in computer science) at the same school I did my undergrad. 

Now for the bad news...To make a long story short, my family's financial situation has changed since the end of last year, and now I am solely responsible for my tuition expenses for my Master's degree. The good news is that my parents will allow me to live at home and provide food and other living expenses. 

The school I plan on attending is in-state, but is still on the order of $13,000 a semester. My Master's program is only 1 year, so I am looking at a total cost of around $25,000-26,000 total. I was offered an unsubsidized government loan for $20,000 to help cover expenses. 

However, I am hesitant to take a large chunk of this money due to the interest it would accrue over the course of this year, and that it would add significantly to the $25,000 in federal loans I already have. 

On the bright side, I am finishing up a well-paid internship this summer that will bring the total of my bank accounts to around $27,000. I also applied to some GSI positions at my school that would give me at least a partial tuition waiver, but with the school year coming up, I am pessimistic about my chances of landing one. 

So that really brings me to a few options:

1. Take the full value of the loan and keep/invest the cash for when I need to move out of state for a full time job/use it to travel after I graduate.
2. Take part of the loan and pay the rest of the tuition bill in cash. The bigger piece of advice I would need in this route is how much of the loan I should take. I am currently leaning towards this option.
3. Pay off the tuition fully in cash. This would bring my total cash reserves down to around $1000, which I can't help but think is a bad idea in case of an emergency. 


Other info:

If the GSI position doesn't work out, I plan on getting some kind of job part time, ideally something programming related. If it makes a difference, I expect to make good money out of college probably on the order of around ~$100k, especially if I get a return offer from my current internship.


So, /r/personalfinance, what would you recommend? At a crossroads here as I can see the benefit of all three options. Thanks in advance for the advice!

---

Hintergrund: In 2010 habe ich begonnen für ein Unternehmen als IT-Administrator zu arbeiten. Zuerst als studentische Hilfskraft und ab 2012 dann in Vollzeit.

Mit meinem Eintritt in die Firma habe ich einen kompletten Scherbenhaufen geerbt. Meinen Vorgänger (ebenfalls studentische Hilfskraft) habe ich nie kennengelernt und Aussagen meines Vorgesetzten zufolge, hat er ein paar Monate vor meinem Antritt abrupt die Firma verlassen. Ohne zu sehr ins technische Detail zu gehen: Alle Systeme, von den Clients über Appliances bis zu den Servern, waren in einem desolaten Zustand. Windows-Rechner mit vollen Admin-Rechten für User (und entsprechend verhunzten Betriebssystemen), von der Wand und nur noch an Netzwerk-/Stromkabeln baumelnde Geräte wie Patchfelder/Router/Switche, Windows-""Server"" mit Lizenzen aus zweifelhaften Quellen und AD-Konfigurationen aus der Hölle. Also praktisch genau das, was dabei rauskommt, wenn eine Firma schnell wächst und der Kollege aus der Buchhaltung gemeinsam mit einer Hilfskraft nebenher die IT machen muss, weil bekannt ist, dass die beiden daheim schon mal am PC Computerspiele spielen. Und wie man erahnen kann natürlich NICHTS dokumentiert und das bei teilweise bereits recht komplexen Systemen.

In den ersten paar Monaten als stud. Hilfskraft habe ich also erst mal begonnen, sämtliche Hardware zu erfassen und so weit wie möglich mit den vorhandenen Mitteln auf Vordermann zu bringen, die Netzwerk-Topologie aller Standorte aufzudröseln und mich in die mir unbekannten Systeme einzuarbeiten. Nach ca. anderthalb Jahren habe ich es dann geschafft, dass aus dem Scherbenhaufen so langsam aber sicher wieder ein vorzeigbares Glashaus wurde. Weiterhin fragil, aber immerhin halbwegs schnell zu fixen, wenn was ist.

Mit dem Übergang zur Vollzeitstelle konnte ich vieles allmählich in eine ""richtige"" Infrastruktur umwandeln (kritische Hardware an den Standorten in 19""-Schränke, USVs zur Absicherung der Komponenten, WAN-Failover, Implementierung von Backup-Routinen, Austausch veralteter Client-Hardware, Aktualisierung und sichere Konfiguration der Betriebssysteme, zentrales Patchmanagement und Software-Deployment, Upgrade der Hardware und Software der Server ohne legacy Abhängigkeiten, Aufbau eines konformen ADs über mehrere Standorte hinweg usw.). Seit meinem Beginn in der Firma hat sich die Größe des Unternehmens in etwa vervierfacht und dementsprechend ist auch die IT mitgewachsen und die Anforderungen sind gestiegen (Terminalserver, VPNs zwischen den Standorten, neue zentrale Telefonanlage, RoadWarrior- und BYOD-Integration, SharePoint, etc.).

Problem: Leider gab es personell kaum Veränderungen. Mit dem Abschluss meines Studiums bin ich seit 2012 also praktisch 24/7 für die Firma im Einsatz. Mein letzter Urlaub mit einer Woche am Stück ohne vorzeitige Abkommandierung war im Frühjahr 2014. Seither hatte ich keinen längeren Urlaub mehr und mir wurden nach Jahresabschluss immer die restlichen Urlaubstage (insgesamt 20 / Jahr) gemeinsam mit den angehäuften Überstunden (durchschnittlich 150-200 / Jahr) ausgezahlt.

Mittlerweile hat sich auch ein gewisses Anspruchsdenken breit gemacht, was sich vermutlich kaum noch wieder abwenden lässt, woran ich aber auch selber Schuld bin. Extrembeispiel: Irgendwann im Juni 2014 rief mich der Geschäftsführer an einem Sonntag um ca. 2:30 in der Nacht an, als er aus seinem Urlaub zurückkam. Er hätte sein Arbeitsgerät (Notebook) mitgenommen und es am Strand liegen gelassen, wodurch Sand und Wasser eingedrungen wären und nun starte es nicht mehr. Wenn ich Zeit hätte, könnte ich jetzt gerne direkt bei ihm daheim vorbeikommen, um es abzuholen und zu reparieren, damit er am Dienstag wieder arbeiten kann. Ich könnte es aber natürlich auch am Montag abholen (war ein Feiertag, Pfingsten oder so), wenn das besser passe. Bin dann am Montag früh hingefahren und hab es vor Ort repariert, weil es glücklicherweise nur eine Kleinigkeit war. Der traurige Höhepunkt war allerdings aber Heiligabend 2016, als gleichzeitig in einem uralten, noch nicht ausgetauschten Server zwei Platten abgeraucht sind und das darauf laufende Raid in Mitleidenschaft gezogen haben, was ich mühselig bis spät in die Nacht wiederherstellen musste.

Februar, April und Juli 2017 sind drei unserer Standorte in Deutschland in größere Geschäftsräume gewechselt und bei allen drei Umzügen war ich eingespannt (nicht nur bzgl. IT), so dass ich jetzt in 2017 schon knapp vor 200 Überstunden stehe. Auch wieder ohne zwischendurch einen einzigen Urlaubstag gehabt zu haben. Mehrmals hatte ich meinem Vorgesetzten in den letzten Tagen zu verstehen gegeben, dass ich in der Form nicht mehr lange weitermachen kann und dringend mindestens eine Woche am Stück eine Auszeit benötige um mich nach den ganzen Jahren mal wieder sammeln zu können. Gestern hat sich dieser dann spontan für 6 Wochen in den Urlaub verabschiedet und mir als Sahnehäubchen einen Wust an Kleinkram-Tickets übertragen, die er eigentlich schon seit Wochen erledigen wollte.

---

Kurzum ohne es allzusehr dramatisieren zu wollen: Ich weiß nicht, ob ich die kommenden 6 Wochen ohne eine Notbremse überstehen kann. Ich habe die Befürchtung, dass mein Limit so langsam erreicht ist.

Da ich bisher noch keinen Krankheitstag hatte, weiß ich gar nicht so recht, was ich überhaupt machen müsste, sollte ich mich entscheiden, mir eine Auszeit verordnen zu lassen. In meinem Arbeitsvertrag steht nur, dass man beim ersten Tag der Krankheit den Arbeitgeber informieren muss. Im Internet konnte ich auch ein paar Informationen finden, die aber zum Teil widersprüchlich sind, da vieles wohl auch individuell geregelt ist. Hier also ein paar Fragen, bevor ich etwas falsch mache:

- Muss man den Arbeitgeber persönlich informieren oder reicht ein Anruf oder eine E-Mail?

Ungern würde ich durch die Firma stapfen und wen auch immer dort persönlich informieren, dass ich erst mal nicht mehr kommen kann, obwohl ich ja bereits da bin.

- Wen muss ich informieren?

Da mein Vorgesetzter nun selber in Urlaub ist, fällt dieser schon mal weg. Vermutlich dann seinen Vorgesetzten, oder direkt die Buchhaltung? Oder gleich die Geschäftsführung?

- Bekommt man beim Arzt einen Nachweis über die nötige Pause? 

Es gibt wohl diesen ""gelben Zettel""...bekommt man den auch bei meinem ""Problem""? Es ist ja nicht so, dass ich ansteckend wäre oder mobil verhindert (Beide Beine gebrochen oder so)...ich bin halt einfach geistig ziemlich am Ende, befürchte ich. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich trotz Schlaf kaum noch richtig schlafe und stehe jeden morgen wie gerädert auf. Ein Symptom, was mich ziemlich bedrückt: Die Arbeit macht mir zwar generell noch Spaß, aber ich glaube, ich habe die Lust an so ziemlich allem anderen verloren, was mir früher außerhalb des Jobs mal Spaß gemacht hat. Wahrscheinlich mangels Partizipation.

- Der ""gelbe Zettel"" ginge dann an den Arbeitgeber?

Falls ja, ebenfalls am ersten Tag? Und muss dieser persönlich übergeben werden, oder kann man den in den Briefkasten werfen? Selbes Problem wie oben geschildert: Wenn ich den Zettel persönlich übergeben kann, was würde mich dann davon abhalten arbeiten zu gehen?

- Kann mir mein Arbeitgeber einen Strick aus der ""Krankheit"" drehen?

Da auch mein Vorgesetzter nicht anwesend ist (nicht, dass er sich sonderlich mit den Systemen auskennen würde), wäre so gesehen dann intern niemand mehr da, der im Ernstfall was fixen kann. Ich habe zwar so weit es geht alles minutiös dokumentiert und Notfallprotokolle aufgesetzt, aber eine externe Person müsste sich vermutlich selbst auch erst mal einlesen, was dann Zeit kostet. Sollte ein betriebskritisches System genau in meiner Abwesenheit ausfallen, kann ich dann persönlich finanziell verantwortlich gemacht werden für den Schaden, der bis zur Behebung des Problems entsteht? Oder wäre die fristlose Kündigung das maximale Mittel?

Wenn jemand konkrete Anwtorten auf die Fragen hätte, wäre mir sehr geholfen. Vielen Dank."

Part I

“I know you must have told your story to many other therapists before, but I would like to hear it too - from your own perspective. What do you think has happened that brought you here?”

This was true. During the short time I had been here, she was the fifth therapist who came to see me. The first one had been Bob - a fresh graduate or an intern, I am sure. He was obviously new to the entire therapy thing and I am pretty sure that during those first sessions I had helped him more than he had been able to help me. After that, it got better quickly. The other therapists had been way more professional. Well, as professional as you can be, talking to a crazy person.

“With the death of one of my younger twin brothers and the attempted suicide of the other, I've had a lot to deal with, a lot to reconcile. I don't remember clearly but the events on September 11th must've been the catalyst for something inside me to snap. I started making up stories for attention,"" I echoed what one of my previous therapists, Cassandra, had told my parents. Cassandra had been my favourite. She was an older woman. She was kind, but also brutally honest.

Amanda looked confused by my answer. She awkwardly adjusted her position in her chair, placing one leg over the other while still balancing her notebook in her lap. She scratched the back of her head, saying: ""Very good, Elly, but uh, that is not really your perspective, is it?""

""What do you want me to say? This is the best explanation I've heard thus far. And it's the only one that makes sense,"" I replied. What was she getting at? The previous therapists would have applauded me for an answer like that.

""Fair enough. Maybe I should reword my question: what did you experience before coming here?""

Does she really want to hear the crazy side of my story? Oh well, might as well. I have been telling that story over and over. It had become a well-practised story.

""We were going to go out for dinner that night, celebrating. You see, Abel had just returned home from mental care three months before and our parents had promised that we would celebrate every milestone we would come across without a relapse - 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months. This would be the fifth time we'd celebrate.

Everyone was in a good mood because of this, and busy preparing to leave when Dad turned on the television for just a bit. He's got a fair few habits and watching the news every night is one of them. Usually, he'd watch at eight. But because we'd be out by then, the six o'clock news would have to do.

On the news, they reported on something terrible that had happened across the Atlantic. A few hours before, a commercial plane had crashed into the Southern Tower of the World Trade Center in New York. Dad was staring at the television in disbelief, finding it difficult to accept the gravity of the situation for the people involved.""

""A terrible accident, indeed,"" Amanda commented. It seemed that her mind wandered for just a bit. With just over a thousand casualties, it was the worst plane crash the world had ever seen. There were even rumours about it being a terrorist attack, although that was never proven. The horrors of people jumping from the tower to save themselves from the fire into the merciless concrete pavement or those burnt alive or buried in rubble had been on the news for weeks. Those images must've made an impression on her, too.

""After Abel and Mom had joined him on the couch, I must've made an audible sigh, because Dad looked back at me as if I was being disrespectful. I wasn't disrespectful, but sad as I realized that this was not going to be a fun night out after all. I had looked forward to that night, but it became clear that we were not going anywhere.

I felt a bit angry about that, but it was an anger that kept whirling around inside of me, as I didn't have anyone to direct my anger towards. It would've been selfish to be angry at anyone in particular over such tragedy. My attention should've been with the victims and those who survived them, but it wasn't.

Disappointed, I decided to retreat into the bathroom. I had put on some makeup before and I figured I might as well remove it right away, as I probably wouldn't feel like doing it later. I had learned to use baby wipes to remove my makeup. That's easy enough.

As I was carefully wiping the makeup off of my cheeks, I took a good look in the mirror, making sure I removed all of it. Though something in the mirror surprised me, it was as if I looked angrier than I felt. My mirror image had this dark look on her face. To my surprise, I could see her facial muscles grow tenser. I held my hand to my face to double check, but my face didn't feel tense at all. My cheeks and my eyebrows felt relaxed like a surprised face should feel.

Then all of a sudden, the reality I had always taken for granted seemed uncertain. For as I looked back at the mirror, I realized my mirror image wasn't looking back at me. She was not looking back at me at all. In one furious move, her arm swung down at the sink, launching a pot of gel and a deodorant container into the air. In the same motion, she stormed out of the bathroom.

Except for my own terrified shriek, it was eerily silent. It felt so surreal. What my eyes had seen couldn't be true. This couldn't be happening!

But the gel and deodorant had never moved. I was trying hard to convince myself that I was imagining things. Trying so hard to tell myself that what I'd seen was impossible, could never happen.

However, the evidence to the contrary was right there in front of me: a mirror of the bathroom wall, the shower curtains and the edge of the tub on which I sat. But not me.""

A part of that same defeated feeling of complete uncertainty that I had felt then came back to me. Every time I told this story, I felt a little bit like back when my worldview had been shattered. It is the most uncomfortable feeling imaginable when everything you have ever learned is suddenly betrayed by a single, unmistakable truth. Either all of what I thought I knew of the world was wrong or my very own eyes were not as trustworthy as I had thought them to be.

What feels even worse is when this feeling is ridiculed. When I told this story to my first therapist for the first time, I was bluntly laughed at. Bob had shown to be a novice in many ways, but this one had taken the cake. Luckily for me, it was not without consequence, as it also marked the last session I had had with Bob.

The other therapists had all tried their best to sound like they understood, but this time seemed different. Amanda looked pale after she had heard my story. She was nervously though elegantly moving her pen between her fingers as she tried to come up with the right words to say. She took her time to find them.

After what seemed like a full minute, she said: ""This may not be what you want to hear right now, but you're not crazy.""

This was certainly unexpected. What was she getting at? All of the other therapists had spent hours convincing me I was and now she is telling me the opposite? What a cruel game!

""You were simply unfortunate enough to be the first to see it. Back then nobody else had, so there was no one there who could understand.

Since you were in here the past few weeks, you may not have noticed. But the world has gone a little crazy lately.

You may have been the first to see something odd happen in the mirror, but you were certainly not the last. In the first few weeks after the accident at the former Twin Towers, we had more reports coming in of people seeing weird things in their mirrors from all over the city. Then it spread very quickly. Within a month, it was world wide.""

""But, how?"" I replied. Certainly, accepting that I was mad had been the easier explanation. That most uncomfortable feeling was settling back in, perhaps making a permanent stay this time, as I had no excuses left with which to reason it away.

""Sadly, we don't know. Society became unhinged for a bit, which prevented a serious discussion. But as everybody started to calm down recently, more useful information has come to light.

Nothing truly bad has happened yet. It's as if our mirror images have gotten a will of their own, but they appear to be quite reasonable people. They've experienced pretty much the same. To them, it's like *we* have come to life.

You see? The entire world has seen what you've seen. You are not the only one, you were only the first.""

Part II

I had only been in for a month and a half, but still returning home took some getting used to. Perhaps I was different now, but home had changed, too. For one, all of the mirrors had left the house. All but one was our parents' compromise. My mother feared the mirrors, she blamed them for my visiting the mental hospital and would not stand to look at one without her reflection looking back at her. In fact, she wouldn't speak of it - she was in full denial.

My father was more curious, hence one mirror survived in the attic. This is where he could be found as well, studying the thing. I decided I was rather curious than scared, so I visited him up there.

As I walked over, I noticed that he had stood the bathroom mirror up straight, against the wall. He sat in front of it with markers and pieces of paper scattered all around him.

""Look, Elly! It's mirror me!"" Dad was clearly excited.

""We cannot hear each other, but we can still communicate. We can write down messages that they can read and they can do the same for us. You have to get used to reading the mirrored words, but after a bit, it's quite doable.

I just asked my mirror image where mirror Elly is at. According to him, she's sitting downstairs with mirror Mom. We've been talking about you mostly.""

It felt good seeing him like this. He had worked as a French teacher at a secondary school for as long as I could remember, despite his university background. Now he was finally challenged to flex his science muscles once again.

""We should ask him what the news is telling him in his world. Perhaps they've already learnt more than we have,"" I offered, trying to impress my dad with a clever option.

""That's a good idea. Here, you can write it down. Just grab this piece of paper here and use this marker. Write it nice and big, so that he read it well. If his eye sight is anything like mine, he could use all the help he can get in that department,"" Dad chuckled.

So I wrote down my question carefully, nice and big. But before I could finish it, my dad poked me in the arm and gestured at the mirror. I looked at him first and saw him staring. His face looked shocked, his eyes open as far as they possibly could be, his mouth open. And then I turned my head towards the mirror. For just a moment, I confused him for Abel, as many had done before me. But as a sister, you can always tell which is which.

So Abel had been telling the truth, all along. Then that meant Amanda was wrong - I was never the first to see it.

[PI] Easy Mistake, Major Fuck-Up - Worldbuilding - 2327 Words

Easy mistake, major fuck-up

Today I fucked up, badly. I'm not sure how I managed to let this happen. And I doubt me or anyone else will be able to fix it this time.

This morning, I arrived at work exactly like I would on any other day. Back then, it didn't feel like this day was going to be any different. I greeted Glitzy-1354 on the way in and signed in with his slime-checker like always. 

But when I got to my work station, I noticed it was already crowded. Despite not knowing what this was all about, I started feeling guilty-even though I wasn't even late.

I had a pretty awesome desk for a rooky. It had six screens with which to monitor my dimensions, while the desks of most rookies had a maximum of four screens. It even had the latest version mirror-manipulators, which were faster than the ones most senior employees even used.

At my workstation were Zibnur-21525 and Glotsnik-139023. Zibnur-21525 was a large one, easily over 60 centimetres, towering over Glotsnik-139023's mere 56. Even though Glotsnik-139023 was a lot older than I am, I was taller at 57 and a half. Despite that, seeing both of them at my desk made me very nervous.

As I came closer, Zibnur-21525 was the one to notice me first. He waved me over and pointed to the floor. As commanded, I sat down on the floor and prepared to hear about another one of my blunders. I bet Glotsnik-139023 secretly enjoyed reprimanding me.

But neither Zibnur-21525's nor Glotsnik-139023's face showed any sign of anger or disappointment. Rather - and much more unsettlingly - their faces showed fear and despair. They seemed unnerved and were clearly not at ease. As if they had something difficult to tell. Then finally, Zibnur-21525 opened up.

""I don't understand. I really don't."" He looked at Glotsnik-139023 before he continued. ""We really tried to make this work, didn't we? We gave you the best tools that were available and the easiest dimensions to manage. But still, you managed to lose control. And you did so in spectacular fashion, I might add."" 

Glotsnik-139023 nodded in agreement. I felt like saying something, but I knew a wise slug would keep it to himself, so I kept quiet.

""Just because you had the easiest dimensions doesn't mean they weren't important. In fact, you had the human dimensions to manage. Humans are not nearly as perceptive as the other prime species, which is why we trusted you with these dimensions.

But the human dimensions are also immensely valuable to us. You must know this. They gave us some of the most important gifts we'd ever gotten out of the mirror dimensions: the gift of written language and their brilliant ideas for measuring time, to name but a few.

But you still let their dimensions desynchronize. Preventing that is the most important thing you were hired to do. How could you let that happen?""

""I don't know!"" I stammered. ""One day their dimensions simply started desynchronizing...""

It had started with a few small differences in dimension Beta-2, small enough that I thought their universe would easily self-correct, as it had done numerous times before. But the changes kept coming more quickly than the universe's self-correcting system could keep up with. Before I knew it, major events were being altered.

I had heard stories of dimensions becoming self-aware before, but in reality, even small desyncs were rare. So there was hardly anyone around who believed that it was actually possible.

""The first major event I noticed was one of their world's leaders signing an agreement on climate change that he didn't sign in any of the other dimensions. 

Then an oil tanker curiously escaped running aground in the Galapagos Islands, leaving this dimension's environment better off than the others.

What followed was the world's most traumatic terrorist attack, in which several hijacked planes crashed into important buildings. Yet in this dimension, only a single plane got hijacked and crashed into a single building. The casualties were plenty, but much fewer than in the other dimensions. This lack of casualties made quite a ripple, and increased desynchronization.

At this point, the universe's self-correcting systems were running overdrive. Luckily the universe was helped by the humans' lack of perceptiveness. For the first few months, they simply didn't see that they had desynched. And those that did see, were declared insane and hospitalized. So I still had hope that the dimensions would resynchronize.""

In the other dimensions, the terrorist attacks had led to a full-scale war that would end up costing the lives of millions. But in this dimension the plane crash was never identified as a terrorist attack, so war was avoided. This led to a ripple effect so strong that the universe could no longer keep up. The humans finally realized that mirrors did not reflect light from their own dimension on a massive scale.

At this point, I didn't know what to do. But I was also afraid to speak up about my failure to fix it, so I crossed my tentacles and hoped for the best.

Zibnur-21525 and Glotsnik-139023 were dumbfounded and stared at me for what seemed like ages before Zibnur-21525 angrily concluded that I should go home. He said that it was probably for the best if I was not around while they were searching for answers. Glotsnik-139023 nodded in agreement.

Despite not having the faintest idea why things went sour, I felt like a complete failure. I knew this would cost us dearly. 

I didn't work at a general food plant or a random gravity stabilizer where your mistakes could be made up for by someone else doing a better job. I worked at a mirror facility, where we would constantly monitor and learn from other dimensions. It's the single biggest source of innovation we have. Most employees monitor dozens of mirror dimensions at the same time.

We hadn't always been so technologically advanced as a species. Years ago, we were simply surviving on a lone and unhospitable hunk of rock, slowly orbiting a massive star until the day of the Genisis Event. 

On that day all of a sudden our rock cracked open and tore into a thousand pieces. The rock fragments shot out into space before being halted all after just a split second. At the centre of where our rock used to be, a big shiny, spiky piece of metal had appeared. Big bolts of lightning continuously ran over its surface, temporarily blackening the shiny metal wherever they went.

Miraculously every single slug had survived, but our species now found themselves living in a vastly different place. Although our rock had shattered into many pieces, they were no longer floating apart - as if they were stuck in space. Luckily this gravity anomaly also meant that travel to the other fragments was as easy as taking a small leap. For the slugs that lived back then, this took some getting used to. But in time, we evolved to the point where this was easy for us. Also - and much to our own delight - we'd grown to be a lot bigger thanks to the new gravity situation we now found ourselves in.

Quickly after that, my ancestors discovered that the shiny object was a window into other dimensions, showing us many worlds in which we could monitor other species living on other planets. This discovery marked the start of our civilization and catapulted us into an era of technological bliss. 

From the other dimensions, we'd learn that most species were much more numerous and inventive than we were. Although this disappointed some of us initially, we decided to embrace this knowledge and learn from the other species as much as we possibly could.

Skip forward a few generations and here I am, living in a completely different environment, blessed by all sorts of crazy technology we'd never have been able to come up with ourselves.

We learned to recreate the mirror metal and manipulate the mirror projections. Discovering new dimensions became a full-time job for some. Monitoring and caring for the other dimensions became a task for others. 

I wanted to monitor other dimensions since I was but a small slug. It was the highest honour one could have to discover new technologies or brilliant ideas in the other dimensions and this job presented the perfect opportunity to do just that.

One of the most important things we discovered was that while we were able to monitor dimensions that were very different from ours, hardly any other dimensions had discovered this. Most dimensions had never discovered the true nature of mirror reflections. You see, mirrors don't simply reflect light so that you can see yourself. Instead, they are windows that let in light from another dimension, typically one of the closest ones.

While many slugs ridicule the other species for not noticing, I don't blame them. Dimensions that are similar tend to gravitate closer to each other. The light that mirrors emit comes from dimensions so similar that it might as well have been a reflection. At least, that's my theory.

In most cases, this holds true. There are, however, exceptions. Sometimes in small ways, close dimensions diverge. In one dimension, a squirrel will drop one of its acorns. In the other, it will hold on to all of them. Usually, the universe has his ways of self-correcting. The dropped acorn may not be the difference between life and death for the squirrel. Or perhaps it's snatched up by another creature and never get the chance to grow into a tree.

But every once in a while, the butterfly effect may set in. Perhaps the acorn does reach the ground and grows into a tall tree. That tree may then one day provide shelter from the rain for a fox that would have died otherwise. Then the fox may kill a chicken that had a crucial place in the local village's food supply and cause more people to die from the plague than in the other dimensions. Then their families and ancestors will have the opportunity to look into a mirror that reveals a world where those people have never existed.

Obviously that last bit was a little annoying. When a dimension becomes aware of the reality of mirrors, that can make it difficult for us to learn from them. And once one mirror dimension discovers, they might try to communicate with the other dimensions, setting off a ripple effect that might affect thousands of dimensions down the line. It was best if they were kept in the dark. Best for us, at any rate.

So that's why my job was not just monitoring dimensions, but also keeping them synchronized. That part was usually easy, because the universe was on our side, pushing the dimensions to stay in sync. But you had to keep your eyestalks out for the butterfly effect. The earlier you nipped them in the bud, the better. You had to get to the source of the butterfly effect though. Otherwise, it would simply keep going. 

And that´s where I went wrong with this dimension. I was never able to found the source of it. I had narrowed it down to this single city by the sea where people kept getting locked up in mental hospitals that weren´t supposed to be. They all reported seeing something strange in the mirror, like their mirror image attacking them or walking out of the frame, disappearing completely.

This wasn´t the first time this had happened, but I was always able to help the universe self-correct by manipulating the mirror images. We are not able to physically go to these dimensions through their mirrors, but by carefully ""changing the channel"", if you will, we could at least help nudge the dimension back into synchronization. It would take a lot of effort and planning but with these very simple manipulations, you could use the butterfly effect to your advantage.

Later that day, Zibnur-21525 came over to my place. He looked quite happy when he slid into my room, but I curled up into a small hump of slug, fearing for my job.

""You gave us quite a scare today! But I am happy to tell you that the damage has been contained. We had to put 4 dimensions in quarantine, but if it hadn't been for your efforts, we would have had to quarantine many more. This desync was a nasty one,"" he explained.

""Did you find the source?"" I said as my eyestalks rose sky-high in anticipation.

""Yes! And I must apologize. I sent you home in anger this morning because I thought you had been lazy in monitoring your dimensions.

But after we had quarantined the affected dimensions, we looked back at our recordings and found the opposite to be true. You really went above and beyond to try and save your dimensions, and when we discovered where the desynch originated, there wasn't really anything left to blame you for.

You see, we had to draw on colleagues from several departments to find the source. In the end, it was Zickin-1120421 from New World Discovery who got the right idea. As it turns out, these two brothers in Amsterdam were both struck with a rare fever at the same time and one of them died from the effects, contrary to what the doctors had anticipated. What everyone else had missed, however, was that in the trouble dimension, the other one had died,"" he explained, as he patted me on my head.

He continued: ""Those humans all look the same, and then you had to deal with twins..."""
6rs2iq,2,2017-08-05,"Took a break in between studying, worried about losing all the information",Lizbeth0,Mcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/6rs2iq/took_a_break_in_between_studying_worried_about/,"Hi! I've been studying for the mcat since January (testing 8/24), but my situation is a little weird. I started taking the Princeton review class in January, but aside from doing some practice outside of class and going to the classes, I didn't have time with my schoolwork to do a lot of extra passage work. Summer started in early May for me, and I was studying 6-8 hours a day, doing Princeton review passage work (since that was what was available to me from doing the class). I was planning on taking the June 17th exam.

Come exam day, and I get incredibly bad test anxiety, get absolutely no sleep, as well as getting some really bad family news. I ended up not sitting the exam (yes, I know it was stupid but in the heat of the moment, I just couldn't get myself to take it). I decided to try and take it at the end of the summer, because frankly I just want to be done with this thing and don't want to be dragging it into the school year. 

Now the problem is a week later, I went to Japan for a research internship for 6 weeks. As you can imagine, I barely studied. I continued doing anki, but dropped off on that the last week or so, and tried to do 5 passages a day, but even couldn't manage to do that. I prioritized being in Japan and doing my internship well over mcat. 

I just got back yesterday from Japan and am back to a 8-9 hours a day study schedule. But I'm terrified that I've lost a lot of the information, and that I basically screwed myself over but not sucking it up and taking the exam in June like I had planned. 

A bit about my scores and score goals:

Goal: 515+
Scores on practice tests: (although now feeling like they might be moot because it's been so long) 

TPR 1: 499
TPR 2: 504
TPR 3: 507
TPR 4: 510
TPR 5: 509
TPR 6: 513

SB: (C/P: 78%/ B/B: 67%/ P/P: 76%) 

AAMC FL1: 517
AAMC FL2: 518

Also, since I've already taken the FL's, how should I interpret scores when I retake them? 

In general, I'm mainly looking for advice on how to proceed study-wise, how to evaluate where I actually am now after this break, and whether I can really catch up to where I was before in 19 days. 

Also as a side note: to those of you who ended up getting like no sleep (&lt;4 hours or so) the night before the MCAT, how did you score? Did you feel like you still could perform well because of the practice even though you were sleep-deprived? I can't guarantee that I won't have the same sleep issues (rather, I probably will) this time again, and again I'm worried that will drastically affect my score. 

Sorry for the long post, I just feel really anxious and scared about this and would really appreciate some input. I've been a lurker for a few months, and this is my first post, so please let me know if I did anything wrong lol. 

Thanks! "

I knew she was in love with me but not this much. Didn't think she'd been take thne news of me having a gf so hard. I knew she was super suicidal and unstable. but she was getting better. I've had this gf 6 months and I thought. I just thought she'd be okay if I told her I had someone now, that I was finally doing the right thing and being honesty with people for once in my life I thought she was good enough to handle it. she just said it's probably best if we don't talk anymore but if I'm ever single I can talk to her again and now htat will never happen. she' sjust gone. I was fucking sleeping when she was having her breakdown I could have been there for her I should have known she might not be okay

Edit with more info cuz I'm really really upset. She had an autistic little brother that would yell and scream all the time and physically hurt her. an abusive mother. the school system that just provided no help. She finally had an internship with this awesome artist and with helping them out with some sculptures. school was almost over she was so so so close to being done and free with everything and off living on her own away from all of this terrible Administration and mother and brother. All the stress and anxiety would have been gone if she could have just made it a few more months it's not fair"

1)	You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.

2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower. 

3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”. 

4)	A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…

5)	Private tutoring for a young girl

6)	You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….

For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. And if you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

I have been planning for her to stay with me ever since I knew I was going to have her visit. I have an internship over the summer, and between SF and Seattle I chose Seattle to make sure I could find a place where they could stay with me and also for the time where they would get a hotel when my sister arrived for it to be cheaper. But since they have gotten here I have been very stressed. The night they came she told me she was going to take a cab to my apartment since it was late at night and I had work (her idea), she couldn't really communicate with me when she got out of her flight (she doesn't know how to get connected to the airport wifi) and ended up getting to my place at 3 am (2 hours later than anticipated). I was waiting for 2 hours outside my apartment and was worried sick, so when she greeted me I was upset with the fact that she didn't try to communicate with me somehow when she landed. 


I am really happy to have her here, but I didn't anticipate how stressed I would be having to share the same space, having to go to work and also with a fresh wound of finishing things with my boyfriend a week ago. I feel like for her I needed to be very happy and grateful to see her, which I am grateful for inside, but I am just honestly feeling very down in general and I am very stressed.


Today she told me that she feels unwelcomed as soon as she got here and because how I greeted her and how I have been acting. And that she knew I was down because of the breakup, but that she felt that while my ex made mistakes and was immature I am a hard person to be with and that it'll be hard to find anybody as long as I am this way. That I should've given him more attention and not taken him for granted regardless of the circumstances, and that he really loved me and I should have not let that go (and I feel like she said this as a projection of what I am doing now to her). And that I shouldn't count on her to come to my graduation, and that I'll be single, without kids and without family. I just feel bad right now, that the two people that I loved the most just don't want anything to do with me. I forgot to put a question, but how do can I deal with her given that we will be sharing the apartment for the next 10 days, and how do I not let this just sink me into a worst state than I currently am.

My name is Liam, I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota where I studied photojournalism. I am moving to Naples for the months of September, October and November for an internship with the Naples Daily News.

I am in search of a comfortable housing situation for the duration of my time in Naples. I'm wondering if there's anyone in this subreddit who has any tips, connections, or just general information that could help me in my search? I have been added to a couple of local Facebook groups for SWFL Rentals but haven't had luck. I've also been checking Airbnb, Padmapper and Craigslist on the daily and have yet to find anything there.

Not looking for anything fancy, just a simple setup and private space that I can return to at the end of my workday. Prefer something affordable, though I understand that might not exist in Naples while things are in season. Hoping to stay in the $500-$700/month range.

If anyone can help me, it would be greatly appreciated! Hope to hear back from some people.

Thank you!"

1) First off, I noticed that you can take either MATH 1510 and MATH 1710 or MATH 1500 and MATH 1700 to satisfy the calculus requirements. Is there a big difference between these courses? Is taking one set recommended over the other in terms of how much it will help with future engineering courses? 

2) I know that there is an internship program but are there a lot of side activities available in the program such as competition opportunities, optional group activities, and clubs, basically anything that will give me relevant experience and help beef up my resume (I'm aware that experience is really much more important than the degree itself). 

3) I've also noticed that you can either finish the degree in 4 or 5 years. Are there any tangible benefits to finishing the degree in 5 years vs 4 years aside from the obvious lighter course load? What route is recommended?

4) What is the job prospect like for computer engineers in the future? I want to study computer engineering simply because I really like computers and tinkering around with electronics. However, I noticed in the engineering faculty website that the program only takes about 40 students per year yet the GPA cutoff is significantly lower than the other engineering programs. It seemed like it was really easy and far less competitive to get accepted into computer engineering. Is there a reason for this? Are students not interested because of future job prospects?

Thanks for any help!"

I'm not interested in flash trading. The goal of this project is to start generating some amount of passive income, with hopefully some day, very little overhead. Ideally, there'd be 5-6 of us participating. I am of course open to discussing a different operational structure. 

About me - Bachelors in physics crossed over to software. My day job is full-stack engineering. I've been working in the field for about a year now.

6ruqlo,2,2017-08-05,I was removed from my internship and I can't seem to understand why. What should I do? (xpost to r/LegalAdvice and r/StudentNurse),throwaway_student_RN,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/6ruqlo/i_was_removed_from_my_internship_and_i_cant_seem/,"Last week I was informed by administration that I was reported for ""unprofessional behavior"" by my preceptor at the OBGYN unit where I was doing my capstone. Additionally, the preceptor stated that I was ""bragging"" about my performance during school and my post-grad employment. My program requires that the clinical instructor and preceptor meet and discuss my progress. At my last review, I was given excellent marks and my preceptor stated that I am doing ""exemplary work"". 

I am unsure what transpired between that review and now, but my preceptor has reported me to the unit and school. I have been removed from my internship and trespassed from the hospital. I am confused by this because I've never behaved unprofessionally. I take my schooling seriously - I'm finishing my program with a 4.0, for example. There have never been any accusations like this at any time in during my BSN.

The school administration is working with me to find a new placement, and appear to be as flummoxed regarding this situation as I am. However, they also stated that whether I stay in a placement is ultimately the choice of the facility. As it stands, administration feels it is likely that I will be placed into a new internship January 2018 with the next cohort of student nurses.

This removal of my internship stands to cause significant harm to my career. I am unable to graduate without meeting the required internship hours, and I am currently 48 hours short. I have a job waiting for me. I don't see this issue addressed in the [Kansas BON Legal Issues for Student Nurses](http://www.ksbn.org/forms/legal_isues_ref_packet.pdf), [KS Nurse Practice Act](http://www.ksbn.org/npa/npa.pdf), or [Kansas Association of Nursing Students](http://www.kansasnursingstudents.org/).

My concern is that this has the potential to damage my professional reputation as well as create undue financial harm. If I am unable to graduate, I will be unable to be licensed or work. I need to disclose this to my future employer, which may adversely impact future opportunities with them. 

As a student nurse, do I have any rights to information regarding the specifics of why I was removed? Do I have any legal recourse? What should I be researching? Where should I be focusing my efforts? 

Has this happened to anyone? What's my best recourse?

6ruvh7,5,2017-08-05,Please Advise: Weighing the benefits and consequences of MtF transition in the tech sector,chessgeek101,transprogrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/transprogrammer/comments/6ruvh7/please_advise_weighing_the_benefits_and/,"Hi all, I think this might be one of the places where the full scope of my current dilemma could be understood, and really I just need some advice from people who've been there and done that before.

As some quick background, I'm just about to graduate from my university next year, and in the last couple weeks of an internship. I am also genetically male.

I've always felt uncomfortable with my gender (in the social sense), but never really felt viscerally uncomfortable in my own skin or felt like I was born in the wrong body - which I've heard is a good litmus test for answering the question ""am I Trans or not?"". 

Then I started cross dressing privately about a year ago, and I realized I actively *liked* how I looked in the mirror for the first time in my life. That was revolutionary, and now when I go out I feel so blasé about everything. Now that I've had a glimpse of the grass on the other side of the gender divide, my side is starting to look more and more brown.

It really does nag at me and suck so much that I'm considering transitioning, even at this relatively late juncture. My family would be surprised, but supportive. I'm blessed to not have to worry about that so much. My fiancée's family might be weirded out, and I'll have to deal with that, but that's probably out of scope for this thread.

What is most deeply concerning to me right now is my career. I'm just entering the working world, and I *need* to be certain I'm going to have a job when I graduate in May. How am I going to explain to potential employers why, say, my name has changed from what's on my birth certificate or something like that? What about past work history - what would I write on my resume to explain the situation? And how hard will it be to deal with tech-bro culture without at least passing as a tech-bro by default? 

I'm sure there are all sorts of things I haven't even thought of, so I wanted to reach out and ask; if you haven't transitioned yet, what's your rationale, and what are you most afraid of? For those of you who have transitioned, how has transitioning affected your career in the programming/software engineering world? What fears did you have pre-transition, and which of those fears were validated/invalidated by experience? 

Thanks so much, everyone. Your advice would mean a lot! "

I have suffered from severe mental illness for a long time.  Masturbation greatly aggravates this mental illness.  I had a recent breakthrough streak where my mental illness got much better.  Please pray for my on this.

Hello my friends,

I really feel like I need to share my story with you all, at least just to get some things off of my chest, and to vent some of my current frustrations.  This will likely be long, but I hope that someone will read this anyway.

I would like to preface this short autobiography by stating that I have never really been a porn addict, but for the past 6 years have been a heavy masturbation addict.  I admit to trying porn a few times, however I never really found it that pleasing.  Although it may sound strange, the vast majority of times that I masturbate is to the image of fully clothed women.  I don't know why I am seemingly so different to most other men in this respect, but I just don't find watching others have sex as pleasing as just masturbating to some beautiful and humbly dressed woman.  I wanted to say this because I want everyone else to realize that just masturbating can be just as damaging as pornography in some ways. Now to get to my story though.

I grew up a very shy and reserved kid, even before I discovered masturbation.  I was even pretty socially anxious beforehand as a kid, as well as having a few minor tics and a few other quirks (which only recently in my life did I discover weren't normal for people to have).  I began masturbating at around the age of 17 while going through a delayed puberty phase. So after two years of masturbation and several complete fails at trying to find a healthy relationship, I started college.  College was when my mental world started to fall apart.

It wasn't so bad at first, as in, the anxiety wasn't that much worse than what I had become so used to experiencing since my childhood.  However, as the college years went by and I still continued to masturbate, I began to find that I couldn't socially function in situations that everyone else could.  For example, I couldn't bring myself to approach a person that I needed to talk to about a $2000 scholarship.  $2000 on the line and I couldn't do it. Luckily this situation worked itself out, but still.

Fast forward to a year ago to last summer, when started to get to my lowest point (not depressed, I don't really get depressed, just so constantly overwhelmed with anxiety for seemingly days at a time).  I got an internship in a big cubical office environment.  I was a great job, however, in this cubical environment, I could hear everyone else in the office talking, phones ringing all day, and all other kinds of office noises. Now I know this doesn't seem like a big deal, but as I constantly heard the same noises all day long I would get really upset for some reason.  Even if I just heard a phone ring once an hour, I would get genuinely upset.  I would have too take several ""bathroom breaks"" in a day just to get some peace and quiet, despite the fact that it wasn't a particularly loud office environment.

At this point in my life, my anxiety and other quirks were at their worst.  I could no longer be in crowds comfortably.  My mild tics that I talked about earlier became uncontrollable maniacal laughter, and occasional fits of screaming when I know I am alone.

Now to what I am like now.  I have made some significant progress with myself recently, and a lot of it is because of NoFap.  I recently had a 39 day streak, and my mental illness was so much more manageable! Since that streak ended however, I haven't been able to get more than 3 days without fapping, and my mental illness is rearing its ugly head again.

Please pray for me. For mental illness does not have power over me.  Fear does not have power over me.  Addiction does not have power over me.  I will follow God alone.

If you read this far, thank you. Sorry I didn't mean for this to get as depressing as it did.

Stay fap free my friends.

6rwkoq,28,2017-08-06,"How many of you would join a no nonsense, remote CS club?",JWooferZ,yorku,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/6rwkoq/how_many_of_you_would_join_a_no_nonsense_remote/,"Here's a basic issue right now with the cs infrastructure for students:

1. No remote activities. It's a commuter school. I personally don't even go to half my classes and I'm nearing the end of my degree. It's also 2k17 and computer science in particular. Absolutely NOTHING forces you to be physically present anywhere to write software.

2. No ongoing projects.

3. No way for students to get hands on experience outside internships.

4. ""KEK XD LIKE US ON FACEBOOK""

5. Overemphasis on hackathons. This is 100 shades of fucking awful. A lot about software is bigger projects, long term maintainability and improving features. 36 hours just forces crunch time shittyness.

**My solution:**

1. A club focused on open sourced projects, that grows organically. The idea is having one or more developers in theird 3rd/4th (or 2nd year if they have experience) leading a project, and goons taking on subtasks until they can manage ideas of their own.

2. Remote. Everything managed on something like discord/slack for chats for discussions, git for actual code-related issues and project coordination. NO NEED TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT. Why the fuck do you need to be in the same room to code this idea is ludicruous. inb4 pair programming, agile is a management meme. You can choose to get together but the whole point is it wouldn't be necessary.

3. Monthly (or bi-monthly) presentations and conferences.

**The catch:**

1. The aim is to give real world experience, possibly produce something meaningful. This means code reviews, tests for your code, and opening yourself up to be peer reviewed. No accepting garbage. Note: This does NOT mean you have to make perfect code from the beginning, let's make that clear. A LOT Of people will be learning, and that's the point, but the ~~point~~ goal is the end product should be polished, for each feature that is delivered. You don't have to write the best code the first time, but the point is for you to learn.

2. Monthly (with some leniency during exams) progression required. People not pulling their own weight to be removed, pruned like degenerates. Relatively high standards could eventually mean this gathering of folks actually means something to someone as opposed to ""Executive VP of jibberjabber"" that doesn't do shit like our current clubs.

3. No politics. At all. Dank memes welcome. Talk of how hard you want to deepthroat bernie is not.

4. Easy to get in, hard to say: I have to state this twice, because its a rather large point. It's not running a business because there's no monetary gain, nor anything developed for anyone other than yourselves, but the only way to assure this doesn't become a ball of mud is to have some relatively strict permanence requirements. People have to give a shit about a project and not abandon it for it to grow into something.

**The why:**

1. To give the students that want to learn and contribute to open source an avenue to learn. I don't want everyone in CS to join.

2. To give you something other than ""I worked for my uncle for a few months"" on your resume after you're done school, assuming no internships. Even with internships though, employers just kind of have to take your word for it. Open source software means people can review how you code, and employers are really valuing open source in recent years.

3. To, hopefully, produce something free and open source the world can use. If you've ever used any free library, you'll realize none of it was made without the help of individuals that gave a shit to give back. That can be you.


This is just a proposal. Nothing is set in stone. I just want to spark discussion and hear the thoughts of the plebs.

May the Michkine be with you."

6rx0g8,17,2017-08-06,Kill myself to spare my family the pain of watching me fail.,KeybladesChosen,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6rx0g8/kill_myself_to_spare_my_family_the_pain_of/,"M/20, going back to college in a few weeks. My family keeps encouraging me, telling me that everything will be different this time. They are certain ill be able to make friends, stay healthy, get good grades, find internships and jobs and fend for myself. They all have so much confidence in me and I can't bear for them to see how the child they put so much hope in will turn out in 5 or 10 years.


If I kill myself now they will be sad, but they will at least be able to say I had a bright future ahead. Their faith in who I was as a person wouldn't be taken away. I probably had the potential they talk about at some point but depression has eaten away at it and left a it a hollow shell, a weak facade of the potential for a meaningful existence.

 I really dont want them to see me break down into self harm again, to watch as I piss away thousands of dollars on drugs and therapy only to never improve. I don't want them to look at me as a failure when I wash out school because of depression induced exhaustion, or when I have to be homeless because I have no friends I could share a home or apartment with. I don't want to see the look of dissapointment on their face when they finally realize they will never have grandkids because their son is a awkward loser who cant talk to girls. I don't want them to look at me when I turn into a bitter, ugly man, gaining in weight and diminishing in job options. I don't want my family to see me live out the bleak future I see for myself every time I close my eyes.


My past is so much brighter than my future. If I die now, not only will I be free from the shitshow my life is going to become, but my parents won't have to live with the guilt and shame of spawning such a disgusting parasite. I've put up a guise of competence and ambition for them for years, making them believe that I could follow through on my dreams. But the future will soon tear down that flimsy disguise. The only way to preserve it, to protect everyone's memories of me is to make sure that for me that future never arrives.

I would rather have my death be seen as a tragedy than my whole life be considered one."
6rx6ka,1,2017-08-06,Incoming College Student with Family (mother) Problems,tldrthestoryofmylife,Anger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/6rx6ka/incoming_college_student_with_family_mother/,"To start off this way, I've always seen my mom as... a genius. I don't so much idealize her for it as I do just recognize that the things I've been trying my whole life to do are ones she can do with her eyes closed. I've always given myself a bit of credit (while also working hard not to get cocky for no reason) for being better than most others at quantitative things (math, CS, physics, etc.)

I'm going into college for my freshman year in a couple weeks as a CS/Math major, with ambition to do an MS/PhD in machine learning and eventually break into the private sector as an ML engineer (translation  from nerd-speak: I like computers.) 

Like normal recent HS grads, I started smoking a ridiculous amount of weed because I was burned hard out of high school (my HS was a traumatizing hellhole where your grades defined your worth as a human being and everyone around you was an arrogant prick who would shit talk you the second you looked away to compensate for their own insecurities.) I wasn't going out of control or anything with weed either: I was smoking a lot of it, but only while working 35 hours a week on top of last couple months of HS, and only after I got into college. This was, of course, until my mom found out: she threatened to cut me off for college and throw me out of the house that second if I didn't promise never to go near weed for the rest of my life. 

As if this isn't enough, she got me an internship in her tech consulting company, and made me go to a different state (of course with the promise of a drug test when I'm back) because there's more software development work there apparently (she's one of the higher ups and is also a software developer.) 

This is where the genius part comes in. Once again, I don't mean it in an aggrandizing way: I just want to stress that she herself is so good at what she does that she's never even had to try to relate to people who don't. Unbeknownst to her, though, so am I. 

Normal college kids (who usually intern after 2-3 years IN college) would end up doing manual processing work, which, in and of itself, would turn out to be a great experience. That obviously wasn't enough for my mom, though, who expected me to be a full-stack developer the second I walked in there. No 18 y/o on the face of the earth (not about my egoism, just a fact) would be able to meet that ridiculous and asinine expectation, but against all odds, I did. I'm currently doing hardcore .NET development work to program apps that interact with backend SQL databases to run reports of aggregated document processing data (non-nerd terms: some shit that most teenagers could not begin to understand,) and even though I'm light years ahead of anyone else's fathomable expectations of me, I've only just reached mediocrity in my mom's eyes. The reason for this is simple: I might've outperformed every other teenager I've ever met, and I also might've outperformed people with Master's degrees that have been with the company for years, but I still didn't outperform my mom herself.

TL;DR: I'm not only angry, but almost anguished into a state of mental atrophy, that nothing I could possibly do will be good enough for her. As a decent human being, I would never think of resorting to violence, especially against a middle-aged woman, but when she talks about my life as if it's the product of an investment from her and the other ""generous benefactors"" of my family and expects me to give her ""deliverables"" to prove my life's worth to her every couple days, I stop thinking at all."

6ry1jq,4,2017-08-06,Overwhelmed by many regrets,Lufred,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6ry1jq/overwhelmed_by_many_regrets/,"  I'll do my best to keep it organized, even though it's a big mess in my head. Today is one of those days where i don't fell good at all. Everything i've done wrong in my life is being brought back to me by sweet brain, like the worst slide-show i can stand watching. Can't put everything, but here are the big bits.

  First, know that this is the worst of. Before that I'd like to say I've clearly done more good than bad, and all of the following stuffs make me look like a horrible person. And this is my problem, I only remember the worst, I can't help it. 

  Basically I've been making efforts in the last years (I'm approaching my 30's) to get things back on tracks. And so far it's good. But as I begin to build things than can bring me a bit of pride, I stare at the huge f**k up that those previous years have been. 

  I'm the type of guy in a group that jokes all the time. I'm appreciated, but I feel deeply ashamed about how better my friends have lived the years we call ""the best of our lives"".

  To summarize my personnality: I'm filled with good intentions, empathic. I have always been self aware I'm not the attractive type, without being repulsive. I was and still am a bit clumsy, head in the clouds, being too little self-aware, while feeling entitled. I feel entitled but I don't act like it and it is killing me.

  Now let us go for the cringe fest:


**HIGHSCHOOL**

  I'm a part of the numerous people who aren't good at dealing with heart related stuffs. Every single woman who looks at me, I have a crush on her. Had Maybe 5 crushs in highschool. I spent a year thinking about a girl day and night, still think about her sometimes, while knowing perfectly there's no way it could happen. It's not confidence problem, it's just facts and a bit of observation. And of course I faced a bit of rejection, by making it really hard for her to find any good reason to date me. I think at that time my goal was to be the best at being the worst. 


  Never had a girlfriend till I was 17 (not a big deal). Just after I got into a relationship, I went to university (French here). I didn't know what to do with my life as this question had never been central in my life. Lot of time gaming, and binge eating after school to feel the void had made me a not very cool, skinny fat, tiny manboob, joking guy. I follow my friend to another city as I'm petrified to get into real life and actualy confront it. I move in with my 6 month girlfriend. 


**UNIVERSITY**

  The relationship gets worse and worse. We can't have sex. Two years. Gonna be straighforward. She is too tight, apparently it's a condition mixed with psychological problem. Causes me to feel very bad. Cause I'm frustrated and start being a huge dick with her, a bit manipulative. Exams go, I don't work much, get fatter, don't have much purpose.

  Just before the last year of university I discover ma girlfriend cheated on me with her boss while on an internship. In a way I deserved that I guess. But man did it sting. Guy is a 43 year old, not at all attractive man. There goes my self esteem for ever.

  So last year of university is coping with previous events, and coping with a new crush from the above league.


**GOING ABROAD**

  Then after the diploma I go abroad, in London, to be alone, work a bit (nothing related to my studies, just waitering etc) finally getting independant and getting my things together. Live like a slob, but getting better, start smoking (worst idea), getting thinner (mainly not eating enough), doing tiny jobs. After 6 month work in a place with a girl I have a crush on. A big one. We finally get together. Because yes I can, I have a few qualities. (I can't even be the best at failing :D ) 

  A few days later, I'm not a virgin anymore (21). I'm on a cloud. Next days, like the stupid I am, I go on a ""how can I get cheesy and weird really fast?"" phase, and she dumps me two days later. On my birthday. Still remember it. It was at Victoria station, i don't hold anything against her, it was me. I tried to hold my tears till we said bye, and then just went on a walk home, feeling like I got stabbed. But still think I was lucky to cross her path. 

  Next day, rainy day in London, no friend around, no family, just got dumped. I've never been more alone. My mom tells me by the phone to try and buy something for myself today to cheer me up. Just went on a walk all day, feeling like shit.


  The year after I start working in a french structure, and It's a cool experience. Meet another silent crush, of course. Life can't be all good, I got to live with the repeated, prepetual stinging sensation in my heart, trying not to sink in despair while looking for sleep. Where would be the fun without it, right?

  Oh and of course, meanwhile I tried to get back at the girl I was working with. Of course after the breakup we were still working together, and I was clearly not doing well with that. Went to her place at night just to talk, got blocked by her female friends, stood outside for an hour, then went on a walk home after smashing walls. 

  So the work in the french structure goes on, i'm underpaid, exploited, but feel nice there. New girl comes in the place (let's call here Amy). We get along real good. But I don't see her as a crush.

  Meanwhile I go back to France for a few days and I meet a girl. She's cool. We got together the next time we saw each other (and we're still together). So I'm about to leave england, I'm tired of it. Thinking of going in the city where my now girlfriend (along with friends of mine) lives. Yes, there's a pattern. Exact same stuff I did for university. Before leaving, among the goodbye parties and the work parties, the new girl (Amy) flirt a bit. Party intoxicants help a bit and we make out. She is the kind of girl I couldn't dream of. Smart, funny, pretty, nice ways. And I was and still am dragging regrets of past crushes. She then offers getting a hotel room nearby. I have many regrets, but one of the things I feel good about is telling her ""no"".


**BACK HOME and CONCLUSION**

  Let's continue the regrets

  I got back to France, got into a school (shitty school) to do something else, wasting my parents' money. Two years later, fatter, with a joke diploma, worked for a year. 

  And then I decided ""I've had enough"". The job was useless, underpaid, dead end, making the world actualy worse in my opinion.

  I get back to the studies AGAIN, but to do the job I wanted to do when I was a teenager and not believing in myself. Had to get through a very hard competition to get in, nobody thought I could do it, but Hell yeah I did it, and today i'm 3 years away of practicing my dream job. Still with my girlfriend and even though I have to admit I'm questionning the relationship on a dailybasis, I love her for making me become the person I am today.

  But, I still find myself haunted by the numerous errors and cringy performances I gave over the past years, while my friends made the best out of it, traveled, fully enjoyed partying, their sex life (a lot of my frustration is linked to my appearance and the consequence it had through the years). All those things, I wanted to do but didn't.

  Being with them is quite hard sometomes, as I always have a few horrible days like this one after meeting them.

  I have a very negative view of it all, but this negative vision is what my mind assembled with my journey through life. And it's what I see when I'm not drowned in the moment.

  I've never pictured the whole journey to anyone, and I really needed to get it of my chest. Now I'm going to continue the efforts, to make any new memory worth smiling :)

6ry2om,3,2017-08-06,The Max (television show),Megan_Marie_Jones,SupersRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/6ry2om/the_max_television_show/,"The Max is a teen variety show similar in scope to The Mickey Mouse Club.  The show is produced locally in Platinum Bay, but distributed to most English-speaking markets via basic cable.  While the show was originally intended for teens, it has picked up a greater following in the tween demographic, particularly among young girls.  Each episode contains several comedic skits and celebrity interviews, separated by musical segments of the young cast performing covers of recently popular songs.  These are the fan favorites.  Many of the cast eventually go on to recording contracts, making room for new members to join.  In its three seasons, the show has featured between seven and fourteen cast members at any given time, of varying ages and talents.

**The Schedule**

Because The Max is televised year-round, filming for the show likewise continues throughout the year to keep a fresh show for each week.

Most of this filming takes place during the summer, when the show almost becomes a full-time job for the older kids, and still manages to take up a good portion of the younger kids' time. Almost all of the show's comedic segments are filmed during this time, when availability is at its highest. The studio essentially films enough skits to last almost the entire year, as well as the usual interviews and musical segments for each week's current show. Almost all of this filming occurs during the weekdays, though several of the kids come in on Saturdays to handle some of the odds and ends, like recording time or interviews that couldn't be scheduled for any other time.

During the school year, filming calms down significantly, but doesn't stop entirely. While a few of the kids have studio-appointed tutors and can remain on the set, the rest are either home-schooled, or attend formal public or private schools. Most of the filming during this time is limited to musical segments, interviews and segues. Skits are only filmed if the subject involves something in current events, which is rare since the show strives to not appear political. Weekend filming is much more common during this time, though late afternoon and early evening shoots aren't unheard of.

**The Cast**

* **Terry Jacobson (16) -** Terry is the oldest member of the show's cast, and is the heartthrob of the bunch. Like Megan, he's been there since the beginning season, but is almost ready to move on from the show, following in the footsteps of two other show alumni who have gone on to recording contracts or acting careers. Fans like to ship him with Megan, and the show does little to dissuade this idea, putting the two in scenes together and pairing them for duets. Megan isn't involved with anyone, though. Terry is one of only three members of the cast who were there since the first season, with Megan and Tia being the other two.
* **Megan Marie (15) -** See [Megan Marie Jones](https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/6rty3p/megan_marie_jones_aka_hardware/).
* **Becca Davis (14) -** Becca is the show's prima donna, believing herself to be the best singer in the entire cast. She is certainly the most vocal, acting like a spoiled brat in ways that would make the most eccentric stars seem normal. She views Megan as her chief rival, and complains openly if Megan is chosen for a role or a song that Becca felt should have been hers. Megan, on the other hand, doesn't pay Becca much mind, other than the occasional thought that pops into her head about how long Becca would be able to sit if they ever switched mothers for a day. For that matter, if Becca was much younger, Megan would probably wear her backside out herself. There has been some talk of dropping Becca from the cast when it comes time to renew the show for next year.
* **Tia Fernandez (13) -** Tia is another of the bilingual children on the cast, adding Spanish to the show's repertoire. She is also Megan's best friend on the set, and the two like to hang out between takes or out in public. They usually chat about girl stuff, since Megan knows that the younger girl wouldn't have a hope of keeping up with any kind of intellectual conversation that Megan could engage in. Despite how close they are, Megan tries very hard to maintain her identity of ""Megan Marie"" around Tia, not wanting her nerdy, smart side to come out. Along with Megan and Terry, Tia is one of the members who have been there since the first season of the show.
* **Sonny McBride (13) -** Sonny takes on the position of the cast's ""rebel"" child, taking on roles and songs with more edge than the other kids fall into. He's a talented guitarist, often performing his own music or adding accompaniment when the others are singing. If a scene calls for a ""bad boy"" type, he's usually the one thrown into the position. 
* **Jo and Carl Brown (11) -** Carl and Jo are twin brother and sister, and currently the only black kids on the cast. The two were added to the lineup in the second season, after a reduction in cast size and restructuring of the show's formula. The shift in the makeup left a racial void that the producer felt needed to be filled, so the twins were added when they stood out in auditions. Both are pushed into the hip-hop role, though Jo actively tries to break away from this stereotype to sing more mainstream pop music. Carl, on the other hand, has no issue with the music choice, listening to much rougher street music when he's not on the set.
* **Tiff Stevens (10) -** Tiff is the youngest female currently on the cast, and another new addition. She has a slight southern drawl, and leans towards pop renditions of recent country songs. She's also heavily Christian, which tends to set her apart from the rest of the cast, who are either not very strong in their beliefs or, in Megan's case, just plain atheist. The other kids like her enough to work with her, but they don't strive to spend a lot of time with her outside of work. Still, her squeaky-clean image makes her one of the poster children for the studio.
* **Brandon Cole (9) -** Brandon is the youngest, and possibly the cutest, member of the cast. While he doesn't have a strong singing voice, he's featured in many skits, and has a variety of characters that he plays regularly. He's often typecast into the ""kid brother"" role just by default, usually to either Terry or Megan's ""big bro/sis"" position. Megan loves to dote on the boy, spending time off of the set with him. He loves the attention, and Megan is one of the few people who can hold his hand without him instinctively pulling away. It might be her natural talent for babysitting, or maybe he's just sweet on her.
* **Angela Preston (19) -** Angela isn't truly a member of the actual cast, but acts as the host of the show and introduces each musical or interview segment. She never takes part in skits or musical numbers. There has been some talk from the producer of Angela moving on to another gig, and giving hosting duties to Terry and Megan in order to put more of the focus on the kids. This idea hasn't been finalized, though.

**Other Studio Characters**

* **Mr. Preston Jenkins -** Preston, or Mr. Jenkins as the kids call him, is the producer of The Max. While his influence is an ever present part of their life, they usually only see him when he visits the set or when it's time to renew their contracts. Instead, most of their contact is through emails, phone calls and text messages. He seems to take a genuine interest in the kids, offering them advice on how to further their careers. The success of his show takes top priority, though, and much of his advice is intended to further his own interests.
* **Pete Ellis -** Pete is one of the studio musicians for The Max, and Megan's favorite guitarist, much to Sonny's chagrin. He's skilled at improvisational playing, which pairs well with Megan's own musical talents.
* **Leslie Wooten -** Leslie is one of the interns in the web design department, tasked with minor jobs that the real designers on the studio's website just don't have time to do. This mostly involves posting hourly tweets of what's happening at the studio, and uploading videos of the kids to The Max's YouTube channel."

Growing up I was a troublesome kid who constantly got into trouble and didn’t make the best grades. I was also addicted to porn and video games from an early age (was exposed to porn through a friend, the advent of tube sites made it accessible when I was a teen). I’m now 22 years old and I believe I’ve made huge leaps in improving myself. I work out, have been in a couple relationships in the past, joined a college fraternity, and have a good job lined up. I’ve also made some great friends that are much more active than my past friends who were losers. With this being said I don’t feel like a dominant, assertive, and decisive man. 

I try my best to keep up with good habits; working out, waking up early, avoiding excess YouTube and porn, and remaining active in my school to name a few. I’ve have great moments in the past four years, hooking up with girls, scoring an internship, getting into my master's program, and meeting new interesting people. However my biggest problem is consistency. I find my old habits find a way to creep in sporadically, I sometimes watch too much porn, put off the gym, and in general, I’m not as assertive as I wish to be. I have a problem maintaining a connection with others and I believe it stems from my old habits. I’ve met many amazing people in the past, both girls and guys, yet I find myself drifting away from them. This is also a problem I have with girls, I have trouble maintaining a close connection with them after a period of time (usually a few months). 

My questions to you guys is, how can I push myself to shape myself into a more dominant and assertive man? Even with the successes I've had, I’m still not at the place I want to be right now. To be clear, I want to be able to connect with others (mainly girls) and keep that connection going and I want to rid myself of old shitty habits. These two flaws really drag me down and I don’t feel like I’m in control of myself most of the time.

For me it's kind of a depressing city. There are so many homeless and poor people just trying to scrape by, with there being so many people it makes you feel lonely as everyone just rushes past you, and people don't make small talk with each other. The city just seems very overhyped and I'm not sure if it's the city or just not knowing the right people in the city. "

I've had this plot kicking around for awhile and finally feel comfortable enough to share it with all of you. If you're interested, please PM me with your character idea, kinks, and limits. Any reply not containing all three will be ignored. Please be willing to write at least a paragraph per reply. Ages will be determined in PMs.

Tommy Daniels is one of the hottest young commodities in Hollywood. Despite being under 16, the actor has earned praise from A-list celebrity co-stars as being a talented professional, fun, and incredibly entertaining, Producers are lining up to cast him in movies, and Directors sing his praises. He had, by age 10, already starred in big-budget films as a main character, and doesn't seem to be stopping soon.

What no one except those around him knows is that the blond-haired and blue-eyed Tommy is a desperate, eager little bottom even in spite of his age. He goes out of his way to find at least one person to fuck him on each film he does - be they co-star or producer or director - and wins them over by indulging their darker sides: their kinks, their secret shames. He'll do anything to get the cock he's picked - and for his newest film, he's picked yours.

******

So are you a fellow young actor Tommy has set his sights on, or an older celebrity he's starring with? Perhaps you're the director or producer, or even the college intern who got stuck as Tommy's assistant. Anyone at all is welcome to be the object of the young star's attentions, and so long as you're willing to fuck him, he'll do anything you want to get your cock.

My only limits are Scat and Snuff, anything else is absolutely on the table, and kinks can be hammered out over PM. I hope to hear from you soon, APP!

Outside of Harold’s office there was bang that sounded an awful lot like gunfire. 

That was his second indication that something had gone very, very wrong. The first, of course, had been that there were people in the hall at all. It was half past twelve in the afternoon, and twelve meant lunchtime for his secretary, his interns, and most importantly his clients. He didn’t have another meeting scheduled until nearly two, and if there was anything that he had learned from his time as CEO, it was that no one was ever early for one of his meetings. 

Someone was after him again. 

Clearing his throat, he straightened his tie—more out of habit than anything—and awaited their entrance into his room. He imagined that it would be a grand affair, full of smoke and light and thinly-veiled belligerence. Smiling, he felt his pulse quicken in his chest, relishing in the feeling of having living blood before tamping it down to stoic silence once again. It would not do to get so excited now, after all. He had a reputation to maintain. Nervously, he began smoothing the wrinkles in his suit, making sure that every last thread was perfectly in place. 

In fact, he was so preoccupied with his jacket that he barely had time to dodge the bolt of light that lanced through his door, leaving much of his office in ruin. 

Snarling, hair and tie a mess, he pushed himself up from the carpet and attempted to salvage the last of his dignity. 

“That was a stupid thing to do.” Harold growled. “What if I had been an ordinary human? That blast would have ripped out my heart!” 

“Ah…but you *aren’t* human, are you?” Said a voice from behind the smoldering remains of his door. With the flutter of cloth, three figures swept into the room, faces obscured by deep rune-lined hoods. They would have looked at home performing a ritual in the dead of night, but here in the middle of Harold’s office they were almost alien in their incongruity. Behind them, lying face-down in a growing pool of blood, there was a young woman with brown mousey hair and a professional looking suit. Harold sighed. 

“Did you really have to off my secretary?” He asked. “She was good at her job, one of the rare ones that actually *tried*.”

“She was the consort of a demon, and she was in our way.” The foremost hooded figure proclaimed. “It is no trouble of ours that her life had to be ended.”

“It’s a trouble *to me!*” Harold said. “Do you have any idea how long it’s going to take for me to find someone as good as her again? Ages! It’s going to take ages!” Furious, he crossed his arms, refusing to look at the men. 

“I hardly think that now is the time to trouble yourself, Halphas. Your plans end tonight!” The man roared. He raised a hand towards Harold’s chest, palm crackling with arcane energy. 

“My plans for *what*? Giving money to orphanages? Building an honest business?” Harold asked, shuddering slightly after hearing his True Name. “That’s all I’ve done since I’ve been here!” 

“Lies. No business is honest.” The robed man retorted. 

“Honest *enough*.” Harold sighed. “Look. I have one shot—ONE shot—at not having to go back to Hell. Have you been to Hell? Not exactly somewhere I want to build a summer home. I figure I’ve been given a chance, you know? Be born again as the favorite child, work my way into the good graces of the man up top, and maybe get a chance not to be thrown into the same pot as all the other sinners. Seems like a pretty good deal to me! Then you guys come along, with your holy water and your crosses and old-world magic. Bet you even had to make some kind of pact with an Old God just to find me!”

“It was a spirit, actually.” The man said defensively. “Your old master, the one who summoned you-” 

“WHATEVER! What I’m trying to say is I’m clean.” Harold said, cutting him off with a wave of a hand. “No more sinning, no more causing problems. All I want is to be left alone.” 

“We can’t do that, Halphas. You know we can’t trust you at your word.”

Harold sighed. “Yes. I do know that. But, luckily for me, you just *killed* someone. The way I see it, I’d be doing the big man a favor by sending you to meet him.”

As one the three men raised the hands, fingers crackling with flames of power. This time, however, Harold was ready. With a motion like catching bothersome fly in midair, he snuffed out the flames with clouds of darkness that enveloped the men up to their shoulders. They roared in pain, clawing at the smoke with their free hands, but the spell resisted their every attempt to get free. 

“Wonder if he thinks Sarah’s death is ‘no trouble.’ Do you want to take bets?” Harold roared. He took one step towards the men, office shaking with his anger. Before he could cast another spell, they turned and fled, vanishing out the very door they had ruined in their entrance. 

Harold didn’t pursue them. With a sigh, he turned back to his ruined office, picking among the rubble in hopes of finding something worth saving while studiously ignoring Sarah’s fallen form.

6s02ix,2,2017-08-06,[Job Vs Degree] I completed a 2 year diploma at CC in Ontario should I go for the degree? Comp Sci,bjjprogrammer,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6s02ix/job_vs_degree_i_completed_a_2_year_diploma_at_cc/," I completed a 2 year diploma at CC in Ontario should I go for the degree?

So I will be completing a 2 year diploma in software engineering at a CC in Ontario. I have done 2 internships, one as a data scientist and will be doing another as a ASP.Net developer shortly for 4 months.

After that I can go back for a third year of school which will be 2 semesters plus another internship.

OR 

I can go to school for a degree in computer science that will take me around 3 years to complete.

Most people can get a job after just the 3 year diploma, but I am thinking about getting a degree since it will let me apply for better jobs and is valid worldwide.

Also I am 21.

What is the better route to take?


Option 1: Do a 3 year diploma (one more year I have 2 years done) and get a cushy job (I think) + one year of internship exp

Option 2: take the 2 year diploma with 8 months of work exp, than go to university and finish a degree in computer science

Whats the best path here?"

Let me add some background. I met my girlfriend early last year, and when I did, I fell in love with her personality. After months of knowing each other and working with each other in engineering, we became best friends. She was way out of my league though, and there was no way I was gonna ask her out, besides, I was worried that dating might ruin the friendship I loved so much, and I told myself I'd never ask her out for that reason.

Fast forward a bit in the future, and eventually there came a day when she seemed to be talking down about herself, she was calling herself ugly, fat, etc. That's when I complemented her for the first time and told her I thought she was cute (believe me I wanted to say more but I was incapable of doing so 😅). She really was happy when I told her that, and I started opening up a little bit more every now and then about how I felt about her. She had a lot of issues with her self-image, but I always was there to tell her she was completely wrong. Eventually, she asked me out, and at this point, I couldn't say no.

Fast forward another year, and things have been amazing, but at the same time, there were some things that were revealed to me. My girlfriend was Anorexic, which didn't come to much of a surprise, but after a while it began to affect me too, though I'm not gonna go I to that for the sake of staying on topic. It sucked.

I tried really hard though to make my girlfriend's condition better, I tried so darn hard. And it worked. Everyday she stared a little less at calorie labels, and ate a little more than 500-600 calories, eventually finally eating 3 meals a day. It was small steps, but in the end became much larger ones. It was nice seeing her happier.

The problem was when I left for a while to some internships. Things got bad. She went straight back to her old habits, and she was crying on a daily basis, constantly in pain. When I came back, things returned to normal, until I left again for a week to an internship, and once again, the same thing happened. I feel useless when I'm gone.

The part that worries me the most however is what will happen when we move on to our own schools, how will she cope with it? I can't always be with her on a daily basis, at least not on the short term. I care about our relationship, but most importantly I care about her and her health. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've become the cure to the problem she's had for so long, but the second I'm gone she relapses. I feel like she's a ticking time bomb, and if I'm not there to cut the wires,  things can go ""boom"".  Is the best hope for her to find another ""me"" when she moves on to another school?

tl;dr: When I'm gone my girlfriend relapses to Anorexia, and I don't know what to do."

I went to the baseball prospectus Q&amp;A with Thad yesterday afternoon. We ad an hour with the man himself. The first forty minutes were Aaron Gleeman asking him questions and the next 20-30 minutes was the rubes. Highlights/lowlights:

1. Reading between the lines, he made contrasting statements versus the past regime's roster decisions. 
2. Sano: Elicited laughs at Sano being in the outfield. Talked about Sano being an extremely passionate, energetic, and hard working player (not a lazy bum like Terry thought). Cited his energy as a leadership quality where other players feed off it. Said that his first conversation with Sano, he asked him if he wanted to be a mashing DH or an all around great player on both of the sides of the ball at third. Sano answered unequivocally a two-way player. Thad then said he asked him every day how he got better in the infield that day. 
2. Gene Glynn: Cited Gene Glynn about three times as the infield coordinator in helping Miguel and Jorge an average to an above average left side of the infield (my gawd did you see Jorge last night?!). Talked more about Gene than any other coach. Did not even mention Paul.
3. Analytics department: Was not willing to talk about firing Jack. They currently have four people (disappointing but improving) in the analytics department and one intern. Their most recent hire is a PhD from Canada. They plan to expand this group by four to eight additions by this time next year. He said that when they came in the infrastructure was sub-par. Loose quote: ""When you can't spend to have the best free agents on the field and you aren't spending on the infrastructure, you're going to have a sub-par team"". Said that ownership was on board with improving the infrastructure. Mentioned that they had a program in place during the draft giving probabilities on if a player would be available next round so they were able to make educated decisions on when to take guys.
5. Trading: Said that a lot of trades these days are done over text with no talking until they exchange health information. Said that teams don't trade before July is because they are still figuring out who they are. Specifically categorized teams as buyers or sellers. Said they were going after other pitchers but the prices weren't reasonable. Liked the price of Jaime because other teams in the MLB weren't willing to take on the salary so the Twins had a competitive advantage and the Pohlads were fine taking on the contract. Then, the Twins skidded and the Royals/Indians crushed. So they flipped Jaime and Kintzler for more arms. Cited that you need as many arms as possible because of injuries (look at our bullpen this season).
6. Shortstops: Specifically mentioned that people ask him if they have too many shortstops (Royce and Javier) and Thad laughs and says you can never have too many shortstops. Shortstops can move to other positions and are way better wherever they end up because of their time at shortstop. Sounded obsessed (in a good way) with the position which I loved to hear.

Overall, he was a fantastic interview and made me love him even more. I have the utmost confidence in the new front office and I think they are now going to be given the latitude to start bringing in their own guys (e.g. Jack out, area scouts fired, etc.). I'm probably forgetting some things so if anyone else would like to clarify or add on, please do!"

I am a recent college graduate with a degree in Accounting and I was hoping for some Career Help. A little background information, I plan to attend law school at the University of South Carolina, after I gain residency down there and live there for a year; however, I need to make money in the mean time to support myself and pay off some student debt so I don't graduate with $200,000 of student loans. I graduated with a 3.1 GPA, and my experience is limited to an internship that I did with my father's tax and consulting company. My father runs a small firm with him as the main preparer and one clerk and one data entry specialist and then he used me to prepare journal entries and help him prepare basic 1040s and state returns. 

I want to move to SC, but I'm struggling with the application process, because I'm not sure what jobs I'm necessarily qualified for. I feel that with my background in Accounting and since my father runs his own firm, I could be a staff accountant at many companies. (I would often be teaching other classmates that had internships/job offers at Big 4 companies in Accounting courses). However, I am concerned that my experience will not be taken seriously since the company is my father's and it is such a small firm and since my GPA wasn't stellar and I do not plan to get my CPA until at least after I complete law school.

I have a few questions that I would appreciate any help with: What sort of positions should I be searching for and would be qualified for? How should I use my experience with my father to my advantage on my resume and in interviews? 

I really appreciate any help that anyone could give me. If any of the accountants on here are from South Carolina, specifically in Columbia, I would love for the chance to network a little bit. "

I'm a long time reader and first time poster (on throwaway account). I need help because I'm at my wit's end and feeling emotional pain. I want to know...is it too late for me to have an amazing career or a top job? I'm willing to do what it takes.

Let me give you some background. Growing up, I had a rather unhappy childhood...bullied constantly at school, emotionally unavailable family, isolated, lonely...I coped with this by working hard in school and dreaming of becoming really successful. I was able to do well from elementary school through high school and got into a top public university. 

At university, because of a combination of factors I developed serious clinical depression and anxiety. I could not complete any classes, could not function, was a shell of my self. I went around seeking help but the doctors were useless. I ended up taking medical withdrawal. I was in and out of school until I was finally able to complete my degree with honors and a decent gpa at age 28 even though my transcript showed many withdraws.

Because I spent so many years nonfunctioning, I didn't have good internship experience. I managed to get a job I was at for almost two years until management bullied, harassed, then fired me. This broke me for about four years where I didn't do anything.

I then moved to a major city to find new opportunities...I did a short seasonal job at a retail store, then worked at a temp job for one year, then another temp job for almost another year. This latest temp job I was hoping I would be offered a permanent position...but it was given to someone else. I am upset about it. Now I have to look for a new job....I would like a good one. I am afraid to be unemployed for too long since the gap won't be good on my resume.

I've been so worried, so anxious, so depressed for so long. I feel like it has robbed me of my dreams. I am 37 now, I feel like I should be established, have a career....but I don't have a career or even a higher degree (only have bachelor's). I'm heartbroken about it. Without a real career, I don't feel I will be able to become the person I dream of (confident, capable, welldressed, strong etc.) or to have a lifestyle I really want (happy family, stability, travel, a lovely home.)

I didn't know where to put this...so I am asking this subreddit. Is it too late for me to have a top career? I long for it...I'll do what it takes....though I have no idea what I want to do. Despite my having to cope and manage depression, anxiety...I am still the ambitious dreamer I was years ago. I can't believe I'm 37 now without achieving anything. I wish I could turn back time to a point before the depression and anxiety stole so many years.

I'm also afraid to apply for good jobs because of my lack of experience, low self-esteem, and thinking that others won't give me an opportunity. That's why I've worked at jobs far below my capabilities.

Please help. Is it too late? What do I do? What can I do? I want a career first...so I can have the other things I dream of one day.

As a less privileged student I qualified for perkins loans during school and had stafford direct loans as an undergrad. After speaking with the free consultant from my medical school - I was advised to consolidate my 297K in loans and to apply for IBR under REPAYE to have half my interest accrual subsidized by the government.

I was wondering whether or not I should consolidate my perkins and my stafford loans - I currently earn ~60k in my intern year -however filed 0 for the 2016 year (was in school). Under the Economic Hardship Deferment - I technically qualify for a 1 year deferment of interest on those loans. 

My plan was to consolidate my 200k in unsubsizdized loans and pay under REPAYE for those - defer the perkins and direct loans - then pay under the PAYE for those 2 loans (potentially reconsolidate if possible).

Anyone have any experiences with this? Or any advice to input on this method vs consolidating the full amount?"

It's been two months for me and I'm doing better, turns out being with someone who fills their time and spends so little with you and on occasion hits you when there is a disagreement is not a healthy relationship. 

Only recently (the past 6 months) had things turned to attempting to fill her schedule past the brim and punching me. 

My question is two fold, how do I trust the next person I date to see one of their friends or text them when I didn't mind or care in my last relationship and look where that got me, and how do I get past the feeling of not wanting another relationship because of the time invested into someone to the point where I would marry (Ill advised) them just to have to start from scratch, not knowing them and them not knowing me?

I've had breakups before but I've never felt so empty.

I wanna start this off by saying I'm not saying these spoilers are true but I just want to take a second and look at them from a new perspective now that the series has ended and we've seen so many interviews.

- Wren Kingston is Charles DiLaurentis.

- He's a year older than Jason.
*Makes sense within the timeline.*

- He isn't really British.
*Interesting as this seems to be the Elliott/Archer plot but reversed. Also if you happen to wonder if Julian can do an American accent, he can!*

- He isn't really a doctor and didn't go to Oxford.
*Obviously.*

- Like we already know, he spent a big part of his life in Radley.
*Obviously.*

- Jessica DiLaurentis faked his suicide so he could leave Radley and she joined the board to cover it up. She took him out of Radley and faked the paperwork.
*Makes sense seeing as though she basically did that with Charlotte.*

- Jessica was laundering money into Radley and they paid her family off to keep silence about Charles suicide.
*Makes some sense and would explain Sasha's comments about how it's creepy how A gets their money.*

- He hates the girls because he thinks they stole Alison from him.
*Makes just as much sense as Charlotte's motive ""those bitches were happy you were gone"".*

- Maddie Ziegler is supposed to be Spencer as a kid because she was in Radley when she was young but she doesn't remember it. She had behavioral issues and the Hastings put her in Radley but ended up taking her out after realizing how awful it is.
*Makes sense seeing as though the Hastings hated Radley and would explain the creepy girl. If Jason and Alison can barely remember moments from their childhood then I'm sure they could figure out a convenient way to do the same for Spencer.*

- She also met Wren/Charles when she was there as a kid but obviously she doesn't remember it either.
*Makes more sense than her connection to Charlotte - even with being related.*

- Melissa is the Black Widow. She was kind of working with Wren/Charles because she felt guilty for killing Bethany Young when she buried her alive.
*Makes sense, it wasn't stated (to my knowledge) if she knew who A was but the 'kind of' basically says no she didn't.*

- Wren/Charles hit Alison “that night” because he thought she was CeCe. He thought CeCe had killed Bethany.
*Makes as much sense as Charlotte's motive, although timelines still messed up.*

- Wren/Charles reveals himself to Alison on Prom night after he sends her a text telling her that he's at her house.
*Makes sense considering this is basically what Charlotte did.*

- Ali thinks she killed him after they fight and he falls down the stairs, but the body disappears at the end.
*Would've been more interesting than what we received imo.*

- The last scene of 6x10/6A finale is the first scene of the time jump. The girls get back together after a few years, Aria wrote a book about their lives, and suddenly they all get a text at the same time. They look at each other and season 6A ends.
*Considering the final scene of 6A actually turned out to be a flash forward scene, I think this 'reveal' was interesting.*

- Sara is gonna run away at some point and the girls will find her at the Dollhouse. She can only sleep there because she spent years in that place. That's when Emily will tell her to go home after realizing how troubled she is.
*Would've been a much better route to send Sara's character.*

- Clark, Aria's new friend, is gay. They will submit their photos to a contest and Aria will get that internship he told her about. She's gonna win with the creepy doll photo.
*She did win also there's that gay male character the fans have been begging Marlene for.*

- Emily and Alison dance and kiss at Prom.
*Would've been better to start working on Emison here.*

- Lorenzo, Ali's new boyfriend and Toby's partner, is gonna die.
*It's almost like he did die considering they just made his character disappear after what 6x13? This would've been more thrilling.*

- What Maya Knew was Maya found a photo Jessica DiLaurentis with a baby girl and two boys. A threatened her to leave town or she would be killed - Nate actually killed her (leaker says)
*Makes sense and would've easily explained her situation and what she wanted to show Emily.*

Thoughts on all of this... be open and honest! Would you have preferred this, does it make more sense, does it clear up plot holes, etc etc :) 

Gonna make one on Daisygate next!"

1) You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.


2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower.


3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”.


4) A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…


5) Private tutoring for a young girl


6) You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….
For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. 

If you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!


I'll be at work all day so feel free to send me a message whenever.

I'm a guy, so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt, as there may be other, more sexist, issues driving why some treat you different than your male colleagues.

I haven't ever been described as 'bubbly', but I'm outgoing, I like to laugh, and tell funny stories. I'm not interested in changing those aspects of my personality, and I greatly value a work environment that allows me to be like that. Having said that, I've often wondered if I would be more respected if I were more reserved. Here's what I've found works for me.

Continue to do excellent work. Results pretty much speak for themselves, and establishes you as competent. Regardless of your personality type, being regarded as competent is the first and most necessary step.

Be assertive in asking for and taking on leadership positions, even if they are small at first. It helps if you have a mentor who can grease the skids here to get you those opportunities. This does a couple things. First, it gives you a history of managing small tasks and groups of people. Whereas you've previously established your technical competence, this allows you to establish your leadership competence. Again, think small at first. The second thing it does is gives you the chance to make tough, leadership-level decisions. The best thing I ever had to do for my career was kick someone off a project. It was hard for me, because I like being nice, but that experience taught me that leadership requires being able to do the hard, person-level things. It also showed people that while I like being nice, I am willing to make the right decision, even when it's hard, when necessary. I've been told that gained me a lot of respect.

I touched on this a little bit in the prior paragraph, but establish a relationship with a mentor who is a level or two above you on the food chain. There are two people where I work that I know I can talk to about any career concerns. I don't take up a lot of their time, but when I need something, they'll help me. In addition to providing me with great advice, they also help my reputation because people associate me (someone they may not know), with them (someone they probably know and definitely respect). Also, I have a good relationship with my mentors, so they say nice things to me to other people in leadership. Although this may be controversial, I would caution against restricting yourself to just looking for female mentors. A female mentor would be great, especially for navigating the sexism-related issues, but if there's someone where you work whose career path most closely resembles what you want yours to look like, don't shut yourself off from that opportunity just because of that person's gender (also, you can have more than one mentor). I've had both female and male mentors, and my criteria for selecting a mentor has always been whether or not I thought their experiences could help me, not what's between their legs. I only mention this because I witnessed at a prior job a group of women who would only mentor or be mentored by other women; that group became so insular that they closed themselves off from other opportunities that existed outside of their group. And finally on this note, don't wait to be approached by someone who wants to mentor you; ask! Be assertive; that speaks well for your character, and helps ensure you find someone you like.

Regarding the interns, you need to treat them differently. They aren't your peers, and shouldn't be treated as such. Not always, but oftentimes, interns assume a lower level of formality, because you're friendly, may be closer in age to them, or because it's the environment that they are used to. I have very high expectations for my interns, but I also spend a lot of time with them, trying to help them achieve it (they don't always). But I always keep a distance; sometimes that changes once they're no longer my intern, but when they are, I make expectations both high and clear.

Finally, don't change who you are. Confidence comes from being your truest self, so be that person. You don't have to be less bubbly, or tell fewer self-depreciating jokes, to have greater confidence or to succeed in the workplace. We can always improve who we are (getting better at reading a room can let us know if our self-deprecating jokes are too much, or if a more serious tone is required in specific circumstances), but you can't flip a switch and become a new person. Think of all these things as new (or improved) tools that you're adding to your toolbox, not that you're having to throw everything away and start anew."

How do I regain an identity?",spaceshipadvice,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6s5x9c/me_30_f_with_my_husband_30_m_of_5_years_if_he/,"My husband and I have been married 5 years, together for 6. 

We have two children aged 5 and 3. 

My husband is the most amazing man I've ever met. I still pinch myself, 5 years later, in disbelief that he married me and still somehow enjoys my company. 

He is an amazing father. He's been caring for them solo for 8 weeks while I came home to deal with a family matter, and hasn't once complained. The kids are very happy, he keeps them super busy--arts and crafts, games, outings, etc. He does more with them than I do when I am home. 

In fact, that could be said about basically everything my husband does. When I come home after he's watched the kids all day, the house is cleaner than when I am caring for them: laundry will be folded, he will have mopped, stuff like that. 

My family loves him. They are all so impressed by him and have been since we met. Conversely, my family has always teased me a lot and targeted me for ridicule and criticism. If you were to read this post to them they'd say I was being insufferably melodramatic about that last sentence, so maybe it's all in my head. The point is, my family breathed a big sigh of relief when I married my husband and still to this day jokingly say, ""Thank God for Husband!"" like he ""saved"" me. 

And, well, he did. 

On top of all that, I have no skills to speak of. I have very little earning potential beyond what you'd expect a waitress or something to make. I do have a 4 year degree in a field I really love, but it's not a degree that actually provides you with concrete skills that translate to an active job market. I had a great job as a research assistant while in college but unfortunately it's been about 6 years since I've used those skills and the field commonly requires people to be out in the field for days or months at a time...not conducive to having little kids. It's also not very lucrative. 

I recently started going back to school to get a certification in a field I was really passionate about. I had been employed in this field for 1.5 years right after our second child was born, and then we moved internationally so I stopped working. Anyways, I recently did an internship and realized I probably don't have what it takes to do well in this field. The professionals are absolutely awful to deal with and the lower level employees are gossipy and competitive. In any case, even if I was amazing at it my expected income for working full time would be like $27k before taxes. 

If my husband died tomorrow I have no idea what I Would do. I have no skills. I have very little useful job experience since having children. I could go into the field I'm training for and eke out a living there, but it would require long shifts of hard work. And I don't even know if I'm any good at it. 

There's no way I could manage raising my two kids and working and running a house all at the same time all by myself. My family would probably rush in to save me because they would know I couldn't do it. 

For those wondering how my husband saved me: I got knocked up by an abusive man while in college. My husband met me when my/our son was a baby, and I was living with my parents desperately trying to figure my life out. He had a career in a stable field, owned a home, etc. So he kind of swooped in and saved me from implosion I think. I am so grateful and it just goes to show what an amazing man he is. 

Basically, I feel like I have no value or identity. I have no idea what to do. I'm 30, I've got 2 kids, I look frumpy, and I have no direction in life. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm not a great worker; I waited tables briefly in college and it was an awful experience. I have ADHD (untreated) and it's just not an environment I do well in--lots to keep track of, and you have to have really thick skin to deal with people. 

I don't know....people just always seem to treat me like an idiot when I work with them. I'm starting to think I put a vibe out there, something about how I conduct myself makes people think I'm stupid? I recently had an evaluation done to finally treat my ADHD.....my IQ is high, my cognitive function in terms of reasoning is fine, so I know I'm not stupid (I was actually worried for a long time that I was). But, people just don't seem to like me very much. And I still don't have any useful skills. 

""Take up a hobby"" -- dear god I wish! We live in an awful country in the Middle East and its hella expensive to do anything. I wanted to try kite surfing or wakeboarding and to get lessons or join a club it's like $300 per session or $1k for a membership in a club. I tried finding dancing lessons, and the group instructor just left last year so the club disbanded. I like birding and am currently reaching out to some folks here to see if we can connect. Keep in mind my country is like 100% sand dunes so birding happens in a very limited number of places during only certain times of the year. I tried to join the natural history club's sea turtle program--they only do stuff during the summer when it's 120F and we are gone. 

I did get an internship opportunity, but it's a 2 hour drive to and from the facility every single day--we only have one car and I'm responsible for picking up and dropping off my kids from school. I'm trying to arrange a carpool situation so I can do this internship.

How does a person get training for a job?

  **tl;dr**: My husband supports our family in every way: emotionally and financially. Without him, I'd be totally rudderless. I have no skills. I'm trying to gain some. How do I do that?"

Since brunch about 2 months ago everything had been really quiet and normal. We'd seen SMIL several times, she'd been calm and appropriate(except for some minor Father's Day Card weirdness that I'll circle back on sometime maybe), and hadn't once brought up what her 'grandparent name' would be. 

But I wouldn't be making a post if everything *stayed* calm and boring, would I?

Last Sunday SMIL calls up my wife, saying that she wanted to have a cookout that night at her house. BIL2 was home between his internship and going back to campus, so she wanted everyone together while she had a chance. The short notice bothered me, as my Sundays are usually packed, but I knew my wife wanted to see everyone, so we made it happen. 

As soon as we show up I can tell SMIL had been drinking. Like, for a while. She welcomes us with uncomfortable long hugs (I'm not a hugger to begin with), and presents us with some books she had bought for Spawn. Nice gesture, right? Well, I open one up and she had written a lengthy note inside the front cover of each, and had signed each one *""Mama""*. 

**This bitch.**

I close the books and set them down and just sort of look at her incredulously. She could immediately tell what I was going to say, and tried to reason with me saying 'Once they're old enough to be able to read, surely they'd be able to call me Mama and not get confused'

At this point my wife was starting to get a little anxious, so I took her outside to sit on the patio with her Dad and went back inside to SMIL, where the shit hit the fucking fan. 

I told her that my child would *never* call her 'Mama'. I explicitly told her that she was being wildly inappropriate and that what she wanted didn't mean shit to me. I made it clear that if I *ever* heard her mention the subject again, refer to herself as 'Mama' in any context or medium, or even so much as complain about her stupid Grandparent Name that I'd make sure she'd never see the kid. Cue the wailing and blubbering from her, and the eyerolls from me. 

She starts off asking how I could be so cruel to even threaten that (more eyerolls), tells me it's her right to see her grandchild (step grandchild, Slagathor), and that she was going to see 'her baby' no matter what I said (yawn/laugh), then breaking down and apologizing, saying the kid could call her whatever it wanted, dont keep her from the kid, she'll do whatever I say (even more eyerolls).

She calmed down after this episode and it actually turned into a decent evening. The topic wasn't brought up again, and I still made it home in time for Game of Thrones. 

Before anyone else has the chance, let me go ahead and say that I 100% do not believe her in any possible way. Wife is on board with LC in regards to the baby, and we've already decided they'd never be with her unsupervised even *if* she calms down and stops acting like a psycho."

So this is a question that has been in the back of my head for a while. I currently work in HR at a modest sized company, I'm finishing up my B.S. in I/O, and I'm having issues with trying to decide on my master's degree plan currently. 

I graduate in December with decent grades, I've been working full time in HR for the past two years at a few companies, mostly as an intern (recruiting, Business Partner, Organizational Development, and Analyst roles). 

My biggest questions are: If I decide to take a generalist / analyst role in HR after I graduate (either where I work currently, or potentially somewhere new), compared to going straight into graduate level education, will it be difficult to transition from HR to a bit more ""focused"" I/O roles?

My main delima is trying to decide the route of going full time after my B.S. or staying as an intern where I am, taking a modest raise, and then go on and complete my Master's in a school that I have been accepted at with a good I/O program (I've been accepted but will have to reapply since I didn't finish my B.S. on time). Another thing to mention, I will plan to eventually complete my master's degree, but I would ideally like to do it a couple years down the road, after I take a bit of a break from school, and find a position where the company offers tuition reimbursement. 

Key takeaways (TLDR):

Master's vs experience in the field of HR for someone entering I/O positions.

Is moving from HR to more I/O structured positions difficult, and would I potentially be stuck in HR for my career and unable to move around?

Thanks for all the insight, would love to hear if anyone has moved from HR to I/O and vice versa!

6s7cpj,1,2017-08-07,m4f Naughty Parents and More,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6s7cpj/m4f_naughty_parents_and_more/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.


2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.


3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.


4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.


5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters.


I'm happy to substitute step-siblings or parents if your prefer to play that way."

My parents didn't want me - they made no real attempts to hide it. I had a miserable and lonely childhood - still trying to work through the emotional damage they caused me in and out of therapy. They divorced before I could talk and used me to fight each other once I was old enough to pass messages between them. When I was able to do things like get home from school on my own, cook for myself, etc. my nmom stopped coming home. She would either be at work or at the bar or out with some new boyfriend. She basically paid for me to live in a rent house alone from middle school through high school (which sounds like every kid's dream but you know how nmoms can be). Once it was time for me to start looking at colleges, I found a fine arts university in Chicago that I really wanted to attend. My nmom told me to apply, that we could take a trip out and see the school - how fun would it be for us to do that together and how great would it be if I got in? I could live my dreams the way she never could. But once it came time to visit the campus - *""Well I never said we would do that, what makes you think we could afford for you to go to some fancy school like that anyways? No. Absolutely not.""* I was crushed and thought the only thing left for me to do was to apply for a lesser art school in Texas, so I could live with my aunt and not have to rack up extreme fees for my nmom. I'm thinking... She's my mother, she wants to help me be successful and college is part of that so of course she would pay for it! And better yet, lets put all the loans in my name only because she said that when she pays it off, I'll have great credit! What could go wrong?? So I go to this school, and after a year of working my ass off and putting in long hours and getting good grades I realize that.... people who go here aren't getting jobs when they graduate. I wasn't going to get the internship or the freelance opportunities I was promised when I enrolled, this is a scam and I don't want to waste my nmom's money and my time. So I tell her that and she goes wild saying I'm a liar and that I just want to quit school so if I leave, she's not paying for anything! So after talking it over with other people in my family, trying to reason with my nmom, and finally deciding I should just do what's best for me for once - I decided to leave the school. I got ""cut off"" because I'm a liar. I found out that there were class action law suits against the school - i told my nmom this but it wasn't enough. *I was a liar and if I would have just stuck with it I would have a job and no debt. What a mess I made for myself.* So she ignored me and my debt. I've been working restaurant jobs ever since, making just enough money to scrape by - but not enough for these loan payments. She has known that but refuses to help me even though the only reason I went to that damn school was because of her promise to pay it off. I don't want to go back to school because as long as this debt is there - I can't get financial aid. I don't want to take out more loans because I already feel like I'm drowning in debt. My nmom likes to rub it in how broke I am and how I depend on her for everything (which isn't true - I've been financially independent for years - she pays my car insurance because with her old plan it's cheaper for her to have multiple cars insured than it would be for just her... I don't exactly know how that works but that's what she says and nmom's word is as good as gold). So I get a letter from the Department of Education breaking down my debts and saying ""hey... pay this or it's going to get serious"" So I sent her a text saying that this is out of hand and that we need to make a plan. She tells me to go get a real job and figure it out myself. I decided to stand up for myself for the first time, maybe ever and said ""hey no, you said you were going to pay this. You put me in this position and I think you need to do something about this"" and of course it's not her fault, *it's my piece of shit father who won't do his part! It's the fact that I don't work as a receptionist for $12/hour (Even though she knows I make more money waiting tables than I would sitting at a desk)! It's everyone's fault but hers and she's sorry I feel like she's lying to me because she's only ever tried to help me. She would never lie to me. She has never lied to me. Everyone else is responsible except her and she can't believe that I feel this way* I'm trying to stay calm and list the facts - she changes the subject completely and tells me that she's going into the heart hospital for tests and asks if she needs to list someone else as her contact. She does this when she knows she's losing. She does this to change the subject and hurt me. So we talked about her and her shortness of breath instead of my actual problem. I can't live like this anymore. She's made the first 1/3 of my life miserable... I want to go NC and will be figuring out a way to do that.  "
6s7ja1,5,2017-08-07,Does he [26] want more with me [21] or no?,Xxcoolcurl,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6s7ja1/does_he_26_want_more_with_me_21_or_no/,"So theres this guy, and we met through my internship. He's from a different country, and I'm from the USA, but hes got an internship here for a longer time than me. Hes gonna be here for his internship in my hometown for a year and im going back to my last year of school this Sunday.

But let me give some bg. So ironically we were both visiting another city the same weekend a weekend ago, and agreed we'd meet up if we were free. So that Saturday we met up and were together practically the whole day (8 hrs). 😭 He came to see friends and i was with family, but we both left them to hang out with eachother. Prior to this i thought he liked me bc of the way he acted but this is when it really assured me he did.

So we hung out the whole day, me, initially never thinking this would be a 'date', it most definitely was. He paid for everything like a true gentlemen and we were together the whole day, no hand holding, nothing of that such, just great company and great conversation. We had some drinks, and then it was finally time for us to split. But he made sure to get me to where I was going before he left me, and i remember the place we were at was super crowded and i was like im going to hold ur arm bc at that point we kept losing eachother. Then eventually he goes, this is uncomfortable and intertwines his hand with mine. We get to where i was headed, hug and he leaves.

I was in a daze and confused tbh bc i didnt know how to feel, hes not someone i originally thought I liked but, i liked holding his hand, I'm not going to lie. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION, i've never held any other guys hand in my life or have gone on a date, none of it. So these are about to be alot of firsts.

Then as of recently after that, we texted a bit that following sunday and then he just stopped texting, and we didnt contact all of last week, until he asked me to go to this festival this past Saturday. But that didn't end up happening cause I wasn't really in the mood but then he was like, 'well why dont we do something else tonight, like go out and eat?' And idk how I was feeling, but I said sure!

So we met up, and again, we had great conversation, its not hard to speak to him, i actually enjoy it. And he once again paid for everything. And by the end of the night we were holding hands again and it was honestly great. And then he eventually pulled me aside, we were on the roof of a club. He grabbed my hands and was like 'I really like you...' and then asked me if i liked him too. And i really didnt know how to feel or what to say, i was so taken off guard a bit. But i told him i liked him too.. and then he asked if he could kiss me. Now ive only kissed one person before him when i was in HS and it was just pecks. So when he asked, again i was so shocked but i told him 'yeah' and when he went for it, it was awkward bc i never 'made out' b4 and i went for the disney kiss and he went for the 'tongue' should i say? 😩

Either way we both stopped and i think he thought i didn't want to kiss him but i explained to him i never did this before and we, well I, eventually got in the groove of it. It was nice, and honestly i cant stop thinking about it. And when we were done he was like 'well u can come back to my place or i can get u an uber home?' And that took me off guard bc i was most def going home. And thats when I got really confused bc what does he want?!

I asked him after we left when he knew he liked me and why. He said bc he thinks I'm very interesting, and smart and i pulled it out of him, but he said 'hot' as well lol. And then i kissed him once more snd got into my uber.

Idk. I guess my question is, is all he wanted was a one night stand thing or do u think he wants or wanted something more with me? I'm off to college in a week and hes going to be here. I don't know how to feel or think rn, i'm really confused. And why is it im always the last one to send a message, and why does he go on these intervals of just not msging me. But then goes out with me, and pays for everything and talks with me forever, like we genuinely have good conversations. But why'd he ask me to comr over to his place? I'm sorry, but im most definitely not that kind of girl. I just want some ppls two cents on this. What does he want from me? :("
6s7uq8,0,2017-08-07,Me [26 M] with my ex [28 F]. Should I get her a job where I work?,throwbiway123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6s7uq8/me_26_m_with_my_ex_28_f_should_i_get_her_a_job/,"**Current situation:** I have a decent job with a company that has plenty of work and has hired 12 people in the last year. My ex is working 3 different jobs and at best is making half of what I make for the same hours. I’d like to see if I can get her a job here but as she’s an ex (of a break up that was not her idea) I’m not sure how she’d handle it or if she’d want to. 

**Why it’s complicated**: Warning this will be long and will probably make me sound like a dick. Our backstory, we met in college my freshman year (her sophomore)  she was pretty and I tried talking to her (10/2010), got nervous and walked away. A year and a half later we met up again and hit it off, we were official within two weeks (4/2012). She was in my ’grade’ because of changing colleges a couple years back. She was my first actual girlfriend and I was her 10th (important later). We got along great, we never fought and everyone always said we were a good couple. Then I met up with an online friend. Now I had known this girl longer than my girlfriend and we had a decent friendship, but now I could actually reach out and touch her. I spent one weekend at her place and we connected and got along even better than I did with my girlfriend. I’m not a cheater though, nothing happened, no intimacy or anything, didn’t even drop anything could be construed as me having an interest in her. But that weekend showed me things that were missing in my relationship and started my second-guessing. A few months later I broke up with her because of several reasons (5/2013). It blind-sided her as I had never raised these concerns to her before. (Side note: It's the absolute worst to see someone you care about crying and knowing there is nothing you can do to comfort them since you are the cause of their misery).

We stayed in communication for a while and she agreed to meet with me so we could talk. Apparently she said she’d be able to get over and change a few of the reasons I had given her, and then convinced me that the others reasons I had were not really that big (which admittedly they were not). We got back together (7/2013).  This time it was good, communication between us was better, maybe had a couple tiny-tiny arguments, classes gave more free-time to hangout. But after a year I started having doubts again. Is she really the right one for me? Do we share enough interests? Do I like her family? Does my family like her? Does her family like me? Most of the questions were answered by a “I don’t know” since she was my first girlfriend and I had nothing to compare her to. Whereas I was her 10th and she knew *exactly* what she wanted in a boyfriend, I was only guessing what I wanted. I decided that I needed to know if I wanted to invest further into her or end it, and I chose to end it because I needed to see if there was someone better for me out there, someone that made me feel butterflies in my stomach whenever I saw them, and this girl was not doing that for me. I decided to break up with her on graduation day since I figured the memory of finally graduating would overcast the decision I was making for her regarding our relationship, also since I wasn’t sure when I’d see her again (attended college in a different state). Interestingly enough, this was the first time our parents met even though we had been going out for ~3 years at this point. 

Flash forward a few months we’re talking again. I suggest us getting into a friends with benefits relationship while we try to find other people. She agrees but says if I sleep with anyone else then it ends. Okay whatever. But I *continue* to stress to her over the next few months that this is strictly FWB and either of us are free to date and can back out at any point, she continues to agree. Over the next year and a half I go on a couple dates, nothing come of them. She was my first girlfriend so I’m still a noob in the dating realm. She only has 1 date since she’s not comfortable going out to meet people on her own (understandable). So two years after this FWB starts I say “Hey we should stop having sex, we can still hangout but I think we should stop so we can have a stronger urge to go after other people”, logical. This sets her off, saying I’ll be hard-pressed to find anyone better than her and that her life is over since she can’t get out to meet anyone and has invested so much time into me (5 years). So apparently she thought the FWB was something more and that she could win me back somehow….. this was not the plan at *all*. Apparently I was the best boyfriend she ever had and she truly doesn’t think she can do better than me, there was nothing she did wrong in the relationship so there was nothing she could have done to keep it going. It’s been almost 4 weeks since she’s talked/texted me, I’ve texted her a couple times in that time without any responses.

**Her Jobs:** Her degree has not helped her get a job. For the past couple years she has had one shift per weekend in her chosen career field, it also pays the most, but is only a few hours a week. She has two shifts at minimum wage at a decent place. For the last year she has worked three days a week at another job, for art-time work, it pays a bit more than minimum wage. So total she works about 44 hours a week and is making much less than someone with a degree should be. She applied to my company a year and a half ago but did not hear back. So then applied a few months ago and again did not hear back, my guess was lack of office work on her resume and also a degree that is not the field of the job. I think that if I talk to a couple department heads I might be able to get her an interview at least at which point they can see if there’s any jobs available for her (I currently believe we have 3 she'd be qualified for. We have two interns with no degrees who are leaving at the end of the month. Even if she took one of their jobs, she would be getting $2-$4 more an hour and have full time work instead of random shifts. The downside is that she might have to interact with me every so often and would see/hear me several times a day. 
  

**Bottom Line:** She hates the job that is her main source of income right now and doesn’t like working random hours on her other jobs. She could keep the job in her career if she wanted and make a lot more money by switching her other two jobs out for a job where her ex works but she would have to see the love of her life who no longer wants her, on a daily basis.
  ---   
  **TL;DR**: “Broke up” with ex while she was job searching, my company is hiring for better pay than any of the 3 jobs she has now. Should I try to get her a job here or would it be too painful for her to see me every day?

6s82mw,0,2017-08-07,"Entering junior year, found a new career interest in actuary, changing majors. Some advice please?",MonsterMeggu,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6s82mw/entering_junior_year_found_a_new_career_interest/,"Hey there,

I'm looking for some advice on the actuary career. I've only recently found out about it and started to consider it seriously, and I have heard conflicting information from friends so I'd like some advice from here.


About me:

- I've just finished my sophomore year as of Summer 2017 and I'm graduating in December 2018 (one semester early).

- I've been a computer science major for the past two years, but I've switched it to Statistics and Economics double major. I'm still a computer science minor. My reasons for changing are: I really want to graduate early and could not as a Comp Sci major, I don't really like programming that much and I like math much more, I can't do another summer internship next year (becuase I'm an international student) under the Comp Sci department, and I want to satisfy the VEEs and need the Econ classes for those.

- I'm an international student on an F1 visa (as stated above) and thus I have to do internships on CPT and work on OPT. I have 3 years of OPT before I need a work visa.

- I go to a decent state school, but it's not an ""actuary school"" and there's very few acturial job/internship connections that can be made through my school's career center.

- I have a 3.75 GPA

- I have two summer internship experiences. The first was in my home country at a start up that taught kids computer programming. The second is at a healthcare tech company where I am a product manager. I do work with excel (and VBA) a little bit in this internship. My second internship also strengthened my interest in being an actuary as my company works very closely with insurance companies.

- I have diverse extracuricculars: Vice President of Chess club, E-board position in the Ski Club, member of the orchestra, E-board member in my residence hall last year, on-campus job as a tutor, research in the Political Science department building software.


My questions are: (and any question you can answer will be really helpful!)

1. Is it realistic for me to try to get an acturial internship next summer? To do so means I would have to cram two exams this fall so I can apply for them in time. Keep in mind I haven't taken the P or FM class (taking P in the fall) so i'd have to learn the material on my own.

2. If I can't get an internship, how difficult would it be to get an entry level actuarial job?

3. How saturated is the entry-level actuarial market, really? I have very little knowledge as I've mostly been researching tech companies/market.

4. List of companies that have been known to hire F1 students? Any personal experiences and advice?

5. How much do my non-actuarial internship experiences count toward an entry level actuary job and/or an actuarial internship? Especially considering one was not in the US.

6. How much do extracurricular activities count?

7. I've heard that programming knowledge is useful in the industry. But what specifically is more useful? Machine learning, data analysis, etc.? Also what languages?

8. I have knowledge and experiences in SQL, Java, C, Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Perl, PHP, R. What more computer science classes should I take? Or should I just focus more on stats classes?

9. Any study tips/resources for exams?

10. Keeping in mind all the questions above, and that I have 60 days after graduation to find a job in the US, what should be my game plan for the next few years? Should I try to cram exams and get an internship? Should I just take it at a slower pace and try to get an entry level actuary job? Or should I try to get a job in a related industry and change careers after a few years? Or lastly, should I consider grad school?"

We know y'all wanted the speed last year, but the gearhead wasn't up to snuff.  So we worked on a new version of the 20 which is up to the challenge of drivetrains and other slamming-back-and-forth applications.  This has handled all the stupid things our interns could do to it (which I'm leaving unspecified for safety reasons), and we think it will fast become the standard for FTC drive systems.

The NeveRest Orbital 20 has the same mounting pattern as the NeveRest Orbital 3.7 (which *is* different from the NeveRest Classic 20/40/60), and to match we created the PicoBox [LEO](http://www.andymark.com/PicoBox-p/am-3614.htm), [MEO](http://www.andymark.com/PicoBox-p/am-3615.htm), and [GEO](http://www.andymark.com/PicoBox-p/am-3616.htm) to complement the Solo, Uno, and Duo you already know.

Also, we added the [PicoBox Turbo](http://www.andymark.com/PicoBox-p/am-3449.htm) and [Twin Turbo](http://www.andymark.com/PicoBox-p/am-3450.htm) that ditch gearheads entirely.  We've been working on this since last season, but supplier delays held us up this long.  We think it'll be valuable for any high-speed applications you can imagine, from intakes to launchers.

Hope this stirs the pot appropriately for y'all. More good stuff soon!

6s9zxh,12,2017-08-07,Here's Why,RicoSuavy,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6s9zxh/heres_why/,"I started writing this simply as a reminder to myself, but then thought I might as well share it, though it got kind of long.

Pros

Being buzzed/drunk


Cons

Waking up around 11-12 instead of 7-8.

Waking up dehydrated and slightly hungover, which lingers for at least a few hours, wasting even more of the day.
 
The above mean I can’t focus on anything mentally taxing as it’s just too distracting to keep focus on something for more than a few seconds. 

This also means I’m in no mood to work out. I start drinking in the evening before the time I would usually go for a run, and as a result I haven’t been on one for a couple months now. 

I’m at my highest weight I’ve been in a long time, while losing muscle mass at the same time. 

I have to eat less to help curb the high calories from the alcohol, so my diet is worse off. 

I have to drink several bottles of water throughout the day to keep from being dehydrated.

The dehydration means I have dry mouth constantly, making it harder for me to speak clearly, which I have enough problems with.

Spending ~$50 or so each week as I seem to be averaging close to 2 half-gallons. I’ve literally spent thousands on just alcohol in the past year and a half. 

Constantly feeling overheated and wanting to sweat. This persists unless I stop drinking for at least a couple days, which breaks that long are rare. The moment I start drinking for the day it gets worse. I have to keep the A.C. running cooler and need fans on more often. 

Passing out without getting ready for bed instead good for my face or teeth.

All the extra sugar from the alcohol/coke/juice isn’t good for my teeth alone.

Whatever damage it’s doing to my liver/kidneys/stomach, and any increase in cancer risks from that.


This really started about three years ago, summer 2014, when I was home alone as my fiancée was out of town for an internship. I wasn’t working and just had one (easy) summer class which rarely took more than 7-8 hours each week for both class time and studying. Other than that, all I did was house and yard work and take care of our cat. At the time, I had everything under control. I would get up at a decent time, do any school stuff or house work for the day, worked out steadily, went on runs in the evening, and then maybe have a couple drinks at night. Completely fine, it didn’t affect anything, but it was simply the first stepping stone. 

Throughout the fall, I was fine. I don’t think I drank much outside the weekends with my fiancée. I think I was too busy with classes to even give drinking any thought. On top of that, we spent a lot of time on campus as we tried to overlap our schedules as much as possible.

Come spring 2015, my fiancée just graduated and gets a job, but a 1.5 hour drive away. To mitigate this, she rents a place near her job for the weekdays. Meanwhile, my class schedule was fairly compact. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, my first class was at 12:30. This gave me more freedom to drink more and sleep in. I don’t remember many specifics, except I do remember on a few occasions waking up at almost noon on Tuesday/Thursday a bit too hungover, rushing to get ready to go dredge through that horrible class. Now it was starting to encroach on my life.

For the following year, I’m guessing things played out similarly. I wasn’t drinking every day or in excess, but occasionally I’d take it too far. School was still my priority and took up too much time to let me drink much. 

Fast forward, I graduated spring 2016. I have no job lined up and hardly any options in consideration. I have no internships or any major projects to speak to. I’m not an out-going person, talking to people can be difficult for me if I don’t already know them well; it takes me time to think of responses and how to word them properly. Interviews terrify me, just normal phone calls can be anxiety-inducing. This, combined with being too selective of the internship options I had, led me to having none at all. Now my job prospects are even harder.  I scare myself into not applying for some jobs by convincing myself I don’t meet the requirements and it’s pointless anyway. My other introversive features make me want to avoid the interviews and the assumed rejection. I put it off for the most part, focusing instead on house projects for when we eventually sell it and distracting myself with games. 
During all of this, there’s nothing I have to do, no schedule I have to follow, and my fiancée is gone half the week. No obligations, no reason I have to get up early in the morning. This enables me to start drinking even more. Before, I was going through about a half-gallon of gin every two weeks; a few drinks on Fridays and Saturdays with my fiancée, and a few at night throughout the week. 

Now, a year later, it’s closer to 3-4 times that. A bit more on the weekends and a lot more during the week. The earliest I start is the late afternoon, but sometimes that’s simply because I’m still wearing off the effects of the night before. I have at least a couple drinks every day, and have probably only gone one or two days sober a couple times since then. It’s not completely obvious as I usually have a good idea of my limits. Drunk me isn’t greatly different from sober me, I act mostly the same, just a bit more open. This was always the case, even before my tolerance for alcohol skyrocketed and being drunk was a normal state to be in.

However, too often over the past month I’ve been pushing it too far, I think I’m fine but then that last drink makes me end up passed out at my computer or fully dressed on the bed. I sleep a couple hours longer than I should and my sleep quality isn’t great. If I do wake up early, the most I want to do is drink a lot of water, maybe some Gatorade, then go back to bed for another hour or three. I almost always feel overheated and sweat more than I used to. Just sitting here typing this in a 77 degree room I feel like I’m going to start sweating, and I’m not overweight or anything. I have to keep the A.C. on more or keep fans running. All of these things put me in a state where I don’t want to work out most of the time or go for a run. 

This affects my fiancée as well, as she’s been covering everything for me this entire time. She still has to drive a few hours to work each week because we were holding off on moving until we knew where I would be working. Over the past two years, her car has gone from 12,500 miles when she got it to almost 50,000 now. 

I know what I need to do with my job search and prepping for interviews. It’s just drinking has been taking up a lot of my time and that’s not something I can make myself do when I’m drinking. But this has gone on long enough. My few attempts at moderation and only drinking on the weekend have all failed pretty quickly. I simply can’t make that work with how I’m currently living, and that won’t change until I start working. So the only option is to just stop drinking altogether, at least until things are stable for me.

Right now, I’m sober, and I will stay that way.

6sa7z6,3,2017-08-07,Help mating two curved surfaces,humble_ninja,SolidWorks,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/6sa7z6/help_mating_two_curved_surfaces/,"Hey everyone, I've been asked to model a plunger tangent to a countersink: 

http://imgur.com/oVpBFUh

I modeled the two components and inserted them in an assembly. However, SolidWorks isn't letting me create a tangent relation between the countersink and the chamfer on the plunger. The reason (I think) is because in the assembly, SolidWorks isn't recognizing the flat bottom face and the chamfer as separate features: 

http://imgur.com/mBoSTzT

Both faces get highlighted when I select just the chamfer. The strange thing is that when I edit the individual part, I'm able to select the faces separately:

http://imgur.com/z7T1yZy

So even though this is the case in the subcomponent, I wanted to emphasize the fact that I want two separate faces by using the split line feature. I spent about an hour trying to figure out why there were errors today at my internship, but when I tried it at home just now (doing nothing differently), it worked...

Anyway this is what it looks like: 

http://imgur.com/g0UXIRb

When I jumped back into the assembly though, I ran into the same problem. Is there something about the assembly that doesn't allow me to mate two curved surfaces or is there an easier way to go about doing this?

6sacx5,4,2017-08-07,The true identity of the Night King,zacmccray,gottheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gottheories/comments/6sacx5/the_true_identity_of_the_night_king/,"Last year, I wrote a theory detailing why I believe that Eleven from Stranger Things grew up to be Leslie Knope from Parks and Recreation. This theory included many supporting cast members as well, most prominently Steve and Jean-Ralphio. However there was one Pawnee citizen I couldn't quite fit into the Hawkins, Indiana universe, and that was Ben Wyatt. I have been troubled by this fact for the last several months, wondering how he fits into the world. Well it wasn't until watching last night's amazing episode of Game of Thrones that I realized who Ben Wyatt really is: The Night King.

(WARNING: Spoilers for Game of Thrones and Parks and Rec are coming up, so if you haven't seen these shows, STOP READING NOW).

Okay, so I know you're thinking, how can 21st century Ben Wyatt be the Night King from medieval Westeros. Well if we've learned anything from GOT it's that the future can effect the past just as much as the past can effect the future. But I believe that the events from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series takes place in the future....at least 12,000 years after the events of Parks and Recreation. Stay with me, sweet summer children. This may get weird.

Okay so the first thing we need to establish is what would turn fun-loving Ben Wyatt into the king of a frozen zombie army? It may seem outlandish, but it's actually not that difficult a descent to follow. Ben's greatest disappointment of his life was being fired from Mayor after his Ice Town fiasco. Still not following? Is it really so hard to believe that the disgruntled Mayor of Ice Town could become the King of Winter? It seems like the next logical step. When the town of Partridge shunned him for attempting to bring ice to their town, he decided to bring it upon the entire world. With the help of his Dothraki intern, Khal Zone, Ben used strategies from his hit board game Cones of Dunshire to heap destruction on the planet, freezing out (almost) all of humanity. However his love of Leslie stayed true, so he spared her and the work she was doing to protect national parks across the country. What he didn't quite realize was that hidden in these parks were Children of the Forest. In a last attempt to save the remaining humans, Leslie charged these Children to kill her beloved husband and put an end to this eternal winter. Unfortunately, she armed the children with obsidian, and instead of killing Ben, it turned him into a White Walker. 

Leslie died shortly after, with only their three children, Westley, Steven, and Sonia left to survive in the wilds of Ben's new winterscape he deemed Ice Town 2.0. Steven, the middle child was able to enter into the Upside Down, which his mother had carefully preserved, and bring back Barb. He began repopulating the world with Barb, and their children, complete with red hair and a vendetta, became known as ""wildlings."" 

Sonia, with her beautiful blonde hair, scoured the new snowy continent until she found a man with no age, named Chris Trager. They started a family, which over the centuries became the Lannisters. As for Westley he abandoned his family and dwelt among the wolves that were ravaging the land. His goal was to be in stark contrast to his father, and save the world from the Night King. He formed an army of wildlings and began to help civilize them and train them for war. He would always remind his troops that winter was coming, and after a battle of epic proportions, he chased his father to the northern most region of North America, which was promptly renamed to honor Westley, its savior. Westeros, safe now from the Night King, was secured by the only thing the Wyatt genes knew how to build: an Ice Wall. Ice Town 2.0 became known as Winterfell and Westley changed his last name to Stark, to remind his followers he would never be like his father.

Several generations passed and these stories became legend, but thanks to the dragon glass dagger in his heart, Ben lived on. His hatred for the people south of the wall never changed, nor did his spiky hairstyle. But he knew if he would ever stand a chance to restore his name as the one true Mayor of Ice Town, he would need an army as well. He used the same technology that turned him into a White Walker to begin bringing the dead back to life. He began calling these zombies ""Wyatts"" to let everyone know who they served, but in a classic Hold the Door moment, they simply became known as wights. 

But then how does Ben know so much about Game of Thrones back when he worked in Pawnee? The only explanation is that the three-eyed raven visited him. I don't really understand how the time travel memory aspect works, but Ben's face when he saw the Iron Throne doesn't lie. He wants to take over King's Landing."

6sbiva,5,2017-08-08,Really struggling...,DJ_Samwise,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/6sbiva/really_struggling/,"Its been more than 10 weeks now, and I am trying not to make this a huge post, but I am really struggling so let me give some history. 

Gf of 4 years broke up with me at a really hard time in my life. I had to get surgery after a sudden and random back injury, and this all caused me to move from my university town back to home. I lost my friends, independance, lifestyle, and internship at a big radio station all because of my move/health problems. 

A week after my surgery she broke up with me. Caught my by surprise and ripped my heart out. She said her depression made her unfit to be in a relationship and it was nothing I did to cause it. The 10 weeks since have been the hardest of my life and we have tried being friends, talking to get closure, and have even seen each other a couple of times, but I just kept getting hurt and while we keep each other at arms distance we are trying to give each other space and rarely talk now. 

It has come in waves and been easier and harder, but I am in a really bad patch now. I just feel no hope. No hope I will find a career to deal with student debt, no hope I will ever fully heal and get my body back into a 22 year old shape, and then the big one; no hope I will ever be as happy as I was with her. 

Back in March there was a time I could have proposed to her. I looked at her while we were on one of our adventures and I thought to myself, damn, what am I waiting for? I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman. A few months later she tells me she doesnt love me anymore. 

There is so much to this story, I can't tell it all without writing for an hour. I just am scared because I actually thought about how I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I just hate this day to day and I am losing hope things will get better. I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I have helped others on here before, and if you really want to see more of my story, look at my profile for my last posts. I just am so lonely and miserable and was hoping someone, anyone, could say something to me. I miss her so much but I know I can't go back. "

International University of America (IUA) originally a Californian University established in 1980, founded its campus in London in February 1995. IUA and Its more recent global outlook is an indication of its desire to enhance itself more global offering an Anglo-American style education.

IUA is an independent, coeducational, business and liberal arts international institution of higher learning. As a foreign university in London, IUA is independently administered in accordance to the education reform Act 1988 by Management Education Resources Centre (MERC) incorporated (as a college of higher education) in England and Wales in July 1995.

The university provides an adequate and satisfactory international standard of education and confers diplomas and degree mainly in the business area. The university is a member of European Council for Business Education (ECBE). It is also an approved and accredited centre for the Council for Licensed Conveyancers (UK). IUA, until recently, was a UK registered Education Provider under the auspices and authority of DfES (also known as the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills) and conformed to the evolving rules, regulations and policies of the Home Office in the UK.

Our Mission

The aim of this establishment is to promote Anglo-American education style. And over the past decade the emerging needs of London's multicultural business environment drives the management to set plans for attracting more international students from different ethical and professional backgrounds around the world. This will provide students a rare opportunity to develop their vision when studying in the multicultural environment apart from their main objective of achieving a high end professional degree.

Our mission is to provide our students, through academic coursework, examination, tutorial, industrial visit and internships, a strong foundation of knowledge and experience with which to further their careers in international business.

The IUA Building

IUA which was earlier located in the historical heart of the City of London has now been relocated to an equally prestigious landmark building known as The Royal Arsenal Gatehouse in the south-east of London. The Royal Arsenal Gatehouse was built as a detached building in 1829 with a colorful military past in very close proximity to the Royal Artillery Museum and the original Royal Military Academy of Woolwich's Royal Arsenal. As part of the Royal Arsenal, which was Britain's most important military manufacturing base for over 300 years, various members of the British Royalty including King George VI had visited the Royal Arsenal Gatehouse being the main entrance to the Royal Arsenal.

More recently, the entire building was totally refurbished by the Greenwich Enterprise Board (GEB) and was officially reopened on 19th June 1996 by the Chairman of English Heritage in the presence of the Mayor of Greenwich and the Chairman of the Greenwich Enterprise Board. The International University of America took over the building on the 4th July 2003 to coincide with the American Independence Day.

Located in the heart of the town square, IUA also shares the town's good amenities with its other education neighbor, namely, the University of Greenwich.

Members of our staff and students have easy access to the excellent Waterfront Leisure Centre overlooking London's River Thames and the public library is also only a short walk away.

Within its own building, IUA has its own extensive library facilities. It has two reception rooms, two offices, one communication room, one archive room, four toilets, one reading room, one conference/seminar room, two large lecture rooms, and a large fitted kitchen/ meeting place.

Beside the highly trained and professional faculty members the campus is equipped with excellent facilities for efficient and effective computing. As research forms the core of the university curriculum. All research led courses guarantees that students can readily cope with the changing market demands and face challenging situations as they emerged in day-to-day business operations.

Enclosed within its building, IUA also has a huge patio with four seating and recreation quarters. Moreover, IUA has its own private car park with additional frontage parking and several small garden plots on three sides of the building. Furthermore, the University has its own small museum.

As the only prominent building in the town square which dates back to 964 AD, IUA's Bell and Clock towers are constantly being watched by the public for accurate time-keeping."
6sbwu7,5,2017-08-08,My girlfriend [25F] of 11 years told me [25M] she needed space to sort out her feelings at the worst possible moment.,throwaway25yo2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6sbwu7/my_girlfriend_25f_of_11_years_told_me_25m_she/,"TL;DR : Fucked up relationship turned good, but I'm too dependent on her and she wants away. I've got IBS, which is killing me and has been hurting our social interactions. She helped me live through it but it's been too tiring on her and she wants to live for herself. She got feelings for another person, and even though they may be exaggerated out of her fear it feels like a trigger for her. I can't imagine my life without her and want her back, but on the other hand I know I should let her choose. What do ?

Hello relationship advicers,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I've been in a relationship with the same woman for the last 11 years now. It all started as a long-distance relationship when we were 14 and, as one could guess of a relationship that started between teenagers AND long distance, it quickly went to shit. I cheated on her, she cheated on me. We had a rough time dealing through it, especially her, but we kinda kept on.

Fast forward to 2010 and we started living together, moved in together and all. Important to note that i went straight from my mother's place to living with her while she didn't (spent 1 year in with a roommate for studies, then one year alone). Things... Went kinda wrong on the beginning. I was too focused on the ""living out of my mother's house"" part to deal with the ""living with someone else"" part. I was selfish, spent all my day playing games instead of being with her when she needed me. 

So yeah. Lots of shit. 

Our relationship finally started working out 5 years ago, when I realized my mistakes and worked on them. We were good together. I've got IBS, which has always been a huge factor in going out or not, but I've learned to deal with it (or so I thought) and she's been the most patient, understanding person in the world for me. She was my pillar, and when the world asked too much of me she just hugged me and said I was doing my best and to keep going. 

We had great years. Really. Watching back I feel like these are things you only live once in a lifetime. I felt like I was finally climbing back after feeling like IBS was gonna be the end of me and any social interaction with an human being. I made friends, we made friends, we went out at a reasonable pace, I told her I loved her and she told me she loved me.

This summer, I had an internship to do abroad to complete my penultimate year of engineering studies. I chose London to go to (well, chose the job instead of the city, to be fair), but since the search dragged on it was last minute, we just found a kinda-crappy Airbnb, not so cosy (very cold) and 1 hour away from London, to live in for 3 months (a very long time when you don't appreciate the place). 

Before we started everything, I sat with her and told her that this was gonna be exhausting for me. I have always had trouble with being in a place that isn't ""my place"", and travelling, and long commutes to work. I told her that I would probably spend my weekends resting, and that it wouldn't be so much ""holidays"" that it would be ""a bad time to deal with"". She told me that it was ok, that she'd support me and we'd get through it. 

We spent... One and a half month (we arrived in late June) and I thought things were ok. We weren't hanging out much, but I was trying. Not trying too much though : i was kinda cynical in big tourist attractions (I always had a problem with those) and, well, we didn't go out on the weekends when all my school mates were, because of my IBS. I was going to work and it worked fine.

But she had another situation. Being an independant musician, she spent like, 24/7 at the flat. And she felt like shit staying, and I knew it, so I asked her to join me after work for restaurants, and I introduced her to my school mates to go out on weekends. I thought things were getting better for her, even though she said she wished I was there on the weekends. I talked it through several times with her and she told me that it was nice of me to help her go out if I couldn't take her out, and that she was ok. 

Recently she went to see a music contact / friend of hers. He lived far away, so she stayed at his place for the night. And before you come knocking, she didn't cheat on me. I let her go there because I trust her and she's an incredibly honest person, betrayal disgusts her.

She came back... Different. She was there, but she was distant and I could feel it. It was things, like how she behaved in our private intimacy or the fact that she spent a lot of time talking to a female friend over Messenger, that made me feel like something  was wrong. 

So I went to her and asked her.  

She said she was afraid of having feelings for the guy (let's call him Lester). Long story short, he was a musician like her (I wasn't), he was enthusiastic about things and went out a lot (I wa... actually it's an unfair point because she knew I'd be like that and I'm not that extreme on a normal situation), and more than anything IMO, he gave her attention. I think that's a major point of it right now, even though she didn't tell me that verbatim (it's what I interpreted from our talks about it). In the process of spending this internship in bad conditions, I spent so much time thinking ""just get through this and the rest of your studies are gonna be ezpz"" I went into full eat-sleep-work-repeat schedule. We didn't go out much, but that was expected ; but more importantly, when we were at the apartment, we didn't do much together. I made some efforts but I'm guessing they weren't enough. 

Now to make things clear, this isn't her first time. We already had kind of a rough patch 3-4 years ago, and she'd developed feelings for another confident, positive friend that looked at her, asked her to go out and gave her attention. But we defused the situation with maestria, both of us; she dealt with it internally, and then she confessed to me about it and we had a good talk and we clearly identified the fact that it was her loneliness talking. We went back on track and were happy. 

Now it wasn't just about a crush : basically, the problems here made her think back about the ""bad part"" of our relationship (""the bad more than a half"" is more precise. This is kinda fucked up) and she'd feel gloomy and feel like we were going the wrong way. More importantly, she felt she was going the wrong way. That event was a trigger for her to feel ""do I want this, me, myself ?"". That + her talks with her friend (I'm guessing here) made her decide that no matter how hard it made me suffer, she had to think about what she, alone, needed in life, that she knew it was tough for me (she felt extreeemely guilty) but she had to think about herself. 

So we had the big bad talk. It was hard and it was painful. At some point she told me ""you stop me from enjoying things"", which I don't think was true and was over-exaggerated because of emotions, but it still hurt like a bullet to the chest. After this first talk, we decided that she'd leave and get back to our place for the last 3 weeks of the internship to get her thoughts in order, and that we'd talk again at my return. Whether it was to try and salvage things... Or to give up and move alone. It was mainly my idea (and I regret it), because most of the talk was her feeling like shit for putting me through this and me being calm-headed and reassuring her and understanding that she had to think of herself, but we both agreed on it. 

It seemed like the better idea. After all, back at our place she had a way better environment, she had a therapist that knew her and had always helped her, she could see friends and get her mind out of things. We'd probably miss each other. Maybe she wouldn't (ignore that. It's the insecurity talking. You don't ""not miss"" someone you spent 11 years with just because you're unclear about your feelings). Anyway we agreed it was the lesser evil and that if anything would help us and help her, it was that. 

Now about the elephant in the room. I said the internship was three months ; I said we are 1 1/2 month through ; I said she'd leave for the last 3 weeks. 

Yeah... The plane tickets were definitely too expensive for her to leave quickly, so right now she's staying for a week and a half (leaving Wed 16) and... well... She doesn't have a lot of places to stay. 

She's gonna stay for 10 days at the apartment, and on Thur she's going to see Lester again to define if her feelings are true or if she's just projecting what she's missing from me. Maybe find out if he feels the same. No idea. 

For #teamthrowaway25yo2, I've offered her to go together at Hyde Park (something she absolutely wanted to see in London) on Sat. This is a way to show her we can still enjoy things, that it's not gonna always be like that, and that I was still ready to keep doing efforts with the IBS and to give her what she wanted. We also watched GoT together yesterday, and she told me it made her feel good. 

Now I don't know if you're ever been living what felt like your last days with someone that used to be the pillar of your life and now seems like the decaying wood branch of your sanity, but it's tough. Tough tough. Even with the strongest of convictions, it's hard. I left our first talk feeling like it was a good thing, she was gonna focus on the good things in our relationship and we'd get back together at my return. Right now it's day 2, and I've been waking up at 2AM, 4AM, 6AM with cold sweats and nausea. I've been throwing up a few (forcing myself to temporarily get the nausea out of my system) and my IBS has. never. been. worse. She was right, I was gonna go through hell because of this. But she's staying true to her words, and I know deep down it's right for her to do it. 

As of today I've sent a message at 4AM to my boss telling him I was going through a rough patch (no details. we were clear on the fact that a minimum of people should know about this : her friend, whoever I wanted to talk about it because I had the right too, and Lester because she felt it was important to be straight with him if she wanted to know), telling him rough details about throwing up and feeling my stomach blowing up and not sleeping, and telling him that I was going to need time, maybe I was gonna see a doctor, maybe not, that I couldn't come and that I was sorry. I didn't check his reply. I probably won't. As much as I have responsibilities at work, this is more important and I want to be fully focused on it. 

As for me, I'm going through a full spectrum of emotions : 

 - I want to hate her. But every time I try to it just feels irrational. On the other hand, my subconscious is definitely not going through the same thing. Sometimes I get irrational fits of anger, and I even told her to ""stop playing with me and leave me alone"" even though I didn't think ONE.WORD.OF.IT. But like the ""you stop me from enjoying things"" bit, it's like I could feel the bullet going through her heart at this moment. 

 - I want to hate the world. That I do. I mean, I got IBS when I was a teenager and I hated the world for it. All these people that could go out, live a good life, and I was stuck here developing an obsession with video games because I was afraid of going out. But when I grew older, I learned to live with it. It was kind of a curse, but sometimes things don't go your way. And the world still gave me her in return, which felt like giving me a solution to get through it. It doesn't feel like that anymore. Now I'm mad because it's unfair and even though I brought this on myself (we probably both do) I mean, seriously. Wive beaters and chronic liars who never make a slither of effort get to live happy and I get to go fuck myself ? Shit. 

 - I don't know how to live without her. Like, really. My life is formatted around her, which is something you'd expect from a 11-year couple. I'm sure it's painful for her too, but she's strong and she doesn't talk about it. I'm not strong. I've got a stressful job and I'm tired and I can't get my emotions straight. She spends all day thinking about it and getting her life straight, I spend all day torturing myself about it and not doing work and getting yelled at.  Which led to me going from ""this is gonna be alright"" to ""I don't want to lose you"" to ""This is the end of my life omg omg omg"". I agreed suicide was out of the question so that she still felt like she could leave me and I'd get out of it eventually. 

 - I'm afraid of Thur. Like, definitely afraid. She's going to his place, and he knows she's broken up. Now to get it clear, I know she won't cheat because of reasons given above. But she needs to get out of the apartment, and I'm sincerely afraid that getting a day out in a beautiful place (motherfucker's on the coast. I'd have gotten an Airbnb on the coast too if I knew) will make her feel like, yeah, she'd be better off with him. I'm sincerely afraid that being here with me in a place engraved with negative feelings and going for a break to his place, engraved with positive ones, will just be the death of our couple. That's terrifying. I trust her but, honestly... I'm not starting this on a good foot. 

 - I want her back. Now this is probably the strongest emotion. Like, when my mind is clear (like after writing a 12K character post on reddit) this is all I can think about. I want her back and I want to be there, smiling (not too much doe it's still fucking bad), trying to show her good things, trying to make her enjoy her last days here, at least. But my mind is not always clear, because of my job, because of stress, because of pain, because of lack of sleep. But I want to fight for her. I know she deserves it and our relationship (at least the last part) deserves it. I WILL respect her final choice because it's hers to make, but I'm gonna try to tip the balance as much as I can by doing positive things. Stop being cynical and enjoy things as they are. Go out more. Forget about my job. My job is, like, at 10 in my list of priorities. She's at 0 (i'm a computer scientist hehe). Maybe now that I've got the day off I'll invite her to take a walk out with me. Anyway, I'm not going down without a fight, and as much as I want to support her I don't want her to forget that on our good days, we're fucking great together. 

 - My body is broken. Nights are the worst part, because when you're still madly in love after 11 years you only make dreams with her in it, or nightmares where you leave each other. Nightmares are painful. Dreams are worse. Because then I wake up and I realize. I've been going in and out of sleep for the last two nights. My nights are long, too long, without enough sleep, and she doesn't sleep enough and it's eating at me because I know it's tipping the scale away. (I wouldn't say it's tipping the scale in Lester's favor - I feel like more than a choice between me and Lester, it's a choice between me and not me)


So now for my solutions :

 - Rent another Airbnb for the following week. Get out of here. Or maybe rent one for her, and get her a place to stay alone, in a neutral environment. I can afford it for one week (i make mad cash. London city, city of dreaaaams). Anyway, keep us separated. Still see her, but on our best behavior, because Lester's gonna be on his best behavior, he's not the one going through a possible break-up with half of himself. 

 - Stay with her. This is gonna be tiring on me and her, but on the other hand, we're still supportive to each other, when we're not spitting nonsense. We still hug each other. We sleep in the same bed. We still do stuff together, eat together, etc. Still, it will take a toll on my mental state, and I know it. It's gonna take me time to get my shit together. 

 - Stay with her, but force each other to stay... As roomies. No hugging, no sleeping together (we have a couch), possibility to do stuff separately even when we're both there. This could help to get our shit straight but it could drive us away from each other so I'm afraid of it. 

 - Wait for Thursday and see what happens. This is... The most terrifying one. Now let me get this straight. I trust this woman with my life. I could throw myself off a cliff if she told me she got me. But what happens when you feel like she doesn't know what to feel herself ? I can't trust her to see things like me if she doesn't. And if I stay here waiting, I'm fucking terrified that she's gonna spend a great time with him (which is pretty much a given -her passion is his passion) and that she's gonna leave to our place and spend 3 weeks thinking ""that was so great"". I know I shouldn't but god help me I'm so fucking afraid.

Now for the part where I ramble without any structure about what I'm feeling right now. I'm afraid. I go from tears to fear to tears to no sleep to throwing up to tears. I know I look like shit and it makes me even more afraid because she's seeing me like that and thinking ""this relationship is shit"" when it's just the situation. Sometimes I get my shit straight and we spend good times, but then I go full bipolar and start doing dumb shit. I feel like for every step forward I'm taking two steps backwards. I feel like she's already made her peace with being without me, and right now the only thing on her mind is ""does Lester love me ?"". I know it's wrong. I know I'm wrong to think it. I'm not perfect. But I'm afraid and I want her back. I don't want to learn to live alone. Not right now. This isn't ""learning to walk again"" time it's ""fighting for your life"" time. 

I'm a mess, Reddit. And I have no one to talk to about it. So i'm turning to you. Even writing this feels good. Knowing I've got the day off is good. I'm gonna try to take a walk out, maybe invite her with me, see things. I'm also gonna try reading and responding to everything here. If you need any clarifications, feel free to ask. 

God bless, Reddit. I hope your days are ok. I hope you're doing good. I'm not. "

I struggled to get internships because my networking skills are crap and I just feel horrible about the entire thing because in my faculty, networking is a big thing, but I felt like it was getting mixed with friendship. I got really confused and frustrated because it’s difficult for me to blend the two together and it made me feel… idk…weird? My first years of college didn’t go so well so I ended up becoming alienated. After therapy, I decided to just use my current workplace as an area to build upon those skills, in which my previous line of thought was that networking was like Starbucks’s Customer Connection thing cause I thought it would be good for my personal development.

I work at a Starbucks in my school and have since built 5 regular connections, where one a dude called Bob.  I worked at my store for like 2.5 years, though I work twice a week and he comes in quite frequently because he lives and studies in the area my store is, so I see him often. (Usually in my pre-closing shift which is typical for me…)

He's a super friendly dude who orders 1 of his 3 regular drinks. One of which is his decaf CM.

About 8 months ago... he ordered that with some sweet add-ons (don’t remember what they were). As I going to hand off the drink, he says he forgot to ask for it to be decaf, but he would be willing to pay for another one. I say it’s ok and remake it. He’s pretty happy and I just give him a bunch of those add-ons on the top and went off on my way.

I felt pretty good cause I made someone happy over a small thing, but you do it for customer service and he was polite about it anyway. I’ve made more of his drinks and talked to him a little more to have what most of you call ‘customer connections’. I thought generally customers don’t give a crap about our names, but he asked me in person cause I was one of the few who hate wearing it so I don’t. (My franchise company gives only 20% of their attention to name tags and connections otherwise they don’t really care.) 
But something happened and I don’t know if I crossed a firm boundary.

One day… I saw Bob sitting where he usually sits when I came back getting lunch. I approached him and mentioned that I noticed that he usually works a lot with codes (I took some programming classes) and tried to start a convo there. We talked a little bit, but being the dumbass I am, I walk awkwardly away and apologize that I don’t know how to end a conversation and told him to take care. He says there’s no problem and sort of started at me crawl my way back into our back room… I don’t know if that amused him or what but it wasn’t ‘wow this chick is really freaking weird’ kind of look but whatever.

I didn’t do something like that again cause of how weird it was (in a social aspect). But after that… whenever it is busy, and he’s waiting for his drink, he calls me and tries to start some conversations, or if it’s super busy, then the most he does is to get my attention and say hello. 
Of one of those conversations, he asked me if I had a second job. I don’t cause I’m still in school. He then says he used to work in an office and I remind him of this girl who was their admin/secretary. He tells me that was her main job, and she had worked in a coffee shop too and her 3rd or night job was teaching people how to pole dance. WTF

I gave an awkward/horrified laugh and said ‘oh wow, that’s… interesting…’ and I honestly don’t remember how the rest of that convo finished but it certainly didn’t last. I didn’t think too much of it afterward but still don’t understand how I resemble this admin girl. 

Some of his other conversations that gave me really WTF moments were brief mentions of his ex-wife. He says he sometimes has his kids over since he has some partial custody. That’s about it, but like… Idk what brings that up? Sometimes some people need to vent, but he hasn’t said anything remotely horrible about her.

My last shift, I was locking the patio when he showed up around the corner (almost scared me) and said hello. He asked if I needed help, but I said no. We didn’t really talk much since I told him we were closing a bit earlier than usually.

When I see familiar faces I just focus on that than some crappy coworkers in my store, so I feel better about working, but am I overreacting about Bob? I kind of feel creeped out and don’t know if my attempts to better talk to other people have gave them some kind of impression and I don’t really know what to do. Bob’s quite polite with everyone but he doesn’t actually put effort to hold a convo with people.

Idk if the other baristas have these sort of problems since their friends always say hello and faculty mentors like profs, advisors socialize briefly with them, but I don’t think I can ask them about it cause it’s too nosy and tbh they are mostly gossip people.

FUN FACT: I tried this on another customer (Ed) who is a prof in my faculty and I think I scared him cause he now quickly gets his coffee and avoids me, usually tries to talk to a different barista. I only asked about his research and my field. So I leave him alone but I feel kind of bad about it.

TDLR: I’m a little uneasy about customer connections, one of which I slightly creeping me, one where I sort of creeped a customer. What do I do to better socialize and know if I cross a boundary?

I'm trying to learn said database and wondered if it is possible to ask mongodb for multiple results with only one query. Let's say I have a database with 2.5 million entries and one common read would yield 1.3 million documents. Can I get those documents in a continous stream of batches so I can start processing the recieved data as they come in or would I need to make multiple find queries?

We hit it off, he was fun to talk to. Someone entirely different from me. I'm shy, quiet, reserved but I can talk to people if it's 1 on 1. He's very social, goes to parties etc. A month after, he started to become less friendly. I confronted him about this, and we came to the conclusion that we were just friends (broke my heart but thats another story). I accepted his decision and felt a lot better because now I know where I stood and what to expect. But recently, he's been very flirty again. He made me feel special, drove all the way to where I live and we basically chatted until 4 am before he went back. Said he was thankful I'm alive, loved being in my company (obviously I'm leaving a lot of details but he crossed the 'friend' line).  

So as you can tell, I'm back where I started. I feel confused. Whenever we see each other, it's always a good time. But after that, those thoughts come rushing back in and I'm left to wonder what we are. 

Help? What should I do? what is he doing? "

I love the contrast between the two characters backgrounds, the difference between how they both think and act. Especially though I love the change in thoughts that go through her head, from shock and potentially disgust (or something similar) to eventually intrigue and more...


**Interview with a pornstar**

I roleplay as a fictitious male pornstar now going into more legitimate films. In this rp your character would either be a little shy and possibly nervous about meeting a man with that sort of a background or she would be entirely unaware of my previous employment (I could be going into legitimate acting and you are interviewing me regarding a new movie I am in).

Gradually, as the interview progresses you start asking me about my previous roles and experience, not quite realising what you are getting yourself into!


**Don’t talk to the neighbours!**

We've lived next door to you for a while and for as long as anyone can remember, we've butted heads with your parents. We were too loud, throwing parties two or three nights per week, music blaring, people shouting and likely plenty of drugs. They've called the cops on us a few times, but it seems we're pretty sweet with them too - if only your parents knew how and why! Naturally your parents have told you to stay away from us. You couldn't really figure out why, after all we seem really nice and always wave and say hello. We don't look strange - quite the opposite in fact, we're rather attractive; my wife a pretty and athletic brunette in her early twenties and me a tall, muscular guy in his early thirties. But being a good girl, you did as you were told. Keeping it to just a friendly smile and nod whenever you passed us.

So when your parents start to get really strict (whether it's over your grades/getting a job/your behaviour etc) and you want to get rebellious, there's an obvious place to go. I mean we're only next door, we seem like the kind of people to listen!

I mean, how are you to know that we're pornstars?

**A pornstar in the office!**

The office is generally very boring. People here don't hate Mondays because of the stress their job gives them. They hate Mondays because it's the start of another work week of mind melting monotony. Dull, tedious work that seems to transcend the very concept of time. 

But this week there's something new. Something different. A new starter who seems somewhat mysterious. He's tall, around 6'2 and while he's only averagely attractive with his blonde hair and beard, he's built like someone who would look more happy swinging an axe around on a battlefield somewhere. Broad shoulders, muscular arms and chest fill out his plain work shirt to the point of it stretching. While his plain black trousers must have been specially made to fit round thighs that more resemble tree trunks than legs. 

There's talk going around too, spreading through the air like a virus without a host. 

*'Former prisoner, 'once killed a guy'.*

*'Don't be silly, we don't hire ex cons. No, I reckon he's a failed sports star'*

*'Janine says he was in a couple of films'*

*'I've not seen him in anything! Are you sure?'*

*'That's because he was in porn. Hung like a gifted horse apparently!'*

*'No way! Bullshit!'*

*'why not send in the intern. Find out the truth!'*

The girls snigger before approaching you. You've not worked here long but all the time you've been dying to be brought into the circle of trust. It wasn't hard for them to get you to agree to do his induction...

((So I'm trying to set up a rather awkward interaction between my character, a former male pornstar who has taken to working in an office to try to get a real job. And your character, an innocent, naive intern who has very little sexual experience and would certainly never have watched porn))


**Celeb possibility!**

You're filming a new TV show/movie but you're co star is completely is completely unfamiliar to you.  Which is strange, because he seems to confident in front of the cameras and he says he's been in dozens of films before..

6sdkd9,1,2017-08-08,"My [21F] friend [21M] says things that make me think he's not interested in our friendship anymore, but then acts like he is - I'm confused",notproudenough,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6sdkd9/my_21f_friend_21m_says_things_that_make_me_think/,"Currently I really only have one 'good' friend, as in, we meet up regularly. We started as internship colleagues about 4 years ago. At first he had a crush on me for about 1 year (which I didn't notice) until he confessed, I turned him down nicely and once he got over it we continued as friends. I am quite sure he has no romantic feelings anymore btw.

Now, we don't work together anymore but he recently had a job interview nearby and asked if I wanted to meet up for lunch. So we had lunch and during he said 'we see each other really often in the last weeks. We should see each other less often so we actually have something to talk about'. I was taken aback and not sure if he was being serious. After all, he had 'started' this meeting.

I thought it was probably a joke and a bit later he started working at the company close by. So one day we had lunch together again (initiated by him). A week later I asked him if we want to meet again. And he said yes, but during it again he said 'wow, we need to have lunch together only once per month or something, so we have news to tell each other'. That time I thought, alright, guess he is telling me he doesn't want to spend so much time together? I just won't ask him again for now.

But then today, only about a week later, he writes to me and asks to have lunch again, so I guess he's not being serious about spending less time at all. But I find it confusing why, then, he would say stuff like 'we need to spend less time together' or 'wow we sure see each other a lot'. Are those harmless 'jokes'?

6se7ha,5,2017-08-08,Where are programs and apps stored on ubuntu (something similar to Program Files or AppData on Windows)?,PhilippeASP,Ubuntu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/6se7ha/where_are_programs_and_apps_stored_on_ubuntu/,"I’m in an internship at the moment, and the only spare office computer was a linux machine (ubuntu 16.04).  So I’ve been making the best of it and trying to learn how to work with it.

Time and again there’s one thing that constantly comes up and it drives me crazy.  I will install a program and need it to do something specific.  So the tutorial I'm following will say I need to go into program files in order to copy over some sub-folder, or delete it and re-download this specific file, or transfer the data to another computer.  I have no idea how to do the equivalent of that in ubuntu.  Going into Program Files, where programs and other such things are saved, and performing little surgical changes.

A good example is KiCad.  In windows you need to navigate to the folder in program files in order to access the examples.  I don’t know where they are on the ubuntu version.   I think the equivalent of Local Disk (C:) is File System (though ubuntu doesn’t appear to name the drives).  Then in there there’s a folder called ""home"" that looks like it holds a lot of stuff, including some of of the programs I’ve installed like Eagle and PyCharm.  But it doesn’t have any KiCad folder.

Another example is when I install a new version of a program, but the old one doesn’t get uninstalled.  So when looking it up on “Search your computer” it comes up multiple times.  On windows I can just go into Program Files, find the old versions, and remove them manually.  On ubuntu, I still haven’t found out where he’s storing those old versions.

To say nothing of the more complicated stuff hidden in AppData on Windows.  I think that’s where apps (as opposed to programs?) are stored.  It’s already hidden well enough on Windows, but on Ubuntu I have no idea where those are kept.

So yeah, if I explained myself well enough, does anyone have a clarification on where this stuff is stored on Ubuntu, and how I can go in and alter it?"
6segg5,12,2017-08-08,Everything is bullshit,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6segg5/everything_is_bullshit/,"Not quite sure why, but I made an account today just to post some bullshit. 

I have serious depression and social anxiety. The meds don't really help. I smoke a lot of weed and drink almost every night. I hate my life even though it is probably awesome by other people's standards. This makes me feel worse. 

I got my bullshit degree in computer science. Realized it was bullshit halfway through but I took out loans so I half-assed it and finished while focusing on internships to help pay the loans. Fast forward 5 years and I am still in the same situation. I work as a software engineer at a major power company. I would rather die than sit in this cubicle another fucking minute. 

I have a family and a home, so I need to work to pay the mortgage and feed my daughter and wife. I am stuck. I hate this career, I hate spending most of my life in a cube working for evil rich men just to pay off debt. I have no say in my life at all. 40+ hours a week staring at a screen solving problems for people who would rather see me dead than have to help pay for my family's health insurance.

My fight or flight is always kicking in here. I take as-needed pills to calm me down but they don't work... I would rather be dead than feel trapped in this fucking cubicle, strong-armed into laboring for these disgusting tyrants. The pay is ""good"" but it is never enough to get out of debt. It was designed this way. I will still be paying these loans by the time my daughter is ready for school and then she will have the same fate as me.

I want to kill myself. I think about it every day. Years of sitting in a cube has broken me. There is no escape and this life is hopeless. 

The worst part is that my suicide fantasies/plans are getting more violent. I don't feel like it's my fault for this mental state. The people who make us toil our entire lives away in cubicles are the broken humans. I am going to kill myself one day. Is it wrong that I want to take out as many rich motherfuckers as I can with me? Do I even care if you think it is wrong? I don't see a point in living a miserable life every single fucking day just so some rich-born elites can have more numbers on their screens. 

Done ranting. Sorry."

[Breakup]",sirnumber,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6sehw0/20_f_with_my_exboyfriend_17_m_of_6_months_i_cant/,"For the last two weeks of the relationship, my ex has been fully aware of his actions and told me that he was self-aware that he was being an asshole to me. I'm sorry if this post ends up turning into a mess of events.



He stopped making time for me, he'd get mad and annoyed whenever I needed to talk to him, and continuously did things to hurt me.



Around this time, nothing he said or did added up anymore. They always conflicted; nothing made sense. There were signs of cheating and they continue to linger even after it ended. He'd go to an unpaid internship at 4:30 am and have meetings from 9:30 am to 4pm everyday. Come back to tell me that he would have to stay longer at work to work on something. Then later on tell me that he has another meeting. 6 am to 3pm days turned into 4am to 10:30 pm days everyday. Whenever he got home, he'd ask me to drop everything I was doing to spend 10 minutes with him while he was eating, so that he could go back to work right after. He showed me a picture of what he was working on the past 2 weeks, the reason why he stayed hours after work everyday, only to be sent a picture of an empty poster. He'd work on it at home and never progressed.


Three months prior to my birthday, he started to get my hopes up because he knew that I never celebrated my birthday. He'd always tell me that it'd be the best day of my life, that everyday would feel like my birthday. Knowing that he really got my hopes up and I really looked forward to that day, he continued to get my hopes up as the day got closer. Though, instead, he planned three parties on the day of my birthday for his co-workers. As my birthday inched closer, breaking up was an option for him. He brought it up a lot, telling me that he rather break up with me as opposed to spending time with me. That he rather go to the parties than to make memories with me even though all I asked for was to spend time with him. That he'd be miserable to spend time with me on my birthday. Prior to the party, he asked me if I'd still see him the day after even if we broke up and he kept making a point to see me the following day. 


In the middle of the day, he called me crying and begging if he could go to the party, even though he knew that I couldn't stop him. He told me that it was a once in a lifetime ordeal and he wanted a prize for his handwork at work. That asking me was to only make it seem like he made the decision with me, but really did not.


Here is the partial transcript of the call he made:

""i dont know if i can spend time with you today""

""would you see me tomorrow if we broke up""

""you have to realize how miserable i am if i want to  go back to not having you""

""idk why im like this but whenever i start talking to you, all i think about is sadness now""



The day before my birthday, he told me he'd have at least 4 hours to spend with me that day, so I waited for him, but he never came back. He came home that night, I noticed he was crying and I asked him why he was crying. He told me that he didn't actually want to go to a party he wasn't forced to go to, but decided to stay the full extent; I didn't buy it. 



I still promised him that I'd see him the following day, so we made plans on what he wanted to do. He knew he had intentions of ending it that day. After leaving me in the dark for the full extent of my birthday, he asked me if we could have sex the following day. Throughout the day, he dropped hints that he wanted to have sex with me. 



Whenever on dates, all I asked for was for phones to be kept away throughout the day, because at this point, I haven't seen him for at least three weeks because he kept finding excuses to go to work instead of spending time with me. We went to the movie theaters, I went to the bathroom and I noticed that he was on his phone responding to someone. This upset me because he wouldn't even give me 5 minutes out of his day to talk to me and wouldn't even make the time to send me a small text message. But for some reason, this person was so important to him to respond to. (Throughout the day of my birthday, he never talked to me and merely ignored me the whole day, except for the time he begged me to go. Even though knowing that he was on his phone the entire time, he never thought of messaging me at all.) As the movie started to progress, he started touching me and I knew I didn't want it. But let it continue because I thought it'd save the relationship. I knew it was ending. He kept asking me for a hand job, I complied in hopes to save the relationship, but he kept asking me for blowjobs, but I kept rejecting him while he kept asking why I wouldn't give it to him. 



I asked him if we could leave, so I could talk to him about the relationship outdoors. I told him how much he hurt me over the course of the past few weeks. How he purposely hurt me with full acknowledgment that he did. He mentioned how he wanted to do many things for me on my birthday, so I asked him for the list he was going to do for me. He took his phone out and he noticed that he received a lot of notifications from some girl talking to him. He shifted to the right so I wouldn't be able to see and clear his notifications. I just noticed the girl's name. We were always open about our phones and had access to each other's phones. This is coming from a guy who always read through my conversations, looked through my emails, and always asked me who I was talking to when I was playing online games with him. He would always get uncomfortable and insecure whenever I talked to others and merely told me not to talk to them. He made the point to tell me not to go out with my friends and to only run to him whenever I needed it. But Ive always heard him talking to someone, asking her to go with him, and asking her to go eat with him. 



Throughout the conversation of the breakup, I mentioned how I approached my ex for answers. As I didn't know what I was doing wrong anymore for him to treat me so badly. He told me that he felt insecure about this and asked me if he could read our conversations. I flipped out and said no. 



I always felt like I was there whenever he needed me or whenever he needed someone to talk to, I always picked up his calls whenever he called, but he never did the same for me. He accused me that I would only talk to him whenever it was convenient for me, but whenever I tried approaching him to talk to me, he'd push me away and get mad at me. He also told me I no longer liked spending time with him, but he never made time for me; I was always his second option. I didn't understand what was happening anymore. 



Fast forward to yesterday, I started talking to one of the girls he used to talk to as she was the only person I knew that he talked to before. I've never met any of his friends as he claimed that he had no friends. No one knew of my existence, but maybe only her. I found out that the beginning of our friendship was fake. He was talking to her prior of talking to me. He did the same things with her, and whatever she told him, he would tell me. He only started talking to me when she got busier and stopped talking to him. This made me think that he just jumps from girl to girl, saying the same words, doing the same things, trying to win them. I knew that at some point, he genuinely cared about me, but everything just feels fake now. He hasn't been going to school since fall and it just made me think that he was lonely, bored and horny. He always mentioned having sex and wanting to have sex. He always pushed for it. But since he got busier, he noticed that he no longer needed me anymore and has probably found someone else to screw over.


All throughout the relationship, he kept going back and forth, he'd tell me really hurtful things, telling me how he didn't love me, how he was depressed and sad to be with me, how miserable he was. But would always end those conversations telling me he loved me, he missed me, and how he needed me because he trusted me the most and was lonely. Soon those words became empty and I no longer believed it, that he only told those to me because he knew how important it was to me.

6sekay,1,2017-08-08,Tips on improving on Ana for console?,Brian0043,Overwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/6sekay/tips_on_improving_on_ana_for_console/,"     So I have played this game on console (Xbox) since the first Summer Games event (*ah the nostalgia*) and I have jumped around to different characters at different points. I also recently found a gaming cafe nearby while on my summer internship and I have had the opportunity to play overwatch on PC for a bit and I absolutely fell in love with Ana. I love her kit, and she feels immensely satisfying to play on PC with a mouse and keyboard. At least for me, this does not translate to console....at all. My accuracy on console is so much worse, which is to be expected, but it is almost infuriating that I can't actually properly play a character I now love, mostly because I don't have the right system for it.

     I want to get better as Ana on console because there is no chance I will be able to get a PC any time soon (totally saving up though, PC master race). Does anyone have any tips on improving with accuracy of her aiming or shots at all? I don't know if there is an easier/better set up for the accuracy and scoped accuracy or aim smoothing or whatever but if anyone has any advice or something to try I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks so much!"
6sekd0,6,2017-08-08,21F4A Lonely little intern with no one talk to.,ganjadarlin,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6sekd0/21f4a_lonely_little_intern_with_no_one_talk_to/,"I have only three days left of my internship, and it seems like the entire office is out on vacation. I'm sitting at my desk all alone. Actually, there's one other intern sitting right across from me, but we can't have the kind of conversation I want. Not exactly work appropriate. 

I want to talk about kinks, experiences, feelings, and just about anything else. We can talk about how you like picking out clothing for your girl to wear. Maybe you take care of other decisions for her as well, like who she can fuck and what she has to do when she wakes up or comes home. Maybe she does that for you instead. 

My sexuality is all over the place. I guess the correct labels are ""bisexual"" and ""switch,"" but I'm not really a fan of labels like that. I think I might prefer the term ""insatiable."" 

I'm not always submissive, but I generally am. Depends on who I'm with. When I'm in a submissive role, I like 1950s style misogyny, service/housewife role, slapping/spanking/flogging, being spit on, hair pulling, rough deepthroating/face fucking, non-con, *lots* of restraints/bondage/rope play, nipple clamps, pet play, collars, DD/lg, occasional bimbofication, etc. I also like roleplaying losing my virginity. Unbelievably fun. 

I don't have an ideal Dom. They're all different - some are cruel and rough, some sweet and gentle. Some a delicious combination of the two. Sometimes they break me down and force me into submission, sometimes I easily and eagerly submit. 

I can be very dominant myself. Mostly with women. But also sometimes with certain men. I don't know my dominant self as well as I know my submissive self (yet), but there are two main modes I've identified. 

The first is cold and uncaring. Usually with men. I like to toy with them, use them like an object that I often get bored with, completely disregard their desires and honestly just enjoy denying them fulflllment. I like to raise some hope and then dash it. Maybe after a long bout of teasing and denial I'll finally let them inside of me, only to force them off after a few seconds. I like seeing men reduced to a whimpering mess. It's embarrassingly easy. Even letting them eat me out is too much of a privilege - so instead I use a nice vibrator and make myself cum in front of them, only letting them get a few tastes now and then. Maybe they can suck on my toes though. It's not like they could make me cum anyway. I like ruining orgasms as well. 

My second mode usually comes out with women. I'm kind of a cocky douche. I fuck them the way I wish I was fucked by a lot of the disappointing men I've gone home with after a night of drinking and dancing. I pin them down, pull their hair, bite their nipples, grind on them, touch and grab and squeeze all over, flip them over and give them a few spanks, pin their wrists behind their back or above their head, use my hands and mouth on them until they're squirming and squealing and dripping all over themselves. I am the aggressor. I don't even care if I cum. 

This turned out to be much longer than I anticipated. I am not looking for a role play. I want someone I can talk to in full paragraphs about anything at all, but especially sex/sexuality. I don't have many people I can talk to in real life about all of this. I've only come out to a few people about being bi, and even fewer people about my more deviant tendencies. I am looking for substance, so please don't rush to get your message in first. I am more likely to respond to a well written message four hours from now than I am to a copypasta/generic message four minutes from now. Goes without saying, but no dick pics, kik requests, or anything else like that. 

I very much look forward to speaking with some of you. 

Edit: Wow, I'm getting some really incredible responses. It's going to take me some time to thoughtfully respond to all of you, so please be patient!

Also, since I'm going to college they loaded me up with a ton of college gear and care package stuff and cards. It was amazing, I felt like a kid at a birthday party. So my boss drops me off at my moms house and she takes the opportunity to try to use this good fortune to her advantage. 
She comes to my room all quiet and shy like, after looking though and gorging her eyes at the site of all the stuff. She hen gives me the same old tale of: 

""wow , isn't this amazing , look at how much they gave you, and only after knowing you for a summer . See the way you are, it's the way God made you, you are always so good with people , that's how I know your gonna be a doctor or a pharmacist, even just by talking to you, they are going to feel better."" 

Now this is the same bullshit she has tried to feed me for months on end for years in fact , just cause she wants to have a rich kid as a retirement fund and as a status symbol. Every time I talk to her and tell her why I WONT be doing that , she seemingly ignores it or gets angry. So this time instead of arguing or getting angry, I summon all the courage I can and I say, ""we've already talked about this ."" And she just goes on talking and talking while I with my stone cold, looking her dead in her eyes face just keep staring.  After a while she just leaves. I don't care who she thinks she is or what she thinks she knows about me, just doesn't just get to determine my life cause she feels like it, and she wants a fancy trophy son to tote around.

I feel so proud of myself guys, I worked a great job, with great people, who I loved working with and who loved me back and now I get to enjoy the fruits of my labor and I Grey rocked my N hard as fuck . And in two days I'm going to college 180 miles away. My hard work and suffering is really paying off. "

--------------------------------------

**XM** [October 2004](https://redd.it/6fq9sp)

--------------------------------------

* Ant has moved to Long Island.

* Jim is now mocking Steve C's perfect diction.

* They read a cringey Top 10 list of celebrities who would make good presidents, and [Donald Trump](https://youtu.be/al-ucERAlEE?t=1h40m58s) is on the list.

* Ziggy the homeless guy is dead 

* [Tony Danza ExtravaDanza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apNzWTl4O5M)

* Opie [sorta predicts Obama](https://youtu.be/FzvOmYO8bEM) 

* Ol' Dirty returns to the show, unfortunately.

* [Opie poker chip throwing incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txQ0ILYrxUs&amp;t=12s). Some superfan delivers an old couch to the studio so the boys will have a new Lesbian Couch. In her neediness, she brings poker chips as a gift for the boys that Opie promptly throws across the room. 

* [Ant hates Pablo Francisco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSj_UjiySHg)

* Opie complains about the state of the studio and the equipment fairly regularly to start the show.

* They ridicule Steve C's production since nearly all the sweepers involve rape, domestic violence, and gay sex

* They have a Jagermeister machine in studio and have Sex Bagel do a shot. 

* Stalker Patti is trying to find a job for Lady Di at Godiva, but she says she never got Di's resume in the mail. Di says she sent it last week and that she also sent an application for a crossing guard, which fools nobody. Patti is especially annoyed that Di continues to receive public assistance, as Di said in private that she doesn't want to get off it by finding a job. During their 6:30 am call, commotion is heard on the line and deflects and says she has a friend staying over for the night. This leads to a discussion on her alcoholism, and they beg her to stop drinking. Despite her face becoming increasingly swollen and flushed, she says she has cut back quite a bit on her drinking.

* It's a testament to how famous O&amp;A actually were that, even a month into their show, they continue to be bombarded with press requests from very prominent print and TV outlets.

* Ant hopes Hillary runs for president in 2008 because he thinks anybody can beat her. He expects Jeb Bush will run too. Jim predicts John McCain will run.

* They bring to the show a new event called Comedy in the Classroom, an initiative wherein standup comedians go to schools in awful urban neighborhoods to inspire students to be better contributors to society through hilarious and uplifting standup routines. [Naturally, this program attracts only the shittiest and most desperate of acts.](https://youtu.be/1p3uU03aXRE?t=3h22m45s) Vos says that his daughter saw one comic do a similar event at her school, Joe Matarese, and he was terrible. They go through the list of comics performing at this year’s and the first name that comes up is Joe De Rosa, who nobody knows, followed by Big Jay Oakerson.

* They mock XM executive Eric Logan for signing emails as E-Lo

* Anthony goes on a Stern rant and explains that they had a contract stipulation at WNEW that initially stated that they could talk about anybody openly however they chose. Once they began talking about Howard, however, Howard ran to Mel, and WNEW said that they couldn't talk about him. They threatened O&amp;A that, while they couldn't legally fire the two for talking about Stern, they would terminate their staff and Ken Stevens. Two years later, with Stern stuck on terrestrial until 2006, Ant yells, ""How's that feel fuckhead?""

* Ant says he's intimidated by Jerry Seinfeld and Jim tells a story of how a guy tried to get a picture with him and Seinfeld scolded him for putting his arm around his shoulder. 

* Opie says he was making $60,000 at WAAF and Ant says he was making $27,500, which was $2500 less than when he was making in construction 

* The Ozone Midget Sighting bit is, in which guys call in to say they saw a midget, is the go-to way for Opie to interrupt the pace of the show with content that is neither interesting nor probably even real.

* Jim brings Rent Boys to the show and makes staff read passages whenever they fuck up.

* Opie's [starfucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OinkrH50wo) story

* [Jim norton, Coffee Diva](https://youtu.be/mt0uXajwUWA) - featuring a far more racist Jim Norton than we know today.

* Opie says when the show ends, he and Ant will probably go their separate ways

* [Jim fantasizes about the members of KISS kicking him down the stairs and caring for him after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4iehtJzlQk)

* Jimmy has two imaginary friends, Jimmy Robinson who wore a cape, and Helen, a middle-aged woman with a beehive hairdo. 

* They always refer to rival Sirius as ""The Little Doggie Company""

* After O&amp;A have their fans show up to a Howard live event, outnumbering Howard's supporters in the process, Opie proclaims that it is time to launch an all out assault on the media through signs and public displays that spread the Virus

* [Bobby Kelly admits to fucking sinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmaHS6Xp08k)

* Black Earl is called for his opinion on [Malace in the Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPaZ4zRb5G0&amp;t=588s) and he gives them nothing 

* Anthony hates the term DUMBO and doesn't think it'll take off like TriBeCa and SoHo because it's too desolate in that area of Brooklyn. 

* After Tippy Tom jerks off and strips for the amusement of others, Opie justifies it by saying they gave him $20 and a bottle of Jager. [""I just don't have time""](https://youtu.be/TCJGU4Nf82k?t=22m12s)

* Ant asks a girl in-studio if she speaks Greek, and Opie follows by asking her to literally say something in Greek to prove it.

* [The Show We Can't Talk About](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mimI6bfyo00). The show wasn't that memorable, but Ant alludes several days later that they no longer will have the Jager machine in studio, since some things got out of hand. During the show, they tried to have Intern Danny have sex with a girl on-air, but he couldn't get it up. After the show ended, the legend is that Danny and Jim had sex with an underage girl who was blackout drunk.

* Ralphie May debuted on the Show We Can't Talk About, yelling into the mic. Di and Marion return. Marion is thinner and Di is half-dead and has a bruise on her face that she claims is from falling, but Ant is convinced there was a domestic dispute. Sex Bagel’s former band Wolfpac is in studio.

* David the High-Pitched Jewish Caller phones in for the first time during the 11/29 show.

* Ant says the only time he got arrested was driving with a license and registration that hadn't been renewed"

During graduate school I interned at a psychiatric hospital and it was incredibly draining, but many days I felt very gratified.

I went into social work saying that I wanted to be a therapist, but some days I really question this. 
I think being a new therapist I just feel like I lack skillset (although my internships taught me so much) but often I just don't know what to even say to a client or feel quite helpless as how to help them. I am getting supervision but I think I'm just realizing how difficult this work really is! 
I enjoy group therapy more - and I'm not sure if it's because it feels less.. uncomfortable and difficult? I'm not sure. 
Some days I feel like I really love this work and that I want to do this and that I can do this, but other days I just question if I will make a good therapist.

6sick6,2,2017-08-08,Considering getting a Surface Pro but I have some questions.,WigglerOnAcid,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/6sick6/considering_getting_a_surface_pro_but_i_have_some/,"I'm going into my junior year as a dual major in software development and cyber security and I need my laptop with me at all times. I've been rocking my MacBook Pro (running Windows most of the time via boot camp) for four and a half years now and it's just not ideal for me. It's big, bulky, and super heavy to bring around campus. Worst of all, the battery life is abysmal. I'm lucky to hit the 2 hour mark with battery saving mode on.

I've had my eyes on the Surface Pro for a few years now but was never in the market to buy a new laptop. However, I made a lot of money this summer from my internship and was thinking about finally cracking down to get a New Surface Pro. I'd mainly use it for programming, web development, web browsing, video streaming, some light graphic design/drawing, and some light gaming (mainly League of Legends). I currently cannot draw on my MacBook, it's annoying to haul around campus, it dies super fast, and it's starting to slow down a bit. I can get the New Surface Pro (i5/128gb/4gbram) for $900 after the student discount... the only issue is I'd need to invest in a type cover (and a pen later down the road). Best Buy also has the Surface 4 (same specs) with a type cover for $775 after student discounts. But I heard the New mode has a better battery life and better pen functionality for drawing.

What do you all think? Is it worth purchasing one? And if so, would the 4 be worth it or should I pay the extra money for the New model?

Thanks to everyone who read this and for any help!"
6sicr1,4,2017-08-08,I [20F] need help handling bouts of jealousy and anxiety when I hear about BF's [19M] summer adventures,nataliewhaddup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6sicr1/i_20f_need_help_handling_bouts_of_jealousy_and/,"I have never really posted in here before so bear with me with my wall of text...

This past summer I have been living about 3 hours from home, up at school, where I work at an internship for my current campus job. I accepted this promotion back in February, a time when my current long-term BF and I were on a break. My plan was to have the job as a fall-back, if we happened to still be separated, it would get my mind off of things and I could meet new people.. and if we patched things up (which we seriously did in April and everything is 1000x better) it looked like an opportunity to mature and experience living apart for a few months. 

Unfortunately, everything for me turned up sour.

I had already signed a lease for the summer months, something costing me around $300/mo. I also signed up for a class I needed to take; all my financial aid ran out so that ended up costing me around $3100 out of pocket. My internship did not pan out as expected, it was offered to me as full time, but when I got through my orientation, I was only getting about 20 hours a week. I pay for everything in my life myself, so getting my hours in each week is a necessity. My friends from work turned out being drunk assholes most of the time, so I never really had anyone to hang out with. Even if I wasn't at work, I was furiously studying for my class or doing massive amounts of homework each night.

Right away, I was disappointed, upset, and broke. The only light in my life was him; after we patched things up, we talked more often and took our relationship more seriously. I would wait up every night just to hear from him, and would always have my phone on me at work just to text throughout the day.

Over the whole summer, my BF was back home where we live, going on cruises and hanging out at his shore house. His family would always have little outings and he would be hanging out with his friends from high school. He made his first big purchase, a boat, something I am so happy for him about, and is always taking it out and working on it. 

Meanwhile, I would be alone on my couch eating a bagel and watching Tosh.0 in my pajamas.

As the weeks went on, I started to realize that I really did not enjoy hearing about what he was doing. It made me sick, in such a godawful selfish way.... I wanted to be doing those things with him, not fucking rotting away at a job that is barely covering my living expenses and falling asleep at night with tears in my eyes and mascara stains on my pillow. And I hate that I feel like this. 

I ended up taking off 2 separate weeks this summer to spend time with him at the shore and to see my family. It was lovely and great fun, but anxiety I get when I come back to my dark little apartment and sleep alone almost outweighs the joy I get from seeing him. I figured I would get over it as the summer went on, but it seems to have only gotten worse. 

We spent most of last week together, but I had to come back up here for work (it is the only thing keeping me here). So then over the weekend, he goes out with his brother and his girlfriend and hangs with them, and then now all three are going to the shore together for the week.

And I am up here, working. 

I just can't shake this terrible jealousy and anxiety I get from hearing about all of this. I think it is made worse by his brother's girlfriend.. it makes me feel like the odd-man out. They get to do everything while I sit up here alone. I want to get this thought process out of my head!! It's so caustic. I hate being like this and feeling so left out and upset. I just want to know if what I'm feeling is ridiculous or not, and if it isn't, just some advice would really help me right now. 

To clarify: My BF is truly the love of my life and he has not done a thing wrong, trust me. This has to do with my own feelings and how I'm perceiving things, I just don't want to damage this relationship by closing off my feelings.

6sj6u6,3,2017-08-09,Is it vital that one graduates with an IR/IS undergrad degree from a top program?,FrusturatedFreshman,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6sj6u6/is_it_vital_that_one_graduates_with_an_iris/,"Hello everyone, I apologize if this is not allowed. I lurk on this sub and realize that a lot of college students come here with questions - I am here to join their ranks.

Last May I completed my freshman year at a small liberal arts college. I will not list it so as not to doxx myself, but if someone asks me via PM I will share the information with you. Anyway, my college is not a particularly prestigious one, but it is well known in the region and has around 87/100 on US News and World Report in one of the ""Regional Colleges"" lists... Whatever that means. I have known that I wanted to double major in Economics and International Studies/Relations since I was in high school, and even though I got in to a few very good schools, such as Baylor and Boston College, I didn't receive any scholarships from these elite universities, and money was an issue for me, so I picked the college that gave me the most amount of financial aide - the liberal arts college that I attend now. I am an Economics and International Studies with Political Science double major, and I am actually quite close to a History minor as well. I would like to work for the US State Department or the CIA.

My college is quite small and I do not particularly enjoy the student body, I am very thankful that class sizes are small and I have easy access to my teachers. However, most of my teachers do not have a lot of experience in working on foreign policy - rather, they are all educators by trade, focusing on teaching students. I worry if this will put me at a disadvantage when compared with other graduates who took courses from well revered scholars and policy makers at places like Georgetown, Harvard, American University, etc. Additionally, my school's International Studies department is quite small, there are only about 7 students in my grade that are IS majors. There is no alumni group to network with, and my school is not located near New York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, or other cities that have events and organizations for internships and other opportunities to network. We are in a small bubble and I feel isolated from the world that I desperately want to be a part of.

There is one key advantage for me at my current school: I am a very personable and outgoing person, and I virtually always make a lasting positive impression on people that I meet. Because of this, I have developed a bit of ""big fish in a small pond"" reputation, and have already been granted the opportunity to go on a month long Study Abroad in Russia, where I researched their history and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This coming year I will be spending a semester as an exchange student at a university in France, taking economic courses on the EU and hopefully becoming fluent in French. I believe that I will have the opportunity to study abroad in Africa and Latin America in the coming years if I stay at my small liberal arts college, my professors quite like me.

So I am stuck with this dilemma - If I am interested in going to an elite University to obtain a Master's in IR, and then work in some branch of foreign service, is it a good idea to consider transferring to one of the strong International Relations/Affairs/Studies programs and graduating there for undergrad? I think that my networking possibilities would be a lot stronger. Or would you all recommend that I stay put, go on as many study abroad as possible, try to get terrific LOR's, and graduate with a high GPA and be ready to roll to grad school? I know a lot of people in the D.C. area who claim that it's only worth getting an IR/IS Master's if you go to a top 10 program - Hopkins, Georgetown, MIT, Harvard, etc.

Do you all have any insight? Am I being an idiot? For whatever it's worth, I don't have much of an attachment to my current school, I see college as a means to an end. 

I understand that at the end of the day, the decision to stay or transfer is my own, so I am not looking for someone to tell me what to do, rather for you all to reflect on your experiences and provide me some perspective. Thank you."
6sjm1u,149,2017-08-09,A Day at the Raidses: An Overview of the Average Outing,BattleActionHank,TheSilphRoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/6sjm1u/a_day_at_the_raidses_an_overview_of_the_average/,"When the gym rework first came out, I was in the middle of a 5-week internship in a different state, so I didn't give much thought into joining Facebook or Discord raid groups that I wouldn't be a part of after a few weeks anyways.  However, once I was back and wasn't traveling, I reached out, and shortly thereafter, legendary raids debuted.  I quickly learned that raiding has a culture all its own.  The following are my personal observations of what a typical day spent raiding looks like and some of the nuances of that culture, at least as they pertain to larger suburban areas.

Note: This synopsis is intended to be mildly satirical.

-Phase 1: The Search

So, you've got a couple free hours on a Saturday, and you want to get Moltres before its gone for who knows how long, but a quick scan of the nearby area shows only a Crocanw and an Arcanine.  Time to check the local net!  If your Discord is set up similar to ours, each raid tier has its own chatroom, with the more popular raids being divided into regions or districts, and should there be any sort of crossover, you'll definitely get a swift slap on the wrist from a moderator.  This initial search is likely the most difficult, as there may be several going on at a given time and by the time you make a decision on which one to go to, you've wasted about 10 minutes trying to figure out which one is the most practical.  Do I try for the one that's further out with a large group of people that ends in half an hour (can I make it there in half an hour?), or do I opt for one that's closer with more time, but doesn't seem to have anyone interested and hope that people show up and you're not left waiting there for an hour and a half with three other people?  But eventually, you make a decision, for fear of not doing any raids with your time off, and for better or worse, you move to Phase 2.

-Phase 2: En Route

Now you've settled on a group and informed them of your interest via the Discord chat.  You have an idea of how long it will take to get to the resemblance of an address you found in the chatroom, so that's what you tell the group waiting (who may or may not acknowledge that they'll be waiting for you).  You get in your car and Google Maps gives you a similar ETA, but once you hit the road, you hit just about every red light and traffic unusually high for some reason at 10 in the morning.  Constantly checking your clock, you realize that your ETA was hopelessly optimistic, and you continuously update on Discord how far out you now think you are, which still always happens to be longer than you'd like.  Eventually, you approach what you think is the area the raid will take place at and you immediately check one of 2 things: 1) Pokemon GO to see if the raid you're looking for is on the nearby, or 2) a large, out of place group of people.  You've finally connected with a group and can move onto Phase 3.

Note: If the group started the raid without you, basically return to Phase 1, but with the people in the group that are headed to another raid.

-Phase 3: Battle Planning

The way that this phase plays out typically depends on the number of people present.  If it's less than 6, you privately assume that other trainers won't be able to pull their weight and publicly suggest that we ""wait for more players.""  Ideal raid size is typically about 12 +/- 3.  However, you'll often find that suddenly, the group randomly increases in size from less than 10 to about 18 or more, with more on the way.  At this point, splitting the group is usually taken into consideration, and if this route is taken, the groups are split by team to promote increased Premiere Ball count and to screw over Instinct (sorry, guys).  When everyone is believed to be present, one person typically channels an action movie star and announces they're ""Goin' in,"" and everyone going in with them follows suit.  Multiple groups may start a couple different ways, typically employing the private group method or the staggered start method.  Either works, as long as the raid timer isn't an issue.  Once in, Phase 4 in initiated.

-Phase 4: The Raid

Once in the lobby, you have between 112 and 79 seconds to pick your team (there's always that one guy that jumped the gun on committing their raid pass).  This process usually consists of everyone telling everyone else which Pokemon they should use and occasionally informing the group that Blissey isn't a real Pokemon.  Also, some trainers are likely to error out with 23 seconds on the clock, at which time almost everyone backs out to try and get the unfortunate soul back in a lobby with people.  I say almost everyone, because usually the message escapes one or two people who try to go it alone until they realize they missed a memo after a couple seconds.  With about 3 seconds left on the clock, a countdown will typically be heard, along with ""good lucks"" and ""here we goes.""  During the actual battle, everyone is too focused on spamming attacks to really say anything other than expressing their saltiness about getting dodge glitches or anger that someone's using a Blissey.  But eventually, the raid boss's HP hits zero, when everyone says ""He's down!"" and wishes everyone else more good luck as Phase 5 Begins.

-Phase 5: Commence RNG

For centuries, scholars have studied to no avail the mysteries of how sometimes you can get 30 revives after a tier 5 raid battle, and nothing else.  Rare candies and golden razz berries typically prompt no response, unless none either are received at all, while TM's have mixed, though usually positive responses.  Equally mysterious as the item acquisition process is the Premiere Ball distribution, which has the potential to give you 8 balls at a gym your team controls and when your team did the most damage, or 11 balls at a gym you don't control and when your team was vastly outnumbered in the raid.    Regardless of the ball distribution, everyone has a different method for attempting to catch the raid boss, with degrees of success that vary wildly.  I've met someone who was 0/12 on Articuno before he finally caught one, while I'm currently 5/6 for each of the 3 Kanto birds.  There'll be the trainers that are out of balls in less than a minute, while other trainers still have balls after almost 10 minutes.  After they finish, everyone shares whether they were successful or not and begins the search all over again.  This time, however, going to a raid in a group is much more flexible than going to one by yourself, because you know that you'll be at the next one the same time as a bunch of other people, making returning to Phases 1 and 2 a little less hectic.  These phases are repeated until you decide to leave the group, at which point be sure to thank everyone for their help, because the point of raids is that you're not supposed to do them alone.

Anyways, this has been my experience with raid groups and culture.  Does this sound accurate?  Of not, what has been other peoples' experience?  Thanks, travelers, and good hunting!"
6sk3sl,12,2017-08-09,I'm an Intern and I haven't done shit for 2 weeks straight now. [Conflicted],HowDoIPickAgoodName,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6sk3sl/im_an_intern_and_i_havent_done_shit_for_2_weeks/,"I just scored an Internship at an airport's IT department and judging by their requirements and the forms I had to fill out they were looking for someone qualified, which I am. I live in a country where there's technical schools where you learn actual technical knowledge, and I'm currently getting an IT education in one of those (an IT-specific internship is a forced requirement there). 

So I arrived at the place and the first day was pretty great, I was shown around the building and even got to see the multi-million server room, then I had to go through a tideous 3-hour ""security briefing"", then got my ID card. 
Second day, ""yeah, no, you'll get some work tomorrow"". 
Third day, a little bit of work, comparing an old list of the virtual servers they were running to their current DB and checking how many are just not listed and how many have been decommissioned etc..., this took me 2 days. 
On the fifth day, I did some Inventory stuff, catalogueing their leftover Cisco stuff and so forth. 

The next week, I got another job to use a visualization software to visualise a few of their their services before they automate that job. 

Since then, my ""boss"" E-Mailed me a path to a network share that ""I'd need for my next job"",  to which I didn't have access rights. I mailed the responsible Admin, and he hasn't responded for 2 weeks straight, despite him defintely responding to all my other E-Mails on other issues.

 I've done nothing since then. I think I've been through my 3 hour playlist about 30 times now, browsing various sites and forums, occasionally playing some browsergames when the office is a little less busy and nobody is questioning me. On one hand, I'm feeling like a fraud for not even asking for another thing to do in those 2 weeks. On the other hand, it's not exactly my fault that i can't do my work, and I'm a bit lazier of a guy anyways."
6skbja,5,2017-08-09,"Some Thoughts about the Earthquakes Occurred in Sichuan, China ---in the Eye of the One Who Experienced Them",irisfantang,Earthquakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earthquakes/comments/6skbja/some_thoughts_about_the_earthquakes_occurred_in/,"In 2008, my home town Pingwu County, the center of the biggest remaining giant panda habitat in China, was struck by a deadly earthquake, the world known Wenchuan Earthquake. As a child, I was shocked by the sudden catastrophic accident dwelling to the local environment and wildlife. Ever since 2008, another two biggest earthquakes happened on 20th, April, 2013 in Yaan, and 8th, August, 2017 in Jiuzhaigou. Unfortunately, I have been through two of three in 2008 and 2017.

Firstly I want to talk about the earthquake that just happened. I’m currently working as an intern in Old Creek Reserve which is located in Laohegou, Pingwu, Mianyang, Sichuan. Because I had a cold, I was lying in my bed getting ready to sleep earlier than usual when the earthquake happened.I could feel the intense wobble that caused the bunk bed to shake. After about 4 seconds, one of the interns shouted “ what’s going on? ” “earthquake.” I replied unflappably. Then she popped up and everyone ran outside

We gathered around talking about everything had happened. Most got shocked on account of having little or no experience in having been around during an earthquake. “ OMG! I’m so freaked out!” “ I’m going to talk to my family.” “I’m not going to sleep today.”I called my mom and she said there was no big problem, just some shock felt and people running out. “ When you stay in Sichuan for long ,you’ll get used to it. It’s no big deal.” One of the local staff said.

 “ That is true. The reaction when Sichuan people experience one earthquake is like this.”
The 1st second ,“what’s going on?” 
The 2nd , “shit, earthquake!” 
The 3rd, “run or stay?”
The 4th, “ wait a sec.” 
The 5th ,“fu*k, it’s shaking stronger!” 
The 6th ,“boy, run!” 

It’s kind of funny we talk about earthquake in this way, but it is true that we’ve got this positive attitude. We are just so eased. Afterwards, I opened up the weibo to search for more information about the disaster. Basically, the top topics are earthquake in Jiuzhaigou, rumors about the earthquake, optimistic Sichuan people, prayers and some touching stories that happened during the earthquake, etc. One topic says “ Sichuan people, how are you holding up?” Maybe we are used to it or maybe it’s our attitude. After all, as long as you are alive then things will not be worse.

Let’s just go back to the 12th, May, 2008. I was 13 at that time, a middle school student full of longing and curiosity. The earthquake happened in the afternoon right during the first class which was geography. I still remember the teacher talking about some seismic knowledge before the terrifying catastrophe. I felt my chair was constantly hit by something so I believed it was my friend who was behind me.

“What are you doing with my chair?
“No, I’m not.” 
“Anything wrong with you?”
“What! I am reading the book.”
“Do you feel the strike?” I asked my deskmate.
“ I thought it was someone did on purpose.”

At the first minute we just talked crap like this and blame each other, thinking it was a trick. All of a sudden, a strong tremor happened and we knew it could never have been a joke. We were just stuck and couldn’t move an inch.

“squat down!” somebody shouted.
We promptly squat under the desks.

I have to say that it was silly. What happened next was we were the last group of students who got out. It was all a mess. Everyone was crying and shouting.  I just remembered that I held one girl in my arm who kept saying her scares and worries. “ Your family will be fine.” Those were the only words I had to comfort her. 

I was calm compared to my peers but there will always be a moment that makes me restless.When my parents were apart from me, I felt this way. My father is a high school teacher so he had to take care of his students, considering that those students got no way back home because of the damage. My mother works for government and patrolling the condition of disaster was her responsibility. After the earthquake, I lived with my grandparents and aunt in huge tent, there were approximately 100 people in it. My grandma frequently said “ when is your mom coming back?” “ I don’t know.” I was depressed. The first month I only got to see my parents once. It was hard when your family wasn’t together to face that.

You will never know what comes first, tomorrow or the horrors. Unavoidably, the secondary disaster occurred. Storm, shower and falling rocks. We saw people die. I was told one of my relatives was hit by a huge falling rock right in front of his son. What a tragedy! Last night we fell asleep calmly in tent until dawn and found we were trapped by a flood. One second, we could read a book or listen to some music at peace and the next second we escaped and screamed. A lot of things happened accidentally, swiftly, and violently. We are so vulnerable in the face of nature’s wrath.

“God is roaring again.” Old people described like this. Yeah, why is he so mad about everything? Who would be responsible for that?

I looked through the weibo right after the earthquake happened last night. It is reported there are rumors made up by immoral people. Some people even make profit from it through messages. People just act so coldly and indifferently. 

I feel like I should correct people’s prejudices towards Sichuan people. We don’t want to go though a disaster like this , nobody does. It is not funny to make jokes on people who suffered so much. Some people are afraid to even visit Sichuan. Comments like “ It’s a horrible place , you’ll get killed to go there!” “The last place I wanna visit is Sichuan.” are pretty common. 

Oppositely, additional rescuers rushed overnight to the quake-hit region. This time my hometown, as a vital traffic fort and key to lifeline, helps offer material assistance to tourists from Jiuzhaigou. Wherever there is love and care, there is a way-out.

Beyond all doubt, we must admit how cruel and greedy human is as we consistently squeeze nutrients from nature. We are not supposed to blame anyone since we have already been part of the evil. When you see blood and flesh，you will know the pain that it brings to a person who is still alive with no family. I’ve never been that hurt but it makes me sympathetic. Now the common phenomenon is people with numb hearts remain alive but people with sorrowful hearts experience grave loss. I am not saying people literally choose to ignore everything. Instead, I am saying we need to have a sympathetic heart to do the right things. 

There is much on my mind about those earthquakes, but words fail me. I feel sad about what people think of Sichuan. I am definitely not criticizing people’s reaction. There is no good or bad. I love my hometown and want no harm to her. "
6skil6,0,2017-08-09,Gay Escorting Advice,gayescortthrowaway91,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6skil6/gay_escorting_advice/,"So hear me out.

I'm a 26 year-old guy from the London area who's currently going through a bit of a career change. Not in serious money trouble but for the next 6-12 months I'm going to be cutting my pay in half in order to pursue something new, this is in an expensive city with not much savings and some credit card/bank overdraft debt (nothing massive - like £2,000 in debt and maybe £500-1,000 in liquid savings).

As a result of the above I moved home about 6 months ago but this is massively inconvenient and much as I love my parents and they are very kind and supportive, I just increasingly find it difficult being at home. I feel like I can't be my full adult self - it's hard to explain but I feel infantilised and restricted. My parents are also fairly old (dad is approaching 70 and not yet retired) and I hate feeling like I scrounge off of them - I have a job and work for my own money but don't pay rent, bills etc. I need to put myself in a situation fairly soon where I can be almost completely financially independent.

If I wanted to move out in less than 12 months I am going to need to pay down debts and build up a slightly larger savings cushion. I'm aiming for a paid internship for 3 months to get me on the ladder I want to be on, but we are talking about earning around £1300 a month after tax - not nearly enough to live on in London without constant financial stress, let alone improve my financial situation.

Some time ago I met up with an older guy a few times for sex - he was a sort of theatre maven but one of those older gay men who seem to have done a bewildering variety of things in his long years. Well he told me that he used to work with an agency that sourced 'higher-end' escorts for the more discerning client.

He sort of said to me that if I was that way inclined it might be something I would consider. At the time I was earning well so thought nothing more of it. But now I am seriously thinking about seeing if he still knows people in the business.

I could never be a proper rent boy as I'm no adonis or young blonde twink, I couldn't command good prices in that world, so really not worth my time to turn a cheap £50-£80 quid trick for some beer money. 

But (please forgive my terribly un-British immodesty for a moment), I'm fairly handsome (mixed race asian, this seems to go down well with the older dudes), go to the gym, I've a degree from Oxford, am privately educated, fairly cultured and relatively well-traveled, and I actually rather enjoy spending time with gay men 20-30 years my senior, shagged a few of them and really quite enjoy hearing a good story over a drink or dinner from a man who's seen it all. What is it they say; ""if you're good at something don't do it for free""?

I don't want to appear naive - I know its not all easy. And that you need to somehow work out whether your employer will actually make sure you don't get murdered or be clear with clients on protecting your sexual health. And of course I have to really be sure with myself that I am ok selling myself for sex or company.

So my question gaybros - do any of you have any experience in this area? And what do you think of my predicament?"

6skzp7,5,2017-08-09,There's always hope - my positive story,Nottherealme86,Felons,https://www.reddit.com/r/Felons/comments/6skzp7/theres_always_hope_my_positive_story/,"I found myself in a sudden depression yesterday about my criminal past and what that means for my future.  I have to go to an upcoming project for work and there's a small chance they might do a background check to gain access.  It made me think about what I've overcome though and I wanted to share.

I was arrested at 22 for manufacture/delivery of cocaine.  I did it, not going to lie about that.  What I got caught doing was such a small fraction of what I had actually been engaging in, I was young and stupid and thought I was invincible.  I was just about to start my final semester of college.  The school immediately suspended me for one year and my employer terminated me for coincidentally unrelated reasons at the same time.  I spent the next nine months waiting tables and going to court appointments until my plea bargain/conviction.  

My sentence was a felony conviction and nine months in county jail with a work release program, as well as two years probation.  I spent the first four months working six days a week to get out every day.  I had a girlfriend, now my wife, who committed to driving me to and from jail 45 minutes away every single day day for the first six months as my license was suspended.

I reapplied and was accepted back to my school.  My guidance counselor was amazing and writing letters to the jail about how I needed all the time they would allow for studying and being out every day.  It really made a huge difference.  I also needed an internship over the summer to finish my degree.  I interviewed and was offered the job while still finishing the last month of my sentence.  When I contacted them about signing the work release paperwork, they bawked and pulled out the offer.  I was devastated.  I continued waiting tables through the summer and the end of my jail sentence.  

I kept applying for internships.  Eventually I found one four hours away and they interviewed and hired me on the spot.  I told them right then and there about my conviction and being a smaller company, the owner said it would not be a problem.  What a RELIEF!!  I ended up working there for six months, past my internship end date and graduation because they liked me so much.  I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE!!!!

While still working there I was applying for jobs to start my career.  I interviewed with a large steel company 1000 miles away and they offered me a job.  I checked the 'yes' box on the felony question and even had to do a psyche evaluation, but they still hired me.  We never specifically talked about my conviction though.  I didn't fill out background paperwork so I didn't feel I should mention it.  I packed up my car and moved away to start my new life.  

On my third day of work, my probation office called over to my new employer to confirm my employment (standard practice when requesting to move probation offices to a new county and state).  This apparently triggered a chain of events that caused them to go back and review my application.  I was called into an office and told that because of these events my employment was terminated immediately.  They gave me a check for my troubles and sent me packing.  I cried for probably half of the 18 hour drive back home.  I was devastated.  This was going to be my life.  I come from a middle class suburban family and I could see the disappointment on my parents faces.  What was going to happen to their son?

I spent three months at home applying for jobs, when finally I found one about two hours away.  They were again a smaller employer and after interviews and a job offer, I immediately told them about my conviction.  They thanked me for my honesty and said they'd get back to me.  Well....they did, and they brought me on.  I was ecstatic.  My girlfriend and I moved up to our new town and started our life together.

I worked their five years, and never had another issue with my background.  Finished probation, bought a house, and got engaged.

Two years ago my wife and I decided to move back to our home area.  She got a job right away and I started that nervous stress.  There was a local employer that I very much had always wanted to work for and they just so happen to have an opening.  I applied, interviewed and was offered the job.  I didn't say anything and just filled out the background paperwork and waited.  Three days later my supervisor called me personally and wanted to talk about the information he was given.  I explained to him honestly that I was a dumb kid and made a huge mistake.  I had learned from it and choose to believe that it has made me a better and more committed person.  That was what he needed to hear.  He confirmed my hiring right there.

So, nine years after my arrest, I'm doing well.  Lots of bumps in the road, but I'm where I hope I could be.  I make around $85K a year, own a $370K house, have two beautiful kids, and my superstar of a wife stuck with me all the way. 

There will be more bumps, I know this.  But I choose to remain optimistic and know that I will prevail.  Everyone else can do the same.  Don't lie on applications, it will never work out.  Try to talk to them face to face about what they will see on the background check anyway.  You can explain what happened and what you've learned from it.  And honestly the mega corporations are always going to be more difficult because some faceless person you never meet is making the decision about whether you can work there.  Try the smaller shops and local businesses first.  Get that experience that can then be maneuvered into better jobs down the road.

And don't give up hope!!!"

#Coaching Changes

* David Culley left the team and has moved on to the Buffalo Bills. He was the Assistant Head Coach and WR Coach but will be the new QB Coach for Buffalo. Former NFL WR Greg Lewis moves from Philadelphia to Kansas City to replace the departing David Culley as Wide Receivers coach. Having been a player for Reid he knows the system well and should fit in perfectly. 

* Mike Kafka will be the new Offensive Quality Control coach. Prior to joining the Chiefs, Kafka was a grad assistant for Northwestern University and had a six year NFL career as a backup QB for multiple teams.
 
* Rod Wilson joins the Chiefs as an assistant special teams coach. Prior to joining the Chiefs, Wilson coached safeties and inside linebackers for four seasons at Charleston Southern. He also had a six year career in the NFL as special teams player for Chicago and Tampa. 

* New Role: Both Brad Childress and Matt Nagy received promotions this off season. Childress went from the Co-Offensive Coordinator to the Assistant Head Coach and Nagy went from Co-Offensive Coordinator to Offensive Coordinator. While Nagy is Offensive Coordinator, make no mistake; Andy Reid is still in charge of play calling. This has always been an area of concern for Chiefs fans. It is hard to manage a whole team while calling plays. Being the play caller also exacerbates Reid’s issue with time management, so we will have to see how Nagy’s affects game day coaching.

#Players Lost or Cut

Name|Position|New team 
:--|:--|:-- 
Dontari Poe|NT|Atlanta Falcons 
Jamaal Charles|RB|Denver Broncos 
Jaye Howard|DE|Chicago Bears 
Knile Davis|RB|Pittsburgh Steelers 
Nick Foles|QB|Philadelphia Eagles 
Jeremy Maclin|WR|Baltimore Ravens 
Kendall Reyes|DE|Unsigned 
 
* Dontari Poe - The biggest hit the Chiefs took was the loss of Dontari Poe, but it is not as significant as one may initially think. When Poe first exploded on the scene, he was nightmare for opposing teams. His combination of power, size, and insane speed for a big man made him a scary NT. However, at 6’3” and 350 lbs, he has shown to be susceptible to injuries; specifically, a back injury that held Poe to his worst statistical year since his rookie season. If Poe reverses his decline, the Falcons have signed a defensive monster, so we will have to wait to pass judgement on this loss. 
 
* Jamaal Charles -  Charles had another knee injury that wasted another season for the talented RB. With the end of his contract, the Chiefs believed the risk was not worth the reward, so Charles was released. He quickly signed with the Broncos, which could prove harmful for the Chiefs if Charles can come back with revenge on the mind 
 
* Jaye Howard – After only starting 5 games recording 1 sack and 18 tackles Howard was place on IR in Dec of 2016 with a hip injury. With the emergence of young rookie standout Chris Jones, Howard no longer made sense for the Chiefs to keep. 
 
* Knile Davis – What a year Davis had playing for the Chiefs, then the Packers, then the Jets and then the Chiefs again. Knile is a journeyman and our backfield is crowded simple as that. I've read some good things about him in Pittsburgh though, so good luck to him. I think most Chiefs fans will fondly remember him for his opening kick return in the wild card round @ Houston and hating him for fumbling at critical moments in playoff games @IND and @NE.  
 
* Nick Foles – Backing up Alex in 2016 and starting one game Nick Foles was an easy cut due to a high cap hit. His time in KC was brief and the game he started was painful to watch but good luck to him back in Philly with the Igles in a backup role. 
 
* Jeremy Maclin -  Maclin had a disappointing season with the Chiefs only starting 12 games, but honestly was not being used effectively last season. Couple that with a lack in cap space, the Chiefs were forced to part ways with Maclin, who has now landed with the Ravens.

Mike Person|G|1 yr/850K 
Josh Mauga|ILB|1 yr/775K 
Jarvis Jenkins|DE|1 yr/825K 
 
* Eric Berry - Signing Eric Berry was the single biggest accomplishment for the Chiefs this off-season. While many people were scared by the price tag to retain Berry there is no question that the Chiefs will continue to possess one of the top secondaries in the game. He is the heart and soul of KC defense and since coming back from his bout with cancer he has consistently improved upon his game. 
 
* Laurent Duvernay-Tardif - LDT is very solid guard, but that’s not why he is interesting. While LDT has been playing football, he also has been a full-time med school student at McGill. He should be finished by 2018 where he will have some career options. He cannot do his residency while playing football, so it will be interesting to see where life takes him. We have seen a string of players retiring early in their careers, so will LDT follow that path? If he suffers any moderate/severe injuries I would not put it past him to start thinking about life after football. Although when asked he has stated, ""I signed for a five-year extension, and I plan on playing those five years"". 
 
* Daniel Sorenson – An outstanding safety who has complimented the safety duo of Parker and Berry with a knack for being a play maker himself. In 2016 he recorded 2FF, 3FR, a sack, 3 INTs and a defensive TD. With the Chiefs falling into the ""Big Nickel"" trend, Sorenson will be a key part in the Chiefs defense next season. 
 
* Albert Wilson – Likely to spend some time in the WR slot position this season Wilson brings three seasons of experience with him to a group of very young receivers. 
 
* Cairo Santos – Our little Brazilian buddy. Making 31/35 FGs last season and 2 for 2 beyond the 50, we are glad to have him back. 
 
* James Winchester – We locked up our LS guys... arguably bigger than signing Berry but sports media doesn't seem to understand the importance of the LS position. A guy with the last name Winchester was born for this role.
 
The other guys are camp bodies and all roster bubble guys, we'll see how it pans out for them.

Andrew Tiller|G|1yr/690K 
De'Vante Bausby|CB|1yr/540K
Roy Miller|DT|1yr/1.4M 
 
* Bennie Logan – Logan comes in to try out for a year at replacing Dontari Poe at NT. He should see plenty of play time and should hopefully be an upgrade on the DL for Poe who was rated the worst D-lineman on our line by PFF last season.  
 
* CJ Spiller – Many thought Spiller was going to go to camp and then be cut shortly after but not so fast. Spiller has actually looked pretty good at camp. Today CJ caught a 20 yard pass from Patrick Mahomes and ""With defensive backs swarming, Spiller darted across the middle, then danced past the remaining defenders for a 98-yard score."" Maybe our new RB3 
 
* Gavin Escobar – Another guy showing out at camp. He's been out there making catches [like this](https://twitter.com/davidphotokc/status/891306980584935426/photo/1) and scoring TDs all over. Definitely a buzz around Escobar, could force his way into the TE2 spot and play a role in a very TE friendly offense. 
 
**Other Notable contract activity** 
 
* Starting ILB Derrick Johnson and FB Anthony Sherman took one for the team and restructured to help with a tight cap situation. DJ took his base salary from 4.75M down to 1M and a 1M up front signing bonus, the last year of his contract in 2018 remains unaffected. Anthony Sherman reduced his base salary from 1.5M to 1.1M and cut his game bonuses in half. 

#DRAFT OVERVIEW

##Round 1 Pick 10 Patrick Mahomes II, Texas Tech QB - [Draft Profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/patrick-mahomes?id=2558125) - [Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdlpfRRLGHY)

The Chiefs traded a third and next year’s first to move up 17 spots and draft Mahomes. Pat Mahomes has a cannon for an arm but has a ton to learn at the NFL level. He played in an Air Raid offense at Tech so he will have to learn how to play under center in the NFL. He threw for 41 TDs and only 10 interceptions on 591 attempts and led the NCAA in passing yards by almost 400. There are some mechanical issues he has that need to be tweaked. He came to the perfect team with Alex Smith under contract for 2 years and Andy Reid, QB Whisperer, as a head coach. It will be fun to see if he can usurp Tyler Bray as QB2 in the preseason.

##Round 2 Pick 59 Tanoh Kpassagnon, DE, Villanova - [Draft Profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/tanoh-kpassagnon?id=2558185) - [Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb5-F0V47CI)

At 6’7”, 289 lbs, 4.83 second 40. This man is a MONSTER. Kpassagnon(pronounced pass-n-yo) is very raw and has a lot to work on; he was drafted in the second round because he showed a lot of improvement throughout his college career and he is arguably the physically most impressive player in the draft. He should get some snaps on the defensive line this year but I wouldn’t expect him to be a consistent name on the line for at least his first season. If he can continue to improve as he did in college this could be a very good pick for the Chiefs.

##Round 3 Pick 86 Kareem Hunt, RB, Toledo - [Draft Profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/kareem-hunt?id=2557917) – [Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL9ACFNs3hc)

The Chiefs traded three picks to move up 18 spots and choose Kareem Hunt in the third round. Former GM John Dorsey said Hunt was their top second tier running back on the Chiefs draft board. Hunt shows very good vision and while he does not have the same level of big play ability of Dalvin or CMC. He has shown very good elusiveness as shown by his 2nd in the nation 98 missed tackles forced. Hunt is the most likely of the Chiefs picks to make major contributions to the team this season and should compete with Spencer Ware for RB1.

##Round 4 Pick 139 Jehu Chesson, WR, Michigan - [Draft Profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/jehu-chesson?id=2557866) – [Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnafPGoqLAk)

The Chiefs traded up for the third time in the draft to select Jehu Chesson. Chesson had a tremendous junior season but injured his knee towards the end of it and looked to be a step slower in his senior season. Chesson is a really good special teams guy which played a large part in him being drafted. If he can regain the athleticism he had his junior year he could really push Albert Wilson and De’Anthony Thomas for the WR3 position.

##Round 5 Pick 183 Ukeme Eligwe, LB, Georgia Southern - [Draft Profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/ukeme-eligwe?id=2558097) – [Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZCxBb2gTkE)

Following a common theme in this draft the Chiefs traded TE James O’Shaugnessy and a 6th rounder to move up into the 5th round where they selected Ukeme Eligwe. Eligwe was a highly touted recruit coming out of high school and going into Florida State. After three years at Florida State he was dismissed for violating team rules and transferred to Georgia Southern. He led Georgia southern in tackles, tackles for loss and forced fumbles last season and should add depth to our very thin interior linebacker corps.

##Round 6 Pick 218 Leon McQuay, DB, USC - [Draft Profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/leon-mcquay-iii?id=2558134) – [“Highlights”](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-draft/0ap3000000804906/Chiefs-select-Leon-McQuay-III-No-218-In-the-2017-NFL-Draft)

McQuay comes in to a team that returns its top six CBs and top four Safeties from a season ago. McQuay has really good size and athleticism and was often used in slot coverage at USC. He looks to play a large role on special teams and should get some looks as a nickelback.

#Other News Stories

**Andy Reid received a 5 year, $37.5 million contract extension** ensuring Big Red will be around for a long time. 

The Chiefs then shocked the NFL community by releasing GM John Dorsey who had been with the team since 2013. The motives behind this are still not clear, but it is rumored to be a combination of poor salary cap management and philosophical differences in player contract management with owner Clark Hunt. Brett Veach was hired internally to fill the GM spot.

Former NFL QB Mike Vick joins the Chiefs as a coaching intern at training camp.

* This is my way too early 53 man roster projection. There are some really *REALLY* deep positions on this team. I have a feeling the Chiefs will go deep on the DLine and LB corps due to injuries depleting them the last two seasons and it having serious adverse affects on the run defense as the season wore on. Also, keeping those groups fresh and rotating is a big part of our defensive strategy. I didn't want to bore everyone with a paragraph on each player. I doubt I can tell you anything about Tyreek Hill or Travis Kelce that you didn't already know. Instead I'll just talk about a few guys stepping up this year that you might not know about. Kind of a ""look out for him"".
 
* **WR2 Chris Conley**, he's going to have a good year. Defenses are going to key in on Hill and Kelce and Conley will be open. Conley is a smart kid and I believe with his strong understanding of the offense, good route running and great hands he'll really step up into that WR2 role really nicely this year. 
 
* **LG Parker Ehinger** is coming back from an ACL tear in week 8 of last season in his rookie year. This is the guy that really flew under the radar on our line. He is an above average run blocker that seemed to really be progressing in pass blocking before he went down. Our run game went stagnant the second half of last season and Parker Ehinger going down was definitely one of the reasons why. If he comes back healthy with a season now under his belt I have high hopes for this year's Oline. 
 
*  **DE Chris Jones** lit the line on fire last season. Chris Jones graded out at 84.4 and the #17 Dlineman in the NFL last year by PFF. He started 11 games and played just over 51% of defensive snaps. In that time he was able to generate 14 hurries, 2 sacks, 4 passes defensed and [take Cam Newton's lunch money.](https://res.cloudinary.com/cmgverticals/image/upload/f_auto,q_80/v1481549760/ChrisJonesSack1_v7lnkc.gif) Chris is poised for a breakout year as a full time starter and another scary addition to one of the most feared pass rushes in the league already. He's also [an extremely likable and funny individual.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg3zdXORsR4)

* **CB2 Terrance Mitchell**, man did this kid come out of nowhere last year. I was legitimately worried about the right side of our secondary. Before the season started Phillip Gaines had CB2 as his job to lose without really much competition then Emmanuel Sanders and the Bronco WRs absolutely torched him (for over 200 yards), nearly losing the Chiefs the game. Some say pieces of burnt Gaines are still being found at Mile High.  In steps Terrance Mitchell... who? A journeyman who was let go by Dallas (twice), Chicago and Houston. Just a guy that would end up holding Amari Cooper to 24 yards on five targets, Demaryious Thomas to 14 yards on four targets and Antonio Brown to zero yards on two targets. In 295 snaps played he allowed a 55.5 passer rating and a 42.9 completion percent on balls thrown his way. There's no guarantee he's able to duplicate his success but CB2 is his job to lose. If he does continue last season's success the Chiefs secondary could elevate to one of the best in the NFL with Peters, Berry and Parker already solidified as top tier DBs.

#Team Strengths and Weaknesses

##Strengths

###Defensive Backfield

The Chiefs have one of the best secondaries in the league. With a starting unit of Eric Berry, Ron Parker, Marcus Peters and Terrance Mitchell there isn’t a lot for an opposing QB to look forward to when game planning for the chiefs. Entering his third-year Marcus Peters is one of the top corners in the league. In his rookie year, he developed a deserved reputation of being a high risk-high reward type of player because he would either get the interception or give up a catch. In his second season this was not the case. He has developed into more of a shutdown corner and after the game against the Texans last season QBs all but abandoned throwing his way. Even when QBs weren’t throwing at him he was still making [game changing plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJrhtOtrde0&amp;t=2s). Alongside Peters is Eric Berry who is the [heart and soul]( https://youtu.be/WoHD1tQvXt4?t=6s) of the team. He plays all over the field, playing deep to act as a [ballhawk]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6u9GQ7N258) or he can come up to the line and [blow up the run](https://youtu.be/RSgRpImXZ3Y?t=2m18s). [He will also blow up your well set up screens]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuE7t4m8bLE). Last season the Chiefs struggled to find a suitable CB2 across from Peters but Terrance Mitchell came on late last season and showed that he can [hold his own]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqBU5jGEvvo) against [the best competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edPPofz5eLg).

###Special Teams

The Chiefs have probably the best special teams coach in the league in Dave Toub. Kicker Cairo Santos placed near the top of the league statistically going 31/35 on FGs and hitting a long of 54 yards last season. The team also has a very reliable and consistent punter in Dustin Colquitt. Colquitt punted for 45.1 yards on average and landing exactly half of his punts inside the 20 yard line in 2016. All of that makes for a very solid special teams but where the Chiefs separate themselves from the pack is in the return game. Tyreek Hill was hands down the best punt returner in the game last season. Hill finished #1 in punt return yards over 200 yards head of second place Tavon Austin. He also led in average yards per return and tied for must punt return TDs. He has shown that [he has the ability](https://youtu.be/m1CkyCl8Rao?t=1m32s) to [take it to the house]( https://youtu.be/m1CkyCl8Rao?t=3m17s) on [any given return](https://youtu.be/m1CkyCl8Rao?t=2m21s) even [if you think you have it covered well](https://youtu.be/m1CkyCl8Rao?t=5m21s).

###Creativity on offense

Andy Reid is one of the most creative offensive minds out there. Say what you want about Andy but his creativity in getting the ball into playmakers hands is probably his best attribute. Whether it is a [fake punt](https://youtu.be/k8Bog4cQccg?t=43s), a [play](https://youtu.be/k8Bog4cQccg?t=2m19s) at the [goal line](https://youtu.be/UB_WXbcOsXM?t=5m12s) or [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmP_-bYxBtM) of the seemingly endless supply of  [screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nt49vayKDM) up Andy's sleeve you know that something tricky is likely to go down.

##Weaknesses

###Run Defense

Run defense has always been an issue for the Chiefs in the Reid era. Last season they ranked 26th in the league giving up nearly 2000 yards on the season. The teams woes in run defense last season can be attributed to both personnel and scheme. The Chiefs run a 3-4 scheme with heavy press-man coverage. Though the scheme is 3-4 the Chiefs will often run a hybrid of it and have a 3-3-5 alignment subbing out a LB for an extra safety. This is where the scheme is an issue. Personnel was an issue because of injury as well as players under-performing. Dontari Poe used to be a player that could take on double teams and still get a push and disrupt plays. This past season he regressed and was often getting handled by just one blocker. Along with this, the Chiefs had many injuries along the front seven. Losing their two starting DEs (Allen Bailey and Jaye Howard) to injury early as well as having a bit of a revolving door at ILB due to numerous injuries. The personnel issue should be mitigated after replacing Poe with Bennie Logan and Allen Bailey and Derrick Johnson returning from IR.

###Offensive consistency

Anyone who knows anything at all about Chiefs football knows that the offense can be an absolute atrocity at times. When everything is clicking they are an above average offense but when one thing goes wrong everything comes to a screeching halt. Part of this problem is Andy Reid’s play calling. He scripts the first few drives of games and if what he is calling isn’t working he doesn’t attempt to adjust his game plan. This makes it hard for the offense to build momentum. The other part of this falls on Alex Smith. He can be an aggressive QB when he wants to but throwing an interception seems to absolutely destroy his killer instinct. A perfect example of this would be the game against the Raiders in week 14 last season. Alex came out in the first quarter slinging the ball all over the field and making plays with his legs. The Chiefs go into the half up 21-10. In the first drive of the second half Alex makes a bad play, [throws an interception](https://youtu.be/vmisfOqSalc?t=4m55s) and gets [strip sacked](https://youtu.be/vmisfOqSalc?t=5m26s) on the following drive. Andy suddenly stops taking risks with play calling, Alex goes full conservative, and the chiefs don’t score again in the game. Although the game was a W the fan base would like to see more of a killer instinct rather than lean on the defense to hold the game.

###Over-reliance on S/T and Defense

This goes together with the offensive consistency issue. The Chiefs had to rely heavily on their defense bailing out their offense late in games consistently last season and it happened at a seemingly unsustainable rate. The Chiefs were only able to put up 24 points on the Jets despite [picking off Ryan Fitzpatrick 6 times, including a pick 6]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om4CYLtNH5g).  The defense also [bailed out the offense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6u9GQ7N258) in the [Panthers game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJrhtOtrde0), the [Falcons game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsASgWk5as) and the [Week 12](https://youtu.be/UB_WXbcOsXM) game against the [Broncos](https://youtu.be/UB_WXbcOsXM?t=1m51s) (though [Cairo Santos tried his best not to](https://youtu.be/UB_WXbcOsXM?t=11m41s)).

#Training Camp Battles

##Backup QB: Patrick Mahomes vs. Tyler Bray

Alex Smith has the QB1 position locked down for this season at least but the backup QB position is not yet solidified. Conventional wisdom would have Mahomes winning this camp battle since the Chiefs traded up to draft him at #10 overall and they should be trying to get him as many quality reps as possible. Tyler Bray though has been on the team for four years and is much more familiar with Andy Reid’s system. It wouldn’t be much of a surprise to see him coming out ahead in this camp battle. If both Bray and Mahomes play well through the pre-season, look for the Chiefs to shop Bray around.

###Projected Winner: Patrick Mahomes

##ILB2: Justin March-Lillard vs. Ramik Wilson vs. Josh Mauga vs. Kevin Pierre-Louis

We are going into this assuming that Derrick Johnson returns to his normal self after recovering from his second Achilles tear in three years. Ramik Wilson is the most likely of the bunch to win the camp battle. The 2014 fourth round pick showed plenty of promise last season after being activated from the practice-squad during the season. PFF gave him an 83.0 rating good for their #18 ILB for his play last season. Ramik is also a tackling machine notching 76 total tackles last season in just 11 starts and only playing in less than half of total defensive snaps. From the outside looking in it seems like he is a lock for the job but the moves the chiefs have made lately may suggest that they aren’t fully confident in him. They recently brought back Josh Mauga who they had filling in for DJ after he went down in 2014, traded away linebacker DJ Alexander(a special teams pro-bowler) for Kevin-Pierre-Louis who is not likely to contribute heavily on special teams. Justin March-Lillard is a dark horse to win the camp battle but is probably more likely to be fighting for a backup spot as he didn’t do much to impress in his playing time last season.

###Projected Winner: Ramik Wilson

##Running Back: Spencer Ware vs. Kareem Hunt

Going into last season there was a lot of hype surrounding Spencer Ware as a starting caliber running back. Early in the season it looked as though he was going to live up to the hype putting up nearly 200 yards from scrimmage in the season opener against the Chargers. As the season wore on though his production dipped and he finished with just 921 rushing yards on the season. The rushing game as a whole was disappointing on the season so the Chiefs traded up in the third round to select RB Kareem Hunt from Toledo. Hunt and Ware have very similar styles of play. They both excel at running between the tackles and they are both extremely difficult to bring down. In his senior season at Toledo Hunt was 2nd in the country for missed tackles and forced 98 on the season. Both are very good in the passing game and neither is a concern in terms of ball security (Ware had 0 fumbles in three years at LSU and Hunt had just one in three years at Toledo). This is the most evenly matched battle in the Chiefs training camp and it will be very interesting to see it play out in camp and the pre-season.

###Projected winner: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

##WR3: Demarcus Robinson vs. Albert Wilson vs. Jehu Chesson vs. De’Anthony Thomas

The Chiefs WR group is going to have to take some strides forward after the release of Jeremy Maclin. Though Maclin had a disappointing season last year he was still the best receiver on the team and the only significant veteran presence in the WR room. Although, his release does give the young receivers a chance to make a name for themselves. The #1 and #2 positions should be locks with Tyreek Hill and Chris Conley filling those spots but the #3-5 positions are up in the air. Albert Wilson, the only WR remaining from the 2014 roster (the one that had no receivers catch a TD) is more than likely the front runner to secure the #3 position as he has the most experience and production of any of the other player. The most likely person to challenge him for the #3 spot is Demarcus Robinson, a second-year player out of Florida. He has the physical ability to become a solid receiver and reports from camp suggest that he may be starting to put it all together. Chesson and Thomas are on the outside looking in but should not have any trouble making the roster for special teams alone. I don’t expect to see Chesson on the field on offense at all this season as Reid’s system is notoriously difficult for WR’s to learn and he is not a very good fit for how Alex Smith plays QB.

###Projected winner: Albert Wilson

##CB2: Steven Nelson vs. Phillip Gaines vs. Terrance Mitchell vs. Kenneth Acker

Most of us expect Terrance Mitchell to win this camp battle. He played extremely well when being thrust into the starting role at the end of last season. He was very scarcely found out of position, gave up less yards and completions than his two competitors and gave up only a 55.5 passer rating in 279 snaps at RCB. He also had five passes defensed and allowed just 42.9% of passes his way to be completed. Phillip Gaines is a former third-round pick who played well at times last season but also had significant struggles. He gave up the second highest passer rating (104.1) playing at RCB. He has the athletic ability to play the position well but he just hasn’t gotten to where he needs to be to make a positive impact. Gaines will probably be on the roster bubble if he doesn’t make some steps forward before the start of the season. Nelson also had his ups and downs but he played much better than Gaines last season. Nelson lacks the size to be an ideal outside press-man corner and that’s where his struggles seemed to stem from. He fits much better and plays significantly better at slot corner so I don’t think that there is much of a chance for him to win the CB2 job. Kenneth Acker is a dark horse to win the starting job. He didn’t have any terrible games last season but he also wasn’t great in any. Acker will probably make the roster but he won’t be seeing much playing time barring injury.

###Projected winner: Terrance Mitchell

#Offensive Strategy

The Chiefs offense is Andy Reid's evolving form of west coast offense. When Andy came to KC one of the first things they did was bring in Alex Smith and no matter what anyone's opinions are; Alex Smith is a perfect fit for the West Coast offense.  For those who don't know the ins and outs of the West Coast offense it is an offense that changed football. When teams were running to set up the pass Bill Walsh had his offense use the pass to set up the run. He accomplished this by attacking horizontally with short passes all over the field. With precise route running and timing between the QB/WR it is nearly unstoppable once it gets going. This offense requires an extremely accurate and intelligent quarterback that can read the defense and understand how to read his progressions on each play. The defense is forced to make difficult choices on who to cover during all these slants, ins, outs, screens, swings and crossing routes. The LBs are often forced to stay off the line and spread out while the safeties are forced to respect the underneath routes in the middle. This theoretically should open up the run game and vertical passes down the field. A good example of this in action for the Chiefs is [this play](https://media.giphy.com/media/svJuguVmBmoes/source.gif). Alex's head starts looking right freezing the SS, the crossing TE freezes the ROLB and moves the MLB right while Maclin slants in right above the LBs and right underneath the FS for a TD. A perfectly timed five step drop, throw into a tight window, setup by an underneath route and smart QB play understanding the defensive scheme.

This brings us back to Alex Smith, a quarterback consistently ranked one of the most accurate passers on short/intermediate throws, someone who understands his progressions and when not to throw the ball. And believe it or not Alex and Andy have actually progressed into opening up the offense down the field since they've been together. Alex's air yards per completion in 2013 were 2.91 and have nearly increased each season to 2016 at 3.23 air ypc (For reference Stafford had 3.53, Carr had 3.68 and Kirk Cousins led everyone at 4.85). This increase in down field throws have come from dependable WRs like Jeremy Maclin, Tyreek Hill and the emergence of TE Travis Kelce in the offense. It all comes back to the original scheme though, West Coast Offense.  

Reid's version of West Coast Offense so far in KC has evolved into a mismatch game. Reid likes to sometimes put 3 TEs on the field, tight WR bunch formations, fake screens, real screens and using misdirection to create confusion. This sometimes works out amazingly(Hill's highlight reel), most of the time works well but sometimes looks like Reid thinks he's smarter than everyone and the play blows up in his face. Again this year I expect Reid's version of the West Coast Offense to progress and evolve. With speedy WR Tyreek Hill assuming the #1 spot I expect the offense to go a bit more vertical this year and [so far in training camp](http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/red-zone/article165665607.html) they've really put a strong emphasis on this. At the end of the day though Reid will be using inside and outside horizontal timing routes, screens and every 1-10 yard route in the playbook to try and open an offense up for the run and a few shots down the field. 

The rushing attack struggled last season, a mix of Oline and Spencer Ware not turning into a feature back like we all hoped when JC couldn't make it back. Andy Reid asks a lot of his RBs, they need to obviously run well, catch well and [block well](https://media.giphy.com/media/14j3bLNOh0OO7S/giphy.gif). It's fairly common for our RB to be tasked with chip blocking or to be left alone blocking pass rushers, [Jamaal loved it](http://s3.amazonaws.com/br-cdn/temp_images/2013/11/08/charlesblock.gif). The first couple seasons Reid ran mostly a zone run style but last season in particular there were more man and gap runs (with still plenty of inside and outside zone runs). Probably changing the offense to try and fit Spencer Ware's run style vs the old of Jamaal Charles. Last season we saw a lot of guard pulls showing Reid felt more comfortable with the line and how versatile they could be. We saw speed options with Ware. We saw jet sweeps and fake jet sweeps with DeAnthony Thomas and Tyreek Hill. We also still see plenty of FB Anthony Sherman in power runs from the pro set and I formation, although he did see an 11% drop in snap count from the previous year. How Reid will try and tweak the run game after a bit of struggle last season and a new face in Hunt is kind of unknown. All we know for sure is the RBs will be a large part of nearly every play, running, catching, blocking or being a decoy. The RBs will be incredibly important in Reid's West Coast Offense.

#Defensive Strategy

The Chiefs defense, led by DC Bob Sutton, is on paper called a ""3-4"" but it's really hard to call them that when it's probably one of the rarer personnel combinations you'll see. Sutton tries his best to throw as many different looks to the opposing QB as he possibly can. Always evolving throughout the season. The more common formations you'll see are variations of 3-4, nickel and dime defenses. He uses a strong supply of blitzes, often press man coverage and as many different looks as possible to keep opposing teams guessing. Sutton has also been a master at halftime adjustments. In the last three years Sutton has been in KC the Chiefs have ranked 2nd, 3rd and 3rd at points allowed in the second half of games. No other team in the NFL has been able to stay in the top 5 during that time and only the Seahawks can claim to maintain top 10 during that time. Sutton's half-time adjustments are simply the best in the NFL. 

Out of the 3-4 you'll see the base DE/NT/DE  - OLB/ILB/ILB/OLB but Sutton has no issues trading out an ILB or D-lineman for another pass rushing OLB or bulking up the line with two DTs and one DE. Sometimes you'll even see a package which consists of [three OLBs overloading one side](http://i.imgur.com/zmL2WGo.jpg?2) of the line (Hali, Ford, Houston...scary).  

In the ""Nickel"" package you might commonly see a 3-3-5 or a [2-4-5](http://i.imgur.com/IlMV0mM.jpg?2) with different personnel packages in each formation. As seen in that previous picture the team has kept a 3rd safety that could probably start (or is starting now) on most teams specifically for these types of packages. At one point it was Quentin Demps, Hussein Abdullah, then Kurt Coleman and now Daniel Sorenson. This safety will be used in the ""Big Nickel"" package we've been seeing around the league more commonly now. Bringing in a safety that can play the role of a hybrid LB/S has served the Chiefs well and created some big play moments.

Out of the ""Dime"" package you might commonly see a [1-4-6](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2383356/Parker1.0.jpg) or a [2-3-6](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/assets/3569665/235.PNG), again, with different personnel packages in these formations depending on the personnel and game situation. If you notice in that picture Berry is in a LB role and there is still two deep safeties. Player versatility is a huge part of Sutton's defense.

My summer internship ends this Friday and I have about a 2 week break before next semester starts. I’m an econ major who’s really interested in statistics and yesterday, I had the idea of recording how long I have to heat the M for it to click, how long of a hit I get before it clicks again for cool-down, and then rating the vapor production of each hit (obviously pretty subjective but I can come up with a somewhat standardized rating scale so at least you’d know I’m being consistent). Attached is a screenshot of the data I collected yesterday for additional context (note: on the third chart for Aug 8 – I was pretty blasted 3 bowls in, and didn’t remember to record the data for the last 3 hits – ideally that won’t happen again but no promises). I plan to continue collecting this type of data for the next 2 weeks – would likely give me a sample size of about 30 bowls, or about 150 heat cycles in total, which I think is a reasonable amount to form good averages and to be a resource for anyone interested in the M. If there’s interest, I could also write a report on the data. 

Just a note: the data would be entirely more readable when I finish and also I'd include more info like strain used, lighter used, approx. distance from flame, etc. for even more context.

**Timeline and History**

Terraforming project begun under U.N., the contract was awarded to BioTerra Systems, an ambitious terraforming firm based out of the European Union.

The project was a huge money sink, and within a generation BioTerra Systems filed for bankruptcy.

Hadama Industries took over the contract.  Having anticipated the collapse of BioTerra, Hideo Hadama (the founder of the company) pushed the development of telerobotic mining drones that could withstand the temperature and pressure of the Venusian surface.  This required the risky purchase of a materials company called NeoMat Inc., a chemical engineering company that had made some promising developments in heat-resistant electronic shielding.  The gambit paid off.

Hadama Industries was able to tap into the iridium-rich Venusian surface. Within a generation, the company had built Venus into a thriving colony supporting the mining trade, while collecting government funding to continue the original terraforming project.  

Once the asteroid belt became accessible, Venus’ location provided quick and numerous transfer windows, making it prime real estate for accessing the isolated bodies in the belt. By then, Venus had over 20 million inhabitants in its floating cities, and many more living in orbital stations.  It had expanded its industry to become a chief source of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen for the fledgeling colonies in the outer system.  As the Belt provided a better prospect for mining ventures, surface mining was no longer seen as profitable.  It still serves as a valuable terraforming research station, though the project is projected to last for thousands of years.*

Upon the establishment of the UPR, Venus was granted political independence and representation within the republic.

*New ceramics have recently been discovered that can store waste heat, which can be released via the application of weak pressure.  Something like this that can store heat at 90atm has the potential to exist. 


**Values**

Venusian culture is influenced heavily by trade; haggling and bargaining is expected.  People who are able to secure better bargains enjoy higher social status; this has led to a very materialistic culture.  Their history of belonging to a corporate entity has led to a very competitive and driven society.  The “Venusian dream” is to be able to support a family through being a small business owner.  

Due to their status as the trade hub of the solar system, Venusians blend the novelties and trends of the cultures they trade with.  They are a very eclectic people, often viewed as fashion-forward or as trendsetters.  Among themselves, trends are fairly short-lived, though a variety of subcultures have formed around their more iconic looks and lifestyles.  

Venusian locals are very tight knit and cliquish.  A common sentiment among them is that a person can’t call themselves a local until they master the local language, Venusian-French.  


**Ethics**

Although Venusian culture is centered around good business decisions, they do maintain a standard of ethics.  Stealing is wrong, as it deprives others of their opportunity to conduct their business.  Likewise, murder is wrong, but this is considered to be more self-evident.  Business decisions that secure profit at the cost of the well-being of employees or customers is considered wrong, as those people are the driving force behind a business owner’s profit-making.  As such, good work deserves to be rewarded, and returning customers are to be shown respect and gratitude.  

However, Venusians have no concept of “the customer is always right.”  If a customer is causing a disturbance and taking away from the experience of other customers, or causing an employee undue distress, the employee is within their right to call them out on it.  Customers that attempt to scam a business are swiftly ejected from the premises, as scamming is considered little better than stealing.  Regardless, as in any culture, there are those who manage to get away with unethical behavior and prosper.


**Symbols**

The Venusian flag is divided horizontally between blue and white, which honors the first manned-craft visits from the European Space Agency.  Centered in the foreground is a golden circle, representing prosperity and wealth.

The official seal of Venus bears the Roman goddess that the planet is named after.  In her left hand she holds an olive branch representing peace and prosperity, and in her right she wields a mining pick representing hard work and an appreciation for the hidden value of things.  The top of the seal is emblazoned with “Commonwealth of Venus”, and the bottom bears the motto “Or en paix, ferre en guerre”, meaning “gold in peace, iron in war.”


**Technology**

*Floating Cities*

The first city established, Cité Paradis, is also Venus’ capitol city.  A thin protective shield is stretched over a series of balloons containing breathable air.  This shield is supported by a framework roughly 3 km in diameter.  Hanging down from the center of this assembly are suspended towers, skyscrapers in reverse that stretch towards the planet’s surface.  This inverted city includes business parks, shopping malls, restaurants, cafés, a bustling downtown area, and the capitol building.  Perched atop this mushroom-like structure is a 192 acre park enclosed in a protective dome, frequently used for recreational activities.  The rest of the shield’s surface contains cooling fins, exhaust ports, solar panels, communication stations, and landing pads for orbital craft.  

As the population of the city expanded, new floating structures were built.  Lashed together like rafts, these structures comprise separate habitats, or “habs”, with some being specialized for agriculture.  Expanding outward, Cité Paradis is now home to 1.2 million people.

Building off the lessons learned from the capitol, following cities were built to be even larger.  The largest city on venus is currently Costa Gailla, which boasts a population of 4.8 million people.  Other notable cities include Côte Verte, an agricultural community which produces some of the finest coffee in the solar system, and Nuova Venezia, which houses the planet’s largest ore refinery.

*Spaceport and Orbital Ring*

The Venusian government has commissioned the construction of a massive orbital ring.  Though it is still in its infancy, it is still large enough to house the planet’s primary spaceport.  This is where the majority of trade occurs between the inner planets and the asteroid belt.  Once completed, it will be capable of generating a ring of electrical current around the planet, creating an artificial magnetosphere that is desperately needed if the world is ever to support life.  

*Mining Operations*

Venus once had a variety of mining operations on or near its surface.  The easiest of these is in metals whose melting point is at temperatures below that of the surface (462 C).  Metals such as cadmium, lead, magnesium alloys, mercury, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, etc., form a vapor that is carried up by thermal winds.  At higher altitudes they condense, combine into heavier molecules, and form precipitate deposits that can be collected via low altitude balloons.  These precipitates can also be scooped from high mountain surfaces, where they form like snow, via cable cranes.[2]

Surface mining is a much trickier proposition.  Until the development of effective heat shielding and improvements in cooling technology, this was an impossibility.  New mines are created from orbit via high powered mining lasers.  Once the initial shaft is dug, mining robots are lowered to the location via cable crane.  Controlled by operators in the cloud cities, the bots begin their search for valuable metals that remain solid at surface temperatures, particularly iridium.  These are then loaded into containers to await retrieval via crane.  The mining robots return with each shipment to shed their waste heat at cooler altitudes and undergo a maintenance cycle before being returned to the surface*.[3]

*Terraforming Research*

Research is funded by grants from the UPR as part of its colonization initiative.  The bulk of the original terraforming cost came from the establishment of infrastructure.  Current costs are in research staff and importing the chemicals required to cool the atmosphere.  Though still an expense that must be justified every time the UPR reevaluates its budget, the cost has balanced out to be fairly manageable.  Data gathered from Venus may prove invaluable in terraforming earth-like worlds in other star systems.

*Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Collection*

Venus’ atmosphere is its chief commercial asset.  At 96% CO2 and 3.5% Nitrogen, Venus is rich in elements that are sorely needed on the edge of the solar system.  Processing plants gather outside air and use electrolysis to separate carbon and oxygen.  They then use oxygen and nitrogen for breathable air for their cities, space stations, and resupplying starships.[1]
  
*Division of Labor*

There are many jobs available on Venus, from wait staff at a restaurant in the capitol, to port authority inspection teams at the orbital ring, to CEO of one of the many mining companies based out of Venus.  Generally, these jobs are divided between skilled and unskilled work.  Skilled work can be further divided between those jobs requiring education at a trade or vocational school, and those that require a university-level degree.  Cafe baristas, wait staff, and most other service industry work falls into the category of unskilled labor.  Jobs such as bartender, chef, electrician, robotics technician, life support maintenance specialist, etc. are considered skilled positions requiring vocational education, and management jobs and specialties such as doctors, engineers, physicists, and teachers, all require varying levels of university degrees.
*Trade and Money*

Orbital mechanics work such that the closer to the sun one is, the quicker its transfer windows to the belt are and the more frequently they open up.[4]  In fact, windows open up between Venus and other bodies at nearly twice the rate, and allow travel in around half the time.[5]  This has made Venus an ideal source of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon for the colonies of the belt, and put Hadama Industries in a valuable position to begin asteroid mining.  Because of this, Hadama Industries has established its headquarters in Venus’ capital city, Cité Paradis.

Venus’ chief exports are nitrogen, carbon, and liquid water for the belt colonies.  Its chief imports are textiles and exotic foodstuffs such as cheese from Earth and Mars, and ores, hydrogen, and helium-3 from the asteroid belt.  

Traffic from the belt is a big part of Venus’ economy.  Because Venus’ transfer windows open more often, there is always a steady stream of shipments arriving and departing.  From Venus, these materials are sent out to Earth and Mars as transfer windows open up.  So while it is practical for startups and family-owned cargo haulers moving from the belt, the big-business shipping industry handles inner system transport.  Unfortunately, this has the added side effect of belt-based piracy being a reasonably profitable venture (more on that in another article).  

*Transportation*

Elevators provide transportation between levels of a tower, but transport between habitats (or as a shortcut between towers) is handled via a series of flexible pneumatic tubes. Tube-trains run regularly, much the same way as subways in the old London Underground.  Riding a tube-train is often referred to as “tubing”, or “taking the tube”.  Incidentally, these terms have also been appropriated as a way of referring to fornication or defecation, depending on context.  

**Food, Clothing, Shelter**
*Food*

Though the cities are climate controlled, public spaces are usually kept at 27 C (81 F), the same as the temperature outside.  Cold foods are a welcome relief, with shave ice being very popular.  

Venusians grow most of their food hydroponically, though their Ag-domes are able to grow small amounts of specialty foods.  Potatoes are an important source of carbohydrates and are easy to grow, thus most of their starchy foods are made from potatoes rather than wheat.  Gnocchi is a very popular and easy to make dish.  Marinara sauce is ubiquitous, as tomatoes and spices are easily grown.  White sauces are available, though less popular due to the presence of dairy substitute. Protein is primarily provided through beans and tofu, though vat-grown meat is available as well.

Dairy products such as milk and cheese are very valuable, as they must be imported from Earth or Mars.  They are seen as a food for special occasions, and suppliers often import more during the holiday season.

*Clothing and Adornment*

Because of the warm temperatures of public spaces, Venusians tend to wear thin fabrics and loose-fitting clothing.  Shorts and loose tees are popular with the younger crowd, though sometimes teens and young adults will incorporate warmer Martian imports to their outfits ironically.  This is generally regarded as silly and ostentatious, and is the butt of many jokes on Venusian fashion boards.  

*Shelter and Dwellings*

Though even the more modest of dwellings is fairly spacious, Venusian homes are little more than apartments.  Unlike the public spaces, air conditioning is available in living areas.  These apartments can vary from small, single person lofts to sprawling manors.  Generally, the more affluent residents live in the higher levels.  As you go down levels, the prices drop, but the temperatures rise.  At the lowest levels, the temperature can range from 32 to 37 degrees C (90 to 100 F).  In these poorer areas of the habitat, residents often rely on each other for household repairs; a broken a/c unit can be quite uncomfortable, and take some time for the official repair services to get to.  This has led these communities to relax some of the social stigmas of visiting neighbors unannounced.  

Venusian apartments are often incorporate a living wall; the greenery helps purify the air and helps raise the spirits of its occupants.  Some apartments even have small, enclosed balcony areas, often with breathtaking views of the city and the clouds below.  Looking out the window of one of these residences, one would likely see not only the neighboring towers, but also billboards with lively advertisements for local goods and services.  

**Political Organizations**

*Government*

Venus’ government is loosely modeled after a dual board corporate structure, which has its origins in the colony’s history as a subsidiary of Hadama Industries.  Venusian citizens become eligible to vote when they turn 17; these voting citizens are like the shareholders of a company.  They vote for their local representatives; each habitat has a Councilman and each city has a Governor.  The Board of Governors elects a Chairman from among their ranks, while the Prime Minister is elected by the people.  The Prime Minister heads the Executive Branch, while the chairman heads the Supervisory Branch consisting of the Board of Governors and the Board of Councilmen.  The third branch of government is the Judicial Branch, headed by the Chief Attorney.  The Chief Attorney is elected by the Supervisory boards, but must be approved by the Prime Minister.  Together, these three branches balance each other out.

*Law Enforcement*

Each city has a police department, while the orbital ring has the Port Authority.  While local police have a good reputation, the Port Authority has been known to take bribes from time to time, and in rare cases, extort small cargo businesses with an extra “convenience tax.”  Failure to pay this tax tends to result in longer than usual inspection times or even rejection of cargo.  Cleaning up the Port Authority has been a political point that comes up during election season, but no administration has yet kept this promise.

Venus is not without its criminal elements.  Local organized crime rings are involved in bribery of port authority officials, contraband smuggling, money laundering, illegal prostitution (as opposed to regulated and perfectly legal prostitution), and forgery of foodstuffs (such as passing off synthesized dairy or 3D printed meats as the real thing).

*War and Peace*

The Venusian militia exists to patrol nearby space and lend assistance in the case of natural disasters.  It is much closer to a coast guard than an actual navy.  It is a largely volunteer organization, however service is a requirement for non-natives seeking citizenship.  Politically, Venus actively seeks neutrality as their trade heavily relies on both Earth and Mars.

**Family and Kin**

*Marriage and Type of Family Groupings*

Venusians are fairly liberal in their romantic affairs; open relationships are not uncommon.  Marriages are traditionally monogamous, but they are also not expected to be permanent.  Every 10 to 20 years (depending on whether procreation is intended), the couple is given the option to renew their nuptial contract or allow it to expire.  This arose from the early days of the colony; when populations were low it could be difficult to avoid exes, and marital infidelity could heavily disrupt a community.  This has contributed to stereotypes of Venusians being selfish, capricious, and libertine.

Because of this arrangement, extended families are fairly common; a given person likely has several half-brothers or sisters.  This makes Venusian family units quite large, and holiday gatherings are often a big deal, bringing a volatile mixture of merriment, celebration, and fierce competition between guests. The tension these moments bring has been the source of many humorous depictions in comedic holo-films.

*Child Training and Rites of Passage*

Children enter preschool at the age of 3, and then enter primary school at 6.  They move on to secondary school at age 12, where they stay until they are 15.  At the end of secondary school, students are then sorted according to their capabilities and career intentions.  Those that wish to pursue higher education are send to a preparatory school, where they are prepared for University.  Those that wish to go directly into a trade, such as robot maintenance and repair, agriculture specialist, life support technician, etc., attend vocational training instead.  This consists of a two-year course in their desired career, followed by a year-long internship.

There are few “official” rites of passage, though it is traditional for a young person to seek higher education in a separate city from the one they grew up in.  This has its roots in the early days of the colony.  When the cities were small, genetic diversity was a big concern.  The cities initiated a “city exchange program”, where young people would move cities once they reached a certain age.  During the iridium boom, a huge influx of new colonists and the rapid expansion of the cities put to rest the fears of hereditary conditions from a small gene pool.  However, the city exchange had been going for a couple generations, and though it is no longer an official practice, it has still left its mark on society.

Certain ages come with certain benefits.  The drinking age for beer and wine is 15, and the age of majority is 17, when a person can vote, grant consent, serve in the militia, and purchase hard alcohol and legal recreational drugs.

There is another rite of passage that is only commonly followed in Nuova Venezia: hab-zipping.  This dangerous activity involves donning an oxygen mask and protective garb (on clear days, little more than tucking long sleeves into one’s gloves is required) and zip-lining from one habitat to another.  In most other cities this activity is put to an immediate stop, but Nuova Venezia does very little aside from paying lip service to prevent this activity.  Most of the parents also went through this rite of passage, after all.  Accidents, though not unheard of, are very rare.

**Attitude Towards the Unknown**

*Religious Beliefs*

Although the majority of Venusians are atheistic or agnostic, all faiths have found a home on Venus as people migrated during the iridium boom.  Muslim communities are careful to keep track of the heavens, as the most devout still make an effort to face earth (mecca) during their daily prayers.  In fact, some of the largest mosques have funded the development and maintenance of the city observatories.

*Religious Practices and Holidays*

In addition to religious holidays, Venusians of all stripes celebrate “Buy-out Day” from June 30th to July 3rd (or roughly the end of the second financial quarter).  After the collapse of BioTerra Systems, the resident Venusians were devastated at what appeared to be the end of their colony.  Almost 96 hours later, Hadama Industries bought their assets and promised to continue supporting the colony.  The first 48 hours of Buy-out Day, the daylight hours, are spent with family.  During this time, meals are shared and grievances are aired.  Almost all businesses are closed during this time.  The 48 hour night-cycle, however, is a giant party.  Referred to as “Carnival”, residents take to the streets to celebrate.  Service businesses open back up, and various clubs and interest groups put on a parade through the main thoroughfare.  Schools will put on events for the young children, while the adults will usually spend at least some time rotating through various bars and pubs.  

*Death Rituals*

Death rituals vary from faith to faith, but the ones that allow cremation also allow the body of the deceased to be dropped from the city to the surface below.  The body is incinerated far before it lands.  Those that cannot be cremated for religious purposes are put on ice and shipped back to Earth, usually at the expense of the church they attended.

**Communication**

*Language*

Venus has four national languages: French, Italian, German, and English.  French and Italian are by far the largest languages, with English being taught in school as a second language.  It is not uncommon for Venusians to mix their languages, resulting in a patois that may be more French or more Italian depending on the city.  These languages have become so different from their predecessors that they have earned new names as “Venusian-French” and “Venusian-Italian”, and locals see their use as a point of civic pride.  English is fairly unchanged, and is used for business between the worlds.

*Numbering System*

The Venusians use the latin numbering system, and use the metric system of measurements.

**Arts and Artistic Values**

*Art*
Venusian art tends to highlight the materialistic aspects of their culture, often posing questions about what truly has value or posing as a warning of materialism taken to an extreme.  Some art pieces address the isolation that someone might feel in a culture where relationships are transient and fleeting. 
*Music*

A variety of musical subcultures exist in the cloud cities.  The popularity of each genre tends to wax and wane, however pop and dance music reign supreme in the Venusian club scene.  Smaller, but frequently popular genres amongst the younger crowds include unique variations of hip hop, punk, and metal; hip hop and punk artists frequently find societal issues to rail against while metal bands draw attention to the insecurities that one might feel living kilometers above a literal hellscape.
*Dance, Drama, Literature*

Dancing is little more than a popular pastime; clubs open up during the long night cycle, blaring popular dance songs and providing a steady supply of alcohol. 

With the availability of VR, holo-vid streams have become the primary method of releasing new films.  These streams are initially monetized, and “movie go-ers” pay a small sum of credits for access to the stream.  Viewers also have the option to open up private viewing rooms, to enjoy the film with their friends.  

Most people eventually crave real interaction, however, and traditional theater has enjoyed a popular resurgence.  Plays such as William Shakespeare’s Tempest and an adaptation of Faust are frequently put on, in addition to many more contemporary works.

**Recreation**

*Games and Sports*

Football (soccer) is the most popular sport on Venus.  Carried over from the European roots of the original colonists, Venusian football has adopted some interesting adaptations for the close quarters experienced before the advent of dome parks.  The biggest of these changes is that many moves that would be counted as fouls on Earth are completely legal plays, as they would be unavoidable in close quarters.  Additionally, the professional Venusian football field is approximately two-thirds the size of an Earth field.  There is fierce competition between city football clubs, with the two most popular teams being Cité Paradis FC and Costa Gailla’s FC Fulmine.

Cité Paradis FC’s logo is a football over crossed palm trees, while FC Fulmine’s logo is a stormcloud and stylized lightning bolt.  

*Use of Leisure Time*

A week on Venus is 8 Earth-days, or two Venusian sols (a day-night cycle).  This makes a 5 day workweek, and three day weekend.  Usually the weekend is one day cycle and a half night cycle.  The extra day is called Veneris, which is the latin name for Friday.  This day lies between Friday and Saturday, and is the last day of the workweek.  This puts Monday as the first day of one of the night cycles, and the last day of the weekend.  The names of the days, in Venusian-French, are Lundi, Mardi, Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi, Veneris, Samedi, Dimanche.  Interestingly, this means that both Vendredi (Friday) and Veneris derive their names from Venus.
  
Young Venusians tend to spend their time outside of studies browsing the internet or interacting with others via virtual reality.  Close groups of friends will gather in-person, and it is normal for them to schedule time away from their screens.  This can include playing games in their habitat’s dome-park, shopping at the mall, seeing a musical performance, or going to an air-conditioned theater.  Adults will often entertain guests; cooking for one another is an affectionate display of friendship.  Being invited to someone’s home and sharing a meal with them is an indication of a close bond.  As such, dropping by someone’s residence unannounced is considered very rude.

6sn5pe,6,2017-08-09,Should I get a MacBook for programming?,bravisbrott,mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/6sn5pe/should_i_get_a_macbook_for_programming/,"I'm a senior Analytics &amp; IS major and am starting to program a bit more for school and my internship, primarily using Python &amp; SQL. After school, I plan on going the business/systems analyst route to give you an idea of what I'd be using the laptop for in the future.

I used to have a maxed out 2015 15"" rMPB, but sold it earlier this year shortly before I ended up making decent money with my internship. Sold it because I didn't really utilize it since I have a decent desktop. 

Honestly, I'm not sure if this would be the most financially sound decision, but damn, it's convenient, especially using it at work and school and much nicer than using a clunky Windows laptop.

I'm leaning towards a 13"" 2014/15 rMPB, which seem to be going for $850~, from what I've seen. Not really looking to max it out, since I have my desktop at home, so I don't think storage is much to worry about.

I'd love some input. I think I just need some outside opinions on this before I end up making a decision. Sorry if this is all over the place!

6sn6dc,4,2017-08-09,3rd day sober but kind of down because of internship and friend problems,dinochic22,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6sn6dc/3rd_day_sober_but_kind_of_down_because_of/,"First off, I'm 3 days sober. I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post what I'm thinking. I just need to get it out and I'll feel better. 

So, my best friend and I both got internships at the same company this summer. Yay! It really has been a lot of fun. We are on the same team but different jobs. I started a month before her and am the first intern of the company. She is an intern but I think it's more because they need her part time... I don't know. Anyway, it's my last week and tomorrow I give a big presentation that I've been working on since May about my projects, what I learned, etc. She doesn't have to give a presentation. 

Honestly, I have messed up this internship. I won't go into details on my main account. I feel like I messed it up because I've been battling this addiction for about a year (this October will be a year). It's amazing how much drinking actually gets in the way of real life. I have stopped drinking many times over the year but always fall back into it. I'm back on the wagon but anyway, I digress. My boss and I do not get along. I've tried but between not being the most dependable (my fault) and lack of communication (her fault), I figured that when this internship ended I wouldn't be offered a job but it was great experience and really helped me prioritize getting my life together. My boss definitely focused more on regulations and rules while I wanted to be more creative and work with different departments to help bridge communication gaps I've seen while going to school. When they hired me they wanted me because I have two skill sets they’ve been wanting to combine but then as I’ve tried my boss just isn’t into it. It’s been frustrating. They've also told me my part of the team isn't hiring until 2018 anyway. 

So, I started being upset about this when I was told that I couldn't go to team meetings and I wouldn't be getting vacation pay. That's fine but my friend has been getting both of these opportunities. My boss is very strict about policy and told me it's against the law for interns to be in on the meetings. But my friend has gone to all of them and her boss pulls a bunch of strings to allow her to get better treatment. It just doesn't seem fair. I get that life isn't fair but this company has two interns and they're not treated the same. I've literally been asked to leave rooms while my friend is asked to join. I guess I'm upset that she's an intern and seems like she needs a different title. I don't know how to address this to the company. If we weren't friends this would probably cause more friction than it currently is. 

So now, it's my last week and my presentation is tomorrow. It's a big deal. My friend said she wasn't having lunch with me and that hurt because no one else is here. They're having a company BBQ day and everyone but the interns can go. My friend isn't going but she's also ditching me... on my last week... when I'm finishing something that my future references and letters of recommendations will be based on. She also just came up to me (to tell me she wasn't having lunch with me) saying that one of her team members asked when she's defending because they want to hire her... So today just kind of sucks. I asked her if we could get together after work so I can practice the presentation but she said that I'll be fine and just practice alone. I even pulled strings for her to come see my presentation because my boss didn’t want her to. I don't know... today just sucks. She is a good friend but I guess I just feel abandoned today. She also knows about this struggle I've had and kind of pushed it off today. She knows it's my 3rd day and I told her last night that I stayed up until midnight cleaning because I needed a distraction and ended up staying up too late. She said I should have slept and yes, that's true but I can't sleep... My legs get restless and I'm sure a lot of people on this subreddit know how hard it is to sleep the first week just with night sweats, restless legs, shakes, etc. 

Anyway, I guess I’m looking for a friend. I’m not drinking with you guys today. Tomorrow will be better and I’m actually excited because I’m going to rock it. I just am down and don’t want to be. 
Thanks for reading if you are still reading. "
6snchb,4,2017-08-09,Advice for a Software Engineering,the_other_riot,austinjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/austinjobs/comments/6snchb/advice_for_a_software_engineering/,"I have a B.S. in CS, graduated in May. I have  about 1.5 years of experience in hands-on internships, in a couple of different areas (web dev, C#/.NET, Java development). 

I started a full time gig in real-time embedded systems and have been at it for about three months, but I hate it. I know it looks like real shit to have such a short spurt of employment on your resume so I'm trying to hold out for 6 - 12 months here but I really don't feel great working for the company I'm with, or under the conditions I'm working. 

My questions are: 1.) What do you think about the time frame? Do you have any advice on similar experiences? Would you totally throw my resume? 

2.) What level should I be applying to? I'm running pretty close to two years of industry experience, granted a large part of that is in internships. Most of my internships were either full time for a summer, or I was a part time dev on the team. Should I still be seeking entry level employment?

Thanks a bunch, guys. I really appreciate any advice y'all can offer."

6snkbv,7,2017-08-09,Why can't I find a fucking internship or job?,coffeelovingdude,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6snkbv/why_cant_i_find_a_fucking_internship_or_job/,"I'm a senior studying Electrical Engineering and its been absolute hell trying to find a job or internship. I'm so fucking frustrated on how unlucky I am. I applied to over 30 internships and temp jobs for the winter (nevermind me trying to find a summer or yearlong internship) and got one call back. Two weeks ago, that one call back who said I was the only applicant, closed down their intern program. I fucking work my ass off to build my resume. I have a 3.1 GPA. I work summers as my dad's accountant and have managerial experience. During school, I worked as a chemistry lab technician. I do side projects to  build my resume; How many EE students know Python, Solidworks, AutoCAD, AutoCAD Electrical, basic PLC programming in addition to all the programming shit we do in school?  I'm also involved in engineering clubs like an engineering fraternity and IEEE. 

Here is the kicker. No one else I know studying my field or any engineering field is having trouble getting work in my city. My friend blew off finding an internship until a week ago when he cold called a company, got a phone interview and got offered a position two days ago. The dude had a 2.4GPA , no experience, and no side projects (I know this because I checked his resume during a class last semester and we were supposed to do side projects this summer and he bailed). People I fucking tutor and study with who are getting Ds in a few classes hare getting great internship offers. Everyone I know in my class hasn't really applied to more than a few jobs before getting one. This year, I applied to over 60 applications with over a 100 cold calls. A girl I know very well with a 3.2 GPA got over 5 internship offers and leveraged them to make almost $30 an hour. 

How am I so fucking unemployable?!?!?!? "
6snlv6,1,2017-08-09,Already put 2017 earnings into a general investment account. Is it a bad move to sell shares and move it into an IRA?,fegitrun,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6snlv6/already_put_2017_earnings_into_a_general/,"I am a college student, and each year I get a $2500 student loan (so I was planning on having $10k of debt to pay in 2019).

I earn money working part time and over summers, but instead of paying off the loans I put my earnings into a Vanguard general investment account. This is because my loans have no interest until 6 months after I graduate and I will have well over $10,000 invested when I graduate (so I can pay off the loan right away even if the markets dip by over 40%), so I might as well invest the $10k I would have paid of the loans with and keep the gains for myself.

I have $10k in the general investment account now. My financial aid changed, and the last 2 years are grants instead of loans, so now I will owe only $5k on loans in 2019.

I have already put all my 2017 earnings into the general investment account (most of it comes during the summer internships). The general investment account is $9000 cost basis and $1000 short term capital gains. Now I have a lot of excess money in this account that I will not be withdrawing in 2019, so I wish the money I put in this year were instead used for IRA contributions for the 2017 tax year.

I am wondering if it was smart to sell some of the Vanguard general investment account and move it to an IRA. My main concerns are with taxes, and I have a few questions.

Is it true that since I have $9000 cost basis, selling something like $3000 of the shares would not involve me realizing capital gains and requiring me to pay taxes for this year? Or would I pay capital gains proportional to the amount each share increased?

If I buy $3000 worth of shares in a traditional IRA, would I still get a tax break on that $3000, or would I still need to pay taxes on it since I first put it into a general investment account and then moved it?

Also, I lost $100 on a separate stock experiment using RobinHood. Can I use that to my advantage in the tax process in any way?

Thank you!"

6so2tz,4,2017-08-09,I'm back.,Anderzzz,OpiatesRecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/6so2tz/im_back/,"Hey everyone..

I'm back. You can look in my post history for my original post on this sub a while back. Long story short I'm addicted to percs, and tried to quit 25 days before leaving town for a summer internship. The idea is that I didn't want to quit because I was forced to, I wanted to quit because I made the decision. Then a summer away from my connections would only solidify my sobriety from painkillers.

If you look at that thread one user mentioned that NYC (where my internship took place) was no safe haven from drugs and running from my problems wouldn't fix them, my addiction would always be there.

I found people at my work who liked to party. Did you know there are cocaine delivery services in NY? I didn't. Send a text with an address and within an hour you get a text back saying a certain car is outside. So I started partying. Then to come down from coke ar 7 am my new friends would have xanex. Before I knew it I was on Craigslist looking for ""blueberries."" 

The first person I met up with tried to rob me but I managed to get away unharmed. You would think this would pretty much end my determination, but nope. Next guy was legit. 

I won't ramble too much longer but I'm worse than before. I'm back home from NY and am still using. Soon I am going to be in a situation where I'm broke as fuck with maxed out credit cards and student loans, and parents that are already charging me rent but want me out of the house by 2018. 

So here I am. I'm back. I used today so I can't count it obviously. But I need to fucking stop or I'll end up in rehab. 

I'm going to hit a meeting ASAP. This sub helped me a lot the first time around This is the worst life to live and I can't believe I let myself back in it after 45 or so days clean. Fuck. "
6sody7,1,2017-08-09,What are the chances of my now ex girlfriend (F/20) and I (M/20) getting back together after a hard breakup?,KongurIV,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6sody7/what_are_the_chances_of_my_now_ex_girlfriend_f20/,"We have been dating for three years. We were high school sweet hearts who fell madly in love. Everything was perfect. Then we went to college. We went to two different colleges, but they were in the same general area, so we still saw each other on a pretty routine basis.

Basically, we did what all new lovers do. We lost our spontaneity and did less to connect with each other. Now we still had a very strong and passionate relationship for all three years, but we definitely lost a certain level of understanding for each other. We didn't understand each other's motives towards the end.

We broke up a year ago due to my depression and some confusion between us, but we got back together pretty much by accident three weeks later. After that, she became much more fearful of losing me.

Over time, the wounds healed, but I don't think she ever completely got over that first breakup. It was absolutely devastating for her. And now the same thing has happened to me.

The last few months, we became increasingly tense with each other. Any small thing could turn into an argument. A big fight we often had would be us getting married. She wanted me to propose badly and I often shot her down and said that we were too young.

It all came to a tipping point about a week and a half ago. She came over to my house and said we needed an honest talk, but it was obvious within a few minutes that she wanted to end things. At this point, I felt relieved. We broke up.

The next few days I really felt the sting of her loss. I constantly wrote and would send her texts saying that we could fix things. She would always just apologize and say that right now we need to focus on ourselves. She didn't think we were compatible, but I don't think that's the case. I think we lost touch with our friendship.

I finally agreed with her that this was best when I realized that I was chasing nothing and she already made up her mind. We left off on a good note.

After a few days of not talking, I texted her and asked how she was holding up. This was actually yesterday. The conversation was tense at first, but she always hoped me the best and was happy to hear that I've been productive. After a while, we began talking about why we broke up. I really focused on sympathizing with her and making her feel better. We came to agreement on a lot of things for the first time in a long time. Then she said she missed me and my dog. I told her I'd love to hang out sometime, but she didn't think that was a good idea. I told her that we could whenever we felt comfortable, and she thanked me for that.

Flash to today, I came to the conclusion that I would like to propose to her. She is teaching her first yoga class next weekend, and I wanted to do it there. First I texted her to see if she was comfortable with me going, and she was fine with it. Then I texted her parents to meet tonight and talk about it. I've always gotten along with her parents, and we left on a good note. When I texted them about catching up, they said that they try to stay out of her business as much as possible and us meeting would be crossing boundaries with her, which I understand. So I told them my real reason for wanting to meet. They said that if I truly loved her, I would give her some space. I began to see that this was true.

At this point I'm thinking that I'll go to the class next weekend and bring a good vibe. After the class, I'll go to her and tell her that I'd love to catch up or come back to a future class, but I'll leave it up to her to contact me.

Here are some additional details:

We were first loves. I was close to her family and grandmother who recently died. Her grandmother's death was one of the hardest things she's ever dealt with. She's been under a ton of stress all summer.

We both have very strong feelings for each other. Just a few weeks ago she was practically begging me to propose to her.

We were best friends. She has two really good friends but only a few others. I have lots of different friend groups, but I'm not particularly close to any of them over the others.

We're both introverts, but she's very type A and I'm very type B.

Another cause of tension for us was my depression and lack of motivation. She wanted to see me try more with my career and life. Since the break up, I've been hustling hard and she knows that.

She told me that she didn't do this to date other people, but the thought is still my biggest worry. If we both stay single I feel confident that someday we can work things out, but I'm worried she will latch on to another guy.

She will be in an internship this coming semester. It's a small office with not a lot of people. She also does freelance work and teaches yoga. I worry most about her meeting men at her yoga classes, but I never actually got to see what that's like. She just started after we broke up.

That's about it. I'd really appreciate some feedback. I think us becoming friends through her initiation would be the best direction to go. I can't imagine living without her, and I know that as soon as we get back together and on a good note, I would propose to her right away. She's my soul mate, and I wouldn't want it with anyone else.

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend and I broke up but are still in love. She wants space, but I feel like we can fix things now. I think the best way to fix this would be starting over as friends.

 * Prospective Resolution (3840x2160, etc.): 3840 x 2160 (UHD 4k)

 * Size (27 inches, etc.): 27 - 30 inches (Big enough to add lots of screen space, but still needs to comfortably fit on a college student's desk).

 * Aspect Ratio (16:9, etc.): 16:9  or 16:10 (I think these are pretty standard?)

 * Adaptive Sync (GSync, FreeSync, or None): I think none. Not a gamer.

I'm a Computer Science student that spends most of the day looking at my laptop screen (MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)). 

After my internship this summer, I have some extra cash and would really like to add a second monitor for school to make programming easier/more productive with extra screen real estate. I'm looking at this as an investment towards my career/profession as a software developer (so let me know if my budget is reasonable -- looking at amazon I think it's doable). 

My usage will mostly be designing mobile/web apps, reading pdf textbooks, and watching TV/Movies. I'm really lost in terms of buying since a lot of monitors are targeted towards gamers and I do zero gaming. Please advise on all of the above as I'm open to suggestions from all of you enthusiasts and experts.
 
As per this link: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587, my laptop should support 3840 x 2160 at 60Hz through the mini Displayport (I'm guessing I'll just need to buy a mini displayport to displayport cable).

6som80,0,2017-08-09,(t4A) Looking for long term detailed partner that would love to play an erotic yet fun story.,MystiChase,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6som80/t4a_looking_for_long_term_detailed_partner_that/,"It all started the day when I downloaded this game called ‘The Academy' you haven't a clue what the game is about, but you heard it was an X-rated game, so I was trying to keep it hush, hush from you, for I know you don't appreciate filth like this in your home. you saw me playing it and wanted to say something, but realizing I is twenty-three and an adult, maybe in age, but not mentally, you feel I has a right to do what I wants. Well you were pleasantly surprised to hear nice music coming from the game, almost classical music, easy to listen to. The graphics were truly spectacular, it almost looked like you were watching a daytime soap opera, the characters looked that real. you noticed there was a white noise being generated in the background again. you guess it was a meadow scene and it was supposed to be the wind or something. The dialog was interesting too. First it sounded like real people talking, not a computer-generated voice at all. It looked like this was an adventure game, where the person was given puzzles to solve, to find clues or hidden things, which help solve the game. Kind of like the Telltale Games.
 
You noticed that my character was a female, a very beautiful female in fact. You found this interesting that I would choose such a character I am not your typical guy but you figured I would choose a male character to live out the fantasies. It was almost embarrassing how beautiful she was too. I was almost jealous I didn't look like her.
 
I heard the beautiful, skimpily dressed girl, my character was standing next too, saying, ""My, my. You need to date  him to get that information that you seek girl. You look like such a tomboy. You need to make yourself look sexy and appealing, for him otherwise he will have no interest in you. Let me get you ready so you will know how to dress properly in the future. I'm sure you can get an outfit that will make his eyeballs pop out of his sockets when he sees you. Come with me dear.""
 
The next scene shows my character naked, and what a body my character has. Well, you guess you can see what is holding my interest in this game, it's all these, almost dressed, girls I see. I was so oblivious of you and absorbed in the game, I didn't even know you were in the room with me.
 
The character that was helping stated, ""Oh Cedric is such a hunk, I has the biggest muscles and the tiniest waist and the most firm delicious buttocks of any man in the realm. His love muscle is the biggest and firmest in the kingdom. I is insatiable and will have you in the throws of orgasms all night long. You will truly grow to love me dear. I also would love for you to do other things for me as well, but I'll let you find out what those things are from him. Come let us take a bath and remove all of your body hair, so you are silky smooth. Then I'll wash your lovely hair and put it up in the most beautiful of locks, that any girl would be jealous of."" With this the other girl took off all her clothes and the both of them went into the hot spring to wash.
 
You noticed I was lying on the couch and was getting sexually excited, judging by the bulge you saw in my pants. 

So I am finding this interesting and sexually stimulating huh? you were beginning to wonder why I would even consider playing this game? This is too weird. It's so girly, why would I possibly take this character in the game? you think you better have a talk with me about this.

-------—----------

Hey everybody,

Thanks for taking the time to review my post!

I am looking for a partner that likes playing characters that evolve over time in multiple settings.

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. The authority figures can be anyone from a coworker that has been at the job longer to an aunt or stepmother or even his boss. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.

So if I have sparked your interest let me know. I also have skype and Kik if that is your thing."

I just finished a bachelors of science in Computer Information Technology. I did an internship as a Digital Marketing Intern.

My view of marketing is this: Almost all marketing nowadays is digital marketing. If you are looking for a marketing expert, the best candidate has experience in *digital marketing*, but your second best candidate has demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to technology and analyze data.

My degree has given me that skill, the ability to adapt to new technology and analyze data. I'm also a self-motivated learner, which would explain my internship in Digital Marketing despite my degree being in IT.

The thing is, many recruiters who are looking for a marketing manager aren't looking for CIT people. They're looking for *marketing* people.

I'm actually very interested in getting into digital marketing, and not just because I'm looking for a professional job, but also because it's an exciting and new field to me that I find i'm good at right out of the box.

Should I use my cover letter as a way of telling them why this CIT grad is a good fit, even though they aren't looking for someone with my background? It seems a little bit too self-serving, like i'm giving myself a pat on the back. What do you think?

tl;dr I want to use my cover letter to tell them why i'm a good fit for the job, even though they aren't looking for someone with my background. What should I do?"

I could be wrong, though. Maybe i'm showing my ignorance.

Somehow I pushed through my last year of college and graduated while working an unpaid internship and part time job. That being said, I was probably doing even more damage to myself by pushing through so much. But now I'm even worse than ever. I can't go 1 hour without having to run to the toilet. I've failed 5-ASAs, pred, Humira, and now trying Entyvio by the end of the month. 
But how do I get people to understand that I'm simply not in any kind of a position to work a full-time job right now? I think if they saw what I was going through then they wouldn't even let me work. Other people call in sick for the common cold or the flu, but this is much worse. How can anyone expect me to just act like everything is normal and work? It's like they don't understand that I'm sick and one bad day away from being hospitalized and needing surgery which would put me out for weeks to months. Do I just need to go nuclear with them and scream in their face that I can't hold any food down, diarrhea pure blood sometimes, and am so fatigued from lack of sleep and nutrients that I just don't have the physical strength to go out?

Because I was diagnosed and medically treated for depression, I never had much desire for sex.  Now that I have begun dating and am weening down my medication, my sex drive has returned.

Aside from some sensory problems that I posted about in another thread, I am quite nervous about sex.  I have been a very shy person for most of my life and never had the courage to talk to guys romantically, or even think that they noticed me at all (although I had plenty of guy friends).  I received pretty good sex education in school and am very open minded and accepting.  My parents, while very progressive, never really discussed sex with me and I never had anyone I could talk to about it.  This is quite ironic actually, because I am an intern therapist who currently works with sex offenders.

I have been dating someone for a bit and we have not become sexually involved yet, but I am nervous (and excited) for when we do.  He knows that I am a virgin and am inexperienced, and he has been very supportive.  I just feel rather silly because I am a virgin at my age and I don't even know how to masturbate (I have tried with little success).  I find myself very uncomfortable when I try to do so.

You've probably seen me post stuff here in the past. Well, I have a favor to ask.

I just graduated from university and have been working in sales. Honestly, I don't like it much. I've been thinking about what I want to with my life, and I came to the conclusion that I honestly don't like anything more than talking Chargers football. I applied to a few internships with sports journalist websites, and I landed one with TSJ sports as their chargers writer.

A big part of my job is to be active on social media and grow my following on twitter, google+ and FB. I'd really appreciate a follow on twitter and google+, I haven't created my FB yet. 

Regardless of whether you follow me, I appreciate you all as fans of the same team I love! Bolt Up!

***

I believe I have written this anecdote before, but it’s entirely too relevant to not bring up again.

In the fourth grade, I “read” the entire dictionary. “Read” is in quotes there because, while I technically read through it, I didn’t read all the definitions. I simply read each word. In order. From A to Z.

In my mind, doing so would make me “smarter.” I have always been prideful of my intelligence, of wanting to prove my brains to the world. Doubly so when I was a young kid who had everyone telling him I was overly smart for my age.

I don’t remember too much of my little adventure, for I was “reading” it so fast. I hadn’t realized there were *so many* words, but, once I started, I knew I couldn’t stop.

At the minimum, when I finished the dictionary, I had a greater appreciation for words. Not just the amount but the variety, weirdness, and importance of them.

*Fune wo Amu* isn’t something one reads through quickly. Rather, it’s something that rewards patience with a wholly satisfying experience.

**STORY**

*Fune wo Amu* begins with Mitsuya Majime, a salesperson who seems a bit out of his element. That is until Araki, Nishioka, Matsumoto-sensei, and Sasaki enlist him to help in the creation of their massive dictionary named Daitokai. Once aboard, Majime starts to feel right at home among the symbols, pages, and words that surround him.

*Fune wo Amu* is best described as an extremely solid show. It doesn’t do anything fancy or unique or special. But it what sets out to do, it does well, giving the audience a complete, well-rounded story.

One of its earliest goals is to showcase how exactly a dictionary is made and what a dictionary means. The show talks about gathering words, performing mundane triple-checks, sacrificing heaps of time, the various notations involved, and even the type of paper required. While expected, learning more about this very niche profession gives the audience a reference point for just how arduous this task can be.

The anime also includes these cute little interludes between the A and B Parts of each episode. Personifications of the different high-profile dictionaries from Japan discuss their differences, their focuses, and their changes. It heavily contrasts the down-to-earth story being told, but these fun asides further help the audience to understand dictionaries at a more fundamental level (in their own silly way).

That down-to-earth feeling is arguably *Fune wo Amu*’s biggest strength. When one steps back and looks at the whole season laid out, nothing extravagant really happens. They work, they make their dictionary, they have dinners, they have relationships, and they simply live their lives. Besides perhaps the final conflict of the season, where a missing word forces a complete recheck of the entire dictionary (bringing in interns and extras to help), the anime does not elevate its drama beyond that of everyday life.

After all, the story’s premise focuses on something arguably very mundane: the creation of a dictionary. How fitting it is then that, through this big book of definitions, the anime explores a relatable theme that any audience member can appreciate: the importance of words.

Words give people the power to express themselves. For someone like Majime, he uses words to write a love letter that oozes feelings. For someone like Nishioka, he can use words to both exude personality and support his good friend. For someone like Matsumoto-sensei, he can share his life’s wisdom with all the words he has gathered over his whole life.

It’s not just the words themselves that matter, though. Their use, place, and context do, too. And *Fune wo Amu* has many strong scenes where its word usage reinforces this idea. For example, in episode three, Majime stammers in shock as Kaguya speaks with him for the first official time, leading to a comedic situation as well as one that perfectly captures his thoughts. Even better, in episode eight, the new hire Kishibe describes the word “right” in the exact same way that Majime did all the way back in episode one, proving that “away-kan” doesn’t fit her current role in the company.

Simultaneously, *Fune wo Amu* focuses on another idea: the pursuit of perfection. With Ferris wheel symbolism in tow, the anime, through Kaguya’s conversation with Majime, argues that nothing is perfect in life. From her dishes to his dictionary, people constantly struggle to follow their higher calling. And, even when they have accomplished their goals, there’s still more to be done.

It’s a realization. How the end isn’t the end but rather the beginning of something new. A motivation that pushes people to grander heights. Like life itself, it goes on and on. A never-ending cycle that’s not daunting but rather fulfilling beyond what even words can describe.

This theme is not explored as much as the show’s theme on words. However, it does sit subconsciously in the audience’s mind, acting as a nice buffer for the anime as it focuses on relationships, work, and time itself.

Speaking of time, *Fune wo Amu* follows an interesting narrative path: a thirteen-year time skip in episode eight. It doesn’t come as a surprise to the audience because the characters constantly implied that creating their dictionary would take quite a while. Plus, the company’s underhanded tactics of pushing extraneous work onto them to hamper their progress slows down their work even further.

This plot element ends up as a catch-22. The anime must advance the plot to deliver its conclusion; it wouldn’t make too much sense to *not* showcase the completion of Daitokai. In doing so, however, the story must skip over a *lot* of content. Majime and Kaguya’s romance. A massive amount of work involved in creating their dictionary. Nishioka’s time away from the Dictionary Editorial Department.

Arguably, this skipped content is not necessarily important. Indeed, the in-between of the beginning of their journey and the end of their journey would be a bunch of busy work that doesn’t exactly work on a narrative level.

Yet it’s also somewhat tough to justify. When the anime places so much emphasis on words and their ability to connect people together, it seems almost unfair for the story to gloss over a *huge* part of the lives of these characters. Granted, the audience got to see the starting of these relationships, but the intricacies, changes, and milestones are lost to time.

*Fune wo Amu* makes another interesting narrative choice near its finale. A choice that’s a bit more on the negative side: Matsumoto-sensei’s death. Matsumoto-sensei’s declining health is alluded to frequently after the time skip, and, sadly, he passes away. But that’s not the issue. The issue is that the anime has him pass away *before* he gets to see the official completion of Daitokai.

The anime does its best to make it a dramatic plot point. Majime feels absolutely heartbroken that he couldn’t finish their dictionary in time, and Matsumoto-sensei leaves behind a parting letter that describes his contendedness.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t work very well.

His death is shoved into the final episode, leaving little time for the audience to dwell on these events. It also gets in the way of the aftermath of the dictionary. After all the buildup and time spent on it, the payoff isn’t exactly rewarding on an emotional or narrative level because now the audience must juggle both of these pivotal plot points.. And it simply feels unnecessary. *Fune wo Amu* builds his character on the fact that he’s the most passionate about dictionaries and that this endeavor is perhaps his last. So, for the narrative to deny him his important resolution injects drama where none is needed (let alone wanted).

Despite this odd plot point right at the finish line, the anime ends on an optimistic note. Hearkening back to its theme on life’s cycle, the anime’s last line reads, “And we will build another ship once again,” implying that Majime’s journey and those of everyone else has only just begun.

And with that, *Fune wo Amu* concludes. It doesn’t overstay its welcome by bogging down the audience with extra ideas or forgotten plotlines. Rather, it reaches a satisfying completion that, while not itself everlasting, leaves its viewers ready to pursue their own perfection, too.

**ANIMATION**

*Fune wo Amu* starts off rather strong on an animation front. When Araki puts on his suit coat or Nishioka motions his hand at Majime during Majime’s welcoming party, the anime gives these non-extravagant actions extra fluidity that’s evident while watching. Given the mundane day-to-day depictions, these extra frames add a spark to the feeling of the show itself.

Artistically, the backgrounds do not vary too much. The Dictionary Editorial Department and Majime’s residence make up most of the setting. These places, while fitting in their numerous binders and wooden walls, don’t have that same spark the animation brings.

To rectify this lack of spark, *Fune wo Amu* incorporates on occasion imaginative scenes that derive mostly from Majime’s mind. A flurry of words echoes him awake as he dreams of Kaguya. He and Nishioka stand opposite one another on a thin layer of water filled with words, the green-sky backdrop punctuating their drive. A hole explodes in the fabric of space that spews forth a raging tornado which sucks in the words that he desperately wants to save.

Keeping with realism instead, the character designs strike simply yet superbly. Majime’s frazzled hair, lanky body, oval glasses, and slightly hunched back capture his awkwardness with ease. Kaguya radiates beauty with her long, dark hair, fair face, and mature demeanor. Matsumoto-sensei exudes a gentleness thanks to the ornate leather necklace around his neck, the uncommon colors of his suits, and the wrinkled smile on his face.

Unfortunately, come episode four, the anime encounters a dip in quality. Animation loses its spark, leaving behind its subtle actions and sticking mostly with stagnate movement during conversations. Similarly, a few sloppy depictions of the characters make their way into some of the final cuts, hurting the artistic integrity of the anime itself.

After episode four, *Fune wo Amu* never gets low artistically again. However, it likewise doesn’t reach the highs of the first three episodes. Indeed, it coasts somewhere in the middle, giving the audience a standard visual experience for the rest of its run.

Yet the anime does create one last spark. It often showed the changing seasons to indicate the progression of time. After that thirteen-year time skip, though, it does an even greater job of visually showcasing this progression. Rather than constantly mentioning the jump in time, the anime highlights smaller details like Majime’s wedding ring, Nishioka’s new smartphone, and the funeral shrine of Take.

Once again, though, it’s the character designs that stand out the most. People often look different thirteen years later, and the same is true for the cast. Majime and Kaguya have bags under their eyes, Araki’s hair turned grayer, and Nishioka grew his out. These details are small, almost insignificant. But they immediately demonstrate the time skip without fanfare.

**CHARACTERS**

Like the story itself, Majime’s journey in *Fune wo Amu* doesn’t scream lavishness or remarkability. But, once again, it’s so solid in its construction that it also doesn’t need to stomp its foot down with force.

In the beginning, Majime is a very socially awkward person. He’s a salesman, but he cannot interact with others without carrying the wrong bag or spilling some beer. Indeed, his favorite hobby – watching people queue for escalators – paints him in a strange light. Even when he is enlisted to help with the creation of Daitokai, he still feels inadequate. He understands his nature, and he doesn’t want to let anybody down.

This new opportunity in his life marks a turning point for him. As the anime depicts, he’s very good with words and working hard at what he does. More importantly, the people around him give him the courage and the support he needs to grow as a person.

Araki is a mentor for Majime, inviting him onto the team, showing him the process, and providing him the chance to fight for something he never knew he wanted.

Take is a mother of sorts. She cooks him food and listens to him over dinner, giving him advice that keeps him hopeful. She’s also a cool wing-girl, setting him up with her granddaughter whenever she can (and with a few winks as well).

Matsumoto-sensei is his role model. Majime and the others not only want to finish Daitokai for themselves and for the people but also for Matsumoto-sensei. His evident passion for dictionaries and his outlook on the words that connect everyone inspires Majime. Matsumoto-sensei sadly does not make it to the end, but, as he similarly puts it, his gratitude towards him cannot be understated.

Kishibe is the new, hopeful junior. Just as Majime learned the ropes and became accustomed to this new venture, Kishibe likewise starts to flourish. She doesn’t realize it immediately, but, with her on the team, Majime gains happiness and drive for the final leg.

Kaguya is his beloved. She loves him not with fervent adoration but with wholesome respect. More so than anyone else, she understands him, the two of them pursuing perfection in their respective fields. She’s quiet like him. She’s mature like him. She’s simple like him. And that makes her the one.

All these people around Majime support him in their own way. His mentor, “mother,” role model, junior, and lover help Majime to grow out of his awkward shell and into the confident man he always wanted to be. 

There’s one other character who supported Majime the whole time. Arguably, he did so the most: Nishioka.

Nishioka sees Majime’s awkwardness firsthand, so he doesn’t initially take to the odd word guru. However, as he listens to Majime speak and sees him work with due diligence, he slowly starts to appreciate him for who he is.

All the while, Nishioka looks out for Majime. He eases Majime’s transition into the team at his welcoming party. He gives him a playful kick on the back out of friendship. He reads the love letter for Kaguya, giving no addendums since he feels it encapsulates Majime already.

To Majime, Nishioka is the person he wants to be. Outgoing, comfortable in social situations, and confident. In return, Majime is the person *Nishioka* wants to be. Passionate, determined, and willing. As Matsumoto-sensei says of the two good friends, they “…respect each other’s strengths and complement each other.” That they share a “wonderful trust.”

The more Nishioka learns of Majime, the more he gets inspired by him. He does everything in his power to make the creation of Daitokai a success – to the point that he gets transferred to a different department. But that doesn’t stop him from enlisting more help, pushing forward, and doing more to follow the path he has found himself on.

Before his transfer, Nishioka has arguably his best moment in the season. In episode seven (where the quote above also comes from), he refuses to grovel at the feet of their manuscript writer. The pride they have in their project, the heart and soul with which he and Majime and everyone else has put into it, means more to them than what some mistress-having jerk may think.

Even after he is transferred, he supports Majime and the others from the sidelines. He works overtime outside of the office. He guides Kishibe. He helms the marketing for the dictionary (going so far as to create the cute blue mascot for the dictionary seen in each episode’s interlude). He unfortunately does not have as much of a presence in the last four episodes, but the effects of his support, both for the people close to him and for the project at large, are no doubt felt throughout.

Thus, Nishioka, like the rest of the cast, supports Majime. Their feelings, their thoughts, and thus their words affect him for the better. Majime doesn’t turn into the life of the party like Nishioka (nobody can), but he now leads the department, he can enter meetings, and he can express himself more clearly.

Yes, Majime doesn’t transform into somebody new, but these many relationships were their own great passage all along.

**SOUND**

[Samples of the OST for *Fune wo Amu* can be heard here.](http://www.neowing.co.jp/product/SVWC-70204/track?from_cdj=1)

[The ED for *Fune wo Amu* can be heard here.](https://track5.mixtape.moe/komwux.webm)

Perhaps surprisingly, the music of *Fune wo Amu* has a lot more finesse than may be at first believed.

The opening track, titled “Shiokaze,” uses a simple beat with dancing sound-effects to achieve a catchy tune. Once the sound of wood hitting wood rings out, the second half begins, and a rolling set of lyrics up the energy of the song as well as the catchiness.

However, it’s the words of those lyrics themselves that pack the most punch. “The vivid clatter of the night.” “Flexible conception.” “Swept and sunk in the waves with sparse opposites and similarities.” The OP’s ability to weave these complex words into not only a cohesive piece but also a story about how words bring people together, which matches a major theme of the anime itself, makes it much more than just a fun tune to hear.

In contrast, the ending track slows everything down with calmness and sensuality. Titled “I &amp; I,” the ED is a love song, and a romantic one at that. Piano and acoustic guitar, like two lovers, support one another, forming a peaceful base that gives the female vocalist the room to express lyrics saturated with sincere feelings and a life-partner’s touch. While less about the words and more about Majime and Kaguya’s relationship, the song makes for a strong contender in how to best represent love in musical form.

Alongside the OP and the ED, the original soundtrack also strikes a nice chord. A triumphant, soldier tune that leads the charge forward. A sometimes sweeping, sometimes cascading melody that harbors high emotion. A pair of delicate acoustic guitars. A brooding, menacing track that threatens all. Many use the same base motif – the titular track “Fune wo Amu” is arguably the best among them – in the same vein as words do, threading together as set of simple yet powerful tracks.

The best track in the whole show, though? The dictionary rap “We are Jisho-tans~.” Their cute song came as a welcome surprise in episode four.

The only real letdown are the voice-acting performances. They are definitely fitting, and none of the actors or actresses were subpar. They simply had no standout roles either.

**ENJOYMENT**

I love almost any kind of anime. (Controversial, I know.)

Yes, I have my preferences in genres and details, but I watch everything and anything that I can. I consider myself lucky that I have a wide taste when it comes to stories. So far, I’ve completed over 300 different shows – yet it’s still interesting to me how rare it is for an anime to focus on a story about adults *for* adults. Most people know already, but so many anime (understandably) focus on high schools, cute girls, and high-octane action.

Which is why *this* anime enters that niche group of shows that appeals to the regular adult male who’s writing these sentences out right now.

This show never tries to wow me. Rather, it simply wants to tell this tale without much fuss. It didn’t win any awards, and it probably won’t be the most recommended anime out there in the future. But, in my mind, that makes me like it *more*. For it knew what it was and what it needed to do, accomplishing all its goals. It showed up, played out its piece, and left on satisfying terms.

Of course, there are specific reasons for why I like this anime. Chief among them is Nishioka. He’s such an awesome dude. A passionate worker, a supportive junior, and a really, really good friend. Silly but thoughtful. Carefree yet driven. He always managed to say or do the right things at the right time, making him my favorite character in the anime. (And I was very happy to see him be a husband and father, too.)

The romance between Majime and Kaguya also makes me smile. My readers know that romance is my favorite genre, so, even though the anime doesn’t give a whole lot of lovey-dovey moments, their connection and the feelings they share with and for one another fill my heart with joy.

Even the small ending skits got me chuckling. They were arguably pointless, but their fun, aside nature, and the fact that the anime occasionally alluded to them once again in some form afterwards, made them little treats that I could never turn away.

*Fune wo Amu* may not do anything exceptional, but, during its quiet stay, it presents the audience with nothing short of a satisfying experience. Strong story beats. Supportive relationships. Some intriguing artistic choices. Emotional music. Filling a spot in that niche adult genre. From A to Z and back again, it defines itself about as well as it possibly could.

**SUMMARY**

Story: Good, a mundane yet satisfying tale about words, life, and the pursuit of perfection

Animation: Fine, while a consistent quality of movement isn’t maintained, and the artistry can see some hiccups at times, the young and old character designs, alongside the imaginative scenes, provide enough visual sparks for the audience to like

Characters: Great, Majime’s many relationships are their own great passage for him, and Nishioka takes a similar trip right alongside his best friend

Sound: Good, good OP, good ED, good OST, cute dictionary rap, and okay VA performances

Enjoyment: Great, a no-fuss tale, plus Nishioka being one of the coolest dudes out there, multiplied by a dash of romance and silly asides equals a fun, mature experience

Final Score: 8/10

But things were going well, and then I failed may 6th. And then I kept on failing. And I think I've either hit rock bottom or am heading towards it. Today I was at my old middle school  to  clean off the computers as part of an internship I'm involved in. I was alone doing this, and after about 20 rooms were done I thought. Hmmm what harm would it be to masturbate at my sixth grade health teachers desk? I did it. Publicly masturbated in my old school. I could've been thrown in jail. I thought about her, other  teachers, girls, even my own mother. I came all over her desk and left. Ive been in a shocked state all day that I can be so disgusting. I've tried finding structure, friends, and enjoying nature, finding a new place to be, meditating, using willpower building tips. It doesn't work anymore. Sometimes I get mad, and get to day 2 or 3, but that doesn't work anymore either. I either need jail, or some serious help. Nothing seems to work. What do I do now?"

I just started my first adult job at a media specialization company as an intern. I thought I would be helping create content for big name companies but for right now, I'm just the coffee errand boy who puts together meeting agendas and refills the water cooler.

I'm 5'9 with a slim athletic physique, dirty blonde hair with blue eyes. My girlfriend is 5'3, black hair, brown eyes with a petite and cute figure. We've been together since college and moved in together in the city after we both got jobs here. It hasn't been easy, to put it simply. We have been arguing and fighting a lot recently and our love life has become a bit dull.

http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mams4uMRWD1qf7cdjo1_1280.jpg

Our usual day consists of waking up in our small apartment, getting ready for work, watching Netflix or movies together, and then going to bed. I wish our lives were more exciting than this. I feel like we are starting to become a couple that doesn't do exciting or new things.

One day, I hear someone moving in across the hall into apartment 4E which has been empty for a couple of months. Later that night, I woke up suddenly to loud music and girls yelling and screaming. It was only Tuesday. After my girlfriend and I woke up several times throughout the night, she asks me angrily to tell whoever it is making that noise to keep it down. I angrily walk into the hall and bang on the door. Someone opens the door after a few seconds, the music gets louder, and my jaw almost hits the floor. A woman with bright highlighted blonde hair, smokey blue eyes surrounded by heavy eyeliner, thick juicy red lips, spray tanned dark skin, and humongous fake breasts barely held back by your bra and tank top. ""What's up?"" she says in a bored and playful way, blowing a large bubble with her bright pink gum. Her less attractive girlfriends still behind her giggle and then resume dancing and drinking. I pause for a moment, still in awe of your unbelievable figure.

https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/15043501_1077607605689537_1830411655922581504_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyMDYxNDA2MzYyOTIyNDIwOA%3D%3D.2.c

""Uh, it's three in the morning."" I say while trying to be serious and convey my point. ""Can you girls.. try to keep it down?"" I say while still eyeing you from head to toe. ""Sure thing, sexy. But next time you should come by and have fun with us."" You say playfully again. I reluctantly break eye contact and walk back to my room. I lay down next to my girlfriend and she asks tiredly, ""Who was that?"" ""Just some girls?"" I lie. The truth is, you're not just some girl. You're the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on, and the new sex symbol that just moved in across the hall.

The next few weeks turn out to be pretty difficult. I can't stop thinking about your body, flirtatious personality and my boring love life. Every time I see you in the hallway or elevator you throw me a wink or stretch showing off your body wrapped in your tiny inappropriate clothes. I start to think less and less about my girlfriend and think more and more about you. These days I seem to find any excuse to stop by your apartment or catch a glimpse of you as you head out with your girlfriends to have fun in the city. I just can't stop thinking about you..

Hey there and thanks for reading. The kinks I want to explore in this prompt are cheating, betrayal, hesitation, bimbofication, public sex, caught cheating, and corruption.

If you want to roleplay, I would like to discuss the character you will be playing a bit. Would you her to be a stripper, exotic dancer, or even a street walking whore? Do you take joy in helping break my girlfriends heart? Will you stop at nothing until I'm your play thing and I do everything you ask?

Let me know if you add anything or have any other ideas for the prompt. Looking forward to hearing from you :)"

First, I'd like to apologize for my English and for the length of the post. I will explain all of my situation and how it led to it so it's going to be long.

I'm going to explain everything first so if you're not interested in all my story, I will separate my story and my questionings about polyamory with ______

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

I'm a 25 yo man and I'm currently in a relationship with a 29 yo woman who is polyamorous.
We're together since two years and I know about her polyamory since the beginning. She's my first ""real"" girlfriend and we slightly discussed that in the beginning of our relationship. She said that she'll always be polyamorous and asked how I felt about that by the time. I replied that it was all new from me, that I needed time to ""digest"" that, familiarize myself with the concept etc. but that theoretically I wasn't against it. I was just afraid that it would create some imbalance in our couple since I'm a very introvert person, I don't meet easily new people even less in a sentimental way. She's quite the opposite in a way. I knew she wouldn't have any trouble to find someone she could fall in love with or to be sexually involved with. So I was afraid that it would create some imbalance.
She agreed that imbalance could be a thing and that it could be problematic and that she'll give me some time to process all this and thus trying to not be involved with anyone (especially men) by the time. I should say that we live together since quite the beginning of our relationship.
She was already involved with another woman (she's bisexual obv and I'm not) and I had/have no problems with it. I'm aware of who she is, I respect her and I can see why she's in love with her. They don't see each other that often but even if it was more regular I don't see why I could have a problem with it.

Then, during the first year, she fell in love and became involved with another woman, they saw each other more often than her other relation but it was still ok, I knew her too etc. That woman is in couple with a man (which I respect too) (they live together) but it the beginning she said to me that she didn't want him involved (mostly sexually) when they saw each other and by the time I said that I was ""kinda glad"" about it. Then time passed and eventually they started to be sexually involved in a three way. She told me and as time has passed, it was no problem for me.

So everything was fine, we lived together, she spent some nights/afternoons with the couple and the other girl and I had/have no issue with it.

Then, she cheated on me after the first year. I use ""cheating"" as she didn't tell me and I found out by myself. I was away for five days and when I came back, I noticed two glasses of wine in the sink while washing the dishes. It immediately struck me. I'm a very observatory person and I think a lot about everything so when I saw that, it was clear that someone had been here. Since it's usual for her to invite friends for dinner/talk I assumed that it was that and that I shouldn't worry about her cheating on me, that I could trust her. 

(Trust is an issue for me as I was betrayed a lot in various ways, especially one time in sentimental way. As I said before, she's my first ""real"" GF because I have been sentimentally involved with another woman on the internet when I was younger (maybe 17/18 yo). We were part of a small community and we became ""virtually in love"". I even went to Paris to see her once (I live in Brussels). I was young, immature and insecure at the time. I though that she were too close to other guys in the community but she was saying (and lying obv) that I was the only one and all that bullshit. Then I found out that she was involved sentimentally and sexually (we didn't sleep together) with a lot of other guys and it crushed me real bad, I took it bad because I was young and had no idea about polyamory etc, but whatever it's not the point here, just to clarify the trust issues.)

One night, three or four months later, I came home drunk, we talked and I said that I trusted her, that it was important for me etc. And I said that when I came back from my vacation, I noticed the two glasses but as I trust her I assumed that she saw a friend or smth. She told me that she didn't see a friend but had an affair with another man. Thanks maybe to the alcohol, it hurted me because she lied to me and that we hadn't discussed the possibility of her seeing another man etc. Shed lied to me because she was afraid I couldn't bear it.
I forgave her because I knew it could happen, because I'm greatly in love with her and that I didn't want to end our relationship over that. I just said that it hurted me a lot that she lied to me, way more than the fact that she had an affair. I asked her to be honest in the future if it had to happen again.

Then, again, everything was fine etc.

Then, in the beginning of this year and for six months (until the end of June) our couple wasn't so great because of me. I'm a very depressed person by essence, I tried to see a psychiatrist and take some antidepressant but it didn't help me so I closed on myself and we weren't sharing a lot of things (sexually sided also). It was hard for me and for her and even more in June since we're both still in the university and had exams. At the end of June, after our exams I was happy to be a little peaceful and that we could work on our relation to relaunch it again. She went on vacation in Berlin with a friend of her for a week and I couldn't go with her because of the timing with my exams. It wasn't easy for me to be away from her for a week and I was so glad to be with her when she came back.

The night when she came back, she told me that while in Berlin, she started to talk with a Indian guy she knew from 10 years ago and fell in love with him. It was hard because I was so happy to see her and she directly told me that. Then she said that she would like to go to India to see him (It is worth saying that India is a big deal for her as she lived there for a year and fell in love with the country). During the same discussion, while I was processing all this, she told me that she was actually going to see him in July, she just needed to get some money for the plane. It was even harder for me. I went to being so glad that she came back to she fell in love with another guy, I will have to cope with this, to it's going to be hard if she leaves to the opposite side of the planet for him and finally to she's leaving in two weeks to see him. All that in the length of a discussion the night she came back from Berlin and I felt kinda responsible for it. Yes she's polyamorous so it isn't that surprising but the fact that our couple was going trough a rough phase for so long had to play something in it (and she admitted it).

The two weeks after this were kinda hell for me. As I said, just before she came back from Berlin, I was determined to work on our couple, to do things together and make it for the best. But instead, she was just trying all day to get money for the plane by selling stuff, seeing friends that could borrow her money, scanning websites to find the best deal (and even doing stupid stuff like going to www.cheapplanesonlastminute.com and trying to remove cookies from her browser to lower the prices [As I told her, it didn't work]). During this time I made her clearly understand that I wasn't comfortable at all with the situation, that the timing was bad and that the last thing that I wanted was for her to be away for another 10 days (adding the fact that it was to see another guy). She kept telling me that she didn't really know if she was going to go, maybe she wouldn't find enough money, that she didn't know if she was going because of him or India. But I knew she was going to leave, whatever she could tell me (and of course, she went).
But because I'd like to think that I'm more mature now, as I said to her, I couldn't and didn't want to forbid her to go or to stop talking to him. She doesn't belong to me because we're a couple and I don't belong to her either so I have no authority over what she want to do and that's why I'm really attracted by the concept of polyamory in theory. I love her for what she is, not what I think she is and what could be beneficial for my ego. I love her and I love that she is polyamorous, that she is seeing this other girl and this couple.
So I said this to her, that I couldn't forbid her anything but that I wasn't confortable with this situation at all and that it was hurting me (And I'm still trying to find all the reasons for it. Is it because it's a guy alone? [Vs the couple that I have no problem with] Is it because I don't know him even she talked to me about him?). I didn't want to forbid her because I knew it was genuine plus the fact that she's studying medicine and will have to go trough internships during two years without any real break starting this ending of July. She said to me that I should have told her how I felt before because I started showing more and more of my malaise as her travel was approaching. Since I'm a very introverted person, at first I did all I could to keep it for me and not bothering her with it and tried to work on it on my own. But as it didn't help I couldn't help myself but feeling down and thus showing it (maybe hoping that she would retract on her own so that I wouldn't really  be the bad guy who forbid her to leave, but that's strictly the same thing, just a more manipulative way.). So she said that I should've told her sooner because now she was too involved with him and that she couldn't do this to him. It hurted that she preferred to continue her story because she didn't want to hurt him by not going vs hurting me by leaving. It hurted but it wasn't only that binary as I knew she really wanted a trip to disconnect from everything in India before going hard for her internships. 

So she left for ten days, leaving me deeply depressed and alone (well not exactly since we have two beautiful cats). Time passed, not so slowly thanks to the weed I was smoking all day long, probably to help me cope with it.

It didn't even go well when with him when she was there. They had sex once and then he didn't want to anymore. (I should mention that sexuality is very important to her, not in the way ""we should wait before the first time"" but because it's an very special and intense way to communicate with someone and I fully agree with that). So it hurted her and she felt rejected. He had trouble showing his emotions, looking at her etc. It hurted her and so it hurted me even more because I blame him for that. She traveled half the planet for him, leaving me behind and he did that to her.

So now she's back and their relationship hasn't really changed. They still talk a lot and are in love with each other even with what happened which doesn't simplify things for me since I'm more lost with all the situation than before, not understanding it. It's harder as she stated she wanted to go back really bad to see him again, hoping he will have dealt with his shit. She's planning to try to do an internship in India in 6 months during 3 months I think (or 1, not really sure but it doesn't really matter, it's long) and, right now, I don't see how I will survive that. She's trying to do an internship there the same way she was trying to go there in the first place so I'm sure that she will go.

Since she couldn't stop with him and I love her and doesn't see our relationship ending because of this, I try to cope with the situation as much as possible, trying not to think to much about it and trying to finds ways to be ok with the situation but sometimes it hits me like a fucking train and I feel bad (as now, leading to me writing all this lol).

Our couple has improved since she's back because I try as hard as I can to improve myself because I love her.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

A quick TL;DR for those who didn't want to read the whole story : I'm in couple with a polyamorous woman. I theoretically agree with polyamory as being in couple doesn't give power over the other and, while I'm not atm, if I meet someone I would like to be able to live something with her without breaking up with my GF because I feel it's right and love isn't exclusive.
So she's seeing another woman and a couple from time to times and I'm 100% ok with it but she fell in love with an Indian (we live in Belgium) when our couple was a little down, she went to India to see him when I was feeling really depressed. I was not comfortable with her going but couldn't and didn't want to forbid her so she went and she's planning to go back there for an internship in 6 months. And I'm trying to cope with the situation as I love her so much and doesn't want to break up with her.

So now the questionings.

Does polyamory include total freedom? Meaning if she or I fell in love with another person, it doesn't really matter if she or I aren't comfortable with the situation for any reason? How do you cope with that? Setting limits or having a ""stop everything"" button seems kinda wrong as being in couple doesn't mean having control over the life of the other.

I feel like the sucker (not sure of the expression, in french it's ""la bonne poire"") who say yes to everything she could or would do in the sake of polyamory. Do you have a say in the other relationships of your mate?
Am I fooling myself by thinking I'm ok theoretically with polyamory but in truth I'm not?
Why does this situation bothers me when the other relations she has does not give me any trouble? Is this because it's a guy alone and so just ego-related?
When in a polyamorous relation, is there any kind of ""levels"" between you and the other persons your mate sees? It's an hard questioning for me because if so, it feels kinda wrong as I try to be as less ego-driven as possible and if not it's hard for me to cope with the fact that I matter in the same way than a guy at the other side of the planet she just met vs our couple that we built over two years.
Should I break up with her because of that? It feels wrong as I'm ok with her seeing the other woman and the couple so I need to cope with this situation.

Thank you for reading. I hope to have some answers and discussion following my long post and that I didn't write all this for nothing. Well, even if I get no answer, writing this down felt good and so it was worth it.

Should I make her read this? As I'm a very introvert person, I'm really better at writing than speaking.
Should I talk with him? Should I make him read that too? Should I ask her permission first?

Thank you and have a nice day."
6sstp6,1,2017-08-10,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6sstp6/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

6ste1p,1,2017-08-10,Pre-Completion OPT,MonsterMeggu,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/6ste1p/precompletion_opt/,"So my employer decided to extend my summer internship into the fall. Currently I'm on CPT but to intern for the fall I need to use Pre-Completion OPT as I won't be able to get approved for CPT again (for next semester at least). 

I've been trying to find more information on it but a lot of the information is related to post-completion OPT. So my questions are:

1. How long does pre-completion OPT take to get approved?

2. If I work part time for pre-completion OPT for 2 months, does it subtract 2 months from my post-completion OPT, or does it only subtract 1 month from my post-completion OPT?"

&gt;By which I mean at least one hundred halflings all entered her name in our Winter Intern drive. They all seemed a little nervous, and their handwriting was very shaky. Who knows! Maybe they were very, very cold. Winter, right?!

Did she extort her way onto the C team?

6stie8,2,2017-08-10,Early 30s and in credit card debt for the first time - time for a 2nd job?,pfthrwaway222,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6stie8/early_30s_and_in_credit_card_debt_for_the_first/,"Long story short, I have a tight budget, didn't have much in savings, and went from $0 in credit card debt a year ago to just over $6000 now due to a combination of a few bad choices and a few unexpected expenses. I terrifies me just how quickly the credit card debt built up without me really noticing and I'm very concerned about it growing to an unsustainable level.

My current debts:

Student loan - $29000

Credit cards - $6200

Car - $15000


My current budget:

Monthly take home pay - $1892

Rent - $800

Car payment - $320 

Car + renter's insurance - $105

Student loan - $220

Utilities - Usually about $60

Food - $160

Gas - ~$30

Internet - $0 

Haircut - $30 every 6 weeks or so


If I'm careful I usually end up with around $150 left each month, all of which goes to credit cards. I canceled Netflix, Spotify, etc. and don't leave my apartment except for work or groceries.

I don't feel that my current expenses would be all that unreasonable if I could get more money coming in. I have a Computer Science degree, earned last year, but have had trouble finding a relevant job. My biggest issue right now seems to be that I have no experience in the field (from internships or otherwise) and I'm nowhere near a major tech job market and can't afford to move without a job lined up. I've been really pushing to apply for more jobs, trying to network, etc but I'm beginning to worry that I'm just not going to be able to land a software job out of state, at least not any time soon. 

I'm in the process of selling pretty much everything in my apartment except my bed and I believe I'll make about $1000-1500 total cash by the time I'm finished. I'm expecting a bonus at the end of the year of about $2000-3000. I should be able to meet my obligations and pay down some of my debt between now and the end of the year but obviously my current financial situation isn't sustainable.

I have some positive equity in my car so I will probably, very reluctantly, sell it and replace it for something cheap. Moving back with a parent isn't an option unfortunately but I can try to find a cheaper living situation when my lease expires next year.

This is getting kind of long but my biggest question is: is it worth it to get a part time job to try to pay down debt faster? I think my mental health would suffer but who knows, I might meet some people and it might be a good kick in the ass to be more frugal in the future and not do stupid shit like go buy a new car based on a job I think I'll have. Or am I better off spending my free time continuing to apply for as many jobs as possible, prepare for interviews, work on programming side projects to have something to talk about in interviews, etc?"
6stx66,1,2017-08-10,[M4F] Young office intern/Bimbo slut/Celebs/Her first massage. . . And more,CZ2Collin,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6stx66/m4f_young_office_internbimbo_slutcelebsher_first/,"If you have any other ideas that you think I may be interested based on what you see here you are welcome to suggest them to me!


1) You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.


2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower.


3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”.


4) A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…


5) Private tutoring for a young girl


6) You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….
For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. 

If you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!


I'll be at work all day so feel free to send me a message whenever.

Kinks: Cumplay, age play, lingerie, instructions, oral (giving/receiving), other vanillaish stuff
Limits: The usual, scat, gore, violence, rape, death, futa, furry, group, etc"

6sudwv,112,2017-08-10,Self-doubt to the point of sabotaging yourself? Is anyone else so afraid of failure that they sabotage themselves? Sometimes even unintentionally? [Long],Raveynfyre,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6sudwv/selfdoubt_to_the_point_of_sabotaging_yourself_is/,"I don't think I've submitted a post in some time, basically since I still have a hard time accepting that I do belong here, even though my grandmonster's are the narcs, my contact with them was relatively limited, and at worst my dad just struggles with a LOT of FLEAs thanks to being raised by a queen-bee, manipulative, textbook narc. 

(He's really working on them, he actually apologized to me for interrupting me the last time we met up, and my jaw hit the table when he did it. I'm very used to being dismissed or spoken over when my father and husband are in the same room.)

Since my teens I have struggled with self-sabotage, believing the put-downs and ""overheard"" conversations from family members saying that I wouldn't amount to anything. When ever I get a fantastic opportunity for growth, development, etc., I somehow end up sabotaging myself. Sometimes I do it subconsciously and I don't remember what or how I did it.

Ex. When I was about 16 (approx. 22yrs ago), I went to a local event at a comic book store in the mall, and there were executives there from the comic book company ""Tekno Comics."" It was a small company, but at the time it was new and growing in popularity. I took my sketchbook and spoke with one of the Exec's there about possibly working for them when I was old enough. I was trying to get feedback so that I could work on any gaps in my skills so that I would be able to draw whatever was requested of me by the time I applied with the company.

As I was speaking to a Vice President and showing him my sketches, his eyes lit up, and quite frankly he looked like a kid given free run of a candy store. He gave me his card and said I should call him when I was ready for an internship (he tried to offer me one right there, but my father was *looming* ofc).

I felt amazing, because an offer like that, to a 16 year old still in High School, and the fact that I was offered this *as a woman* was absolutely mind-blowing. That industry (at the time) was extremely male dominated, because 99% of women just weren't into drawing comic book art.

Let me say right here that my father was very supportive of the idea at this time. He had previously told me that my artwork and comic book sketching would get me nowhere in life, and that I was unlikely to make a career out if it. Then one day I drew this amazing picture of two X-Men characters (one comforting the other as she's crying [Jean Grey and Jubilee]) and my father started crying when he saw it. It moved him that much, and from that point on he told me I could do whatever I wanted to do, even if it meant trying to break into the comic book industry.

I know that I put that card somewhere very special, so that I would not lose it, and no, it was not someplace that my parents knew about. There was no one in that house who would try to sabotage me intentionally (that was left to my aunts and grandmothers, who at most only visited for a few weeks every 6 months or so). Both of my parents were extremely supporting of it, after my dad came around, and my mother has always been an artist.

I don’t know how, or why, but that card just wasn’t there the next time I went looking for it (a few weeks later) so that I could begin the process of applying for an internship. I tore my room apart looking for it. I went through every spot in the house where I might have ended up leaving it for some other reason (I can be forgetful, but I was not as bad as I am now). I was devastated when I couldn’t find it, and because this was in the age of dial-up internet, it wasn’t as easy as it sounds to get contact information for executives at companies.

My only explanation is that I sabotaged myself by throwing out the business card in a fogged up depressive mood swing, and I got rid of it because I was convinced that I couldn’t succeed. Not because anyone told me I couldn’t do it, but because **I** thought I couldn’t do it.

Anyway, I’ve always felt this kind of impending doom, when a fantastic opportunity comes knocking on my door. Thoughts along the lines of somehow/ someway I’m not going to measure up so I may as well not try. I’m sure that I’ll fail, or be humiliated just trying to fulfill whatever my dream is or take advantage of some kind of fantastic opportunity. My self-doubt  is almost innate or ingrained in me at this point in my life.  I also have Major Depressive Disorder, and I’ve tried multiple kinds of anti-depressants. Unfortunately, they just do not work for me, or they make me worse, like wanting to go play in traffic or commit suicide in some manner (Ex. thoughts of wanting to yank my steering wheel very hard to drive off of a bridge while I’m driving on it –that was a fun one).

Right now I’ve started doing something that could potentially be a fantastic opportunity if I do it right, but the thoughts of self-deprecation have come back. “I’m not going to succeed”, “I’ll just lose money”, “I won’t be able to sell &lt;product&gt;”, and you get the idea. 

I’m trying very, very hard to ignore those thoughts, and I’d like to ask you all about how you cope with it if you have the same issue. I keep telling myself, that even if I just do this for “funsies” then that is justification enough. Even if I never sell a single item, it’s something that I enjoy doing so it’s worth it. 

Those are the only thing keeping me going with this prospect right now. My husband isn’t as supportive as I wish he was, and has in fact complained about what I’m doing because he doesn’t understand what it’s like to be creative yet constantly stifled by your own self-doubt. I don’t think he’s ever doubted himself, so he really can’t relate to how negative comments affect my ability to be creative and do something for enjoyment, so I have no one I can talk to about this who is close to me and will prop me up a little when I need it.

Maybe I’m just sick in the head, because a lot of people online have been supportive, and thought that my creations have been amazing, but I think if I had just one friend that I could talk to face-to-face it wouldn’t be that big of an unsurmountable mountain of “you’re not going to succeed!” thoughts in my head (annnnd I’m crying now.)

I tried to be as descriptive as possible in the title but if there's any more info that would be helpful to know just give me a heads up. I also searched most of these questions so hopefully, these aren't repetitive. 

I'll just list some of the big questions I've been having below.

* How bad is the commute from Freeport, Long Island to 30 Rock? 
* With around 2,000 in the bank and making 1,200 a month at the internship, would finding a closer place on my own even be possible? If I could get financial help about how much would I need?
* Would I need a car to get around in Freeport? I could drive from Miami to New York if having my own car would make Freeport a more enjoyable place to stay.
* Being from Miami I own ZERO real winter clothes, I was thinking I could just show up in New York and hit some local thrift stores or good will. Is there a cheaper / better way to get my hands on the winter stuff I'll need?
* Are there any recommended housing programs for interns? 
* I am open to possibly staying with my family for one month and then finding my own place. Should I be looking at Airbnb, subleasing or another option?
* Is there anything you feel I should I know about the area where I'll be working or where I'll be staying?
* How expensive would the public transit for that commute be?

**Thank you** so much for any and all help, it's greatly appreciated.

6sul0x,79,2017-08-10,Speak No Japanese and Don't Want to Teach Eigo - Here are Some (Obvious) Tips for Career Building,kidvibe,japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/6sul0x/speak_no_japanese_and_dont_want_to_teach_eigo/,"Hello,

A question that I see pop up often is “I want to find a job in Japan that doesn’t have to do with teaching… But I don’t speak Japanese”.

Well, as someone who managed to find a job that has nothing to do with teaching and speaks minimal Japanese, I figured I’d shed some light on how it all came to be. This post is geared towards newbies who are arriving, just arrived, or are stuck in the muck here in Nihon*.

I came to Tokyo on a work holiday visa (WHV) almost two years ago and had no job lined up whatsoever. Psst.. If you can’t get a WHV, you’re probably going to have to work a little harder then I did(ganbatte). Anyways, when I arrived, I started my search online with the hopes of something popping up. 

*Nihon... I guess I should specify and say Tokyo. If you're living outside of Tokyo, I would assume the job pool shrinks considerably.

Biting the bullet:

Coming to Japan, not speaking Japanese, I realized job hunting was going to be difficult and therefore had literally no expectations. I searched EVERYDAY on different sites (which I linked below) to see what was out there. I made the conscious decision that, if I wasn’t able to find a job I wanted, I’d teach.

Six weeks later, I started my first shift at an eikaiwa.

I took the job because I didn’t want to see any more of my money leaving my account rather than going inside it. However, I made sure of one thing… that this particular job would be part-time. This was critical as you’ll soon see.

Working at the school wasn’t so bad. It was small, privately run, and close by. Heck, I didn’t even need to wear a suit. So all-in-all, teaching was pretty good -- but it wasn’t good enough to keep me in Japan long-term. So during my free time, I was searching the web to see what else was out there. 

A few months passed and I was getting a bit desperate. I found a marketing gig on Craigslist that was actually an unpaid internship… I was 27 and decided to take it. Once again, I didn’t speak Japanese, I had no specialized skills, thus my choices were limited. 

Mentors:

Thanks to my teaching job being part-time, I was able to work at the internship (which only required 10ish hours a week). 

I won’t get into much detail but doing the internship was probably the best decision I could have made. The two bosses/mentors I was fortunate to work under really taught me a lot of the skills I needed to learn but more importantly, they helped grow my network (a must if you want to climb the career ladder in Japan). For the next 10 months, I worked two jobs (well, one job and one intern position). The teaching job kept me afloat and allowed me to have fun, the internship taught me the required skills needed to get into the type of career I wanted.

Oh, and during all this time, I was looking for new jobs online EVERYDAY (or every other day). It’s my third time repeating this but remember, if you don’t speak Japanese and don’t have a specialized skill -- you know the rest.

Anyways, the internship ended and I was back to only teaching. A few months later, thanks to looking for jobs everyday, I found an opening. I applied, got an interview, and due to my newly acquired skills (and my mentor walking me through the interview and giving a great referral), I got the job I wanted. 

Oh, this entire process from landing in Japan to getting a job outside of teaching took me 14 months! So yea, things like this take time.

Since then, I found a new (and more rewarding) job thanks to looking online during my free time (you know the drill). Also, on another somewhat related note, I’ve been able to score a few freelance gigs through networking and joining new communities (meetup.com, hobbies, etc).

All in all, what I would like to pass on is that if I can do it, so can you. Just know that it takes time. I’ve shared a list of a few resources I use to see what else is out there in Japan. You probably know most of these but maybe a couple are new to you.

Summary
-
-
-

1) You probably will have to teach one way or another. Don’t let this job consume your life -- if you can, take a part-time gig and keep hunting to see what’s out there.

2) You have little choice (unless you’re skills are specialized*). Internships, regardless of your age, may be your only way ‘’out’’ of teaching. Just be sure your boss(es) are legit, have strong networks, and will take you under their wing. 

3) Patience. These things take time. Look for job openings everyday.

4) Network! If all else fails but you have a strong network, you’re still in the game. Friends of friends have businesses and may know of openings that aren’t posted online. Stop going to Roppongi and gaijin-smashing and go to a meetup.

*Specialized skills such as graphic design, coding, engineering, UX/UI, give you a big boost in the hunt for non-Japanese speaking roles. 



Resources for job hunting:

[craigslist](https://tokyo.craigslist.jp/?lang=en&amp;cc=us) - Probably my fave resource (surprise)

[gaijinpot](https://jobs.gaijinpot.com/) - Has the odd non-teaching, no Japanese required job. 

[justa](https://justa.io/en) - Focused on startups. Great if you're a dev, engineer, etc.

[the muse](https://www.themuse.com/jobs?job_location%5B%5D=Tokyo%2C%20Japan&amp;filter=true) - Mostly bilingual but there are some entry level jobs that require no Japanese. There are also high level jobs for big companies too.

[indeed](https://jp.indeed.com/) - Hit or miss, usually a miss.

[tech in asia](https://www.techinasia.com/jobs?location_name%5B%5D=Japan) - See indeed.

[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view-all/?country=jp) - Similar to the muse.

[daijob](https://www.daijob.com/en/) - Mostly bilingual. You might find the odd job for non-Japanese speakers.

Good luck!

6svpxm,9,2017-08-10,"ED and weight loss: am I being unhealthy? (TW: ED, depression, suicide)",[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6svpxm/ed_and_weight_loss_am_i_being_unhealthy_tw_ed/,"Hey everyone, 

I'm subbed on my main account, but a fair number of my friends know about it, and I'd like for this issue to be private for now. 

Some basic stats: 
I'm 21, female, lightly active (10k steps a day, exercise 3-4 times a week), 180lbs, 5'7. TDEE calculators put me at 2200-2500 calories per day. For reference, if I'm just eating relatively normally (being mindful but not restrictive), I eat about 1900-2000 calories per day. 

I've struggled with eating disorders since I can remember. I've had bad experiences with my ED to the point where I didn't lose much weight but almost killed myself. 

Due to a bout of serious depression, I ended up gaining 20 lbs in the past six months. I was sitting at a relatively ok 160 lbs before, though I was still trying to lose weight. I talked to my therapist, who is aware of my ED issues, and she said I should start losing weight. I'm still quite depressed, and I told her that calorie-tracking has made me very obsessive in the past, but she said I could always stop. I bought a food scale and redownloaded MyFitnessPal. 

Now food is all I think about. I go to a high-stress university and have an amazing internship and all I can think about is food instead of my hobbies or my classes or reading. I have a food scale and I use MyFitnessPal religiously. A few things that have indicated to me that maybe I'm not being particularly healthy about my weight loss: 

1. I almost brought in a food scale into a restaurant on a date. 

2. I couldn't fall asleep one night and hated my body so much that I got up from bed, did 50 squats and some planks, and then went back to bed. 

3. I eat 1200-1500 calories on the days I exercise (hour of intense martial arts), and today, I haven't eaten anything. I kind of want to see how long I can go without eating.

4. Eating makes me feel sick. I want to throw up. I get lightheaded but I just don't want to put food in my mouth because it feels like I can't swallow it properly. 

5. I measure myself several times a day with a measuring tape. 

6. I'm insanely jealous of my good friend, who is a size 0 and constantly talks about how little she eats in front of me. She also lives with me. I don't even want to talk to her anymore because hearing her talk about how she loves her flat stomach or how she's full after half an appetizer just reminds me of my own gross body and habits. 

I told this stuff to my therapist but she hasn't told me that I should stop, but I'm getting kind of scared. She admits she doesn't have much experience with eating disorders, and truthfully I only got a couple of sessions of therapy for my ED last time. 

I don't know if I should put this to a stop, or if I'll feel better once I'm in the 140-155 range so I should just tough it out. I feel like if my therapist isn't telling me to stop, then I don't deserve to stop--I'm just making excuses for myself to be lazy. My entire family thinks I should lose weight and encourages it. No one has told me it's unhealthy. So obviously I'm fat, although I'm confused because I wear a firm medium in women's tops and a size 31 in jeans and men stop to tell me that I'm beautiful when I'm walking down the street. 

Should I be losing weight? I don't even know anymore. If any of you have struggled with an eating disorder, I'd love to hear from you. "
6svq7a,3,2017-08-10,"[Rant/Vent] [Progress] [TW: Rape, Physical Abuse, Self Harm] I've finally started getting my life together and I just need to post this somewhere of what has happened to me in life.",lemon_goes_awoo,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6svq7a/rantvent_progress_tw_rape_physical_abuse_self/,"I wanted to vent here because I often struggle with coming to terms with the things that have happened to me as a kid. I want to say in advance for mods and readers that this will be a long ass vent of parts of my shitty life. There is one part that I really struggle with because I can't fully remember it. I never told one until 2014 when I spoke to my therapist, and to one ex, and my current boyfriend. I recently got an email from my mom to which I have been NC for around a year informally (I never told her, just her step-mom) and it's aggravating the progress I've made. 

tl;dr

* Got raped and molested by my uncle at the age of 3/4.
* My mom neglected me as a child in various forms (child support for drugs, threw me off to my grandfather, encouraged me to eat a lot of food, used me for money)
* Dad choked me and would often forget to visit because drugs and alcohol.
* Struggled with the loss of my grandfather (only good person in my immediate family).
* My ex cuckolded me and I was blind to it. 
* Uncle threatened to cut me off if I didn't give him my share of money from Grandfather's death.


Full story:
One of my earlier memories was being raped as a kid. I was born male and I remember in particular being guided to the bathroom where he penetrated me, I also remember him after, pulling my pants up and having the zipper hit my genitals. It was in 1997 and I only remember the year because it was on that year, in my state of Maine, that we had a terrible ice storm. It was also the only time in particular that I explicitly remember him being at our house. My father was never in my life because he left my mom when she was 7 months pregnant. I never told him about this and when I mentioned this to my mom, she refused to believe me. Time and time again I argued with her and she conceded that my timeline of events matches up with the one time he was here, but she still never fully accepted it. I never had asked her why she never believed me because she also has no contact with my uncle anymore, but this greatly bothered me. 

As time went on though, we eventually had to move out of the original house where I was raped. We moved into a new town that had a relatively low population. I was around the age of 5. I would go on to live in this area until I moved to a new town for graduate school. It was pretty rural, the type where there were no stores within a 5 mile radius. School and daycare would be fine. I can recall one moment in daycare where I was chased down and beaten up by two kids and my mother had stuck to my side. That in particular is one of the few positive things my mom did for me. But usually at home she would either cook spaghetti or order out chinese food/pizza. This was something that was a daily occurrence, and being young I didn't really know much about nutrition and dietary needs. I gained a lot of weight as a kid and it progressively got higher for every year as a kid and in my teens. To make it worse, when she did cook she would usually leave the dishes (which some still had food) on the stove/sink for weeks on end. 

As I got older she would eventually start berating me for not doing the dishes. I would often clean my own plate and utencils but to her that meant the entire thing. She at the same time would tell me that she'd do the dishes when she got to it, but usually she just sat back and watched TV to sleep. Usually however I didn't clean the dishes because we ate out a lot. 

Also during my childhood I became really close to my grandfather. He dedicated so much time, energy, and emotion to me. With respect to family relations, he was my father's father. So while my father never married my mom, he still loved me unconditionally. My mom used this to her advantage in two different ways: My father struggled to consistently pay child support and when he didn't, my grandfather would help her buy things; second, she put me in the care of my grandfather to smoke weed. These two went hand in hand because she would only buy me a new toy or video game on the rare occasion she had additional money. She worked full time at a hospital as a secretary for well over 20 - 30 years, giving her an okay pay, but still low-middle/middle class. Usually however she would buy weed, and I know this because by the time I was in college she casually brought it up as we reminisced about my grandfather when he died. I think barring my birthday and Christmas, it was around 1 to 3 times per year I would get something. 

Time with my grandfather was always really nice because it was the only time I really learned about work ethic. We would often stack wood and cut it together. He had a wood furnace so the work we did contributed greatly to our comfort in the winter. He also had his own antique lot and would buy cedar chests at auctions, clean them up, and then resell it at his antique lot which was hosted in some bigger antique mall. He named his own personal lot after me as well, and the money he made also contributed to my college fund. Almost every positive thing in my life is associated to my grandfather: He was the one who would buy me clothes and toys, he was the one who told me I would go to college, and that it was because of him I had things to do after school. He was a hard working guy growing up, he dedicated most of his career in the Air Force and got to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and when he retired he taught US History for eighth graders. I always believed that my dad and uncle were jealous of me, if not subconsciously, because he used to be the staunch, hardworking military officer as a father. To me however he was just so.... laid back but still principled. He never asked of me to do the level of work that he made my uncle and father went through. I was fearful at first, but I eventually came out to him as a transsexual, and fearing that his more conservative side would dislike that, he only was sad because I was afraid to tell him. He only thought of my safety. Being with him was a complete 180 to being at my mom's home. But even with him like this, he was still sadly an enabler. I do not hold any contempt or sadness because he was a guardian to me. But he would never call out my father's behavior or cut him out.

Eventually when I was a sophmore in high school, my father moved back to Maine. He lost his job for reasons that he never told us. But he came back as a total mess. It was clear his body was wracked from a life time use of drugs and alcohol. He had no other place to go and so he came back to live my grandfather. When I visited my grandfather during this time, I got to know my dad a lot more. Prior to this I saw him once or twice a year, with some years of him being unable to come up because he was inebriated. He tried policing me around and acting like he was a best friend to me. This caused some conflict because while he was my father, he did just feel like someone not connected. The first time he tried to use his position as my father over me I retaliated because I didn't see that authority in him. He pushed me to a wall and choked me, and had his other hand in a fist. He told me not to explicitly to not fuck with him. My dad had violent outbursts at time and was easily triggered by some types of stimuli (he HATED to be shushed for example) and I was the target of it sometimes, but this time it was the worse. I never told my grandfather about this sadly. Whenever he tried to lecture (read: yell) at me, I would typically disassociate from it or imagine doing other stuff. I would separate the idea of my mental self to my physical self, turn off my ego, and just blindly nod or agree, thinking that the person he was targeting was someone else. My grandfather would give my father money at times for when he helped him work around the house or elsewhere and he would often use that to buy alcohol. I remember vividly seeing the effects of withdrawal because my dad had REALLY bad tremors if he stopped drinking after a week or two. The timeframe to when tremors occurred is foggy to me, but it was scary to see that this guy was my dad. His presence would eventually cause a schism between me and grandfather. It got really bad after I went to college. One day when I was back there, when I was making it known I am trans, he grabbed my ass and called me his girl in a weird way. That was the final straw between me and my father, and when I went to my mom's home I told him about this and my grandfather was distraught by it but didn't know what to do. I left his house without knowing what would really happen. When I was back at my mom's that night I sent him a scathing email that I can't be around my dad and he had to choose him or me. He couldn't really choose but the sight of the email caused him to get really depressed. I still remember hearing him on the phone saying that ""[You're] killing me"", which expressed so much desperation. He knew my dad went too far and he didn't know what to do. This last part was during the Late Fall/Early winter of 2013. 

He died around 5 months after I sent the email. I went back to school a couple weeks after I sent the email and we didn't talk as much as we used to. I would update him about how I'm doing and everything. Some weekends I went back and saw him, not really sticking to my ultimatum, but he was still depressed. He was also having some health issues with his liver, but he never let on that it was a big issue. On 16 May, 2014, he died. It was in the middle of the night and I was informed twice by my uncle (one of the only few times he personally called me) that my grandfather was in the hospital, and then the next when he was officially dead. I felt so fortunate in hindsight because I spoke with him that night telling him I got on the dean's list (first or second time too!!) and that I loved him and would talk to him again. While the latter wouldn't happen, it still felt good that I got to talk to him. This caused a lot of fights between my Mother, Father, and Uncle. He left us with money, and initially I was told that my uncle would honor the wishes of my grandfather by getting his car. One issue came up however with the last signed will did not say it was there for me, even though he said I could. As time went on my father was squatting at my grandfather's house while he and my uncle were discussing what to do. My dad would effectively become homeless if they sold it but he didn't care. If they sold it my father could afford an apartment, but the death of my grandfather sent my father into a deeper spiral of drinking. Eventually we got money from insurance and through his will, but my uncle became increasingly antagonistic about paying for the funeral. My mom had next to no money and I was just a college student. He tried to coerce us to giving us our share of insurance money to pay for it, by my mother refused to. In response my uncle took my grandfather's car and sold it.

This was a big issue because it was during this time I was trying to get my license. This is in itself a whole separate can of worms because my mom would always berate me for not having a license but at the same time never letting me get in practice. I failed three times and every time it became more and more discouraging because she would bring up my failures to her friends and others. It was a vicious cycle that I still haven't fully left. At least by having his car I could at least try to (illegally) drive in town. In conjunction with berating me for not having a license, she did the same about me not having a job. She would always tell me of the looming moment when I need to get a job after college. This was a big issue because there was no way I could move because I had no money, and I would have no money because I didn't have a job. Because of how little my town was, and with no ability to acquire a license, and with no means of purchasing a car, I was really stuck. I started to really resent my mom at this point, growing more aware of her abuse to me as a child. 

After my grandfather died I went back to school the following fall. When it came to do taxes, my mom got very aggressive about getting money. While this was a thing that happened while my grandfather alive, my mom would be relentless about getting the American Opportunity Tax Credit. This is a refundable tax credit up to $2500 to help alleviate the costs of college. My mom however never paid a single cent into my books, fees, tuition, or housing. After my grandfather died I had to take out more money in loans (and with the help of the school administration, I got more grants too). But I still had to pay for school and without my grandfather I took on that responsibility. After he died I tried asking my mom if I could have it to start paying back loans. She started telling me about how that detrimentally affected her and her ability to pay bills. She saw this as a threat and said if I did she would take me off every insurance and deactivate my phone. During my last year I managed to compromise with her to give me $300, which she saw as her ability to support me and kept this over my head. 

During this time I also met someone online who I got close to. She was also trans. We met in the summer of 2014 and had a great time. She flew up from Virginia and we spent time together. She became acutely aware of the shitty living situation I was at in my mom's house but saw past that. To me, who never had a partner before, I felt like I was rescued in some way, and that eventually I would find a way out. Before we left we agreed that I would visit her in Virginia. This plan would eventually change though because as I went back to school that Fall, I was planning for what classes I would take. I still needed to finish my gen eds and could do so online. I asked her what she thought to the idea that I would be there for my spring semester and summer, all the while doing those classes online. Although we started having some arguments relating to politics (I'm personally more right leaning than she is) things were relatively okay. We had reconciliation at the end and moved on like adults. This idea of me moving up would transform more: we thought it would also be a great idea to bring some mutual friends from Canada to Virginia for christmas. They arrived in Virginia a day before I did. When I flew to Virginia, I told her that I would call her to keep her updated with where I was, as this was my first time flying by myself. One major flag occured during my flight where she completely failed to pick up her phone. I asked one of the friends we brought up what was going on, and I was told that at the time my ex was showering with the other one. Understandably their flight up had some sexual undertones but it still bothered me she failed to be at the phone. When I got there though things got really worse. The night I was there we acted out a BDSM scene and it was a really passionate one, but when it ended I didn't get aftercare and was put aside on the inflatable bed. It didn't hit me at first because I was still a little glowly from the pain, but I saw my her and our friend getting very sexual and it hit me that I was just cast aside and I had a breakdown. I had just got beaten and left there. I got my hands on a box cutter and I went to the bathroom and started cutting. It was the very first time I started cutting. They didn't notice after a couple hours and I went back in, completely drunk off the constant stinging pain of cutting and feeling thrown aside. My girlfriend became more aware and we had our friends leave the room. We broke up that night, but what struck me was not that we broke up, but the things she said. She said that she stopped loving me a long time ago and had interests in our mutual friends. I was completely bewildered because she never once mentioned her reservations or change of feelings while I was school and we were planning. It completely turned my life upside down. We were confused as to what to do and she didn't want to send me to my mom's house as she knew it would be bad (and it was). She offered to let me stay at her place for awhile, and I did. It's not like I wanted to be but I still knew the issues of being at my mom's. During this time I still kept cutting and it got to the point to where she said she couldn't handle that and if I kept doing it she would kick me out. I didn't really have anyone I could talk to because I could not face my close friends with the fact of what she did. I eventually did move out in early March back to my mom's house. 

Back at my mom's house things were really bad. Prior to my grandfather's death she never smoked weed around me, but this completely changed. From March to August I was stuck every day having to smell weed. The issues I mentioned before with my mom harping on me about not having a job or license was not limited to the weekends I was away from school, but a constant thing, all while wrestling with an urge not to cut. My mom caught me one day doing it called me mentally ill. From that moment she used it as ammo for me needing help but never helping me. I still stuck to school and in some bizarre twist of hope doing school work BECAME my sanctuary from my own feelings or world from me. I would walk early in the morning to the closest cafe for three hours to work on stuff and stay there all day. The workers there liked me as I became a frequent customer (using what little money I had left in savings and returns from my school funds not going to housing or food there) and they let me work there. I never told them my issues but I'm sure from being there, knowing how far I was, that there were underlying issues with my home life. I still avoided talking to my friends at college from shame which I believe isolated me more to school work. I felt that the only escape was stop thinking of my life and wait until I could leave. I was entering my last year of school and that I was going to work really hard. I had met someone else during this time and we got along really well. I still expressed interests in kink but I felt really limited in that. I regret this as I felt like it was really rushed and it only served as more diassociative ammo from thinking about my life at home. But my interests in kink were limited from the scars of my past ex and depression, even while at school. I moved out from my mom's house and having to deal with all her bullshit that I've mentioned again and again. From my time in school I tried to find a way to get a job. I never let my undergrad advisor in on a lot, but he recommended to me I try to apply to the same university for their graduate program. I would be offered an assistantship and stuff would be paid. I had okay enough grades and with taking calc 1 and the GREs I would have a solid chance at getting in. I thankfully did. I also found an internship from the same advisor and had that to do during the summer. My new girlfriend and I also moved into an apartment after I graduated to a place near school. She had a lot more money than I did which helped a lot. We didn't celebreate my graduation nor did I walk. My mom never bothered to ask. During this time is also when I went NC. A couple months later however we broke up. We both had our own issues and which I want to limit discussion on as I feel that her issues should not be brought up barring that it caused conflict between my own. 

I've finally had the chance to see a counselor since March of this year and she sadly stopped working at my school since June, but having her has been awesome support. Today I am with a new boyfriend of three months and he has been the first to be so affectionate and actively aware of my issues. I've never had someone that I've cared so much barring my grandfather because of this. Also as of now, my mom has been trying to contact me through email (she has in the past only to ask about when im paying bills, no word of how I am etc). She cut me off of her insurance and phone out of the blue last november which caused a lot of issues for school, but I've luckily had money to fix that and with the support of my school's administration. Although her talking to me causes so much issues, I feel like I am starting to recover. Her email has triggered me slightly, remembering the bad things that have happened. I feel like I just want to send her an email saying we are no more, but it reminds me of like when I did with my grandfather and I truly doubt the severity of the stuff she did. It may sound asinine because I wrote it here but I don't know how to come to terms with the issues of my past and her trying to get in touch. 

I'm sorry for the long post and if anyone actually read it, I am really appreciative you did. Only my boyfriend really knows what happened to me so posting this online feels like a massive burden has been lifted. It may take me awhile to respond because writing this has made me need to take a quick break."

_Since the 1990s, numerous Islamist groups have emerged in Algeria, but over the years their allegiances and identities have shifted according to geopolitical trends. The Islamic State is the latest group to gain a presence in the country, but it has faced a pushback as the Algerian authorities are no strangers to counterterrorism._
On June 1st, south of the capital Algiers, gunmen attacked a gendarmerie wounding four policemen. It was reported that the [attack](http://ift.tt/2fvEPHm) was orchestrated by individuals acting on behalf of the Islamic State. It was just the latest in a string of incidents which have occurred in Algeria this year. Other high profile attacks claimed by the group include a thwarted suicide attack by two men in the city of Constantine in [April](http://ift.tt/2pSYSzJ), and two months before this a jihadist tried to enter a police station in the centre of the city. On this occasion, a police man on duty succeeded to disarm the bomber’s suicide device by firing on it and the perpetrator was shot.

Algeria: A hotspot for radical Islamist groupsAccording to a [2015](http://ift.tt/2k6eLTd) report by the US Department of State, some of the most active Islamist groups operating within Algeria include: Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); the Mali-based organisation Movement for United and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO); al-Murabitoun, which was responsible for the 2013 attack on the In Amenas gas facility in southern Algeria and Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), which has declared its allegiance ISIS. However, it is estimated that there are many small groups scattered across Algeria´s southern and eastern borders, which each to varying degrees have declared their loyalty to ISIS.

In light of the Islamic State defeats in Iraq and Syria, many foreign fighters are seeking to return home. Unlike in Tunisia or Morocco, where hundreds of young men have been drawn to the fighting, Algerians have proven less susceptible. In fact less than [200](http://ift.tt/2neDyaA) are said to have travelled to the region to fight under Islamic State´s banner. In Algeria, those who have chosen to align themselves with ISIS have often spent years in the field fighting. The group’s operations faced a setback [last year](http://ift.tt/28ZFFbL) after 332 people were arrested across the country for belonging to recruitment and support networks. Nevertheless dampening the desire for young Algerian men to take up radical causes can be difficult given the high rate of unemployment and social inequity that has beset the country for decades. One [commentator](http://ift.tt/2hP1nUu) has noted that Algeria’s only hope going forward is that there is a surge in the price of oil. Currently, the government is required to pay [$30 billion](http://ift.tt/2t5inJD) USD in subsidies which cover everything from food to education.

Algerian counter-terrorist experienceHowever many contend that what is helping to undermine the threat of the Islamic State is that many Algerians carry the memory of the brutal civil war of the 1990s in which an estimated 200,000 people died. The might of the security force also plays a significant role, as the Algerian [military](http://ift.tt/2hP1oI2) consists of over half a million active service members and a national [police](http://ift.tt/2tgjLa6) force of 210,000. They have learnt to cope with the ‘residual’ terrorism that has continued despite efforts in the early 2000s to grant amnesty to Islamist fighters. The country´s Ministry of National Defense denies publicity to militants by purposely refusing to list group affiliations in communiques regarding arms seizures or anti-terror operations. More broadly, the Algerian government is working to support [young Algerians](http://ift.tt/2ue5R9B) by providing tuition, job placements and paid internships, which is part of a deradicalization program.

While the government continues to address the threat internally, the challenge for the Algerian security forces is controlling the country’s porous 4000 mile border and the mountainous terrain in the north east, which has proven ideal since the early 1990s for Islamist guerrillas. To counter this, Algeria actively participates in the [US-backed](http://ift.tt/2fwd69H) Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP), which aims to strengthen counterterrorism capabilities among states in the Maghreb and the Pan Sahel region. While such programs are certainly designed to assess the changing nature of the threat across North Africa, for the government of Algeria, what remains certain for the foreseeable future is whether Algerian mujahideen choose to fight under the banner of the Islamic State or Al-Qaeda, the tactics and strategies they adopt remain the same.

I’m currently looking for a CFY position in a SNF but have come up with a lot of questions throughout the process. I would love to get your feedback!

1) I did my internship at an acute care rehab hospital, but I’ve been told working in a SNF is very different. How so? Can you walk me through a typical day?

2) Have you noticed a difference in quality of care, work environment, stress levels in SNFs that are non-profit vs. for-profit vs. county-owned?

3) Many of the recruiters have told me that I would be the only SLP on-site and that the supervising SLP would be in a different building. As much as I would prefer an on-site super or at least another SLP to bounce ideas off of, I get the feeling that this is the norm. What was your experience like being the only SLP in the building as a CF?

4) What would you consider a red flag in terms of accepting a position at a SNF? What about a positive sign?

5) One of the students in the cohort recommended using star ratings on the Medicare site or Healthgrove to weed out bad SNFs. Anyone else do this and find that a poorly rated SNF was actually quite nice in person or vice versa?

Thanks for your help!"

These guys are hard core revolutionaries who brought down Milosevic and then made it their day-job to setup and create revolutions around the world. They are behind a number of ""color revolutions"" and have heavy ties to the U.S. intelligence community. They are at the forefront of a lot of revolutionary activity today, including Venezuela.*](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/17/1738540_re-fwd-canvas-comes-to-stratfor-.html)


The above is an excerpt of an internal email from Stratfor in the Wikileaks files. For those who don’t know anything about CANVAS or Stratfor, [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5momop/important_introduction_to_george_soros_group/) and [Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5z3654/breaking_news_overlooked_wikileaks_email/) explain it in greater detail. In a nutshell, CANVAS began as a student protest group in Serbia called “Otpor.” They relied on US assistance and succeeded in overthrowing the Serb president in 2000. Since then, Otpor changed its name to CANVAS (The Center for Applied NonViolent Action and Strategies) &amp; worked with the US &amp; Soros to overthrow [a litany of countries](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5462012_otpor-.html) that the Deep State [doesn’t like](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/17/1713359_re-insight-venezuela-canvas-analysis-.html).


So what has CANVAS been up to? I wrote about Otpor’s involvement in [the US Purple Revolution in 2005](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5z3654/breaking_news_overlooked_wikileaks_email/). I also warned about the Democrats [copying CANVAS’ tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5momop/important_introduction_to_george_soros_group/) in the wake of Trump’s victory. That was their short-term plan. Their long-term plan is much more dangerous. After 2005, CANVAS started [working with universities](https://archive.is/a6MX7) to allow them to hold guest lectures, teach courses and offer internship programs. The [co-instructors](https://exed.hks.harvard.edu/app/lnm.pdf) are the leaders of CANVAS themselves. CANVAS is currently in partnership with 32 universities – most of them in the US. Remember that CANVAS started out as a student protest group. The color revolutions specifically rely on student involvement to succeed, as seen in the [Rose Revolution](http://www18.georgetown.edu/data/people/cdw33/publication-32608.pdf) and the [Orange Revolution](https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1209/p01s04-woeu.html). Knowing this, it’s very dangerous for CANVAS to be in American universities “teaching” and establishing networks and alliances. 


Their plan is slowly being implemented. They understand that their revolution will not work unless they have widespread support of America’s students. It should be no surprise then that the UAE has classified CANVAS as a [terrorist organization](https://archive.is/th3rH). CANVAS’ actions have been criticized by [progressives](https://archive.fo/PbU6T) and conservatives alike. We should follow the UAE’s example and do likewise.


It’s time to smash the so-called resistance. Cutting off Otpor means cutting off the Deep State’s ability to mobilize their footsoldiers in the streets. We need to meme Otpor out of existence.

This was my first internship following freshman year and I was unbelievably horny, all the time. His name was Steven, 23 years old, and British. 

My first day on the job consisted of just walking around with my supervisor and saying hello to everyone. I first met Steven in the cafeteria at lunch time and gave him a fairly enthusiastic hello. In my head, I also told him that I was going to get him in bed sooner rather than later. I could tell he was into me as well. That afternoon, he pulled up a chair to my desk and asked me out to dinner. I told him that I was still trying to acclimate to the area and told him to ask again next week.

He found me on Tinder the next day and we both had a laugh about it. We matched and he took me out to dinner on Wednesday. We talked, connected, went to a bar where he kept buying me drink after drink. Finally he told me he had some whiskey at home and asked if I wanted to come and try some. I knew what he was up to but played innocent. By the time we got to his place, the alcohol was really hitting me. I collapsed on his couch and just closed my eyes until I felt his lips on mine.

We started making out and he asked me upstairs and we continued on his bed. I remember he turned the fan on because it was getting extremely hot as our bodies fronded and our hands roamed all over each other. He took off his clothes then took off my top, taking my nipple into his mouth. It felt so good with him. My body never felt that good when someone sucked on my breast but that man was good. He snuck his hand into my pants and started playing with me over my panties, feeling me get wetter and wetter. 

While his hands were doing some exploring, I gently touched his cock. It was huge, the biggest I've had at that point. I grinned to myself, thinking that I had struck gold and started giving him a handjob. He eventually pulled my pants off and straddled my chest so I could jerk him off better. I played with him and fondled his balls until he came (he suggested I use my mouth but I laughed and told him that would cross the coworker line). He finger fucked me while kissing my neck (which absolutely makes me scream) until I finished, then started playing with my asshole. That was the first time I had had anything in my asshole, and it felt amazing even if it was just his hand.

I woke up around 5am and swore at myself, mostly because we had work in two hours. It was a bit awkward the next day and I made a mental note to never fool around with a coworker again. That was a promise I kept to myself until my next job three months later haha."

Things are as good as I could ask for and it just hits me out of nowhere. A few months ago, I had a very intimate relationship with a girl that I go to college with. We both knew that summer was about to come which raised a lot of questions about the nature of our relationship... We'd be living a good hour drive away from another, but I have an internship taking up 40 hours a week and another job on the weekends and some nights. In other words, the relationship was something I knew I couldn't maintain with that work schedule so I told her that I'd prefer to wait until the beginning of next year to figure things out. She didn't like this, but she accepted it and we've seen each other a few times throughout this summer. I really did care about her, she's all I could ever ask for. Then one day, I cut myself off from her (going on about 4 weeks now). I can't honestly explain why I did that. Maybe it was her frustration when I told her I was out doing other things with other people (not like dating anyone else, just hanging out with other friends occasionally)... I guess that's it.. I just had enough and quit. Although she hasn't been on my mind much these past few weeks, they have been some of the hardest as far as my depression is concerned -- there have been days where I lose all sight of myself in the future, almost as if the future will pass without me in it. I really don't know what to make of it and I don't know what to do about it. Worse yet, she came back into my thoughts yesterday and I can't get over what I did to her. I've tried talking to her, but she doesn't seem to want to talk and I think I really fucked this one up. Me doing this to intimate partners isn't really a new thing, I hate to say... I wish I knew what my own motives were behind all this. I'm just really lost in myself right now and don't know what to do."

What was your initial idea for making UCI Esports happen?**



&gt;We get this question a lot. People are very interested to know what forces created the program. The idea of the program came out of a business school project I was working on in the summer of 2015. I had been at UCI for 5 years at that time, working at student government working on events and programs. In business school, I was thinking about where to go next for my career. As I was doing a report on a video game company and studying the industry I was shocked to see how big video games and esports had become. It was very surprising that this massive phenomena was largely being ignored on college campuses. So while I was doing research for that paper, I stumbled upon a Facebook article that showed the UCI was ranked the #1 school for gamers in North America. The article talked about our massive gaming club, our club League of Legends team that won back to back national titles for UCI. Another school that was on that list, Robert Morris had just started offering scholarships. I just saw the opportunity where other schools had broken the ice, proven the concept that it was possible to do. I thought we had a more compelling case. That was the genesis, reached out to the club and its members, brought student government leaders early into the conversations. Eventually we took the idea to some administration colleagues who might be able to elevate the conversation a little bit. It just kinda kept snowballing from there. Eventually we ended up taking a group of student to our Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs during his office hours. Kinda got permission to start exploring sponsorship and finding space for a program. He was very surprised how big and strong our gaming community was and how important it was to gamers. That was the very early genesis of it. When you find sponsorships you find partnerships. You recruit players and build the arena. That's kinda how it started.   

---


**What's a way that you could suggest for others to bring the conversation to administrators?**

&gt;It's a lot of educating. If you look hard, you'll find a lot of really compelling reasons why videogames are relevant, why they matter and why they're a good thing for young people to do. We already had dozens of faculty teaching, researching video games and learning related subjects. I was pleasantly surprised by how open-minded administrators were at UCI and how much research was already being done that was already justifying and defending how video games are important. Very rarely did we come up against someone who was really opposed to it. Even when we did, we just a little bit of education and showing the research by UCI faculty kinda helped changed their opinions.

**We're famously known for our 4 pillars. Could you describe the 4 pillars and their significance to the program?**

&gt;We got very lucky early on to kind of create a strong vision for our program. And it's really helped us communicate what we're doing and why we're doing it. The four things we focus on are Competition, Academics and Research, Community, and Entertainment. When we compete, competition is one of the ways that makes esports really resonate with a lot of people, it’s kind of the buzz and the hype and the sizzle to the program. We offer scholarships for both league of legends and overwatch players this year. We also support our club teams with free training time in the arena and competition time as well. We’re very interested in competing against the best college teams on the planet. On the academics/research side we want to partner our faculty with our students to do research and cover some of the mysteries around learning with games and think of how it can shape and evolve education into the future. On the community side, we just want to support our massive successful gaming community at large. Talking some of the social issues, expanding games, and esports to a broader audience of people that may not be reflected a lot in esports currently. Just supporting and engaging with this massive group of young folks or students. On the entertainment side we want do this, we want to stream, create content and do events in the arena. We want to approach esports broadly, and i think that’s one of the reasons why people really get excited about the program. We’re not just putting students in front of a computer and saying “play for 12 hours”, we’re approaching esports really broadly.

---


**Who do you think is the main audience/people to talk to when we’re looking for commentary on the arena or the program itself. Who should we be listening to for the most part, or who should new programs be listening to?**

&gt;I try to listen to everybody. We have good ears and I think everybody’s comments are things we should listen to. We’re really trying to pay very close attention to the gaming community and understand the influencers of games in esports are saying and thinking. Esports is often referred to and talked a lot about as a grassroots phenomenon, we totally want to acknowledge and appreciate that and work alongside our community. They’re very important stakeholders at UCI. Faculty and administrators are obviously very important stakeholders and have a lot of control and influence on where we go as a program. Keeping them happy. Our program tries to listen to everybody. I have one on ones every quarter with each of our players. While we’re not quite a democracy here we do allow everyone to try to influence and help us learn and grow as we move forward.

**What would say the most common resources that everyone should be able to access, like the basic things for starting an esports program. What are the hardest resources to acquire when creating something like this?**

&gt;Everyone on college campuses understands that finding money on campus is really tough and finding space or a good location is hard. Those are really scarce resources so for administrators those are gonna be the first things they think of when you come up with a crazy idea like an esports program. We always pitch this program and this idea as a cost neutral program, come up with all the financial resources for it and I’m very happy to say we were able to do that. Second is finding space, that was another thing that we didn’t ask our administrators for help with that. We took it upon ourselves to work with our student center board and the student led committee to see if that was something they would be interested in. At many points along the way, had we not gotten the right response, the program probably would’ve fallen apart and wouldn’t have happened. We have very forward thinking folks.

---


**What were some of the steps that you took to proactively go forward, knowing that those resources would be hard to find?**

&gt;They definitely go hand in hand. We have a beautiful 3500 sq ft arena, and it was the only real space on campus that we thought we could get a hold of. It was a billiard room that had some xboxes, so kind of a recreational facility. We weren’t really changing the purpose of it, and for a lot of folks around the university thought it was underutilized so it was a space that was right for renovation. We approached the student center board, it took multiple meetings and pitches, several months to convince them. It wasn’t one of those things we walked into a room and walked out with the answer we wanted. It was a process for sure. We made sure they didn’t feel like we were exploiting or taking advantage of them. We were thinking about student experiences holistically, we were concerned about what happened if someone played video games for 12 hours in the arena, how we were gonna deal with the pool tables, how we would satisfy the pool community. These were things we were all interested in and things you have to have answers for. Once we had the space, we knew that this could also be a revenue generator. That was kind of the vision, to build a PC cafe that would help offset some of our costs. Pay for rent, utilities, student staffing costs. We kinda weaved the whole program together and our business plan continually changed and was tweaked based on the approvals we got.

**jeffrey asks: how did you come up with your son's name**

&gt;My son’s name is Jace, J A C E. My wife actually came up with the name, and she is a physician and had a cute little male patient, his name was JASE, J A S E, and she brought up the name Jayce concept to me. I’m a magic the gathering fan, and very familiar with that character Jayce in that context. And so, I was quick to say “if we could spell it J A C E” i was gonna buy into it. She proposed the name, I tweaked the spelling, so that was that. It was pretty easy conversation.

---

**Which overwatch/league character would you hang out with?**

&gt;Good question. I haven’t played a lot of league of legends, so I only know a few champions that I’m comfortable. I like Jhin’s personality. He’s a little bit of a diva, theatrical person, very expressive. I think he’s really fun in game. I like his style and the lines he has in the game. For overwatch, probably Lucio. I feel like he’s got good style, good music, and he’s in every single game, so he could either heal me or speed me up.

**thesmithsoniann: @uciesports Do you believe that only team based games can thrive in collegiate esports?**

&gt;Great to hear from you, we’re huge fans here of the thesmithsonian. I don’t know, I don’t think it needs to be all team based games, I like team based games personally but I could see fighting games doing well. We have a very good smash team, and I know thesmithsonian is a well-known street fighter player, and so I could definitely see some single player games. The criteria I always talk about always involve having some sort of competitive ladder in the game so you can kinda identify talent, the game’s gotta be popular both at UCI and broadly so that there’s interest out there. There’s gotta be a good college league for us to play in. So if the FG community comes up with a great college tournament or league that would be great. The developers kind of have to develop the games with tools in it that make it competitive, and a lot of fighting games are that way. 


---


**What do you think would have to be added to fighting games, what kind of league would you want to see for fighting games where people could thrive in a collegiate scene?**

&gt;I like the Swiss format when you look at tournaments or matches. I think it’s great to have as many people able to play, and the Swiss format kinda helps separate the good teams really quickly from the lesser teams. Eventually you end up with the best players competing against the best players, in a pretty balanced way. The Swiss format allows a really huge base to start, and helps whittle it down to the top talent. I’d like to see more of that in the FGC.


---


**Bladexer: @UCIeSports Hi Mark, are you planning on expanding the space anytime soon? Or opening up another arena on campus?**

&gt;Great question. The space we have is really great, and I think it has worked really well for the almost-year that we’ve been open. I definitely wanna increase resources for the program, increase space for facilities. It’s hard to imagine growing with staff without adding more square footage so, we are exploring options to make more space on campus, but as I mentioned earlier, space is the hardest to find resource. But I think we’ve got a good tentative plan in place that we’ll hopefully have some more firm information in the coming months.


---


**If we were to open another space, would you focus on another PC Cafe? Or a different vision?**

&gt;I really like the recreational aspect here, it’s got a great location on the student center terrace. A lot of easy access for the general public to just walk in and find their way here. This place is ideally suited for recreational stuff. I’d like to find some more facilities that provide more office space for staff, conference room space. We don’t really have a meeting room, we have a tiny conference table that’s really a lunch table and student staff hangout spot. A nicer training facility would be really great for our players. Our little stage area is for them, but often times when we’re competing it could be loud in here, or very distracting. Having a little bit more space where they could spread out and have some more elbow room and mousepad space, and a quieter space as well, are some of the things I envision. Growing deeper into the production and video side would also be another thing to think about.


---


**dom_nom_nom: @UCIeSports What's your end goal for UCI Esports? In 15 years, what do you envision the program to look like?**

&gt;I have very ambitious goals and I guess I talk a lot about us trying to be the Duke Basketball of esports, so if you think about it Duke Basketball has the best coaches, facilities, players, and currently the evil/bad guys that everyone is kind of trying to chase and knock down. That’s where I want to be in 15 years, with a lot more resources with the program. Some academic counselors affiliated with us to help guide our students, we need more teams competing in more games, plenty of coaching, resources, and analysts, and team managers. More physical space to be doing this stuff in. I really think that this can mirror what traditional athletic programs look like, and so we want to stay a few steps ahead of everybody in terms of resources, space, talent. There’s a lot of other schools doing this right now, but we want to continue to press our advantage, or grow as quickly and smartly as we can to be positioned well to be the best school in 15 years.


---


**JJKplays: @uciesports Hey guys. Would you have any advice for a streamer that lives near UCI and is interested in helping to create content for UCI eSports?**

&gt;What’s up, great question! One of my big priorities this coming year is to create way more content, and so we’re really fortunate to have Damian, Jess, Paul and a few other staff members that were really interested in streaming and other content creation. But I’d say come in the arena and meet with us, I want to have every one of our league of legends/OW matches shoutcast this year. That takes people, resources, people in front and behind of the camera, so we need more people to do it. I think we can find money to pay people so if you’re interested, and you’ve got some skills, come on over and talk to us. Talk to Damian.


---


**follow up from dom_nom_nom: Also, do you see collegiate esports being integrated into the NCAA?**

&gt;Great question, a lot of people  ask about this. I think right now the future of esports is really going to be controlled by individual game developers and how they want their games to be rolled out and competed in. My sense right now is, is the best leagues and the best events and tournaments are being put on by developers. I think the NCAA is going to have a tough time weaving in esports into what they’re currently doing. I have a lot of respect for them, and they’ve been around for a long time, and have turned college sports into what they are. But I think esports could be tough, esports moves very quickly. Given that OW came out a year ago, and we’re offering scholarships already, I think it’s going to be hard for big organizations to jump in esports that quickly. Also, when a game kind of falls out of style or popularity, it’s going to be hard to wrap it up and quickly change direction. The intellectual property, given that it’s owned by game companies is another factor. How would third party tournament organizers continually change people who they’re working with, and create long term agreements when things just move really quickly. It’s going to be a real challenge for them.


---


**Lihengz: hey mark, which video game that is not in the scholarship program do you think will have the highest potential to enter the scholarship program next?**

&gt;I would say look at UCI and the arena and see what games are played the most. Hearthstone is really popular on campus. Tespa does a great job doing hearthstone stuff, I could see that being a game we offer. We’re looks at HOTS, another Blizzard title UCI’s good at. Heroes of the Dorm is a massive competition, and it’s hard to ignore an event that big and special. To throw another one out there, PUBG is a new hit, and a lot of people are playing it at the arena. So we want to play something that’s popular, see leagues develop especially for PUBG. If all those check-boxes are met, and we find the resources, I think it’d be good to add more scholarships next year.


---

**thesmithsoniann: @uciesports Do you feel like UCI Esports has a responsibility to set the direction of collegiate esports in general?**

&gt;Absolutely. There’s a lot of people out there in college esports. Everyone has different opinions but one of the things we really want to set the direction on is how we welcome other people and demonstrate how we can make esports more available and inclusive to people. So we’re very actively trying to do that, we have a code of conduct on our wall. We want to treat people respectfully, we don’t tolerate harassment or toxicity in our program. That’s one direction we want to be very involved with. If no one else is talking about it then we want to talk about it very actively. We want to create opportunities for people, women and underrepresented communities. We want to make this a safe and welcoming environment. In 15 years, we want to see more people involved.


---


**What do you think of ""esports specialists"", and what do you think the potential is for UCI Esports players and the role that they would play?**

&gt;A lot of people are interested in video games right now, a lot of money in the business of it. We are allowing some of our student players, interns, people affiliated with our program to service as specialists to other companies and their developers to play-test their games, or hopefully doing some coaching and teaching people about the industry. I think the people that are in esports in a very deep way have an understanding and a set of special skills that could be offered to a lot of people. We do have some esports specialists, you’re one of them, that we loan out to people. I think we want to be a place that prepares people for careers in esports, and deliver services to the esports world.

---


**What do you think of an esports major or something like that? How would that fit into collegiate education?**

&gt;I think a major is a lot to ask. I’ve had some conversations with faculty about it, and I think a minor is much more likely and easier to do. It takes less collaboration between a lot of important people on campus. I think we’re gonna have a minor in the coming 3-5 years. We’re also going to have a certificate with our continuing education program. There will defnitely be classes about it, and some schools are starting to offer majors and minors in esports. I’m hoping that you and Jess consider doing that streaming course to teach people how to stream, that would be a really cool class for us to offer. I definitely think it will be woven into the fabric of higher education.

**mattakhavan: Esports on TV or Online as far as viewership? Turner is doing CS:GO on TV on their network and BAMTECH (Disney recently invested in BAMtech) is taking the streaming rights for the NA LCS. Do you think both TV and online can work or will one take over completely?**

&gt;I think TV is turning into online to be very honest. I think the idea of television as this box in your house that beams content from another place to your wall, I think it’s the same as online viewing. We stream just as much as we watch TV. I think whether you watch on a TV, computer or monitor, tablet or phone, I think streaming’s going to be the future and that traditional cable television will have things go away from that direction just because that’s not technology anymore. Our phones, tablets just do the exact same thing with unlimited access to unlimited content out there. That’s what I personally view things will go.


---


**Lihengz: @UCIeSports do you guys think any time in the future that UCI Esports will be hosting medium to large-scale tournaments with large money prizing, like CSL tournaments?**

&gt;I was hoping to do some of that stuff sooner rather than later. We have a great venue, the bren events center, and I could see several thousand people in there. We have our ballrooms downstairs that could seat up to a thousand people. I think the arena isn’t bigger enough for that, but UCI is a great venue. I would love to see big tournaments, we’d welcome TESPA, CSL, or uLOL or any of those folks coming onto campus and working with us.

**BiGGBoBBy: how to sell Esports to your University to get funding**

&gt;It’s a process for sure. You have to educate people at your university and make sure they understand the value, how big games and esports are. How many students at your school are interested. Fundraising is a whole skill and career path in and of itself, so selling a program could be a whole different skillset to finding the money for it. We were very fortunate in that our crazy vision of creating this really successful esports program resonated with some of our sponsors. We gotta give a huge shoutout to folks at iBUYPOWER, Oomba, Logitech, Vertagear who really brought our vision and were willing to buy in significantly with both cash or products. You have to create value for your university and show why an esports program is valuable, and you also have to create value for your sponsors and show them why it’s valuable to them.


---


**What do you think is a good way to start conversations with sponsors? How do you put your foot in the door, and take that next step with a sponsor and getting them to fund your program?**

&gt;I think it’s showing a strong case so that there’s demand for it. We did a survey early on in our program where we surveyed our undergraduate students, we got 1300 responses and 72% said they identified as a gamer, and 89% said they would support an esports program. It’s a very long process, it took us a year and 3 months from idea to opening the arena so it’s no one-pitch meeting. It’s multiple pitch meetings, I’ve probably pitched this program over 100 times to people either over coffee, at lunch, in sponsor meetings. A lot of people said no, but we ended up getting enough yeses in the right people to make it happen. If I could offer one piece of advice, one of my favorite quotes is to “Never take no from someone who doesn’t have the ability to say yes”. So find the people on your campus who could be potential yes people, who have the resources, connections, and horsepower to push a program through like this and endorse it and champion it. Identify those people and start with them.

**yodasan29: What specific steps do I need to take to get my Alma mater to establish a program similar to UCI's?**

&gt;It’s the stuff we’ve been talking about, showcase for it. Answer the questions and be prepared to solve the problems with your administrators when they bring them up. Where’s the money, where’s the resources, who’s gonna do it? Answer those questions before you walk in.


---


**thesmithsoniann: @uciesports Sorry for me asking a lot of questions! But I have one more! What type of roles do you wish your scholarship players will take on? Other than the role of a ""pro gamer""**

&gt;I want them to be great ambassadors and content creators. Those are things I’d like to see them do. We want them to show UCI in a great light, we want them to help us generate value for the university, value for our sponsors by putting content out there.

---


**What are the kind of roles currently on a collegiate scholarship team? Past just the players, what else is there?**

&gt;Other roles include coaches, analysts, streamers, casters, all that good stuff. We want to be involved with all aspects of the team. Being a part of the content team, events, programs, those are things we’re trying to get folks to help with. It’d be great to rely on UCI talent and students to do that. Also research, we fund research with our UROP program.

---


**Who's your favorite intern?**

&gt;My favorite intern? Uh… I don’t know if I have a favorite. Right now… You want me to name one? Just one intern? How about top 4? No Justin, just kidding. We love you Justin. I’m super impressed with all our interns. We got Hillary out on the east coast representing us well, doing a ton of work out there. We got Jenny, president of TAG. We got Jess, who says yes to every project and kills it. And that’s it. And we obviously have you, Damian, who always says yes to everything.


---


**Hillabeans: @uciesports What's your favorite experience so far with the program? And what are you looking forward to most this coming year?**

&gt;It’s been a really fun couple of years working on this. We had a recent event with Amazon Games at their studios where our team, the 4 Pillars got to play. We got to meet Rick Fox, and you all got to represent Echofox for a minute. We got the band out, peter the anteater, the cheerleaders. That was a really fun day, and it just kind of felt like all esports coming together. That was a really big highlight, and there’s been a ton of highlights."
6sylf5,1,2017-08-10,Why Entrepreneurs Should Consider Working in a Co-Working Space,Al233,lifestyleentrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifestyleentrepreneur/comments/6sylf5/why_entrepreneurs_should_consider_working_in_a/,"Being an entrepreneur is a not an easy job. It demands extra-long work hours at work and sometimes even work on weekends. Entrepreneurs rarely get free time to spend with their families. Besides the huge costs they have to bear to start a business, they must also bear full responsibility for all decisions taken. Managing core functions tends to become difficult and co-working has developed as a response to this. More and more startups and established companies are shifting to co-working spaces. Co-working offers many tactical and financial benefits for entrepreneurs.

Affordability
The best part about choosing to work in a co-working space is that it is cost-effective. While rents are not cheap, you will most definitely get something that suits your pocket. Instead of a long-term lease for your office, this is a workable solution which is appealing especially to newcomers.

Flexibility
Another significant advantage of co-working for start-ups is that you can add more space as and when you need to. Co-working space is flexible and meant to accommodate growth. In case you want to make your business grow in a new location, you can simply rent a portion in a co-working space. You do not have to shell out a fortune for a new building for your new office. Co-working is useful because when you feel the need to cut down on your staff, you can always give up the extra space. In comparison, in a regular office, you will never be able to get your rent reduced if your team is downsized. A co-working space allows you to lessen the resources when your needs decline.

Support Services
When you choose to rent a co-working space, you will get many resources which you did not know about. These workplaces are cognizant of the services which businesses require from time to time for growth. Sometimes the company itself can be of direct assistance. At other times, any of your neighbors can advise you correctly on different operational problems.

Networking Benefits
The ecosystem of businesses and people is varied and for every business which is starting off, there will be professionals from other backgrounds to help out. You will be surprised at the help and collaboration you can get from various professionals.

Moral Support
Every established business has gone through its ups and downs. Startups are bound to experience their own challenges and roadblocks. It is natural to start having doubts about your own credibility. You are likely to get frustrated when you fail to get results even after tireless work. It is in such situations that you can greatly benefit from a co-working space. You will invariably be surrounded by other entrepreneurs who have similar experiences to share with you.

Their relentless hard work and commitment will motivate you to keep faith. When you notice people around you overcoming hurdles that you are facing, you can draw from their support and strength. As a student, i you are looking to opt out from your university placements or screwed up your internships and looking to start something of your own then it is very important to sit with people of your temprament who can not only be your moral support, but also teach/ guide you. So, the time you spend in a co-working space actually serves like a crash course in entrepreneurship.

Better productivity
With co-working, you can actually increase your work productivity. Interactions are likely to be much more in this environment compared to a regular office environment. This offers greater scope for sharing news and information. Networking is more and you can find prospective customers and vendors through such an ecosystem. Politics common to stand-alone offices are not likely to happen in a co-working space. Here, every member stands to benefit from his co-worker.

Better Collaboration:
Co-working means better collaboration and cooperation. There is no feeling of isolation which is common in a regular office. If you are a student and trying to be an entrepreneur in your university, then you might face a lot of loneliness apart from the homely things you would be missing if you are studying abroad.  In co-working spaces, you can be motivated by working with people sharing common ideas and work ethics. The way they are handling challenges can also inspire you to do the same.

Cost–Saving
When you choose a co-working space for your business, you do not have to worry about long-term leases. There is no need to buy equipment and office furnishings. Co-working spaces are equipped with the necessary networking and IT infrastructural amenities. You can even benefit from features like firewalls for security, servers for storage, Wi-Fi access for connectivity etc. These can translate into huge savings. There is no need for down payments and zero lock-in periods.

Sharing Resources
When you can share resources with others, you can save costs. Saving operational costs helps your business to succeed. Co-working is based on the same principle; it is like living in a house as a paying-guest. Resources are collectively used by many people and this explains why all necessary amenities can be got at reduced costs. On a lighter note, a co-working space should not be considered exactly like a paying guest or homestay accommodation (if you are a student) because its comes with its own pros and cons.

Easy Recruitments
Co-working is the perfect solution when you need more workers for your business. This need for extra talent is easily met in a shared work environment that is more productive. Owners of businesses can gain from an overall feeling of positivity and wellbeing. Co-working spaces offer many add-on services like legal help, admin support, and recruitment support."
6sysfi,2,2017-08-11,Internal transfer from CAS to Tisch Film/tv,curmudgeono,nyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/6sysfi/internal_transfer_from_cas_to_tisch_filmtv/,"If anyone has any success/attempt/failure stories, or any advice I'd love to hear it. 

So here's my deal: I'm currently a computer science major going into my Junior year who has decided to withdraw from next semester because I've decided that after a summer internship at a startup that I do not want to spend my life as a programmer. I am going to spend the next year working at a restaurant and putting together a portfolio to apply to Tisch. As of now my GPA is a 3.4 - also I did premed for a sec, then compsci for the last year, and I'm a little worried that all the changing will make me look like a quitter on my app :( . But does that really matter if my portfolio's great?

^ That's kind of my biggest question for anyone who knows - what's the importance of portfolio quality compared to GPA/academic record?"
6sz1mb,7,2017-08-11,Found out that I am HIV positive but no access to medication.,koolio92,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6sz1mb/found_out_that_i_am_hiv_positive_but_no_access_to/,"Three weeks ago, I found out I am HIV positive. I had nothing to blame but myself. I possibly contracted it last year when I was in a really troubled state and participated in many reckless behavior including many unprotected encounters with men where I was the receptive partner. 

Background: I graduated with my bachelor's degree last year as an international student. I was born and raised in a third world country, in a poor rural area. I was one of the smart kids then and won a scholarship to study in Canada. I knew it was my golden ticket as I finally found a way to escape homophobia in my home country. I didn't think too much about career or my actual interest as my goal was just to get out of the country. I went on to do a degree in biomedical sciences as I was pretty good with biology, maths, and chemistry in high school. At university, I began really well academically but started hating what I studied in my final years of study. There was no way for me to change my program of study (because of scholarship contract) and I finished my program anyway.

After graduating, I was just left in a limbo. I really don't know what I like or what I'm good at. At the same time, the pressure of immigration is catching up to me as I only have three years to make sure that I have a year of experience in a skilled position to qualify for permanent residency or I'm out. Given the job market in Canada, I was left jobless for 4 months before I decided to work part time at a retail to help support myself. I hated my life every single day ever since graduating. Maybe I felt entitled, but the pressure of immigration, the anxiety that comes from the lack of medical coverage, the fact that I was clearly worthless in terms of value/labor/skill/experience and the fact that I had to 'mature faster' compared to my Canadian friends who are out traveling/volunteering were making me really distraught. I was in a clear, distressed state and started engaging in reckless behaviors as a form of escapism from reality. I never really liked condoms because it really hurts my 'tight' ass but in the past, I was always sensible and ensured I was having safe sex but during this period of my life, I simply didn't care about my health at all. During that period of unsafe sexual encounters, I once felt sick after sex with symptoms similar to early infections to HIV but I brushed it away thinking it was just a seasonal thing for me to have and didn't go to a doctor because I have no health coverage (non citizen/PR does not get access to universal healthcare). 

After a while, I secured an internship in a completely different field than what I studied (which is fine, I hated what I studied anyway). I was only starting to get my life back in order and decided to get tested for STI/HIV, bammm I came down positive with HIV and Syphilis. I was treated for Syphilis immediately but HIV is a completely different story. It's not just about me worrying about access to drugs because of my lack of medical coverage but it's also possible for Canadian govt to reject my application for permanent residency because I now pose a burden to the Canadian healthcare system (HIV medication). All this while, my performance at work is declining every single day and I'm afraid my manager won't even consider me after the end of my internship. I also recently found out I have ADHD and I'm like great, I seem to hit the jackpot on everything.

I really want to go back home. At least people won't discriminate me based on my race, my accent and home means that my family is there to support me but having HIV and being gay also means that I need to be in a more gay-friendly place to protect myself. I'm dirt poor anyway so decisions like migration needs to weigh in all possibilities before I do something. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I'm living a double life everywhere I go and it's taking a toll on me. I feel lonely and I have never been in a relationship because I'm a fucking mess. Nowadays, I spend my time after work sleeping, looking at my friend's success and being incredibly jealous of them, and literally wished I was born straight. If I was born straight, I wouldn't even think about moving to a different country, I would probably be married right now.

Thoughts of dying are common these days. I don't want to commit suicide (that's probably ingrained through my Muslim upbringing) but sometimes, I wish someone would kill me. I have no value to provide to this world, I'm a filthy immigrant who's here to get 'welfare' and steal other people's jobs, I'm that gay Muslim kid who is hated by both communities. It's okay, I'm used to living my life being bullied as a kid for my sexuality, I'm used to living a double life, I'm used to being perceived as lesser because of my race, English and immigration status. Now I simply just have to add HIV and ADHD into the equation. "

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, as you could already tell I'm in the market for a mid-range-ish 15 in gaming laptop. As of now, the choice is between:

&amp;nbsp;

An [Asus ROG GL502VM](https://benstore.com.ph/asus/2752-asus-rog-strix-gl502vm-ds74-156-gaming-laptop-g-sync-i7-7700hq-gtx-1060-16gb-ddr4-128gb-ssd-1tb-hdd-.html?search_query=Asus+strix&amp;results=43) Strix variant, which comes with a 7th gen i7 7700HQ processor, Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB GSync capable GPU, 16 GB DDR4, and 128 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD storage.

&amp;nbsp;

Or a [Dell Inspiron 15 7567](https://benstore.com.ph/dell/2887-dell-inspiron-15-7567-156-fhd-gaming-laptop-ips-i7-7700hq-gtx-1050ti-16gb-ddr4-128gb-ssd-1tb-hdd-black-.html?search_query=Dell+inspiron&amp;results=24) which comes with a 7th gen i7 7700HQ, GTX 1050Ti 4 GB GDDR5 GPU, 16 GB DDR4, and a 128GB SSD + 1 TB HDD storage.

&amp;nbsp;

From what I've seen so far, the Dell Inspiron has better build quality, better temperature control and quieter fans, while the Asus ROG GL502VM has significantly more GPU umph and a slightly more in-your-face ""gamer aesthetic"" with the logos and red stripes.

&amp;nbsp;

It's really come down to the fact that the Dell is a bit sturdier and quieter, while the Asus packs significantly more punch, even if it comes at the cost of build quality. The fact that the Dell comes around 10k-ish cheaper than the Asus is also a factor, as I'm unsure if the performance upgrade is really worth the subsequent price increase.

&amp;nbsp;

I think I should also point out that the look of the laptop plays quite a lot into what I want to buy. This is mainly the reason that despite having similar specs at a much lower price, 15 to 14k ish to be not-quite-exact, I didn't list the [Acer Predator Helios](https://benstore.com.ph/acer/2919-acer-predator-helios-300-156-gaming-laptop-i7-7700hq-gtx-1060-16gb-ddr4-256gb-ssd-black-.html?search_query=Acer+helios&amp;results=44) as a choice. It just looks too gamer-y and too outlandish for me to be able to bring it out at school or at an internship.

&amp;nbsp;

Thoughts, opinions, maybe even other laptop suggestions? The upper limit of my price range is around 80k, give or take maybe 3 to 5k.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, I want to know from you guys if Benstore is a trustworthy PC store? I've checked with TipidPC and Dynaquest they don't seem to have this specific Asus for sale. While they do have the Inspiron 15 7567, it's actually around 1 to 2k more expensive than as listed on Benstore.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks in advance for the advice!

&amp;nbsp;

Price for each (according to Benstore PC)

Is it just pure luck to get into an internship? I have applied to A lot of places, I used internship.com and tried the CDS on NJIT, and also I went to last years career fair, and no one came back to me, ever came back to me would be the best answer.
This is frustrating me, I am a junior that works as a ""freelancer"" so its not an IT job but somehow disconnecting computers and reconnecting them and being on the job site for day one support to make sure everything runs kinda works out as an IT job, still tho I might have steered away from the topic, my question would be "" Did you get an internship through NJIT or just got lucky looking around, searching websites such as Dice and Internship.com?"" It would be amazing to see everyone's experience and also give me some hope that I might get into something before graduation, Hopefully."

 by Zaid Jilani via The Intercept
   
 URL: http://ift.tt/2uwwLZW
   
Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar, one of several Democrats vying for his party’s nomination to run for Illinois Governor against incumbent Republican Bruce Rauner, doesn’t think the drug war was a failure.

“The war on drugs was a success,” he said in a speech on criminal justice reform given last month. “Because the war on drugs was never actually on drugs. It was against black people.”

Pawar used that address to explain the true history of the modern drug war, which President Nixon [utilized to crack down](http://ift.tt/1Psi0ZW) on the anti-war left and African Americans.

As part of his campaign, he’s vowing to end Illinois’s participation in that drug war through a battery of policies: making minor possession of controlled substances no longer a felony, legalizing and taxing marijuana, expanding addiction treatment, establishing a truth and reconciliation commission to air police-community grievances, and, most radically, using his commutation powers as governor to simply commute the sentences of non-violent low-level drug offenders.

**As the British Divided India, Rauner Divides Illinois
   
**

In a wide-ranging interview with The Intercept, Pawar put his views on politics into a larger context. His campaign targeting the drug war is part of a larger philosophy of fighting what he says is a divide-and-conquer approach by the nation’s elite to turn people of different races and classes against each other.

Pawar, who himself is the son of Indian immigrants who were active in the now opposition Congress Party, was spurred to run partly by [Rauner’s 2015 decision](http://ift.tt/2hS3inj) to pause the acceptance of Syrian refugees to the state.

“My background is in the connection between disaster and poverty policy; my wife used to run a refugee resettlement program, my first graduate internship in social work school was working with refugees,” he explained. “The idea that you would ban a group of people who literally walked across continents, who are fleeing persecution…is un-American. This is consistent with what Rauner has been doing in Illinois over the last years which is pitting communities against one another. Using the economic anxieties that exist in communities as sort of a catalyst to pit them against one another.”

He cited the example of Rauner going to poor white communities in Illinois and complaining about the level of school funding in Chicago, a sort of racial dog whistle. “He’s done a very good job of dividing and ruling,” Pawar cited. “When I give my stump speech I talk about how that is the same tactic the British used in India. You know, the British pit Hindus and Muslims against one another. Pit people against one another based on class and geography, caste….this is no different. Chicago versus downstate. Downstate versus Chicago. Black, white, brown against one another. All poor people fighting over scraps. So that’s why I jumped into the race. I’m going to call this stuff out.”

Pawar’s convictions about ending the divide-and-conquer strategy inform his views on the drug war. He pointed to the very different public policy response to the crack-cocaine epidemic, which was concentrated among African Americans, and today’s opiate epidemic, which is concentrated among white Americans ([black and brown people have seen soaring rates of overdoses,](http://ift.tt/2hRdh0f) too, though on a smaller scale).

“The opiate crisis means we need to provide treatment. Today we’re calling it a public health issue, but it was a public health issue 40 years ago,” he said.

He explained to The Intercept why he is willing to take the step of using commutations to get Illinois’s low-level, nonviolent drug offenders out of prison.

“If you were jailed for low-level drug offenses, nonviolent drug offenses, the basis for commutation is, well we are talking about preventative treatment so why are we letting people whither away in jail for the same issues we are wiling to provide treatment for today?” he asked. “The drugs are different, but the underlying circumstances that led people to addiction, or created the addiction issue is the same. So you can create a rubric and say look, ‘low level drug offense, nonviolent, commute the sentences; create an automatic expungement program.’ You pair that with workforce development or social supports. That is still cheaper than 35 or 40 grand a year of jailing that person.”

**A New Deal For Illinois**

Pawar’s platform is inspired by former President Franklin Roosevelt; the candidate calls it a “[New Deal for Illinois](http://ift.tt/2fy8j7B).”

In addition to criminal justice reform, it has three other planks.

On education, Pawar backs an elected school board for the city of Chicago, which would reduce the power of Mayor Rahm Emanuel to call the shots (the Mayor is actually a constituent of Pawar’s).

He is also proposing moving away from a property tax funding model for the state’s schools towards more progressive financing.

On childcare and the social safety net, the candidate is proposing making access to child care universal and guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers. On jobs and infrastructure, Pawar is calling for a program modeled on the New Deal itself to put thousands of people to work.

Much of his approach to politics was informed by Hurricane Katrina. “I saw politicians blaming poor people for poverty,” he said. Katrina and disaster relief  formed the epicenter of much of his research in graduate school, which later led to a [textbook](http://ift.tt/2hRmjKw) he co-wrote with his wife.

“The one thing I kept coming back to in my research, and my book, and I looked at it from a disaster perspective, but it’s certainly true in all public policy in America is that policy in this country is based on deserving and undeserving people,” Pawar noted. “It starts with this idea that if we give and help poor people too much they’ll become dependent on the system and then abuse the system. And that the best way to help people is to help those that have quote ‘have worked the hardest.’ So they can create more jobs for everybody else. That frame needs to be broken. That’s why I got into politics.”

**Running Against a Billionaire Opponent**

The Democratic gubernatorial primary is being overshadowed by J.B. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune who has now [spent $21 million](http://ift.tt/2hBIe8m) of his own money in the race.

“There’s always someone in life who has more money than you, and if you let those kinds of barriers determine whether you make decisions or not, that means your life is always in someone else’s hands,” Pawar said.

He pointed out that when he first ran for Alderman, he spent $11,000 during his entire campaign against an opponent who spent six figures. “I think by being out there, hustling, talking to people, making up for the fact that I didn’t have money and replacing it with sweat, I put myself in a position to win,” Pawar said. “My thought here with this race is do our best to out-hustle them. We’re spending a lot of time in places that went for Trump….I don’t feel it makes sense to write people off based on who they voted for in the last election and I think ultimately if we’re going to stop the ugly rhetoric anywhere, we have to organize poor white people, black people and brown people together. They need to see the commonality between their experiences.”

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

I'd been talking to this girl for the past month and every day we were wanting to be together once she got back from an internship over 10 hours away.  

When she got back into town, I couldn't see her right away because she had some things she needed to do.  

I patiently waited until yesterday I was having a panic attack due to stress at work and family situation.  I spiraled out of control.  It was like I could see myself spiraling and I couldn't stop it.  I messaged the girl saying that ""Why haven't we seen each other yet?  We aren't talking as much as we usually do.  Did you find someone else?  I'm sorry my anxiety and depression are ruining my life right now."" etc etc.

Turns out, she was just really busy the last couple days and she messaged me hours later saying she wasn't sure we should see each other.  I am heartbroken and I feel like she would be the one who I would always think of as the one who got away. 

I messaged her this morning saying ""Hey..."" and if she responds, then I'll ask for forgiveness and try to explain what happened.  (One friend of mine, who I thought was a friend, was angry at me and used my panic attack to get back at me by saying things like ""She probably found someone else, she's not interested in you.""

I'm an IT student, just waiting to graduate on October. I've been looking for jobs for the past few weeks and honestly, I'm kinda lost. Call me a snowflake but I really need help, especially from professionals that have been or are currently with me in my dilemma. 

I came from an average family. Average meaning na we really just get by day to day. I've had two internships in the past. First was at BGC and second was at Ortigas. Now, I really love companies which are located in BGC. Parang andun halos karamihan ng how do I put this, ""pang millenial"" na companies. Problem is, it's too far from where I live. Wala naman din kaming means to transfer and I couldn't find anyone that I could live with (sa dorm) kasi I can't leave my mom alone. 

My second internship, sa Ortigas, it was nice, pay was good. It was also near my place of residency, but the company was the traditional 9-6 organization with matching formal attire pa. Medyo big deal sakin yung attire kasi wala naman akong madaming polo. Humiram lang ako ng mga masusuot sa tito ko and obviously I'll have to return those pa. The 9-6 is where it sucks. I wake up early to avoid traffic and so I get there around 7 or or 7:30 and I don't really have much to do sa free time ko. Plus, yung 6pm out means na kasabay na lahat ng traffic pauwi so I get home at around 8pm. I can't really leave the house at a latter time kasi 1- mabilis dumami yung tao sa sakayan ng FX and 2- traffic. So it's either I'll be super early or super late.

Now, what advice would you guys give me? Should I stick with a job that wouldn't really make me happy in the long run (pero maayos yung sweldo) or focus on having fun while working pa rin (in a sense na I'm with people who share my similar interests)? I'd really appreciate everything from you guys. Thank you! "

I am super excited and will say yes -- but *do* want to negotiate my salary.

The range for my position in my current location is 33k - 41k according to Glassdoor, with some companies paying 43k-45k at the high end.

The base for my company according to 1 submission on Glassdoor is 39-42k. I want 43k at least.

**Aspects the could potentially be brought up to negotiate:**

- Members on my team will average 50 hours a week. And more during the holidays, where we often have to stay (even up until day before New Years)
- My team holds 40% of the agency's business
- My entry-level position is 100% more hands-on compared to the work done by my same position at other companies
- I've been told by my team's Assistant Director in person, on several occasions, that I am ""above average"" and everybody on our team is ""above average""
- I have been told that my contributions made during the internship have very much impressed my team members, and that I seem like a hard worker
- For a few reasons, I feel like I bring more to the table than your typical entry level hire, which I could bring up in discussion
- I will be paying close to $3,000 a year to commute after commuter reimbursement (which is only $100 a month)

With those things being said, I want to understand what points I should *not* bring up, and which points I *should* bring up. This will be my first salary negotiation, and I'm not positive what I can say as an entry-level hire to hit the higher end of the range. I really want AT LEAST 40k, and since commutation expenses are 3k, I want 43k, to pad that. Ideally I would get 45, but I really have no clue if that's possible.

Would love as much advice as possible! Links, guides, videos, a fat dose of reality maybe? Thanks so much!

I also have Asperger's so it is tough for me to be extremely social. I am sent to an engineer company during this break. The company is quite large and there is a total of ten interns there.

There is a group of interns who know each other before being sent here for work. There are a bunch of international students from Poland and they seem pretty social. In fact, quite a number of the employees at the company seem pretty social.

I tried being friendly with those students from Poland as I was grouped with them. I have noticed that they tend to talk about their lives back in Poland so I naturally asked them about that and tried to make some small talk about Poland.

It wasn't until later that I started to notice that these interns from Poland seem to dislike me (won't explicitly say what they did here). This coworker even pointed out that they seem to be ignoring me and asked if something happened between us.

Thinking back on it, maybe they dislike how I am asking then about Poland and commenting on how life there is probably nice. I guess they see it as me wanting them to go back home even thought I really didn't intend it that way. Some secretaries also asked about our employment aspects vs international students out of curiosity and I guess I made the mistake of answering something along the lines of how German companies want to hire locals and then other people from the EU.

Now I don't know what to do. Also, what should I do if something similar happens in the future? Since it is super obvious that these students are not from Germany, what should I do when I encounter people like them in the workforce in the future?

Tl;dr: I am a German intern with Asperger's and I think I made this group of interns from Poland angry as I probably asked too much about their homelands and commented that returning there for work must be nice. I guess they misinterpreted what I've said and think that I want them to go back home even though I was trying really hard to be friendly and now they seem to be ignoring me. What should I do about this (and no, I don't want to disclose that I have Asperger's to anyone in the company given out I fear discrimination)? And what should I do in the future if I encounter international students or foreigners in the workplace (i.e. how to talk to them without them feeling like I am dissing them)?"

Kara the intern said, fidgeting a little. She could never get used to the atmosphere in this office. Mostly it was the sensation of all the hairs on her body standing on edge. As if everywhere she walked, there was a giant statically charged balloon.

""GodTube."" Zeus mused on the alien word, stroking his majestic beard and looking down at Kara from atop his golden throne.

""Uh, yes. GodTube."" Kara said, fixing her glasses. ""I think it'd be quicker if I just showed you... may I?"" She said, pointing at Zeus's laptop.

The god of thunder simply nodded, his chin resting on a Herculean fist the size of a bowling ball. Kara made her way over to the device and clicked on a link that she had found earlier on. She noticed Zeus leaning over a little for a better look at the projection she played on his heavenly nimbus projector.

""E...pic Water Prank... what in the name of my beard..."" he said, looking over the obnoxious thumbnail ascribed to the clip. ""This better be damned good, Kara,"" he growled.

Kara gulped and played the video. On the screen, a familiar face popped up. Zeus groaned.

""What's HE doing here?""

""You'll see,"" Kara said, keeping her eyes on the video.

A muscular man with a regal beard that flowed like water held up a golden trident, and was grinning menacingly into the camera.

""Whattttsup believers, your boy Poseidon here with another epic prank. Today, I'm gonna,"" he stopped here, breaking into a fit of hysterical laughter. Eventually, he continued, wiping away a tear. ""Sorry about that, anyways, today, I'll be pranking the folks of this peaceful hamlet in the middle of diddlyfuck nowhere.""

The camera panned over the peaceful town. The elderly could be seen as little blots, walking their dogs, conversing on benches, and chasing little kids off their lawns. A booming roar shook the screen from the side. The camera turned to an image of Poseidon, who had his trident raised above his head. Behind him, a tidal wave of veritably godly proportions loomed over the town's populace, drawing a most foreboding shade upon the puny mortals.

""Whoooooohooooo!"" Poseidon yelled as he jumped on a water carriage drawn by his oversized seahorses. The god of the oceans rode the wave, which crashed down on the hamlet of Happytown, wiping it clean off the map.

""What in the actual fuck?"" Zeus said, incredulously.

""Shh, here's the important part!"" Kara said, hushing him. Zeus fell back into his seat, grumbling.

Poseidon could be seen walking closing in on the screen from a distance. When he had finally arrived, the new, hip god swept back his turquoise locks which had been drenched wet from all the tidal waving and started talking again.

""Like I said, epic! If y'all liked that video, please don't forget to subscribe to the temple of Poseidon and hit the praise button below. Every praise I get means I get more power, and more power means more quality content! Poseidon out!""

The projection ended. Zeus stared at the screen drawing a blank, then turned to Kara. Kara shrugged.

""So this... the other gods,""

""Hindu, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, Muslim, Norse, most of your friends and family in your pantheon too.""

""Even Athena?""

""Especially Athena,"" Kara said with a sigh. Zeus did NOT want to know what his daughter had been up to recently.

""Damn."""
6t2uox,2,2017-08-11,I don't know how to cope with waiting.,n8in8,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/6t2uox/i_dont_know_how_to_cope_with_waiting/,"Before I get into my question, I want to rave a little bit about how amazing this subreddit is.

For the past year or so, I have been questioning my gender identity. At first it was very painful to think about being trans, and I had a lot of doubts. My mind was torn in two directions: on one hand, I knew that I'm not a cis man, and at the very least I'm agendered or gender fluid or some other sort of non-binary person, and possibly even a trans woman. On the other hand, I kept giving myself doubts - maybe I only think I'm trans because I like women and femininity? Maybe I only think I'm trans because I have low self esteem and I think that if I was a woman I would be more attractive? It goes on and on, like my mind fighting itself - part of it questioning my gender identity, and the other part trying to convince myself that I'm a cis man.

Enter /r/asktransgender. As soon as I started reading posts on this subreddit, I realized that *SO* many other people have similar - sometimes *exactly the same* - feelings as I've had. Lurking on this sub has helped me feel more normal, like I'm just your average trans woman who has repressed her gender identity for so long, and not some weird freak who is just a confused cis-man. My doubts and fears have not disappeared, but I've gone a long way in coming to terms with being a trans woman, and being more sure that I'm a trans woman. I have looked back on many things in my life and they make so much more sense now that I'm coming to terms with my gender identity! It's to the point where I'm about 90% sure that I'm trans, and reading /r/asktransgender has helped so much in getting me here. I love you folks!

Anyway, now to my problem. I said that I'm about 90% sure I'm trans, but I'm still not completely sure. I still have doubts, fears, and concerns. And if I am trans, that scares the shit out of me. I am dating a girl right now, who is bi and very supportive of trans people, but has told me before about a bad experience dating a guy in her past who was questioning and thought he was trans for a while, and as a result of this very negative experience, she's said she doesn't know if she could ever date a trans woman. I also have a very religious and conservative family, who I'm sure would still love and support me if I came out as trans, but they wouldn't like it, and it would be very uncomfortable and difficult to navigate. I also live and go to school in a semi-rural, Christian, conservative area of Texas. Most of the people around here aren't comfortable with LGBT people. Because of this, I don't know how I would handle coming out, or transitioning. It's terrifying.

Thankfully, there is a support system in place at my school for LGBT people: There's a student group for LGBT students and allies (mostly LGBT, not allies) to get together and socialize and what not; there's a faculty group for LGBT faculty and allies (mostly allies, we have very little LGBT faculty as far as I know) to take safe zone training, offer safe zones for students, etc. The latter group also hosts events with speakers about various things - legal issues in the LGBT community, information for allies about how to be supportive and understanding LGBT issues, meet n greets with LGBT authors, etc. Additionally, there is one counselor at student counseling services who specializes in LGBT issues, especially gender identity questioning (the other counselors are supportive of LGBT people as far as I know but this is the only one who specializes in LGBT issues). This counselor sounds perfect for me! And student counseling services offers *free* counseling!

I plan on talking to this counselor as soon as possible to help work things out. But school doesn't start for a few weeks, and he isn't going to be there until September 1st, from what I heard. And I have no idea how to wait! I am constantly thinking about this, and it's starting to get very uncomfortable for me. I'm nearly bursting at the seams with all of this gender stuff that I need to unload on someone, and I don't have anyone to talk to about it and help me with it!

What do I do? I don't have the money to pay for therapy or a doctor's visit or anything, and even if I did, I'm currently in a sort of turbulent transition period where I'm ending a summer internship very soon, going back to my parent's for a couple of days, then moving to school, so over the next few weeks I'm going to be living in 3 different cities in 2 different states.

It's just so hard for me to wait!

Thanks for listening to my barely-coherent rant :)"
6t2y7s,3,2017-08-11,"Long term unemployed, feeling less than useless.",newguyhereyep,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/6t2y7s/long_term_unemployed_feeling_less_than_useless/,"I've been unemployed for about half a year now. I know that's not a lot. I know people have it worse. I have a roof overhead and a partner who loves and supports me.

But I feel like I don't deserve it. Every job app that comes back rejected and every months-long interview process that doesn't work out reinforces the idea that the job I was laid off from made a mistake in hiring me in the first place and I was a charity case who was there to keep a seat warm. I feel like all I'm allowing myself to do every day is work towards getting work, and if I'm tired or bored, it better be from sending out job apps and hey I don't get to be bored, there's apps to fill out and jobs to find.

Did I mention I went back to school to prevent this? I was working unpaid shitty internships, living with my parents and thought the only way out was to go back to college, that having loans to pay off didn't sound so bad when you had a job to pay them off with, so did that whole thing again at 5x the price so I could be competitive and stay employed. Hasn't worked out that way. Really though it feels like I got myself waaaaaay more in debt than I'll ever be able to pay off, hamstringing myself and the ones I love, IF I were even working right now, let alone bleeding out.

I have been working like mad. Going to networking events. Part time side work that doesn't pay the bills but at least makes me look like i'm doing something. Bettering my skills and bolstering my resume.

Meanwhile loan deferments are expiring and I'm still out of work. Contacts and networking haven't helped. I keep feeling like I'm on the brink of finding work and it keeps not happening. The rejection part is the worst -- they don't tell you what's wrong, or why you're not good enough, they just tell you ""nah"" and you get to live with it. My favorite was one that said ""yeah we don't give feedback"" and then two weeks later I was sent a survey of how I thought the interview process went.

And there's no one to talk to.... I have friends but I feel like they don't know what to say and I'm tired of having the same story. My partner is supportive but preoccupied by their work. I'm afraid that I sound like a whiner or complainer when I talk about my situation, that gee, maybe you shouldn't have done what you did for the last 7 years and you'd be in some other situation.

After every rejection I go back into a day or two of this feeling, so that's why I'm here. I feel like I wasted all my 20s just trying to enter the workforce and I was there for just a short time. I'm scared I'm going to be locked out of life and weighed down and everyone will say ""well it's your fault, stupid""."

6t38pm,18,2017-08-11,Losing my passion. Getting too cynical. What happens from here?,pajamalamaobama,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/6t38pm/losing_my_passion_getting_too_cynical_what/,"I'll readily admit I'm not the best journalist in the world. But on that metric, there's only one ""best,"" and the rest of us fuck up here and there. I've let stories slip for various reasons, and that's no excuse - I should have been on them. But I pride myself on honest and accurate work, and have taken significant steps to improve my reporting practices in the last two years and change, since I managed to land a job at a small daily in the southern northeast.

However, I got my start at an internship in New York City. I was overwhelmed by the job but kept my head down, tried to make connections (and failed, for various reasons - partially my own, partially because my program was unorganized). I went home with my head hung low and needed a few years to get back into the game.

I have experience now. I turn in stories early, don't miss deadlines, have cut down majorly on bad copy, and generally do about as much as I reasonably can. I've got good clips, I have spunk, I care about journalism and I can turn around pretty much any story - even when I'm having the customary ""I can't do this"" panic attack, I get the job done. I just can't do that on a meager salary in the middle of nowhere anymore.

I've been applying for jobs for more than a year, mostly in NYC but also in some specialized places I feel I could succeed in. I try to sell myself the best I can, and I really do think I present a good package. I've tried to utilize connections the best I can. None of it's worked.

And when I look at the industry, at the jobs I'm clamoring for... I'm starting to notice patterns. Such as... everyone went to the same five schools. (I'm not exaggerating: most successful journalists I know are alums of Syracuse, NYU or Columbia, outside of the two people who parlayed great internships.) Everyone knows each other, and when I see jobs filled, they're going to people who know each other.

I'm not going to pretend journalism is the only industry that works this way - it's all about who you know, and what you've done for someone lately. But, as time goes by, I stagnate at a paper that's slowly taking on water (and I'm not allowed to freelance under my contract!) and the opportunities in front of me start to dwindle, I'm struggling to even warrant staying in the profession. I didn't get in this to get rich, or to get famous - I report because, in addition to feeling like it's the only thing I can do, I want to make the world more informed, and I want to help or entertain people with my copy. But it's getting harder and harder to do so. I can't take risks like I could three years ago - I need health insurance desperately, and I'm at a point in my life where $$ is taking on more importance. (And yes, I know there are tons of people in my shoes, those who can't even find slots like my job and are struggling worse.) I was covering my latest late-night, rural town board meeting this week when I nearly snapped and walked out.

I'm considering grad school, but grad school's an expensive crapshoot. I'm considering leaving the industry I've loved for most of my career and the majority of my pre-work life. I'm still sending resumes, and they're giving me a 100% bupkis return rate. Should I keep trying? Is it worth it?"

-How much is the cost of living (assuming i'll try to get a tiny place in downtown to avoid transport as much as possible) compare to west europe ?

-Will people find weird that a chinese-looking person can not speak the language when in the country ? Should i try to speak to them with my fully broken mandarin or should I go for english ?

6t3ovx,1043,2017-08-11,Summon Rates are not what we believed (statistical analysis of 4* and +1 ticket summons),gringacho,FFBraveExvius,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/6t3ovx/summon_rates_are_not_what_we_believed_statistical/,"#**UPDATE:** 

I was able to finish analysis of previous banners. Important points first, details to follow.

1. All evidence points to a **rate of gold crystals popping out on-banner units from 4* tickets and the guaranteed gold of a 10 + 1 to NOT be the same as JP version.** At the same time, **all evidence continues to suggest that standard tickets have the same rates as the JP version of the game.**

2. **This rate looks to be around the same 23.75% chance coming out of gold crystals from standard summom**, though exact confirmation is not possible.

3. **This has not changed recently or likely ever.** It rate extends far back at least as far as February. It may or may not have existed before then.

4. **We were not lied to** by GUMI or Square Enix. 

5. Since summon rates for normal summons have all been confirmed to be the same between JP and GL, **it was incorrectly assumed by the player base that 4* / +1 summons were the same as well.** It is much more difficult to analyze these, which is why we have never seen the difference before.

6. I cannot say whether this was an intentional decision or an implementation error. **However, I ask that GUMI and Square Enix please address this issue and consider implementing this QoL change.**

&amp;nbsp;

A few of my personal opinions on this. 

First, **let's not get mad** There is no way for us to know how this difference came to be. Whether it was an intentional decision or a mis-communication between different sides of the companies that publish it. Or just bad coding somewhere that no one double checked.

Looking at the summon surveys (link below), **all evidence suggests that the actual odds of a gold crystal popping out a banner unit from a 4* ticket or +1 summon are around 23.75%.** This is different than JP version where 50% of 4* and +1 summons will yield on-banner units. And it appears to be the same as the rate as GL standard summons. 

I will leave exact details of how this affects summoning for on-banner 4* characters to u/dposluns but **I believe that this will significantly devalue 10+1 and 4* ticket summons for players who's goal is to get banner 4* characters.**

Although SE never stated summon rates on GL, the fact that all other summons were the same as JP version led the entire player base to assume that these would be the same as well. 4* tickets are a very limited commodity, which makes collecting data to analyze their rates individually near impossible. 10 + 1 summons are, meaning there are only a handful of banners (Nier, Brave Frontier #2, and FFT #2) which generated enough summon data to even consider looking at +1 rates. If it weren't for the great work of u/Steamboy27 on past survey summons, we may have never noticed this. 

For everything that I present, **there is no way that the player base will ever be able to confirm summon rates.** But these rates have been around for at least 6 months, and potentially before then. We as a community need to continue summon surveys and continue analyzing their results so that we don't find ourselves making decisions with improper knowledge in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

My final thoughts:

1. **Thank you to this entire community and especially u/Steamboy27** . If it weren't for the thousands of summon results submitted by community members and the massive effort Steamboy has put into creating and running summon surveys, there would be nothing to go off of.

2. Unless GUMI / Square Enix consistently make summon rates public information, we will never know true summon rates. But we also do not know whether this change was intentional or not. **PLEASE PUT DOWN YOUR PITCHFORKS**

3. We need to continue doing summon surveys.


4. And finally:

###To GUMI / Square Enix, if you read this please address this issue by making summon rates for the global version of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius mirror the Japanese version and/or by making summon rates public.

&amp;nbsp;

-gringacho out

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


##Okay, now the details
When I first posted I analyzed the on-banner rates for 4* and +1 summons of the current Nier:Automata banner. Normally I would have looked back at old summons for further confirmation of my findings. But with the potential financial resources being spent by players on this banner I decided to publish these initial results immediately so that as many players as possible would be able to decide how much to invest in this banner with accurate summon rates.

I went back through all summon survey results from Feb 23, 2017 (The Olive/Shine/Shera banner) through the current NieR banner. Prior to the Olive banner I could not analyze data so I can't say anything about summon rates prior to then. There are a total of 1,290 summons included in this analysis

In this time, there were only three banners which had a large enough set of summon data to potentially provide accurate information for 4* base summons. These are the current NieR banner, the Brave Frontier #2 banner, and the Tactics #2 banner. Although I did not include other banners for analysis, I did check rates on them and found them to be similar to Nier/BF/FFT banners.

&amp;nbsp;

Results of my analysis are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nDhkAZBkjJORCZpmXpscDk1O9dkDTKKenUl2Dzy2FOM/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;nbsp;

Each banner is analyzed individually, and the total rates for all three combined is also analyzed. These results are limited to 4* base units. I excluded 5* base units because there was not enough information to accurately analyze their rates. 

A few important findings:

*The rates of 4* summons popping out banner units varied slightly between banners, but **none were near 50%. This provides further evidence that the GL rate is not the same as the JP rate. A 95% confidence interval for this rate ranged from 16 - 25% for individual banners and 20-22% for combined results. A binomial proportions to determine the chance of getting a sample mean of 21.16% when the actual rate is 50% over 1,290 summons **tells us that the odds are 0.01% that the true rate is 50%.**

*As many have pointed out, we can see reporting bias in these survey results. Soleil (the sole 4* unit on the FFT banner) was reported at much lower rates than NieR or Brave Frontier. Tilith was reported at higher rates than Karl or Seria. **Rather than invalidating analysis, I believe this provides further proof of the actual summon rate.** If rates were under-reported for Tilith (10-12%) and under-reported for Karl (6-7%) and Seria (5-6%), it would stand to reason that the actual summon rate for each of these units lies between these rates. If the actual rate were 7-9% for each of these units, it would give 21-27% as the overall rate.

*Considering the rates and relative consistency between banners over the course of 6 months, it seems most likely that the actual rate is 20-25%.  

*While there would appear to be a trend of 90% of 4* and +1 ticket summons being gold and 10% rainbow, testing results with an 85% chance that the true rate is actually 95%. Without a much larger data set, we cannot currently make any conclusions on this.

*All of this points towards likely summon rates, but unfortunately none of it is proof. Proof would require either (a) a large enough pool of +1 summon survey results with proper documentation/confirmation (approximately 350 results if the summon rate is 25% and we wanted to know the real rate within +/- 2%) of (b) public release of summon rates by Square Enix.

Finally, I have decided not to update results from the NieR summon survey in my current analysis. For better or worse, the existence of this post has enough potential to influence what is being reported that it would potentially compromise submissions after I posted. 

I am always looking for constructive feedback. If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know. 


#**END UPDATE**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

u/dposluns was kind enough to let me use data from his summon survey to check the rates on the NieR banner. I took only 10 + 1 entries (since there is much less data error in these than in single pulls historically). The rates for tickets/dailies all check out.
&amp;nbsp;

However, here is a breakdown of **4\* base summons (4* ticket or +1 of a 10 pull)** based on the 426 summons logged to this point:

**THE ANALYSIS BELOW IS FOR 4\* TICKETS AND +1 SUMMONS ONLY. FROM HERE DOWN DOES NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT REGULAR SUMMONS.**

 Unit | # pulled | % | “Official %\* ” 
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
A2 | 19 | 4.46% | 1.88%
2B | 21 | 4.93% | 1.88%
9S | 45 | 10.56% | 23.75%
Eve | 48 | 11.27% | 23.75%

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see, the combined rate for the two 4* bases is ~22% NOT the 47.5% we all expect. **THIS IS LESS THAN HALF AS LIKELY**.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking further, I checked to see the odds of a gold crystal popping a banner unit. The accepted “official” rate is 50%. 

Gold Crystal | # pulled | % | “Official %\*” 
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
On Banner | 93 | 25.27% | 50%
Off Banner | 275 | 74.73% | 50%

&amp;nbsp;

Here you can clearly see that **THE ODDS OF A GOLD CRYSTAL POPPING A BANNER UNIT ARE HALF OF THE ACCEPTED “OFFICIAL” RATE.** Now I cannot say if this is a change or just that we never noticed before. If it is a change, I have no idea if it was intentional or if the intern who forgot to take Shera out of the featured pool got hired full time.

\* *All official rates are taken from [exviuswiki](https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Summon)*

&amp;nbsp;

##But Gingacho, your sample is too small…

No it isn’t. It is much harder to get large enough numbers to test rainbow summon rates or drop rates of giancrysts because the expected rate is 1% or less. However, with an expected rate of 50% and an observed rate of 25% this sample size is plenty big.

I ran a binomial proportion test to see the odds of getting the current sample rate of 25.27% in 426 summons when the true rate really is 50%. 

**0.025%** 

Yes, there is a 0.025% chance that the banner rate is actually 50%. 5% is generally accepted for statistical significance, and this is 200x less likely. For a comparison that everyone here can relate to, this is about the same likelihood of pulling Tilith twice in a row on daily summons. 

&amp;nbsp; 

##But Grincacho, sample error…

Yes, these summon surveys are not even close to perfect. However, 10+1 samples tend to be much more consistent in reporting. To take a quick look at sampling bias, here some results for the “10” portion of 10 pulls reported:

| Rarity | # pulled | % | “Official %\*” |
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
3* | 2148 | 77.83% | 80%
4* | 531 | 19.24% | 19%
5* | 81 | 2.93% | 1%

&amp;nbsp;

| Banner unit rate by rarity | # pulled | % | “Official %\*” |
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
3* | 553 | 25.74% | 25%
4* | 132 | 24.86% | 25%
5* | 49 | 60.49% | 50%

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see the 3* and 4* rates are dead on. The 5* rate appears to maybe be different, but the sample size here actually *is* too small and the difference is not statistically significant. Even if we didn't have this confirmation, rates are OVER reported if anything because people go to the survey and submit a single summon that they are happy about while leaving out any they have done up to that point. So if anything, the survey rate will be skewed up and that the real rate is lower than what we see here.

&amp;nbsp;

My analysis is located in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aW9wmEnaXaViU8UJSI9Ygg5VNK6mn32_my0FpxxWMwI/edit?usp=sharing) . I invite anybody to look through it and analyze my analysis. 

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr The rates of pulling a 4* banner unit out of a 4* ticket or +1 pull are half we thought. It appears to be largely due to the fact that the odds of a gold popping out a banner unit are 25%, not 50% as we believed**

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT:** I initially stated that I ran paired t tests to compare sample to the expected rate, when it was a binomial proportions test. Doesn't change the analysis. I blame trying to format Reddit tables...

The sensation of being in a body I'm not controlling makes me uncomfortable, along with the unfamiliar feeling of breasts as she touches them, of there being nothing hanging between my legs, and being a few inches shorter.

The warmth of the water on her back feels soothing, and the feeling of her fingers massaging her thick long hair start to relax me/her/us. That's when I hear her private monologue and thoughts. Naughty thoughts. Thoughts about that guy in the office she flirts with. Thoughts about that hot new intern kid, ""but no - he's too young - someone might find out, he might brag?"".

The bubbles landing on her crotch give a tingling sensation I've never felt before, and it intensifies once her fingers gently start to rub her clit. Cold glass of the shower wall on her bare ass cheeks, I feel her pinching at her own nipple. She closes her eyes and I see mental images, of a muscled, shirtless male torso unbuttoning his jean fly, letting them fall and revealing a frighteningly long, thick, hard shaft.

Her breathing gets heavier and I'm feeling her getting this urge, totally foreign to me, for some reason she really needs something in...

And then she does it. Two fingers slide into her pussy causing me to moan aloud and wake back on your couch.

Chuckling to yourself, you prepare to send me back under.

My eyes close again. Where will you send me next?

***

I'm hoping you can take the role of the hypnotist, and perhaps other characters that you introduce by sending me off to relive Chloe's naughtiest experiences through her body and mind. You're sort of a GM, setting up the scene and the behavior of other characters.

I'll be playing as her, or rather as myself living through her, like the above! You could land me in the middle of another one of her solitary fantasies, or perhaps the intense, sexual build up, where she's being seduced, or doing the seducing. Or maybe just as her bra hits the ground? Or as she puts her ass in the air?

I don't like extreme stuff, like scat, piss, vomit, excessive violence, but I'm otherwise pretty flexible."

I managed to get from no Citrix experience at all, to passing the 1Y0-301 exam. I've loved working at Citrix and reading all of your experience with the product has a great affect internally so keep posting! People do read it.

6t46em,0,2017-08-11,So recently I've been frustrated and need to vent.,WeAreFinallyDolphins,RWBY,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/6t46em/so_recently_ive_been_frustrated_and_need_to_vent/,"Let me begin by apologizing if this post comes off as rambling and incoherent, sentencing and grammar have never been my strong suit.

Recently I've started noticing that I no longer get excited or hyped about RWBY as I once did, instead I feel sad and... I guess apprehensive? I'm worried about the CRWBY and there ability to handle the show going forward. 

In my opinion RWBY Volume 4 is the worst volume, sure it looks nice but that's it. Everything else to me feels like a step back in terms of pacing, character and especially fight choreography. The fight scenes in volume 4 are bad, (with the exception of Qrow vs Tyrian which I found to be passable) they are very slow and sluggish with frequent pauses in the combat, it all feels very un-Monty like and is a source of great frustration for me.

Now of course I don't mean to imply that the previous volumes are without flaws (I'm still waiting for an answer on what the heck was the point of cinders list back in volume 2 episode 5) maybe volume 4 would've turned out the same with Monty attached to it or maybe it would've been worse, we'll never know but at least the choreography would have been great so I would at least like it a lot more than the volume 4 we have now.

Having recently watched the new Weiss short I feel they're improving the combat but are still not up to the level of Monty quality that vol 1 and 2 had, at this  point I get the feeling that they're trying to go in a different direction instead of trying to emulate Montys style as much as possible which I think they should be trying to do above all else, considering that his choreography was one of the main selling points of the show when the red trailer first came out.

I would also like to go off on a tangent for a minute about my annoyance with the rooster teeth store and its lack of quality, the figurines are poorly sculped and break easily (it cost me £200 in total to get team CRME over to england and within a week both of Mercury's pegs broke off, now he has to lay on his stand.) I was going to praise the quality of they're plushies but as of this post they released some new mini plushies for $15 each that look very low effort. Combine all this with the nickle and diming of Grimm Eclipse and it seems to me like RT are more concerned about making a quick buck rather then making quality content. 

I have no love for CRWBY, not anymore.  Not the writers or the actors and certainly not the unpaid interns that are currently in charge of the fight scenes. Everyday I find myself agreeing more and more with what Shane wrote in his letter which is something I never thought would happen when it was first written a year ago.

I also don't like what I've been seeing on this subreddit recently, people who are content to just blindly accept this new inferior RWBY that we've been given, instead of demanding better from the CRWBY, because we all deserve better than what we got. We need less MurderofBirds and more SickSlick.

I'm gonna end it here, sorry for how disjointed this post turned out I've been adding to it bit by bit over the course of 5 days. Posting really isn't my thing, I'm just gonna go back to lurking full time. "

6t56rg,1,2017-08-11,[34M4F] The Greeks only asked one thing when a man died: Did he have passion?,Willpower4848,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6t56rg/34m4f_the_greeks_only_asked_one_thing_when_a_man/,"My biggest kink is passion. I realize that sounds pretty vanilla ... and is probably not actually a kink at all. But god help me nothing turns me on more than that hungry-eyed, lip-biting look. That desperation. That need. Plenty of kinks come from that. Cheating is thrilling, especially when there's the danger of getting caught. Public sex really gets my motor running, and not semi-public, I want an audience. But it's got to have that I-fucking-want-you-right-now quality to it. I want that primal, urgent, unstoppable lust.

As you may have guessed, these are the rantings of an unfulfilled married man. Everyone wants what they can't have, and for me right now that's passion. So instead I fantasize about meeting the intern in that dark hallway behind the break room, or hate-fucking the bitchy supervisor who loves to show off her tight little body. There comes a point where that's not enough anymore, though. 

What I'm looking for: An online friend with benefits. I want to talk about every dirty little thing under the sun. I want to tease you until you can't help but sneak away to the bathroom. I want to swap dirty pictures and audio and video (if you're game for that). But you can't have the benefits without the friend. Bitch about your boss and then we can fantasize about what it would be like to fuck in his office and make a mess of the place. I'll complain about my lack of sleep and you can tell me how you would make me look forward to waking up in the morning. 

This is maybe starting to sound more like an online relationship, but that's not really it. I'm just hoping for something casual and fun to take our minds off reality.

Who I'm looking for: If any of this sounds good, then it's probably you. Being married as well gets you bonus points (all the better to commiserate with). Being over 22 would be nice, but exceptions can be made. I don't care about race or body type, as long as you have that passion. Also, please understand that I may disappear for a day or two because of personal and professional responsibilities, and I'll extend you the same courtesy.

So drop me a line and let's get to know each other. I'm good with reddit or google or kik, whichever you prefer. 

Thanks for reading!"
6t58qx,0,2017-08-11,Buying a new house vs renting an apartment (Student loans),jrt364,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6t58qx/buying_a_new_house_vs_renting_an_apartment/,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking into buying my own place or renting an apartment right now, but I'm not sure which route is better to pursue. I'm currently living with my parents and I graduated in 2015 with my Master's in Computer Engineering, so I do have some college debt ($44,050.75 left).

I have a great job that I love. I make $89,000 plus stocks and bonuses, and I get to work from home 1-3 days a week (although I usually go into the office all 5 days a week). I also have money leftover from an internship I did and research lab stipends.

I have about $53,000 in my bank account currently, so I was saving up in case I wanted to buy a house and needed a downpayment. Got room for that.

Current expenses:

 - Gas ($150/mo)
 - Medication ($60/mo)
 - Car payment ($344/mo)
 - Student loan payment ($832/mo)

Car payment should be done in &lt;1 year. Student loan should be done in &lt;4.5 years @ this rate, but I can refinance both if necessary.

I'm not sure if it would be wise to buy a place when I have these monthly expenses. What do you think? If I shouldn't buy a place right away, what do you think about killing those student loans? I used to have a separate $38,000 loan on top of the $44,000 one, but I paid that $38,000 one all off at once about a year ago. (So I guess I would have had almost $90k in the bank right now if I didn't pay it off, but I want to pay off my loans quickly and part of it was like 7% interest anyway, so I don't regret doing that.)

BTW, interest rate is 5.5% for my student loans left (yikes!), so that's something important you guys probably need to know."

We were in the same university, but different colleges, that's why we didn't talk much to each other. Two years later, I randomly met her on the train, and found out that we did our internship near each other. After that we started talking more, we hanged out together, had lunch and dinner together. Then I liked her. On the last day of our internship, I knew that I would not have much chances to see her again in school, because we are in different colleges and stay far from each other. That's why I decided to confess my feelings to her.
She rejected my love and told me that she did not want to get into any relationship for now, she wants to find a career first before getting into any relationship. She hopes we can still be friends. I feel empty and lost now. I feel it is quite awkward now to talk to her as a normal friend. What should I do now? I also want to talk to her and keep our friendship, but I feel it is quite hard now to control my feelings and emotions. Can I have some advice to move on?

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

Kind of my trash account, wife knows the real one and I don't want to start something if there's nothing to start, you know? Sorry if this gets long.

My wife and I have been together for five years now, great relationship, her career has been stellar, mine's at least been stable, and we have two kids, some cars, a house, hurray. I've spent the last year getting an additional degree in my field, it's been a lot of work and long nights studying, and I've appreciated the hard work my wife has done picking up slack on the homestead. This summer, I had a grueling internship, 10-14 hours a day + studying for program captstones and papers- it's been a nightmare.

My wife has been reaching out socially at work and outside of work more this year, and I have been enthusiastic about her developing herself independently, she needs time out of the house, and she needs girl time. The normal year has been fine, but this summer has kind of driven me to make this post. I haven't had a weekend with her, just the two of us, and I'm pretty sure it's wearing me thin. She's been on fun girls' trips, a couple of bachelorette parties, some bridal showers, work trips. I've been grinding away, watching the kids on weekends, both dreading and anxiously hoping August would just roll around so I could get back to some normalcy. My program ended last week, and my internship ended yesterday- I'm not overjoyed at being done like I was after finals in college because it just *sucked so bad*, I'm just  happy I survived. But things have been weird all week.

My wife had plans every weekend of July- cool, I'll stay with the kids on the weekend, and I'll get her come August. Last weekend she has a last-minute meetup with a friend she hasn't seen in forever, I told her I'm finally coming out of my time sink and would like to spend some time with her, so she makes Sunday a little bit about us and it was pretty great, until the week started. I didn't talk to her basically until the mid-week, when she says she wants to go out for dinner with some girlfriends on Friday. Kind of disappointing, it was my last day and I thought some celebrating could ensue between us, but after telling her that I need some wife time and being reassured that it was only dinner and she'd be home just after the kids went to bed, I (mistakenly) relented.

Well that turned into a few pitchers, which led to some dancing, which led to a nightclub, which I actually knew about because one of the girlfriends was texting me the timeline, my own wife wasn't really responding or keeping me in the loop (""be home at 1000/1130/midnight"" followed by no communication past midnight, which is what kind of set me off). She started texting once I made it pretty clear I was upset, tried texting sexy things or whatever, but by that point the night was ruined because it didn't feel genuine. For the record, the sexy times did not ensue because ""I made her feel like I was mad at her, and her friends think she's on too tight a leash.""

I trust my wife, I know she'd never physically cheat on me, but I feel pretty betrayed all week, which just got out of control last night. One night out with the girls is great, but every Friday seems to be a different color of the same story, and I was anchoring myself to a night with my wife. 

We're supposed to go to a wedding a couple hours away, and I didn't sleep last night, or really any night, and I don't really care to go to celebrate a marriage when I am feeling weird turbulence in my own.

I feel like I'm losing the love of my life, and I don't know how to get on the same page. I've now been reassured that next weekend is all us (and the kids, which, I love them, but I haven't had a deficiency of child time this summer), but I'm starting to think my wife doesn't like me, because we've been playing next weekend since May.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Wife is partying, dad stays home, dad has long days and just wants his wife, who keeps reassuring him that ""next weekend"" will be the one that rekindles us. Did I make a mistake doing this program? How do I tell her that she needs to choose which marriage is important to her today?

Edit: because I forgot to address the leash thing- do I have her leashed? I don't want to be controlling, and I feel like I've tempered myself because I have such trust in my wife, but it seemed like such a jarring comment. I don't know if she fed that line to them, or if her friends think that way, but that also was shocking to hear, given the context of our entire relationship. I feel like there's a large line between leashing someone and being a doormat to them, right? 

Anyway, I appreciate any insight or sage advice, I'm struggling this week, and especially this morning."

I'm a 30 years old french. I have been in the US in 2014 iirc as a tourist for a bit less than 3 months.

Now I've passed the entrance exam of a programming school, called 42, which is located in Paris, france (where I did my exam) and Fremont, CA, USA. For personal reasons I do not wish to study nor live in France. Now 42 is completely okay with me studying in their Fremont campus, however they're not recognized as a higher education organism, neither in France nor in the US. Hence, they are unable to secure visas for their students, and one must apply on their own if they wish to immigrate for their studies.
The other thing is that part of the cursus is completing a 3-months internship in the first year, and another 6-months internship at the end of the third year, which, I presume, will require a different kind of visa than a student one.

Now, what type of visa should I be applying to? In my situation, do I have any chances of actually being able to secure something? Also, if I manage to secure an internship, would my employer be able to secure a visa for me?
Considering the first internship is quite early in the course, I would technically be able to come study on 2 tourist visas back to back, then find an internship and get a visa this way, but I'm not sure that's legal, and frankly it's a bit of a gamble....
Any help or pointers in the matter will be extremely appreciated."

# Different Types of Run-Pass Options ""RPO's""

This was inspired by a fantastic article I read by /u/Downinthebend.  A lot of what I learned about RPO's came from this article, and it's a great beginner article to understanding them.  A lot of the terms I use will be used from this article too.

**[Article Link](https://www.18stripes.com/film-room-decoding-the-rpos-and-the-option/)**

Long story short, a run-pass option is exactly that, a play that can be a run or a pass based on reads the QB makes after the snap (you could also argue they include a read before the snap as well).  Basically, the O-line and the runningbacks will execute a running play, and the receivers will execute a passing play; usually a quick pass or quick screen concept.  RPO's dominate the college football landscape today, and there are teams like Auburn, Baylor, Ohio State, and Oregon, where pretty much every play is a RPO.

**Triple Option RPO**

This is what many think of when they hear of an RPO.  There are three choices for the QB: Hand off, keep and run, or keep and pass.  The keep/pass phase is like the keep/pitch phase of the inside veer used at Georgia Tech and the military academies.  The give/keep read is often a D-lineman, while the keep/pass read is a LB or rolled up safety.    

**LB read/2nd level read**

On these types of RPO's, the QB will read a linebacker and either hand off or throw the ball based on the LB's actions.  These are used a lot against defenses that use a six man box (with only five O-linemen blocking), or against a seven man box with only six O-linemen + TE/FB blocking).  The pass option will usually involve a route or concept that puts the designated LB in a strain, forcing him to either commit to the run or to the pass.  If the LB bites on the run, the QB keeps and throws the pass.  If the LB stays wide or is held in his place by the pass, the QB hands off.  A common pass concept for this is a slant by a slot receiver.  A slant by a slot receiver will attack the position of a LB, so if the LB vacates that area to defend the run, the slant should be open.  

**DB read/3rd level read**

These types of RPO's might be used more against an aggressive secondary (like Michigan State), or when the offense wants to strike big if they can't rely on the run.  The QB will key a DB, typically a run-support defender, and will give or pass based on his movements.  A good example of an aggressive DB is a safety in a cover-4 scheme.  Safeties are the run-force defenders, and because of the deep help from the CB's, cover 4 allows safeties to be much more aggressive against the run.  If the QB sees the safety fly upfield to stop the run, he will pull and throw the pass.  Seam and go routes are quite common here.

Another way to do it is to read the CB.  These ones are more common with triple option variations, where there's a run, keep and run, and keep and pass option.  The QB will make his give or keep read, and after he pulls the ball on a keep read, he will run to the alley.  If the CB comes off the receiver to get the QB, the QB pops the ball over the CB to the receiver.  Throwing to a receiver on a bubble screen/route is also common with this look.

Another way to read off the CB is to run an actual two-route pass concept off a run/pass read only.  For example, a QB could make a second level/LB read for run/pass.  If the LB bites on the pass, the QB pulls the ball, then reads the CB, and will throw one of the two routes based on his movements, just like a QB would do on any other designed quick pass.  

There are video examples of all of these types of RPO's in the article I linked here.  The credit here goes to /u/Downinthebend.  I found the article fascinating, and really simplified the concept of RPO's for me.  The lesson here is that RPO's are not universal, or fixed in terms of how you execute them.  You can run any run with almost any quick pass or quick screen concept, and choose to read any combination of one or two defenders you want.  You do not need a mobile QB to use RPO's either.

**BUT ILLEGAL MAN DOWNFIELD!**

The obvious rule issue here is linemen blocking downfield on the run.  Why is this never called?  Because offenses are using quick pass and quick screen concepts, the ball is usually thrown quick enough to where the linemen haven't gotten downfield enough for it to be a penalty, or a lot of times, referees simply don't catch it or piece what is happening together.  They know RPO's exist, but these plays develop so quickly they're near impossible to catch until after the ball has already been thrown.  The linemen are also far enough away from the pass concept that one cannot see both developing within the same field of vision, especially if they're on the field, and not up in a press box.

OK, there's that.  What other questions do you have?  Ask away!  They do not have to be about RPO's.

# Different Types of Run-Pass Options ""RPO's""

This was inspired by a fantastic article I read by /u/Downinthebend.  A lot of what I learned about RPO's came from this article, and it's a great beginner article to understanding them.  A lot of the terms I use will be used from this article too.

**[Article Link](https://www.18stripes.com/film-room-decoding-the-rpos-and-the-option/)**

Long story short, a run-pass option is exactly that, a play that can be a run or a pass based on reads the QB makes after the snap (you could also argue they include a read before the snap as well).  Basically, the O-line and the runningbacks will execute a running play, and the receivers will execute a passing play; usually a quick pass or quick screen concept.  RPO's dominate the college football landscape today, and there are teams like Auburn, Baylor, Ohio State, and Oregon, where pretty much every play is a RPO.

**Triple Option RPO**

This is what many think of when they hear of an RPO.  There are three choices for the QB: Hand off, keep and run, or keep and pass.  The keep/pass phase is like the keep/pitch phase of the inside veer used at Georgia Tech and the military academies.  The give/keep read is often a D-lineman, while the keep/pass read is a LB or rolled up safety.    

**LB read/2nd level read**

On these types of RPO's, the QB will read a linebacker and either hand off or throw the ball based on the LB's actions.  These are used a lot against defenses that use a six man box (with only five O-linemen blocking), or against a seven man box with only six O-linemen + TE/FB blocking).  The pass option will usually involve a route or concept that puts the designated LB in a strain, forcing him to either commit to the run or to the pass.  If the LB bites on the run, the QB keeps and throws the pass.  If the LB stays wide or is held in his place by the pass, the QB hands off.  A common pass concept for this is a slant by a slot receiver.  A slant by a slot receiver will attack the position of a LB, so if the LB vacates that area to defend the run, the slant should be open.  

**DB read/3rd level read**

These types of RPO's might be used more against an aggressive secondary (like Michigan State), or when the offense wants to strike big if they can't rely on the run.  The QB will key a DB, typically a run-support defender, and will give or pass based on his movements.  A good example of an aggressive DB is a safety in a cover-4 scheme.  Safeties are the run-force defenders, and because of the deep help from the CB's, cover 4 allows safeties to be much more aggressive against the run.  If the QB sees the safety fly upfield to stop the run, he will pull and throw the pass.  Seam and go routes are quite common here.

Another way to do it is to read the CB.  These ones are more common with triple option variations, where there's a run, keep and run, and keep and pass option.  The QB will make his give or keep read, and after he pulls the ball on a keep read, he will run to the alley.  If the CB comes off the receiver to get the QB, the QB pops the ball over the CB to the receiver.  Throwing to a receiver on a bubble screen/route is also common with this look.

6t9753,33,2017-08-12,"Forgive me, but I need to %&amp;#@ing rant..",Bananaman1229,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/6t9753/forgive_me_but_i_need_to_ing_rant/,"The title says it all.  I just got burnt by a company in the most dickish move I've yet to experience.  I finally might have been given the push I need to fold and look for work in some other industry.

Where to begin...

A little over a month ago, I was having lunch in a local taqueria after a morning of fishing (what else do you do when you're unemployed?).  I just so happened to be wearing one of my old USGS shirts that I got while I was interning for them immediately after I graduated.  A man in the restaurant saw my shirt, came over to my table, and started a conversation with me.  He introduced himself as an environmental consulting geologist and also mentioned that he too had an internship at the USGS when he was fresh out of school at the same office I had mine.  

Seeing that an amazing networking opportunity pretty much just fell into my lap, I casually worked the fact that I've been looking for work into the conversation.  The man (geology angel?) and I then agreed to meet up at a local brewery later in the week to talk about the industry and what possible opportunities there might be for me at the company he works for.  In the meantime, I decided to research as much as I could about the company since it was at first unknown to my ignorant self.

As I researched the company, I became more and more excited for my meeting with the geology angel at the end of the week.  I'm not going to name it, but the company is a pretty big international firm that is based out of Europe but operates pretty much everywhere and has many major contracts with extremely visible companies that we have no choice but to interact with in pretty much every part of our lives.  Needless to say, I was pretty damn excited.

When we met at the brewery we had a very lively and warm conversation.  He assured me that I would be a great fit at their office and that my experience and education would be more than qualifying for the entry level staff geologist positions that they fill.  He also explained to me that the company generally hires through employee references or in the case of entry level positions, campus recruiting.  He told me how much weight having someone from within the company pulling for you gives, and also that employees who bring candidates that are eventually hired receive additional compensation (I'm glad he was honest about this too).  At this point, I mentioned to him that I am willing to relocate to just about anywhere in North America (although admittedly my Spanish needs some work..).  He told me that being able to relocate would make me an even better candidate for his company than I already was, and to be sure to mention my willingness in the interview that he was going to arrange for me (wink wink).

The next work day, I received an email from the head of his office asking for my availability for an interview with herself and two of her clients.  We decided on lunchtime for the next day.

I arrived for my interview early and sharply dressed.  I was nervous, but this wasn't my first rodeo.  Thankfully I've had some less-important ones to practice with in the past.  
Now I'm not the most socially aware person on this Earth, although I can confidently say without a doubt that I absolutely killed this interview.  I was the best that I had ever been in such a situation, and was able to ask all of the right questions.  Near the end of the interview I mentioned that I am willing to relocate if necessary, to which the boss lady responded ""That won't be necessary. I think we three can all agree that you belong here"".  I had to contain my excitement for the remainder of the interview after hearing that line so to not let my joy leak out from my shit eating grin.  I was told that they have an entry-level staff geologist position in their office that they just created, and that they'd much prefer to fill it with the recommendation of a current employee.  We all exchanged our contacts, thanked each other, and went on our merry ways.

Right after the interview I called the geology angel and thanked him once again, and let him know that it went really well.  He too was excited, and informed me that he would keep his eyes and ears open and inform me on any progress.  Later that evening, I emailed the three people I interviewed with thanking them for their time and working in question about the company that I felt each one of them could personally best answer based on their experiences.  I also was emailed the formal application for the company that I could fill out and ""get the ball rolling"".  

Over the next week, my geology angel called me a few times and told me how often I came up in office conversation.  He even mentioned that during a conference call between his office and some of the other US locations, the boss lady I interviewed with mentioned how they have a great candidate that they are thinking about bringing in as a new staff geologist. 

After many months of frantically searching, networking, applying, and awaiting responses, I finally felt at ease.  I for the first time in almost a year had my optimism and faith restored.  I started to receive phone calls from their main US office in the midwest informing me that they were running my background and calling my references (one of my references even called me to tell me congrats for finally having someone bother him about his past interactions with myself XD).  All of this excitement culminated with an email from the boss lady informing me that within a week or two, they will tell me their final decision.  I thanked her once again, and told her that I would be eagerly awaiting her response.  In the meantime, I kept a questions and answers dialogue going with her two other colleagues that also sat in on the interview and continued to research more about the company.  

When the first week passed, I began to get nervous.  I called my geology angel to ask if he knew of anything.  He told me that everyone was still very enthusiastic about me, but that there was also a girl who just graduated from a local state university on their radar.  However, he reassured me that my qualifications, work and research experience, and GPA were all much more outstanding and that I shouldn't be concerned. 

Halfway through the second week, my nervousness turned into panic.  I wrote new emails to all three of the individuals that I interviewed with to re-inform them that I was still interested in the position.  By the end of the week, I had not received communication back from all of them.  At this point, I called each of their numbers during late business hours that Friday, and none of them answered.  I left a friendly and brief voice message for each of them hoping that at least one would return my call.

With the close of business hours on the next Monday (which was this last Monday), I was fucking devastated.  I had not heard anything back from these three professionals who had previously been more than eager to communicate with me.  I once again called my geology angel, and explained to him what I was experiencing.  He was shocked.  He told me that he would once again inquire about what was going on and get back to me.

This last Tuesday, I finally received some closure.  Near the end of the afternoon, I received an email as follows:
&gt;Bananaman1229, Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. We have filled the position with another candidate at this time. However, we &gt;were extremely impressed with you.  If you could continue to stay in contact with X, Y, and myself, we would like to talk with you again if &gt;another position comes along, if you are interested.

My first thought was to reply to them saying that their ""extreme impression"" of me won't fill mu fucking stomach, but I restrained myself.  I have not returned any communication to them since receiving that email.

Since the interview, I have been putting my life on the hold.  Yes, that was probably not a wise decision, but all of the positive reassurance that I received led me to believe that something should come of this.  I opted out of traveling with my family to go see the coming solar eclipse(which I have been super fucking excited about for the longest time) and also had to decline an invitation to one of my best friend's weddings in anticipation that I might be starting a new job near the middle of August.  This company strung me out long enough for me to miss out on two unrepeatable life events.

I seriously feel like they fucking ghosted me (look up the term if you're not a fellow millennial..).  Why I would receive so much positive feedback just to be shut down with a late and cold email is beyond my understanding.  At this point, I am so fucking done with trying to find a career in geology.  I have put myself out there so many times, followed the advice of this sub, and networked as much as I could in my small bumfuck nowhere town and beyond, and I have yet to land a job.  I guess I can keep working construction oddjobs on the side for some under the table cash to make ends meet.  This industry has time and time again let me know that I am not desired or hireable, and that there will always be that ""other candidate"" who arrives unexpectedly on a wave of apathetic disinterest. 

Find me in the welfare line.


TLDR: company told me they love me, ghosted me into nothing.

I’ve never gotten below a C in any accounting course and the only reason I ever got a C is because I skipped a lot in my early college years.  I’m now a senior at a state university with a good reputation for their accounting program.  Hopefully next summer I’ll be graduating, I say hopefully because I absolutely can’t stand going to dumb ass gen eds and my gpa shows it.  I’ve had a couple small accounting gigs, helping a local cpa during tax season, bookkeeping in the summer for a small manufacturing company, but I’ve never had an internship or worked in an actual firm.  I’m worried if I don’t find an internship over the winter break that my low gpa (2.6~) and only having a bachelors will make it very hard for me to land a decent job in a reasonable amount of time.  

Has anyone else ever had these same potential issues?  Not normally the type of person to get anxiety about the future, but I don’t know anyone else in my particular situation.  Most people I know that had lower gpas it was partly because of their accounting courses and they switched majors, or they have relatively good gpas and most people have had an internship by now. 

Any recommendation for getting a late internship?  Going the unpaid route isn’t really an option for me as I’m on my own with no financial help from my family.  Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR; don’t have a solid gpa and no internship, little experience in the field and hopefully graduating next summer.  Worried about job placement.  Looking for internship advice.  "

Possible labor law conflicts, raise issues etc.",Lame1Speed,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6tae20/feeling_really_jerked_around_by_my_employer_and_i/,"So I started working for a go-karting facility in Colorado with a similar name to my username back in May of 2016. It originally was meant to be a summer job, they started me at $9/hr while the minimum wage was $8.31. I took a leave of absence while I was up at school, found a different job, realized that one sucked and then went back to the go kart place since they paid more than minimum wage and worked there every other weekend until school was over, then moved my hours up to work every weekend since then.

Colorado passed a law raising the minimum wage up to $9.30 back in November. Everyone who worked there at the time went up to $9.30 on January 1st, but quietly the starting wage for both cashiers and track people went up to $9.50. That's right, some new guy would be making more than someone who had been working there for months.  Eventually through the course of me working there, the entire track staff turned over until it was the track supervisor (who had been there since it opened), me, and one other guy who was hired a few weeks after me who are the most senior members on the track. All employees receive an annual review on the anniversary of their start date. A PM track supervisor position has been open for awhile and would probably have been offered to me if I wasn't literally just about to graduate from college so instead it was offered to another guy. Track supervisors start at around $10.50.

Keep in mind, that review (including his review as well as a bunch of the cashiers) was done back in May. We have yet to hear anything back about any sort of raise whatsoever. It is not necessarily management at my facility's fault either, raises are approved by the regional manager (this place is a chain with over 35 centers in the US). Even my current manager had his review in February and still hasn't heard anything back from upper middle management. 

To top it all off, recently we had a special ""karting academy"" that took place well before we opened. I was scheduled to close the night before and didn't leave until 1 am and was then asked to open for the event at 7:30 am. I was told by one of the guys that this is against a federal labor law that states a service type employee cannot be scheduled for two shifts where the break inbetween the shifts is less than 8 hours but I haven't been able to find anything about this particular law (I haven't had a lot of time to look for it since I'm pretty busy). Anyways, I feel like I'm being pushed around a little even though I've worked here for a long time. The management at my facility is honestly pretty chill, its all upper management who has their heads up their asses. Luckily we will be getting a new regional manager soon and he will be visiting our center by the end of the month. I plan to have a seriously talk with him about how unappreciated me and a bunch of the staff feel. Most of the track staff at the moment are looking to leave as soon as they can anyways.

Is there anything I can say to kick these people in gear? I've been told by my manager we can ask for a retro payment of our approved raise for the time period between the review and when it goes into effect but that it is unlikely to happen. I don't really know how to go about talking to him about all these issues. Do I hold it over his head? I know lower employees never really have a lot of success pushing back against management, especially minimum wage slaves like us. All this nonsense has nearly burned me out on this job and I know for a fact the first question a lot of you will ask is, why not just leave? To be honest, I like the people I work with for the most part, my managers are the most chill people ever and overall, this job is not really all that difficult. Yeah, I should probably think about looking for a job in my field but I'm in a little bit of a limbo at the moment and won't be able to really start looking for a new change in employment for at least a few more months while I finish remaining school stuff (one more class and an internship).

TL;DR: Employer I've worked for a year and a half has not given me a raise, even though minimum wage went above what their previous starting wage was. I've been scheduled for shifts where I only have 6 hours in-between when I am supposed to be there. Upper middle management is changing soon and I am unsure how to go about asking for my rightful raise, whether I can hold the shift issues over their head, etc. "

May be I drove her away, with my constant demands for decency

I thought I was over her, until the other day

It all came down flushing, like a seasonal river

I miss, I truly miss

The way she loved me

More than anyone, how could it all just disappear?

Indeed, I was burdened 

Always seeking attention, she loves attention

She is an attention whore

She dresses so men can see her

She said, she wants a big car

So men could be intimated, by her status and big ass

Made me insecure, I was exhausted all the time

If a normal woman needs this size XX of approval

She requires this much XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

I loved her, but I wanted personal space

She was needy, needy all the time

She was an emotional vampire, now I know

She is taking blood, from another unsuspecting male

Many calls a day, too much talking 

I always knew, it would not last

I wonder why, it comes as a surprise

She flirts with men, many men

Sexual approval, from whomever 

Lowlife, but the higher the better

She lies and feels no guilt, she is impulsive and careless

She does not want to cook

I mostly made meals for us

She always want me to do staff with her, I feel suffocated

She has serious emotional problems

Once said she hates my sister, for no reason

She turns small issues into major conflicts, I don’t understand why

Days would go by

So why do I miss her?

She gave the best sex, sucked my dick

Fucked her from behind, loved that

She liked it, 

When I pulled my dick from her vagina so she can sack it and test her vagina

We’d do that several times in one session 

She ones asked me to fuck her in the ass

Was painful, we dint do it

She was a slut, but I wanted her that way only for me

I miss her because of the way she loved me

She would cry at a slightest hint of me leaving 

I broke it off three times

First time I found, she was still flirting with several men
 
Two months into our relationship

She would take calls, or make 

And talked with them suggestively, made me sick

Friends and neighbors wondered, what a slut I was dating 

I was furious; was beginning of distrust and my insecurities

She said she did not know, that it was wrong

She asked for forgiveness, I forgave her

Second time, she went on a road trip, lied she was home

They partied in clubs along the way, there were men in their company
 
She might have cheated, though she says she did not

But she must have, a woman who craves attention 

Can do anything to get it, especially from people

People she thinks are important, so she could feel important

She asked for forgiveness, I forgave

The third time, gave her money to pay for school

I have chipped in more than four times

Gave her my savings, so she could not miss a room
 
At the school campuses

She always kept her part of the bargain, I trusted her with money

This time, she was supposed to refund, as soon as her father can afford

She lied, paid half

Used the rest to buy me expensive gifts

Which I never use

She wanted to show me she loves me,

But she had broken a promise, not to lie

I dislike the way she lives, spends more than she can afford

What can she not do to sustain that lifestyle?

I ask, please answer me

I was furious, but I forgave her

There was a fourth time, we met after a very long time apart

She wanted us to spend time together, a lot more time

We had two days, before she could go back to school

We talked about everything, that evening

We made meals together, we got ourselves drank

We fucked, she likes it dirty 

I forgot to say, she would sometimes

Mourn louder, to make her neighbor friend jealous

I don’t understand, why women do that

Sex was awesome, let her do everything she likes

She likes sucking, she would say 

“Am not satisfied yet, I want to suck more”

She likes getting dick, the missionary style

She cums easily that way, that night twice

Also, she likes it from behind

And spreading her big ass

Wide and more wide open

So,

We talked more after sex, we slept

She likes being held, like a baby all night

If I dint, she would wake up annoyed

She wouldn’t talk to me the whole day

Also, when she farts in her sleep, she wakes up silent

As if it was me

She asked, if I was committed the next day

I said yes, but only for a little bit

It was important, work related 

She was angry, the entire day, I guess because we did not fuck in the morning 

I dint understand why

Am not very aroused in the mornings 

Like other normal men

When she was going back, we had a slight argument 

I was angry, at the way she had behaved

I said ‘I am not your servant’

She started crying, and that was it

Me and her was done

Did I mention how, she has a bad choice of friends?

Her friend, she used to visit

Was a career prostitute

One time, the prostitute was fucked while my girl was sleeping on the couch, still disturbs me

She had gone to visit her

Another time, she visited again in the morning

She found two guys, who’ve spend the night fucking the prostitute 

A threesome with a prostitute, how stupid can men be

They thought she was a prostitute too

I don’t blame them, what are you doing in a whore house if u not one?

Thy tried to initiate sex with her, they were touching her

I don’t know how far they went, I hate to imagine

Two men fucking my girlfriend

I asked her to end the friendship, she did

She got herself another whore friend, a policewoman

Working with the father, he is a policeman

She sleeps with anyone who cares to fuck her, she often told her

The men she is had sex with

I was disturbed at how she valued her friendship

All they talked about is sex with strange men

My girlfriend started calling her mother

The policewoman even attempted to introduce her to other guys

So they could fuck her too

I was disturbed, I asked her to end the friendship

It dint last, she got herself another friend

My brother’s ex-girlfriend

This one sleeps with older men for their money

I was surprised, she dropped her too

She had to

Then, during internship

She got herself a roommate

This one sleeps with anything every weekend

Does not care to even know their names

Two different men, every weekend

I was annoyed, I asked her why she chooses slut friends

A surprised me, she defended her strongly

She says she likes her friend, she doesn’t do what she does

See a trend here?

Birds of the same feather flock together

Show me your friends and I wil tell you who you are

Remember about lying?

She lied about going to a work event, to avoid meeting me

She was in party with her roommate

Am sure something happened there, made her feel guilty

I guess made her more willing to end the relationship

She had proven to herself that she is what I thought she was

But why am I so broken? Why am I so sad? She was a whore.

I should be happy she is gone

But am not 

I know why, I craved the love she gave me
 
The sex 

That I kept hoping she was better

But, here is the truth

Some women are whores by nature

Guess what she said, I was expecting her to be a different person

What she is was a whore

I was trying to make her a good woman

Or am I a control freak 

What is wrong with asking a woman you love to quit whore friends, stop lying, and be less needy?

Maan..She’s always been a whore. Why did I never see?

Why do I choose bad women…most of the times?

Does that says something about me?

Why do I have so much faith in people?

Say something, I am hurting. 

It hurts more knowing that I was right about her

But still wanted her

Her unconditional luv and great sex

Is what I want back 

What hurts more is that she moved on so quickly

Now clinging and fucking whomever she is fucking 

Like she used to do for me

Okay so I m took an internship at X company where I met my discerning catholic friend. We're both the same age, in college, and studying the same major(computer science). Over the course of our internship we got to know each other better and became really close. I have this strong feeling that he's attracted to me in more than a friendly way, but I can't pinpoint how I know. It's just a feeling I get from the way he acts around me and our past conversations/interactions. I'm very much attracted to him and would love to explore taking our friendship to the next level, the only problem is that he is very much committed to his faith. He is discerning and has previously said that he feels it was his calling to be a priest. I know with priesthood you can't have a wife, children, or girlfriends and you have to go to seminary school. Every time we're alone together or just hanging out I get that vibe he's attracted to me, I can see us dating, but I don't know if I should even bring up the topic because of what he wants to do with his life. How should I bring up the topic, or should I even try to? "

This was my first relationship ever and he ended it so many times. Let's start at the beginning. he sought me out and kissed me. He couldn't stop but spend all his time with me. Then it started to fade. He never really told me why but one day he stormed out of the apartment after a big fight and never came back. The next day he was begging for me back and I said okay lets start over slow. However, he continued to grow cold and distant. He always spoke harshly to me with no consideration for my feelings. Then he never wanted to do anything with me without fighting about it. Yet I loved him so much so I began to compromise. However, this turned into me demanding things of him as I franticly tried to keep hold of the relationship. When he moved to Belgium for a summer internship I had asked him to call me everyday just to chat. These soon turned into arguments as either a)he was extremely rude with ending the call b)he spoke harshly c)he would pass out and forget to call me for hours. I apologized for being overbearing and said I would work on it and yet he says such hateful things to me e.g. I am happy because I am not speaking to you. To be honest I don't think he loves me. It is dawning on me even more now. I found a past reddit post of his when he had broken it off and stormed off stating he wasn't attracted to me for x,y,z and yet he never mentioned this when he came back for me. I really need help because it is clear he doesn't love me truly as a person but I just can't move on. Please help me I was so loving and devoted myself to him completely and am just heart broken.

6tdawl,120,2017-08-13,[b/S] how my panty fetish turned into something more (update 4),sisterpantyfetish,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/6tdawl/bs_how_my_panty_fetish_turned_into_something_more/,"Sorry for the delay. I work at a hospital and things have been crazy with new interns running around. I'm doing this update from my phone so sorry in advance for any errors.


I left you guys last time having just been tricked by my sister Alex into coming into my mother's Panties. My sister just left my there shocked, but I can't say that I minded. It was incredibly hot and I was still high from my orgasm.


As I came down from it I started to realize I now had a pair of my mom's cum stained panties and I had no idea what to do with them. Did she get them from her panty drawer or from the dirty clothes hamper? Not knowing where I should put them, and not wanting to ask my sister so that I could keep an image of confidence, I decided I would through the panties in the wash with a load off my clothes to camouflage them. Once they were clean and dry I opted to putting them in the hamper. I figured that they would be more likely to go unnoticed there than if she saw them clean and folded in her panty drawer after knowing she had worn them.


I got a lot of messages asking for a description of my mom and I suppose this is an appropriate place as any for it. She is of middle Eastern decent, about 5'7"" and at the time of this happening was in her late 40s. I have a hard time estimating her weight because while she wasn't overweight by any means and she would power walk on the treadmill daily, she definitely was thicker in her thighs and ass. I would say her ass had a firm look to it but also had some chubbiness to it too. 


When I went to put her panties back in the hamper I was definitely caught off guard. Before getting to that, as an aside, I think i mentioned in an earlier post that despite my panty obsession I never went for my mom's and I'm not quite sure why. I think it's because I first noticed my fetish with my sister's panties and it was always more convenient sharing the hamper. Also, trying to sneak into her room which was right next to mine I only ever had to keep track of where she was. With my parents room it was on the other side of the house, so if either of my parents came home early they would likely see me walking across the hall and I would have to explain why I was in their room. My mother was always very conservative given her background. For example, she would wear a one piece in the pool with shorts on as to not show too much skin.


Now back to what you really care about. I was expecting to find some very conservative boring panties given how she would dress at the pool, but when I opened the hamper almost all of the panties were incredibly sexy! They were mostly black and pink with a mix of thongs and cheeky panties. Some were all lace and very revealing and others were more strappy and incredibly sexy. For the first time in my life I found myself fantasizing about my mom and what her ass would look like in some of these panties. What was Alex doing to me!?


Since I'm recalling all of these events years later, I could leave you all in suspense, but I'm going to go ahead and disappoint you right now by saying me and my mom never had anything remotely sexual happen between us. Bummer right? Actually not really. Despite the feelings that I started to develop I never really wanted to have a sexual relationship with her. I love reading the M/s stories on here, and I think it's incredibly sexy how tabboo they are, but I just never had that attraction to my own mother.


Now having said that, that doesn't mean I didn't take some time to enjoy myself. After all, a pair of panties feels good no matter who the owner is. I picked out a pair of light pink panties that looked like they would fully cover her front, and had 3 thin strings on each side which connected it to the back which was very skimpy and I imagine would only cover about a third of her ass. It was a very soft material and I remember looking at the tag being surprised it was nylon/spandex.


Even though I had just come a few hours prior, my teenage hormones were going crazy and before I knew it I was pitching a tent. I'm sure you can guess what happened from there so I won't bore you with the details...


Just kidding! I wrapped the panties around my dick and started stroking. I don't know if it was the taboo nature my using my mom's panties for the first time (ok second, but the first one didn't count because I had no clue it was hers while getting stroked) or just imagining the soft panties on her big ass but it felt like no time before I needed to come  I ended up coming into some tissues so I wasn't in the same dilemma I started with a pair of my mom's panties covered in my cum.


When I went to throw the tissues away I heard some rustling and freaked thinking my parents must have gotten home. I then noticed Alex standing there. I had no idea how much she saw, but it was pretty apparent she saw what mattered when she said ""tsk tsk little brother, I think mom's panties made you come faster than mine do. We'll have to see what we can do about that"""

I love the contrast between the two characters backgrounds, the difference between how they both think and act. Especially though I love the change in thoughts that go through her head, from shock and potentially disgust (or something similar) to eventually intrigue and more...


**Interview with a pornstar**

I roleplay as a fictitious male pornstar now going into more legitimate films. In this rp your character would either be a little shy and possibly nervous about meeting a man with that sort of a background or she would be entirely unaware of my previous employment (I could be going into legitimate acting and you are interviewing me regarding a new movie I am in).

Gradually, as the interview progresses you start asking me about my previous roles and experience, not quite realising what you are getting yourself into!


**Don’t talk to the neighbours!**

We've lived next door to you for a while and for as long as anyone can remember, we've butted heads with your parents. We were too loud, throwing parties two or three nights per week, music blaring, people shouting and likely plenty of drugs. They've called the cops on us a few times, but it seems we're pretty sweet with them too - if only your parents knew how and why! Naturally your parents have told you to stay away from us. You couldn't really figure out why, after all we seem really nice and always wave and say hello. We don't look strange - quite the opposite in fact, we're rather attractive; my wife a pretty and athletic brunette in her early twenties and me a tall, muscular guy in his early thirties. But being a good girl, you did as you were told. Keeping it to just a friendly smile and nod whenever you passed us.

So when your parents start to get really strict (whether it's over your grades/getting a job/your behaviour etc) and you want to get rebellious, there's an obvious place to go. I mean we're only next door, we seem like the kind of people to listen!

I mean, how are you to know that we're pornstars?

**A pornstar in the office!**

The office is generally very boring. People here don't hate Mondays because of the stress their job gives them. They hate Mondays because it's the start of another work week of mind melting monotony. Dull, tedious work that seems to transcend the very concept of time. 

But this week there's something new. Something different. A new starter who seems somewhat mysterious. He's tall, around 6'2 and while he's only averagely attractive with his blonde hair and beard, he's built like someone who would look more happy swinging an axe around on a battlefield somewhere. Broad shoulders, muscular arms and chest fill out his plain work shirt to the point of it stretching. While his plain black trousers must have been specially made to fit round thighs that more resemble tree trunks than legs. 

There's talk going around too, spreading through the air like a virus without a host. 

*'Former prisoner, 'once killed a guy'.*

*'Don't be silly, we don't hire ex cons. No, I reckon he's a failed sports star'*

*'Janine says he was in a couple of films'*

*'I've not seen him in anything! Are you sure?'*

*'That's because he was in porn. Hung like a gifted horse apparently!'*

*'No way! Bullshit!'*

*'why not send in the intern. Find out the truth!'*

The girls snigger before approaching you. You've not worked here long but all the time you've been dying to be brought into the circle of trust. It wasn't hard for them to get you to agree to do his induction...

((So I'm trying to set up a rather awkward interaction between my character, a former male pornstar who has taken to working in an office to try to get a real job. And your character, an innocent, naive intern who has very little sexual experience and would certainly never have watched porn))


**Celeb possibility!**

You're filming a new TV show/movie but you're co star is completely is completely unfamiliar to you.  Which is strange, because he seems to confident in front of the cameras and he says he's been in dozens of films before..

Kinks - huge cock, cock shock, heavy reluctance, being talked into it, slow, gradual corruption, facials, oral, rough sex, teasing"

I didn't pay attention to them and missed out on summer leadership which took place this summer for people in my grade. 

I go to Missouri state university, while the big 4 do come to our career fair I've seen many of my older friends get rejected because they have already filled their spots with students from other big universities like Mizzou and others. my questions are what can I do to get a chance at getting an internship with them if they don't recruit too much from my school? How do I overcome the fact that I didn't go to their summer leaderships since I've heard they hire a majority of students for their internships from there? And finally what are some tips that I should follow to increase my odds of getting an internship with them? 

Some background info, I've gotten A's in all of my accounting courses so far and have a really high gpa. I'm an officer in a business fraternity and very involved overall. How can I use this to stand out from the crowd? 

Any advice would be extremely helpful as I'm preparing for the career fair coming up. "

All you've ever known is prison, but soon you'll be freed in order to commit the crime that earns you a life sentence.",inkfinger,Inkfinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Inkfinger/comments/6teaf3/you_experience_time_backwards_all_youve_ever/,"One week until show time. 

It's not like he had a choice in the matter, the pull of the past was simply impossible to ignore. He's tried before, simply *not* doing whatever thing his fellow inmates told him he had done. Shank his cellmate, brawl with the guards, try to escape - there were countless times he could test it. Each time, when the moment came, he'd tried to not act on it. Just for fun, just to see what would happen.

Would time collapse? Would the world stop spinning on its axis, the future crumble in on itself? After all, he still existed somewhere, right? In the future he had lived, he existed. If he didn't complete some pivotal past moment, maybe he would disappear altogether. Escape the prison in a way no-one else had ever attempted. Escape the Earth.

But each time, his feet had moved of their own volition, his hands had grasped their weapon of choice, his body knew what it had to do as the links of the past fell in place. 

It was an almost religious experience. Lately, each time he completed a piece of the past, he caught a glimpse of serene, silent surroundings, of angels dressed in white. His ultimate future, perhaps? If he could travel back in time, maybe he could see the future as well. It made sense, didn't it?

And soon, he would see how he had earned his nickname: 'Can't Stop' Calum. For the words he'd repeated over and over, when the police found him standing over the ruined bodies of a family of five, raving where he stood drenched in blood.

*I can't stop. Can't stop.*

Time seemed to speed up in the last week, each hour building momentum, each second disappearing faster than the one before, as if he were running to meet the past. 

Here he was being taken to jail. An interrogation with two grizzled policemen, where he sat silently, staring at the wall. Here were his hands, covered in blood, five bodies scattered like broken dolls around his feet. Here he was slitting their throats, a nameless family who didn't know why they had to die. Truth be told, he didn't either. But he wanted to offer them some word of explanation.

""I can't stop,"" Calum said, the only words that he could find. ""Can't stop.""

But it was right, he knew. For the world was suddenly blinding white, and he could see the angels welcoming him home. Perhaps this wasn't a glimpse of the future, but of the past. If he went back far enough, he would meet them. 

The message couldn't be clearer: this was right. 

He was screaming the words now, shouting his explanation so they would know. He grasped the angel's arm.

""I can't stop,"" he pleaded, looking into her eyes for understanding. Blue, almost human-looking eyes.

""Yes, I know,"" she sighed, and plunged something into his arm. The world went mercifully dark, and he stepped into the void with a smile, the sight of her white robes still fixed in his mind's eye. 

--------------

The intern was staring at her with wide eyes. ""You let him *touch* you. Isn't he dangerous?""

"" 'Can't Stop' Calum?"" Nurse Alison Warren said, smiling at the girl. ""They brought him here a few years ago, when he wouldn't stop muttering that sentence in his cell. We took the restraints off after a while. Never harmed me yet, he seems to like it here. Just sedate him when he gets too loud for the others, ok?""

6tfm3a,112,2017-08-13,Pamela Lynn Neal: bank teller missing since 1983,RockerChik94,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/6tfm3a/pamela_lynn_neal_bank_teller_missing_since_1983/,"Pamela Lynn Neal was born on July 18, 1960 and graduated from Cherry Creek High School in 1978. After high school, she attended Western State College at Gunnison before heading to Alaska for a year, where she photographed the wilderness. After Alaska, she went to Maine with her parents and returned to Colorado a short time later where she landed a bank teller job with Key Savings and Loan, 3501 South Broadway in Englewood.

On March 31, 1983, Pamela left work on a lunch break at 1:30 p.m and walked two blocks east to another bank to cash a check. She took out several hundred dollars and stuffed the wad of money into her coat pocket. Afterwards, she stopped at a Safeway grocery store where she bought a lottery ticket, a pack of Winston cigarettes, and a delicatessen lunch.

Pamela walked to her third-floor apartment at 9 Hamden Avenue, which was across the street from Key Savings and Loan, to eat her lunch before heading back to work. She did not own a car. When Pamela did not return to work, her co-worker and roommate Darlene Heintz, called the apartment at 2:30 p.m. When there was no answer, Darlene walked to the apartment. Darlene later told police that she saw Pamela walking towards their apartment. Pamela was also seen by one other witness.

When Darlene arrived, the entrance door was ajar. Darlene called her boss who then called police.

Police arrived at the apartment and also found the entrance door ajar. When they walked in, Pamela’s lunch – a piece of friend chicken and a macaroni and cheese side dish – sitting in an unopened bag on the coffee table.

Pamela’s shoes were under the coffee table and her keys were on the floor. She usually tossed the keys onto a chair.

The lottery ticket she purchased at Safeway was still inside her wallet in her purse, which was next to the coffee table. Pamela had not scratched off the lottery ticket, and the unopened pack of Winston’s and another half a pack, were left behind.

There were no signs of a struggle; however all signs pointed toward an abduction. Neighbors did not see or hear anything unusual, and a thorough search of her apartment turned up no evidence into her disappearance.

Despite a massive search and investigation into Pamela’s abduction, she was never found. However, her case is listed as a homicide, not a missing person’s case.

Pamela Lynne Neal was described at the time of her disappearance as 5’4″ tall, weighing 105 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes.

A couple theories emerged into Pamela’s disappearance.

The main one is that someone followed Pamela into her apartment, kidnapped her, and then forced the young woman down two flights of stairs.
The other theory is that Pamela ran down to get her mail and someone grabbed her there.

Englewood Attacks
Nine months after Pamela’s disappearance, 17-year-old Melissa Lou Chase was found beaten to death under a bridge in Englewood on December 8, 1983. Her live-in boyfriend was the one who found her body. He was never named in news reports. The last time Melissa had been seen alive was around 5:30 p.m. the night before, after she finished her shift at Phillips 66 service station at Union Avenue and Broadway.

Three years before Pamela disappeared, 21-year-old Helene Pruszynski was found murdered on January 18, 1980. She was nude below the waist, and her hands were bound behind her back. She had been raped repeatedly and stabbed nine times in her back.

Pruszynski had established a pattern in which she would leave work at the radio station at 16th and Broadway in Denver and catch a bus at around 6:10 p.m. at Broadway and 14th Avenue. She would ride south until she got off at South Broadway and Union Avenue (Mitchell).

Like Helene, Melissa was found nude below the waist, although there was no evidence of sexual assault. Melissa had also disappeared the night before her body was found.

Two weeks before Helene was murdered, another young girl had been sexually assaulted after getting off a bus on South Broadway .

In March 1968, Constance Marie Paris, 18, had also been attacked, sexually assaulted and strangled. She went missing after getting off a bus at South Broadway and Girard Avenue. Her body was found days later in southwest Denver.

The main suspect in Helene’s case is Kenyon Battles Tolerton. He is currently incarcerated for the 1993 rape and murder of a 14-year-old. He was considered a person of interest in Pamela’s case until investigators discovered he had been in prison for another crime at the time of her disappearance.

If you have any information in this case, please call the Englewood Police Department at (303) 762-2460.

The first thing that stood out for me in Pamela’s case was the wad of bills Pamela stuffed into her coat pocket. If someone at the bank saw her do this, he could have followed her home with the intent to rob her but ended up taking her to either rape or kill her or both. There was no mention of this money after she disappeared which tells me it disappeared with her.

The person could have been known to Pamela and knew her daily routine. He would know when she left to go to lunch and would also know that she went home to eat it.

Pamela’s lunch, keys, and shoes were there so we know she made it inside her apartment. The abductor most likely let himself in or knocked on the door and forced his way in. No signs of a struggle but her family stated she would not have resisted.

There was also no evidence found inside Pamela’s apartment so the crime most likely did not happen there. Her abductor must have taken her elsewhere immediately.

From what I understand, Hamden Avenue was and is a very busy street, so I am amazed that someone was able to kidnap her without anyone noticing. I’m thinking she willingly went with him, hoping that might help in her safety. I’m sure he had a weapon and that alone would probably keep her compliant.

There are many similarities between Pamela and Helene’s case. Both girls were in their early 20s with brown hair and both disappeared at or near their homes. They were around the same height and weight, too. However, Helene disappeared at night and Pamela in broad daylight. Police also think Tolerton killed Helene, but there is a chance he did not, and that another sexual predator was roaming the streets of Englewood in the 1980s.

While I think it’s a little possible that Melissa’s case is also related, I am under the impression that her boyfriend was a person of interest. It really makes the most sense in her case. However Melissa worked at a gas station at the same intersection Helene would have stepped off the bus from to go home – Union Avenue and South Broadway. This intersection is only about two and a half miles from Pamela’s apartment.

Is it possible that Melissa’s boyfriend killed her, Pamela and Helene? Maybe Melissa found out about Pamela and Helene so he killed her. There was no sexual assault on Melissa. She was beaten viciously – kicked in the head – and that sounds more domestic and/or personal to me. Maybe she threatened to go to the police.

Tolerton does seem like a good suspect in Helene’s case but he was imprisoned at the time of Pamela’s disappearance. Those two cases are too similar to rule out a connection, in my opinion.

Here's the Denver post article on the case: http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2014/08/09/englewood-2/9115/

What do you think happened to Pamela Lynn Neal?"
6tfr9t,4,2017-08-13,Wife and I got into wreck with both of our cars and another individual. Looking for general thoughts and advice for our unique situation.,MavFFL41,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6tfr9t/wife_and_i_got_into_wreck_with_both_of_our_cars/,"Yesterday, my wife and I were in the process of moving out of the city we had been in for my summer internship. While leaving, we got into a 3 car accident. My car hit a stranger's car in front of me, and I think it could be characterized as a fender bender. He had mild damage. My wife on the other hand, hit my car from behind pretty hard. My car has some damage to the back (broken taillight, trunk is bent), but her car, I'm fairly confident, is totaled. It's only worth about $2,500.

We have collision coverage on my wife's car, the one that is likely totaled. We only have liability on my car.

What is normal car insurance protocol when two cars on the same insurance policy are involved in the same wreck? Is the insurance company likely to still give us the value of my wife's car?

I thought about talking to the person that I hit and asking if we could just pay the cost of the repaired without involving insurance. However, I also feel it may be necessary for him to corroborate our story so that the insurance company doesn't think we're just trying to take advantage of our insurance.

Let me know if there's anything missing. Would love to hear your thoughts about this situation if you're familiar with how car insurance works or you've been involved in something similar."
6tfsox,6,2017-08-13,My GF [22] of 8 years broke up with me [23M],ferrago,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tfsox/my_gf_22_of_8_years_broke_up_with_me_23m/,"We started dating 8 years ago 6/12/09. The first three years of our relationship were up and down, we were both kids and kids do stupid things. There was cheating on both sides, secrets kept, secrets discovered. Never did I think back then we would make it this far.

5 years ago, I started college, and the first year of college was different. I was out from under my parents, but she always remained my first priority. I still did stupid things, I broke promises (not cheating, but still promises) but we stayed together. 

4 years ago we started living together. Our relationship wasn't perfect, but as close as anyone's. I have never been happier. Of course we argued from time to time, but not anything serious. I can honestly say for the first time I started realizing how serious it was between us. I was going to fight tooth and nail to ensure we stayed together.

She graduated last May, I took her on a cruise as a present. We were as close as we had ever been. I had a ring ready, I was going to pop the question in the fall. The plan was set, everything was ready. Then I started my internship in DC, and everything was still fine, we missed each other and I could tell she missed me. Then she moved to Arkansas to start her job. Her first ever job, her first time with her own money not relying on me or her parents, her first time alone. I figured that her anxiety would take over and she would freak out. It was hard because we didn't know where she would end up, and that makes it hard for me to locate jobs near where she would be. So in turn hard to plan for us to be together. 

As time passed she stopped texting me as much, she stopped telling me she missed me, we stopped talking on the phone, we didn't FaceTime at all. I could tell something was wrong because the 8 years we spent together it was never like that. If we spent a few hours apart she would miss me and want to talk. So it was easy to notice. 

I began freaking out a bit, I could tell something was wrong, which led to me questioning her and kind of just breaking down, I didn't know what was happening, but she assured me and assured me that everything was fine she was just getting into the flow of a new job. And trying to explore and embrace it all. So I calmed down and backed away giving her her space. She ended up getting a job an hour away from our hometown. So this was an extremely happy thing for me. It meant she was close to family, it meant I could see her easily enough during my last semester of school. But nothing changed. I stayed back and let her keep her space.

I came back to town on Friday. She called me that morning and made plans to come back to town yesterday morning so we could see each other. It had been three months since we had seen each other. The longest time in 8 years that we had spent apart. So I was ecstatic when I got that call. Saturday came around, I went to her parents place where she was supposed to be coming. She gave me the impression that we would be spending the night there so I grabbed some clothes and all. Well she kept getting delayed in coming down, and it was almost 6 when she finally got there. 

She pulls up, and I have a present for her,  I hand it to her and go to give her a hug and she walks past me to the house. So I follow her in, I find her in her room crying. I ask her what is wrong, and she just keeps shaking her head and crying. She finally says that she thought this would be easier. And I know what is happening, the thing I was fearing the last three months is coming true. She is breaking up with me. I ask her why and she said that she had been enjoying her freedom and being alone, and that she wouldn't be happy being held down by me anymore. So I walk away. She didn't try and stop me. 

I drove for a while, I finally came to the most cliche spot I could think of, hoping the most cliche thing would happen. I went to a waterfall, that had played an important roll at several points in our relationship. I sat there for ever  just hoping she would pull up and one of those stupid movie moments would happen. But those are just movies right? 

So I have been struggling, trying to hold myself together. It hasn't even been 24 hours but I'm trying to make sense of what happened, what changed things. She has text me wanting to figure things out about all of the financials since everything is pretty much linked. I just don't want to do anything and I am really struggling. I came here just hoping throwing everything out there would in some way help me wrap my head around it all for myself. 

tl;dr: my gf of 8 years ended it because she wanted freedom. I am posting this to help myself wrap my head around it all. "

TL;DR: I will break up with her and it will totally crush her and possibly derail her life.

We have been together for almost 5 years now but I don't see any future with her. The problem is that she seems to be totally blind to the problems of our relationship, and wont stop talking about children and marriage. Every conversation we have will sooner or later involve her/our future together, and every time Im reminded that she is not the one for me. 

She just thinks about life so differently than I do and has hopes and dreams that I don't think can coexist with my own.

We haven't seen each other for a few weeks now (I'm doing an internship in a different city and every ""I miss you"" and ""can't wait to see you again"" text is killing me, like literally making my body hurt. 

She will have important exams next months and I thought I could at least pretend everything is fine until those are done but I can't do it, I dont want to lie to her and I just need to get it over with. There were several times in our relationship were I almost broke up with her but couldn't do it because I was scared and every time was ten times worse than the one before. In between these times of hardship the relationship was ""fine"" but monotonous and frankly, boring. I was always hoping for a big fight or something that would make breaking up and beeing blunt and honest easier but I now realize there wont be any ""perfect breakup moment"" It will always cause pain.

I'm incredibly bad at talking about my feelings and her beeing a very different person doesn't help I know I will never be able to convey my emotions and their reasons to her and will probably say things that are incredibly hurtful to her. I don't want to leave her alone in this very stressful time of her education, but I can't do this to myself any longer. 

How do I deal with this? should I end it now or wait for a better moment to break up. Im afraid there wont ever be a good moment and I will be stuck in this situation for a long time."
6tgo4u,2,2017-08-13,Am I [28F] crazy for thinking that my long distance BF [32M] will get it together and become a trustworthy person? Is it time for me to give up on this?,McComplicated,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tgo4u/am_i_28f_crazy_for_thinking_that_my_long_distance/,"Super long story, sorry, it’s been a complicated year. Skip to TLDR if you’d like.

I met E about a year and a half ago. We started dating, knowing that he would be moving across the country in 8 months after completing residency. We just took it one day at a time, and ended up falling in love and building what looked to be the start of an amazing relationship. It was a difficult plan to end up together. Basically, I would match to a residency program somewhere in the country, and then he would finish his fellowship and attempt to get a job in the same city (which could be difficult given his sub-specialty training).


The distance was hard. A 5 hour flight, 3 hour timezone difference, the stress of med school and fellowship, and two different communication styles all made it very challenging. But I arranged to do a month long course in his city so that I could live with him for a month (after about 3 months of distance with a couple weekend visits). In the two months leading up to my month in his city, things got weird. The communication dropped a lot, he was unavailable for unexplained amounts of time, and stories weren’t matching up. 


So I talked to him about it. I actually suspected that there was something emotional going on between him and a specific woman in his life. I was very candid, apologized for being insecure and promised to work on it, and asked if there was anything going on with this woman. He reassured me that they were just friends, and we had a long talk about appropriate boundaries with the opposite sex. 


Then, just a day later, another story didn’t add up. And, I’m not proud of this, but he left his phone when he went back to work that night, and I snooped for the very first time. And that’s when I found out that my wonderful, thoughtful, sincere, too-good-to-be-true, boyfriend had met a woman on Okcupid 6 weeks after he moved, and he had been dating her for about 6 weeks. Sex and everything. He came home and we had it out, lots of crying. His explanation was that he was lonely, and he didn’t want to hurt me. So he kept going along with the plan while getting his needs met. 


So he rented me a studio apartment for the rest of the month. I had intended on breaking it off entirely, but unfortunately, we started seeing each other again. I know that was weak, but I couldn’t help thinking he was the best person for me. He is the best travel partner I could imagine, he has taught me to sail and rock climb, and he enriches my life in so many ways. So we kept seeing each other, but weren’t “together” for a time. We went to China, I visited him a couple times during my interview travels, and we spent NYE together. I loved seeing him and being with him, but we decided to break it off after the NYE trip because it was unsustainable, with me wanting more. Basically, throughout all of this, he has maintained that he wants to get a job in my residency city, and then we can work on going from there. But the distance combined with the uncertainty in the meantime, is too much for him to handle. 


I found out where I would be going for residency, and told E. It’s a city with a competitive market, but he said he was still committed to trying his best to get a job there. He asked me to go sailing for a week in Italy, and I agreed to it. In Italy, I told him I wanted to be together or not do this at all. It turns out that he had started seeing a friend with benefits, and he liked this situation of having a fwb and having something more serious with me. In a way, I understood because I had enjoyed my own fwb in that time, all while still planning to be with E. So I suggested that we attempt an open relationship. We talked about boundaries, and he agreed. 


It was hard, but I was getting through it. An opportunity came up for me to spend a month in his city before starting my internship, and we were also planning a vacation. I said that I would come spend the month with him if he agreed to not see his fwb for the month, and he agreed. When I got there for the month, I was feeling really insecure, I think just realizing how hard the open relationship was for me. Also, he wasn’t feeling sexual, and we were hardly having sex, so that was really difficult for me. But I felt comforted that he was willing to give her up for an entire month. He had a busy call weekend coming up, so I arranged to take a 5 day hiking trip on my own. I made him promise before I left that he wouldn’t see her. I came back from my trip, and asked again if he had seen her - he said no. 


Fast forward 6 weeks, and he is visiting me for the weekend. I had a moment of weakness - his laptop was unlocked, and I wanted to check and see if he really didn’t see her that weekend. Unfortunately, the night before I left for my weekend trip, he texted her and asked if she wanted to get dinner. Then he took her sailing a couple days later. Then to brunch on another day. He saw her three times while I was on my weekend away (which I took because he was going to be so busy on call). I was devastated, but not super surprised. 


I confronted him. He was upset about me snooping. And then upset because I was breaking up with him. I offered him an ultimatum - stop seeing her and be monogamous while he figures the job search out over the next few months. And he said he couldn’t do it. After extensive discussions about how I’m so special, she doesn’t mean anything to him, and how he had already prepared several CVs to send to private practices, we ended up not breaking up. What is really upsetting, is that he doesn’t even really remember betraying me that weekend. I made him read the texts, and now he says, “I guess it’s a bit more than I had rationalized.” 


We are going on an international trip next week (we had already booked tickets before he visited me and this all came out). I just feel very conflicted. On one side, I feel like he is such a great match for me and he adds so much to my life through travel and adventure, but on the other side, I don’t know how I can ever trust him even if he does get a job in my city and we move in together. He’s so private, and I don’t see him ever giving up access to his phone, and I don’t even really want access (I’m very aware that I’ve got a snooping issue at this point). Part of me wants to wait it out and see if he follows through and actually gets that job. And if he doesn’t, I can just move on. I could walk away now, but I feel like I’ve already put so much work and effort into this. It’ll probably be about 4-5 months before his job search is finalized. I used to be so optimistic, and now I feel like all humans are so flawed that relationships don’t really matter. I feel like I can’t get excited about anyone, including him, for fear of being let down.


Has anyone been in something similar that is difficult to walk away from? Anyone ever been with someone who has shown a pattern of lying who was able to get better and become trustworthy?


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I am currently in a long distance open relationship with someone who cheated on me a year ago, and recently violated a clear boundary in our open relationship. He says he’s committed to this working out, but I’m starting to wonder if I will ever be able to trust him, even if we do close the distance and go monogamous again. Have you ever had a partner with a pattern of lying who was able to become a better partner?

6tgqff,1,2017-08-13,Recommendations for a binary classifier against pictures of people,Valiox,MLQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions/comments/6tgqff/recommendations_for_a_binary_classifier_against/,"I've been using caffe at my internship for a little while and I wanted to fiddle around with it at home as well in order to learn more. I got in mind to train a binary classifier on pictures of people. I've labeled 3000 + 200 pictures (train + test) with binary features: male/female (sorry tumblr), glasses/no glasses, facial hair/no facial hair and hat/no hat. 

I've been trying to train lenet and alexnet from scratch with binary output on a single feature at the time. As I feared, they both overfit very easily, even with heavy reductions of the number of outputs on each layer. The accuracy on the test set barely makes it above 60%.

First of all, I expect that you're going to tell me that my dataset is too small. But I doubt I could go for more than 10k, considering how much manual work that is for me (and I'd like to use the dataset I made rather than downloading prelabeled pictures). Secondly, I'd like recommandations for the model. I believe fine-tuning is in order?"

My gf is gorgeous and sweet but also very hotheaded. She can be quite a handful sometimes but it's nothing I can't handle. Normally she's a relaxed and fun person however  lately she's become an absolutely annoying brat. 

Nowadays we're both very busy. She's busy with college/work placements and I have a very demanding internship at a large company. Gym and sports also takes up a lot of our free time. We're both quite stressed at the moment and when we come home we're usually exhausted and don't really do much together before going to sleep. We haven't had sex in almost two weeks now which is very unusual because we used to have sex twice a day, everyday. 

My issue is that these days she tries very hard to find mistakes in whatever I do. She starts arguments over the smallest things and when I tell her to calm down she gets even angrier. Just yesterday when we got home we had another argument and she slammed the door in my face. When she came out again she just nagged again and glared at me. 

When she gets mad she starts clapping her hands after every word and raises her voice to the point of yelling at me. She doesn't allow me to get a word in at all. It's very annoying and I usually stay quiet and wait til she's finished. However when I don't respond she mistakes this for weakness and calls me a ""pussy"" and a ""little bitch"" for not defending myself. She also starts pushing me and punching my arm or chest. It's ridiculous because she's only 5'2 and I'm a lot bigger than her. I just want to grab her little body and push her to the side whenever she starts acting like a rabid chihuahua. 

How do I resolve this? Has anyone here been in a similar situation?

6th307,4,2017-08-13,Interested in Cybersecurity?,Marv20,Hoco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hoco/comments/6th307/interested_in_cybersecurity/,"If you are interested in a career in Cyber I have listed some advice below. Our area has many great resources available that people don't take advantage of. 

1. Create a LinkedIn page and use this to your advantage. Uploading any courses or community service you have done that relate to Cyber.
2. Look into getting some certifications. CompTIA A+ is a good place to start. They have others, but A+ will be the best one for breaking in.
3. If you haven't already signed up for a library card you need to. It is free and they have great resources to help for certifications or just computers in general. The card will also give you access to online learning sites like Lynda.com.
4. If you are in high school look into taking the Cybersecurity academy at the ARL. Your guidance counselor will be able to give you more information it or you can look in the course catalog. 
5. If you are in college or high school look into applying for an internship at the John Hopkins APL in Laurel. 
6. It is also a good idea to look into taking some courses on sites like udemy.com, cybrary and lynda.com.
7. Partaking in capture the flag events are also a great way to test and gain new skills. They usually have specific dates and you have to sign up for them. One annual one is PicoCTF which is in April I believe."
6thnz2,12,2017-08-13,My family is gaslighting me and I feel like I´m going insane,SonOfaGun01,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6thnz2/my_family_is_gaslighting_me_and_i_feel_like_im/,"I have been arguing with my family constantly since I have gotten into college (I still live my parents, so I am not far away). Once I became mature enough to realize that my family is seriously dysfunctional I began speaking out, but every time I do they somehow blame me. If something happened, they didn't do it, if they did it, I'm overreacting, If I'm not overreacting, I should ignore it and get over it, etc... I think this is called the narcissist prayer. Anyway, I have been the scapegoat of my family for as long as I can remember. My brother has conversely been the golden child. I am two years older than he is, and when I got into high school I told him that he should try to go to a different school because I knew that he needed a really structured, yet rigorous school, while I thrived in a loosely structured but still rigorous environment. My parents and brother told me that I didn't love my brother and just wanted to be away from him. Turns out I was right though, because he had a meltdown in my school and literally stopped going for months because he didn't get straight A's. After this he dropped out of high school, my parents paid for online schooling which he pretended to do, and about a year after they found out he finally went to get his GED. After this he was handed an internship at the school (which is required on the school's part) and as been working a part time job there for about a year, while living with my parents. My parents do not provide incentive for him to either work full time or move out, and he spends all his job money on clothes and games, watches sports and YouTube all day, and to top it off gets season tickets for free from my dad for his favorite team. He turns down jobs that my family members offer him and my parents are fine with it, so fine in fact that they are spending thousands of dollars to redesign his room to look like a sports stadium. Meanwhile I am left with college debt and constantly ridiculed for aspiring to become both a writer and a teacher. My brother is extremely disrespectful to my mother and I, and whenever I point it out my parents flip out on me, saying that it's none of my business and that I always make a big deal. Every time I try having a serious conversation about any of this or about any of the emotional abuse that my parents caused me growing up (my mom taught me to never express my feelings to others in order to keep up appearances and my father forced me to like sports and cars because I'm a boy, and boys like sports and cars) I am blamed for overreacting. I recently told my father that I wanted to talk about my brother's behavior because I found out that he turned down a good job offer because he wanted to relax over the summer, and I told him that I wanted to talk about the serious double standard that he has between my brother and I, and first he said that it was okay that he turned down the job, and second he left because he wanted to see if there was good fishing today. I told him that I think it's more important to talk and that if he leaves he is choosing fish over talking to his son, and he just left. I want to talk about the fact that my father was never there for me or about the fact that my mother will literally change facts around moments after they happened, or that my brother is manipulating all of them into just relaxing for years while also disrespecting them, but every time I do everyone blames me. I called my grandfather, letting him know that I can't handle it anymore and that I'm thinking of taking some time away from my family, and he immediately told me that I was overreacting before even hearing what happened. He then suggested that I just let everything slide, and ignore everything, which I can't do while also being mentally sane. Thank you for reading this, I know it was long. I just didn't know how to condense it. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Feel free to ask any questions you might have, and again, thank you for taking the time to read."
6thyid,4,2017-08-13,Wanting to do a UX Design internship next summer. Is it possible?,Sonderence,userexperience,https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/6thyid/wanting_to_do_a_ux_design_internship_next_summer/,"I am a third year student majoring in management information systems. My original plan was to do a business analysis internship next summer, but about a month ago I heard about UX design and found out that it's something I would much rather do, since it's a mix between a technical role and psychology. 

I took a course on coursera called: introduction to user experience design and liked it, although it was very basic and short. I've looked at the interaction design 8 course specialization and it seems like completing it would give me the knowledge to apply for internships, but it looks like it will take a long time to complete. 

All I have under my belt is basically that coursera course and a few psychology courses I've taken. Is it impossible for me to get a UX design internship without the knowledge to present a portfolio on my resume? If so, does that 8 course specialization enough to land one and does anybody know how long it will take? I want to start applying as soon as possible.

I don't want to take the risk of delaying applying for internships in user experience if it's impossible and could just be applying for business analyst roles right away. If it's too late to go for a UX design internship, I'll just cut my losses and try to learn enough to get an entry level job after I graduate. Will having only a BA internship will hurt me in that case? "
6tiowm,3,2017-08-13,m4f mom and dad behaving badly,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6tiowm/m4f_mom_and_dad_behaving_badly/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.


2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.


3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.

5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters.


I'm happy to substitute step-siblings or parents if your prefer to play that way.

My girlfriend will almost certainly be going to North Carolina State University, Raleigh for graduate school after we both get our undergraduate degrees. We go to the same school here in California and will graduate at the same time.

Our plan is to move there together and for me to get a job while she continues school for ~6 years to get her PHD. We can live there together in a 1-bedroom (we have done so already). I was not able to get any internships thus far and I do not have any work experience beyond what I have done in school.

I don't have any student debt but she does (28k). She will get a stipend of 20k per year, insurance, and free tuition. I do not think I will be covered by her insurance, atm I am still on my parent's insurance. I have an old car and my parents are paying for its insurance currently. The entry level pay for Computer Engineering is 70k per year afaik. She has 2k in savings. I have about 50k in savings; It's split between 20k in a stock account, 20k in a secure deposit, and ~10k in my bank. I was planning on using part of it for a house down-payment.

Can anyone offer me advice on how much it costs to live in Raleigh, any advice on getting a job there, or advice about moving off and starting a life with your SO as a young adult?

If you need more information to be able to help just let me know. Thank you!"
6tjal4,77,2017-08-13,The Highs and Lows of a NASCAR Race Team - A Blog by a NASCAR Crew Intern,Carbinkz,NASCAR,https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/6tjal4/the_highs_and_lows_of_a_nascar_race_team_a_blog/,"Imagine entering into your dream job on the first day, knowing that this is what you've been wanting to do since you were born.

Those were my sentiments as I took my first steps into the shop floor of NASCAR Xfinity Series team SS Greenlight Racing two months ago, starting a Summer internship as I had just graduated high school, and would be starting college soon after the Summer sun faded away.

Of course, that wasn't all that was fading away.

Soon into the first day, I saw the struggles of working for an underfunded race team, having to re-use parts off of cars that had just raced the week before, struggling to find that oil line spending an hour and a half looking through the parts room, going bald looking for a single piece of tungsten to put into the car.

While interning at Greenlight, it gave me an eye-opening look at how a ""backmarker"" team operates. However, even though there were days where I would go home soaked in gear oil and degreaser, I couldn't help but leave each day with a smile on my face, looking forward to learning even more the next morning.

As I traveled in the company to my first race with the team at Daytona for the Coca-Cola Firecracker 250, I felt jitters knowing that I was here, accomplishing my dream at only 18 years old. Of course, there were a few colorful characters I was working with that made each day delightful.

I don't know if it was my résumé, or the fact that I picked up the skill of card counting fairly quickly (I was never taken to a casino, so no illegal/immoral acts were committed), but crew chief Ken Evans entrusted me each weekend to act as his race engineer, calculating fuel mileage and determining race strategy. I guess my expectations came out pretty damn high when we came out of Daytona with double Top 15's, one of which was a Top 5.

As the weeks went by, I started not only acclimating myself to the Greenlight environment, but people were noticing my performance and my network was building. I was able to interact with many of the engineers/specialists from Richard Childress Racing, Chip Ganassi Racing, Team Penske, and even rekindling some old bonds with my friends from Leavine Family Racing.

My takeaways from the NASCAR scene are that everybody's a family and everybody works together because there's simply one thing that ties everybody together: a love for racing. Even when you know your car can probably only run as good as 30th, and you're rushing to fix an issue like a leaking fuel pump or some bent-in sheet metal right in the crush panel area that was giving you a real hard time getting you through templates, you still keep pushing forward due to the passion and dedication to the sport which you love so much.

If I have any advice to give, it's to not be afraid to take that chance that'll lead to a huge opportunity. I didn't think that, at 18 years old and straight out of high school, any NASCAR team would let me intern with them. But I still took the chance and e-mailed my résumé to about 25 different teams ranging all the way up to the Cup Series down to the NASCAR Home Tracks teams. Lucky enough, Bobby Dotter and the SS Greenlight team took a chance on me and it's the start to a (hopefully) good start to reaching my career goal of being a crew chief/engineer in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series

Thanks for reading, r/NASCAR. If you've got any questions, feel free to ask in the comments. Thanks for the love at Mid-Ohio, too. Glad Andy could make the subreddit proud.

tl;dr: Don't be afraid to take a chance on something. It could turn out to be your next big break."

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

6tjpp4,3,2017-08-13,I [29 M] pushed for my gf to break up with me [26 F] and I think we're both remorseful. What do I do?,idiotromanticok,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tjpp4/i_29_m_pushed_for_my_gf_to_break_up_with_me_26_f/,"My girlfriend (Jill for fake namesakes) and I had been dating for a little over a year and living together. We had a great connection and great chemistry. Our sex was great, our conversations were great. We made each other laugh constantly and we really vibed well. We were each other's best friends and we were content. However, beneath the surface there were some issues brewing that all came to a head towards the last month of our relationship.

Towards the beginning of our relationship, I was working hard and very busy and ambitious. Due to circumstances beyond my control - my work lessened greatly to the point where I was practically unemployed. I took roughly 4 months off from work and during this time, my girlfriend began to support us financially. I was still paying for my own bills and rent off what I had saved but I wasn't able to buy her anything or take her out. I was barely breaking even. This began to take a toll on the relationship over time but unfortunately for me, my girlfriend (being very nonconfrontational by nature) never took the time to bring it up or attempt to talk to me about it. Attraction faded and we found ourselves as a shadow of what we used to have. After some time, I got the hint after seeing some of the signs of a potentially failing relationship. I moved out and began a frantic search for a secondary job which would keep me up float as I continued my entrepreneurial endeavors. I succeeded and landed a phenomenally well paying job with flexible hours as a server at a high-end fine dining restaurant.

With me starting a new job and the rigorous training that goes with it, alongside an internship Jill started at roughly the same time, we didn't text as much as we used to in the past. I didn't think anything of it, we were just significantly busier than we were before. It made sense.

However, when Jill began an internship, she met new friends. But there was one male coworker she started to get very close with. Too close. I initially uncovered how verbally intimate their 'friendship' was by noticing a large inconsistency in the amount of messages that was on her phone, versus what showed up on imessage on her macbook. I confront her and here begins a neverending chain of lie after lie to cover up the extent of their relationship. Although there was never anything physical that happened between them, the context of their conversations were inappropriate and absolutely crossed the line. I can confidently say that she engaged in an emotional affair. However, in the process of all this being uncovered, I can also confidently say that she realized what she doing was wrong and was in the process of trying to tone the context of their conversations back.

She lost attraction for me due to my lack of drive during this time as I lost my ability to trust her. We would argue, cry, make up, argue, make up, over and over during the last few weekends together until finally it ended.

One night I sat her down after realizing how ruined our relationship had become and asked if she was still attracted to me or if she still loved me. I had been contemplating ending the relationship myself but still felt too deep of a love for her to go through with it. This night, I just asked the right questions until I got the result I was unable to provide for myself - it was over. I would say it was largely mutual but at the end of the day, she was the one to end it.

I understand that the relationship was on a steady decline for a while and although it could've been on it's way back up, my discovering of her transgressions were just at a time where we weren't strong enough to get through it.

After that night, we ceased communication completely until just a couple days ago. Roughly a month had passed at this time. I think this time was necessary to recover and heal for both of us. Yet here I am, still thinking about her from time to time. She's reached out with some emotionally ambiguous messages saying ""You're hard to talk to...it's emotional for me.""

Right now half of me wants to forget her forever while the other half wants to see if there's something left to be explored. I haven't responded to her since she sent me that message mainly because I have no idea what to even say. I just wasn't expecting such a...straight forward expression of her feelings. I feel like I'm in a lose lose where if I continue to go down this rabbit hole, I could undo the past month of getting over her and being relatively okay by myself or look back sometime in the future and regret letting her completely go.

**EDIT:** There was no snooping involved on my part regarding her messages - this was discovered by accident as we were watching a show together on her macbook and happened to be running behind the web browser.

  ---   

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I broke up a month ago but I think we both feel we have some unfinished business. Do I make an attempt to rekindle our relationship or forget her and move on?"
6tju2q,8,2017-08-13,A different kind of Beestinger,LeCavalierSansCoeur,TheCTeam,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCTeam/comments/6tju2q/a_different_kind_of_beestinger/,"OC incoming, since I can't think of anywhere else to put this, and it's destroying my brain. I hope nobody else has had an idea like this one. I don't read Reddit to know. In fact, this is my first post of any kind on any thread in the entirety of Reddit. Be kind.

My character is introduced to the party as Toth, the Low. 

An enormous, hulking brute of a Halfling (standing at an unbelievable 4'3"", and nearly 55 pounds), Toth is a hideous and greatly oversized man, aged 44 years and likely owing his stature to an apparent case of gigantism. His face is half-covered by a leather facemask, but what parts you can see are scorched and horribly scarred. His body is hunchbacked, covered in ragged robes and old leathers, and twisted in places and ways a body should not be twisted. His gait is nearly sideways, and very uneven. He perhaps has never bathed. He appears to be homeless and likely shunned.

Conversing with Toth, he speaks like a cartoon Neanderthal might. He refers to himself in the third person, and speaks with a broken Common tongue. Although he says his primary job is ""street beggar"" in Waterdeep, Toth announces to the party that he secretly holds a second life as an ""honorary intern"" of ""Axe-scissors inc"" (as best as he can pronounce it). He was given the position by Master Viari who doesn't pay him, but claims it will give Toth ""good exposure"". Toth says that his function is:
""...to pretend to be bad person, when secretly Toth is good person!""
The brute essentially states that his position as a beggar offers him assumed entry into the criminal underworld, allowing him to be an informant. He states:
""Bad-people see Toth and think he bad-person just because Toth stupid, and ugly, and smelly. Then bad-people tell Toth allll the bad-things! Then Toth secretly tell Master Viari who turn bad-people into what he call... umm... 'opportunity' for Axe-scissors Inc!"" 
Viari has told Toth to keep his association with AI a secret, as revealing himself would not only hurt the brand, but possibly cause Toth's own demise.

Meeting Rosie Beestinger, whose fame as ""the grandmother"" is legendary among halflings, is quite an exciting moment for Toth. He is immediately attached to Rosie emotionally, referring to her repeatedly as the ""Mommy-mommy"" and following her completely star-struck. Rosie, as is her wont, takes pity on the seemingly gentle giant, and begins to care for him as she might other wayward ""children"" of his ilk. When the team is prepping for a missive from the home office, Toth informs the party that he intends to join them to help navigate their way through the criminal underworld, and gain entry where they otherwise might not. Rosie worries about the danger they might face with this creature potentially slowing them, until the party is surprised to see that what was once assumed to be a walking stick carried by Toth, is actually an ornate, but extraordinarily functional spear, easily worth all of his other possessions combined sixty-times over. Toth explains:
""Toth was born as Barbarian. In barbarian land, there is no house. There is no horse. There is nothing in life but spear. Spear is food. Spear is war. Spear is honor. Spear is ONLY thing.""
A quick, friendly test between Rosie and Toth proves that Toth is surprisingly formidable with the weapon, and that in combat he would be more help than hindrance. With her blessing, he joins the group on their next adventure.

Until of course, the moment when everything is ruined.

Finding a moment with Rosie away from the rest of the party, Toth blindsides the ""Mommy-mommy"" with an attack from his weapon, dazing her. At first, Rosie assumes that it is some kind of barbarian cultural difference, but Toth dispels that thought by following up with more attacks. Rosie angrily demands to know why Toth is doing this.

The brute reveals that although he is now called ""Toth, the Low"", the name given to him at his birth was actually ""Orchid Beestinger"". He is the son of Rosie and Keth, a human nomad from the most violent barbarian tribe in all of Faerun. In his broken tongue, Toth spins the tale of his life. His father died when he was six, and Rosie had left ""before the first harvest"" in his lifetime, leaving him an orphan. The violent barbarian humans physically abused the smaller and weaker half-halfling Orchid, using him as what he calls a ""war-slave"" for nearly thirty-five years. He owes his horrid appearance to these decades of torture in the camp. His bones and muscles were mangled by warriors trying new combat techniques on him, his flesh was destroyed by every new blade forged by the group, and whatever was left of his body was offered as a trophy for the men who came back from raids with the most kills. Orchid begged for death, but was not granted it as the men found it fun to keep their mascot around, and he believes that suicide would force him into an afterlife of further torture from the barbarian god. 

Rosie remembered the boy very well, and comments on how she searched for the tribe for years when the nomads moved away from where she knew. She had so many other things to attend to, and so many other children. She never forgot Orchid, but had assumed the tribe slaughtered, or her boy dead, or safe in the hands of his father. Had she known, she would have never let it happen. But in Toth's mind, his tortured life was indeed her fault. Had she taken him with her instead of leaving him with the maniac tribe of human men, his slavery wouldn't have happened at all. He angrily asks Rosie:
""Toth hear stories of you. Mommy-mommy had SO many children. Care for all children, but not Toth. Why you love Toth least? You never love Toth? Is Toth only child you abandon?! How many other just like Toth?!""
Rosie knows she did the best she could for all of her children, but in the back of her mind she has a number, and she is suddenly stricken ill with the knowledge that the number indeed is greater than one. 

Toth is enraged at the sight of her face in that thought, and declares that during his slavery he abandoned the name ""Beestinger"". Now after three years of trying to track down his ""Mommy-mommy"", he finally can challenge her to his culture's ""Blood Duel of Honor"" to achieve his entry to the afterlife upon his death. Either he dies in combat, or kills his rival. Both work for Toth. Rosie refuses to kill one of her own children and initially declines to fight, offering instead to raise Toth as one of her children from that moment forward to rekindle the years she wished she never missed. Toth is unreceptive. Thirty-five years of hatred have made his ears deaf to anything but combat with this woman. Toth informs Rosie that if she does not fight him to the death, the duel transfers to her next-of-kin. Toth would rather kill Rosie than her children, but if she refuses him, he'll find solace in slaying every creature of Faerun what calls themselves ""Beestinger"". He mentions that it was by tracking down her children that he was able to even find her in the first place. Her letters to them (which he adds that she had never sent to Toth) revealed her existence in AI: Red Larch to him, which allowed him to follow up with the office. He could easily go back to those children and begin with they, and their children's deaths. He lists off a couple of Beestinger names:
""Toth know where find Gnome-man Dwixill in mechanic shop. Toth can easy find Magara and 2-year old daughter in treehouse. Toth maybe not know exactly where find Driebus, but he not hard man to track.""
Rosie closes her eyes, thinks for a moment of herself, her children and her little Orchid, and gives her response to his challenge...

And that's all I have.

Realistically, it could go in many directions after this. Does the rest of the team jump in and fight this foe? Do they kill him, and does that affect his afterlife? Does he get away and stalk Rosie continuously? Does she refuse him, and then she has to chase Toth before he can murder her children and grandchildren? They're all fine by me. I'm sure I'll never get to play the character, but I just wanted to get it down somewhere. I really just wanted a thing to break down the unflappable Rosie. Sure she's worried about a star or two, but I was trying to go for something more visceral, and it seems to me with the number of her children, it wouldn't be outrageous to think she had let some of them down. Mostly I just noticed a use for it. Schala likely hates Donaar, one could argue that the UR hates K'thriss to an extent, and Maleth and her followers definitely hate Walnut. But Rosie? Nobody hates Rosie. Conversely, she's revered by halflings all over Faerun. I really thought there was a spot to grow a character who could be her physical Moriarty. Plus, Rosie doesn't seem like the kind of character who would be okay with someone hating her. Especially one of her children. I even wonder if there's a group of these Beestinger misfit-toys who curse their name and curse their mother for various reasons. Anyone else have a Beestinger who hates Rosie? Anyway, I hope this is good enough to be a part of your community, and I thank you for reading if you're still here. Hooray for the C Team!"

He and I are doing long distance after being with each other for 5 months now. However before we knew long distance was going to occur our relationship was the best it could have possibly be. He and I both attend the same university and we both are from the same hometown. Through time I have been able to get to know his friends and got really close to them, they literally call me their best friend. Well once I found out about him getting an internship out of state I knew that it was going to be tough for us but I knew we would get through it because of how caught up in love we were. Before he left, he suggested an open relationship at the time we were 4 months, even though in reality I've known him for 5 months. He suggested an open relationship because he feared if someone losing interest or cheating if we were exclusive. So for the next 8 weeks we FaceTime once a week snapchat here and there. But I noticed I seemed to have Initated majority of it. And just last week when we FaceTime she said he wanted to break up because the spark just isn't there anymore and he cannot say I love you back anymore. He did say I am the closest person he has ever gotten close to and really values me as a person and wants to continue being friends. Well what sucks is that we literally have mutual friends. I just came out my family a month ago he is still not out yet so I'm wondering if he is just not ready for long term because that is holding him back as our 6 months is next week or would have been I should say. I also forgot to mention that he is returning back to college in 4 weeks and I really do not know what is going to happen. Any advice has to why he broke up with me out of the blue ? "
6tl44g,1,2017-08-14,My two cents - The recruiting industry is full of deceptions and frustrations and the nasty people always win the game (my apologies for the long text),coolsmileybunny,recruiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/6tl44g/my_two_cents_the_recruiting_industry_is_full_of/,"Upon finishing my degree in law and a part time internship, I decided to work in recruitment for a change. I joined a global reputable recruitment firm and was placed under financial technology recruitment team. My team has 7 people and my direct reporting line appears to be a friendly middle aged man. In this so called reputable company, there is no official training on the different kinds of technologies and any sort of market analysis. I begin to read books on fintech and join after work hours fintech groups to understand different kinds of technologies. I also purchased fintech conference ticket (out of my own pocket) and i am very determined to do the job well.  I was given a role (that is opened for 2 years) and this client has blacklisted us. But I tried really hard to tackle the role and made countless attempts to the managers in order to clarify pass misunderstandings. After 3.5 months of interview process with my candidate, I placed with this client. 

And the horror begins. All the impossible roles start to assign to me. (I have a trainee so I have no choice). But god must have mercy on me because I started to fill one role after another and started to negotiate with every single line manager to increase the position budget. I have never followed pointless KPI guidelines issued by the company and deceived any candidates to meet in office for KPI sake (their time is also valuable and financial technology candidates have horrible timetable. Wasting their lunchtime is just inhumane).  Before I recognized, I started to hit company sales targets and got promoted very quickly from trainee to managing consultant within 3 years. 

My direct reporting line mainly receives his commission based on contract renewal and I only work perm roles. He sees me as a threat and spreads rumors to his superior that I am going to leave for another company. Since he is with the company for almost 6 years, many seniors take his words. (I am never the socializing type - I just quietly do my work) However, many superiors think my overall sales target is boosting their regional performance so I remain safe. Earlier last year this direct reporting line axed a couple of people due to lack of sales and told others that this was my idea. (I don't even speak in those meetings). In addition, HR tends to be his friends (and I usually have good relationships with line managers and candidates) and he started to tell HR to release roles privately to him only. 

It just isn't fair - This guy has no market knowledge (after so many years of work, he still can't tell the difference of different programming language). Just because he joins the industry earlier (much better time back then), he made loads of HR friends and befriended with senior consultants in the industry. I feel that no matter how hard i work, I can't beat this guy. It seems that nasty people always win in this industry and honest and hard work mean nothing. 

I got a couple of offers from my clients regarding senior sales roles but that would mean all my hard work is down the drain. What should I do? I am not good at socializing and I am not the sales type. Sometimes I don't even know why business comes my way ....

Thanks for reading and wish you all a good day ahead!

This is my first post here and first time I made an acc on reddit. I'm 23 y/o male and for the past few months I've been talking with this girl (24). At first it was all friendly cause I didn't have any feelings for her and didn't really care much tbh. In the last few weeks we have been talking to each other on a daily basis, text, call, IM etc. It's usually mundane everyday stuff, what you did today blah blah. She even gets mad if I don't reply her for some time lol.

The problem is, I have started developing feelings for her, but I think it's not reciprocal. She has a boyfriend, a long term relationship, but she never talks about him or mentions him. We went to the movies and a dinner a few times, sometimes I called and sometimes she did the arrangements. She seems cold tho, not really interested in anything past this weird friendship and she goes on vacations with her bf and what not (but never actually tells me that directly).

Not to mention, sometimes she makes me sandwiches or gets me food when me meet up, which is kinda weird. She also called me a few times before work to stop-by for food and/or coffee at her place etc. Lately we had few plans to hang out, which she ditched for semi-legitimate reasons but I won't go into that.

My question is, is she leading me on or toying with me? In the past couple of months my life changed drastically, I got a uni degree, waiting to sign a contract at the company where I currently work as an intern (pay will be decent), planning to move closer to work and I ditched (or they ditched me, who knows) all of my so-called friends (really big differences, can't really connect with them like before). So with all that going on, I really don't want to waste time on this gal and I don't want to be played around like a fool, but I'm unsure what's the situation lol.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thanks."

You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.


2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower.


3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”.


4) A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…


5) Private tutoring for a young girl


6) You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….
For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. 

If you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!


I'll be at work all day so feel free to send me a message whenever.

I held off doing my required internship until my last semester due to nearly every internship paying less than my current job at the time (Pharmacy tech).  

I have been spending the summer applying to jobs nearly non-stop and it has been one rejection after another.  I just don't know what I am doing wrong or if there is just no room for a 30 y/o new grad in the industry.  

It is getting difficult to look back on my decision to switch from going to pharmacy school to doing accounting, I would have been unhappy with my job as a pharmacist, but at least I would have had a job in my field.  

I was speaking with a recruiter at a local hiring agency and she mentioned that my 1 internship leaves me with less ""real world"" experience and that is what is hindering me, but that was out of financial necessity to make sure I could pay the bills and help support my son.  

Anyway, I just needed to vent and hopefully you all can help raise my spirits a bit.  It's been a rough summer and it is only getting rougher by the day.  

Thanks,

Sci in 2014 from a Big 10 university, never got an internship (not for lack of trying) and stayed at the university for another year working on a masters, in an attempt to have one more chance at getting a summer internship, which was unsuccessful. I sat for all five exams, passed P and FM, failed the other 3. My grades in grad school were less-than-stellar, so I cut my losses and joined AmeriCorps, where I've been for two years now, learning carpentry and other useful, yet non-actuarial skills. Masters was not completed.

My contract with AmeriCorps is ending soon, and it's time to find a real job. I haven't completely forgotten my training with math, stats, etc. but I basically haven't been practicing those things at all for two years, and I've gotten a little rusty. I want to start applying for EL positions, but feel under qualified because I've kind of ""gone cold"" actuarially. I know that exam progress is important, and fluency with computers (Excel, R, Python, etc.) is as well, but as I said I've quite fallen out of practice with all of these, and whenever I think about picking up somewhere to start practicing again, I feel overwhelmed and unsure of what's most important.

Does the community have any advice/insight into what's the best approach to re-ignite the actuarial engines, and make myself a competitive job-seeker? Is it as simple as just trying to sit for the next MFE and not focusing on anything else? Or just focus on relearning programming? Both? I feel like my brain is in knots. Your advice is appreciated."

However, I have been searching for internship for the past few months and it didn't work out at all.
It is hard for me to get an interview, even it's just a phone interview, I screwed up because of my nervousness. I prepared but I couldn't express myself clearly when it comes to the interview.

I really don't know what I can do anymore, and I hate myself that always screw up because I couldn't think of anything when I answered the questions.

6tnr1u,1,2017-08-14,Blizzard circulates internal memo urging the hiring of more women [and fewer men] -- is this reassuring or troubling to you?,nana_strikes_,imdbvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/imdbvg/comments/6tnr1u/blizzard_circulates_internal_memo_urging_the/,"&gt; Blizzard is launching a “global diversity and inclusion initiative” aimed at raising the percentage of women and underrepresented minority groups in its workforce and improving the work environment for those groups, according to an internal company email recently received by Kotaku.

&gt; Only 21 percent of Blizzard employees are women, wrote company president Mike Morhaime in the email—which a Blizzard rep confirmed to me is real—and “they leave our organization at a higher rate than men.” These numbers, Morhaime writes, **are consistent with the game industry at large,** but Blizzard wants to improve on them.

&gt; Morhaime wrote the company is launching a **diversity effort that will first focus on women,** but will expand later this year to encompass other “under-represented minority groups,” who make up 14 percent of Blizzard, according to the email. Morhaime wrote that while the company will not set “quotas” for hiring female job candidates, Blizzard is encouraging employees to refer more qualified women to open positions, and it’s looking into ways to better recruit from women’s groups, conferences, and universities with an initial focus on “more women leaders and a diverse new graduate hiring class.” The company also plans to partner with organizations like Girls Who Code in hopes of bringing more women into game development and computer science.

&gt; The email states that **Blizzard already has an LGBTQ council** that offers monthly meetings and advises on Blizzard projects, and it recently created a similar council made up of women from “various levels” in the company, with the goal of helping the company’s leaders “think through ideas to attract more women and make Blizzard a more rewarding and enjoyable place for women to work.”

&gt; The email also outlines other concrete steps that Blizzard plans to take to **“enhance inclusiveness for those who identify as women,”** including “networking sessions and mentoring groups for women across the company,” an annual “Women @ Blizzard” summit starting next year, and improved bias training for managers.

&gt; Recent years have seen Blizzard stress the importance of diversity in games like Overwatch, at events like BlizzCon, and in the wake of an incident where pro Hearthstone player Terrence Miller dealt with a flood of Twitch chat racism during a major event. Within its own workforce, Blizzard has seen recent success, more than doubling the number of women interns it recruited in the past year, according to VentureBeat. There have, however, been ups and downs, with Blizzard taking flack for things like a pose for Overwatch’s Tracer (which the development team ended up changing after controversy) and the game’s problems with toxicity, especially toward women. It’s a process, but Morhaime says in the email that Blizzard is in it for the long haul.

&gt; “Our diversity initiative will require a commitment from every one of us, but especially from our leaders, managers, and hiring teams,” concludes Morhaime’s email. “We appreciate your dedication to help Blizzard achieve this goal.”

I'm a student from the Netherlands (male, 22 years old) and I will be in Stockholm from Februari 2018 for 6 months to do an internship at the Karolinksa Institute. I heard some horrible stories about finding a room in Stockholm, so would it be wise to already start looking for something now - or is it too early?

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

The B.A. curriculum looks like half as many credits so I feel like it's one of those ""mix with another study"" kind of majors. I'm worried this wouldn't get me as many internship opportunities, does anyone have advice on if I should give a different college a try? Champlain offered me acceptance as well into their B.S. major for Networking and Cyber security. The curriculum is looking similar to the B.S. at UVM so I am considering going there, but ITS SO EXPENSIVE! I don't get how a smaller school with less impressive facilities would cost more, except they do seem to boast about better ""job placement"" but I'm not sure who to believe."

We met at state 1 in school, two years ago. She graduated and went home for a year. I stayed for an extra semester. We spent 5 months together before she left, we both wanted to continue with long distance. This was Fall 2015. 




Spring 2016 I started graduate school out of state, while she was in her home state working for a year. She got into graduate school in her state. It looked bleak, I was 16 hrs away and would be stuck there for 2 years. Somehow we managed to have a strong LDR. Talked everyday, watched netflix together, and played video games together. 




Then in Summer of 2016, I receive an internship offer in her state only 2 hrs away from her new school. We were apart for 8 months, but I was visiting every 2 months. I packed my bags and moved there. My internship was for four months, but my performance extended me to a year. The Fall of 2016 was great, we took turns visiting each other and had a good time. 




Spring 2016 came, and things got more complicated. Her mother moved into her city, and was very strict about physical relationships (cultural differences). My girlfriend could no longer visit me, and I had to only visit her. Due to her mother's presence, my grilfriends availability time shrunk. It was already limited due to her studies, but now we were not seeing each other as often. I work hard and somehow managed to get admitted into her school and accepted to transfer starting Fall 2017. She is very happy that the two of us will be together again. 




School gets tough for her, and her mom is showing symptoms of cancer. Cancer could not be found, but my girlfriend is very stressed out. Her dog is also slowly dying from old age. I am there to support her, but she starts to treat me unfairly. She would get mad at petty things, and we had to talk things through. She said she wasn't feeling the same about me as she used to and that she was feeling depressed. She started seeing a school counselor, and I talked to her and believed her depression was effecting our relationship. I believed had everything been going great, that we wouldn't have these issues. 




Everything gets back to normal again. I visit her a few times, and things seem fine. Before this summer, she left to her home country with her mother. This was to do some health checks for the both of them. I took care of her dog while she was away. Unfortunately, her dog got very sick during that month. I tried everything in my power to support the dog, but eventually I had to take the dog to her family who lived 4 hours away. The dog passed away and the family thanked me for my effort and appreciated what I did for them. 




After that, the depression was worse. She didn't text or call me for a week. She said she was depressed and asked for some space. I abliged. When she returned, she moved back to her home city to work for the summer. She was now four hours away from me. We made an effort to see each other at least once a month during this time. Things were different though, it wasn't like before were we talked everyday, it was mostly text. When we did talk, we sometimes got into petty arguments. One instance, I tried to call her and she didn't really want to talk to me and was angry. She picked a fight with me, and called me needy (even though we hadn't spoken through facetime in a week). We had a big fight and got bad at each other. I thought it was going to be over, she was displayed signs that she no longer wanted to be with me. We talked about it and then got over it, and things got back to normal. It had been a few weeks of not seeing each other, but we went on a date again and everything was fine. The following week I helped her move into her new place and met her mom. Even learned how to introduce myself in her language, and everything seemed fine! Her mom seemed to like me. 




Now, I finally moved to her college town in preparation for the semester. We had a petty argument the night before (the first in a few weeks). She was trying to get me to go to an event that I didn't really want to go to (political event). Then she said that she was gonna go alone and meet some guy and fall in love. Of course this was not okay with me, and I pointed out what she was doing to me. I think she realized that her treatment was unfair. 




Last night, I finally moved into the new town. She face timed me, and told me that she thinks we should split up. She said that I didn't deserve her bad treatment, and that she hasn't been feeling the same way about me anymore. That we have nothing to talk about, and that what I talk about with her is boring (work). I told her I think this is because of all the time we've spent long distance. I think that being in the same town again, would make a world of difference for our relationship. We could actually partake in activities together, rather than just go on dinner dates. However, now that I've finally made it here, she thinks we should break it off??




She is willing to continue trying with me, but tells me she doesn't think being close to one another is going to fix anything. I don't want her to try this for me out of pity. I told you the long story of our long distance relationship, to explain that we've been far away from each other for at least half of our time together. I've talked to two friends about this, who have very different opinions. One thinks I need to move on, he said he has tried to salvage relationships like this and always failed. The other has told me that I should wait until she gets back into town and have a face to face talk with her to try and make a decision. He thinks that now that I am here, she may be afraid that these feelings will get worse and things won't ever be the same. He suggests that I offer to try and mend the relationship and ask if she is willing to do the same. If she is willing, then we would try to be together maybe go to counseling or just generally do fun things together to see if we're compatible. Then maybe after a month we re-evaluate? I'm not sure how to proceed. I obviously want to move forward with the second opinion, because I really care about her and want to be with her. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: 2 year relationship, half of it LDR (on and off), I get accepted to her school finally, and just moved there. She thinks we should split up right before we would finally be within 5 minutes from each other."
6toz4k,13,2017-08-14,Oak Street Penny Loafers: The shoes that just keep giving...and giving...and giving,puck1996,goodyearwelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/6toz4k/oak_street_penny_loafers_the_shoes_that_just_keep/,"Hey all!

This is my first post on goodyearwelt and let me preface this by saying that I doubt I have the shoe knowledge that any frequenter of this subreddit does. I used this subreddit first decide on buying some redwing blacksmith boots, and then just liked to casually browse it from time to time.

With that semi-disclaimer out of the way, I had my first real summer job, an internship at a bank, and wanted to reward myself by buying some high quality footwear. After much research, I decided to go with the Brown Beefroll Pennyloafers by OakStreet Bootmakers, along with matching shoe trees.

To my relatively novice eye, the shoes are absolutely gorgeous. The chromexcel leather smells looks, and feels amazing, I love the stitching, the shoes just feel absolutely solid. 

But as my title suggests...the shoes just seem to never stop giving. I was measured when I went into a distributor and I wear a size 10. I threw on 9.5's and they felt very tight to me, I almost purchased those. The salesman helping me insisted I try on a pair of 9's, explaining just how much high quality leather would break in. I took his advice and walked around in them. They were exceptionally tight everywhere, but I somewhat doubtfully decided I would go with that size upon the salesperson's advice. Well..he was right. The shoe doesn't seem to ever stop breaking in. I walk quite a bit so after about two days I'd probably walked a few miles in them. I had some blisters in certain areas but knew that was just part of the wear, but already I could feel the shoes really loosening up. Maybe slight heel slippage, but thats just part of the soles breaking in as well. After a couple days, the fit started to feel spot on. A bit loose barefoot, just a little tight around the top of my foot with thin socks. I was very happy. 

3 weeks later I'm feeling pretty upset as the leather feels like it just endlessly continues to soften. Perhaps using shoe trees was a total mistake, especially during a warm summer, but it feels like they are just continuing to overstretch the leather. When I wear the shoes barefoot, they are borderline too large. I get the little snippy sound of a sandal kind of slipping and slapping back against your foot while you walk. The leather no longer feels secure over the top of my foot. I tried the shoes on with some of my thick winter socks that I wear with my boots, and only then do they feel tight and secure for walking, and I'm sure wearing them with the shoes will only continue to stretch them out. The leather doesn't feel hard anymore, its almost like putty in the warm heat that can't hold its shape anymore. I understand that quality leather is supposed to stretch to your feet, but this just feels absurd. There's no stay to the shoe at all, I can with my hands just completely change the shape of the shoe almost at will. 

After months of review on shoes, following Oakstreet's own advice on how to size, as well as the advice of a salesman who owned some of their products, and dropping the whopping $340.00 on these shoes, I'm really feeling defeated. For that price, and from what I had read and heard, I was expecting a shoe that would feel almost like a second skin. Instead they're almost a distraction, and I just feel constantly conscious that I'm wearing them. 

I don't believe I can return these shoes because of the extent I've walked outside in them--the only way I could really break them in in the first place. I don't really know if I'm looking for advice or just wanted to post a semi-review for people, but I guess be wary of the temperamental sizing of a loafer my friends.  

Currently I don't have pictures attached, if any of you feel you'd like to see some or have particular angles you'd like to look at, just let me know.

Cheers everyone"

R34 Ideas inside.,Television-RP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6tp584/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_r34_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, bubble butt opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Game of Thrones**; Daario or Robb Stark would be my top choices. Maybe even Mero! I'd like for them to be fucking a Dany impersonator with a great curvy body. [For more information on this idea, click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6oinsu/f4m_the_queen_of_anal_daenerys_targaryen/)

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Trial And Error**; Josh the lawyer, please! A backwards little town with him fucking a gorgeous new intern or simply having a night of fun.

♥ **Great News**; A few ideas that mostly revolve around sneaking, fucking during a live broadcast, etc. If you play Greg, I would like to be a secretary, reporter, a celebrity guest on the show, etc!

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. My preferences would be Jeff fucking a librarian/tutor/new spanish teacher/nurse/etc.

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **Daredevil**; I'm solely interested in Matt! I would like to play as a female criminal such as Black Cat! Other than that, a secretary/intern/woman coming for help to his office would be ideal.

♥ **Luke Cage**; You play as... *gasp*! Luke Cage. I'm very open minded for this but that body of his manhandling a curvy gorgeous woman? Let's do it!

♥ **WWE**; There's a bunch of people I love there, both present and former! I can play people ranging from fans, to sexy referees, announcers, interviewers and new divas!

♥ **Limitless**; The TV show! Not expecting many people who've seen this but you playing as Brian would be the best!

♥ **MTV's The Challenge**; A bit of a niche show! If you're familiar with it, I'd love to discuss the possibilities we could play out.

♥ **Big Brother (US)**; ^ Read above!

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

♥ **Man From U.N.C.L.E**; Illya, Napoleon or both! Having either or both pumping a sexy spy, informant, daughter of their target, etc for information is just too perfect, isn't it?

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. **Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot!** I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love; anal, creampies, rimming(giving/recieving), roughness and dirty talking. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"
6tp9lg,18,2017-08-14,Ladies in agencies: Do you feel like you always need to try harder vs. male counterparts?,lipsticknstockings,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/6tp9lg/ladies_in_agencies_do_you_feel_like_you_always/,"I have been in advertising (copy side) for over 10 years now. I have done freelancing, full-time, been laid off, been fired, survived massive lay offs, worked in cities, worked in suburbs. I've never been promoted, every time I achieved a new title it was because I moved to a new agency. 

I feel like for a long time, I have been judged more on looks or personality than my talent and work. Even in my first job, the managing partner barely spoke a word to me the entire time I was there but for whatever disliked me. She'd compare me to people who had years of experience above me, saying I didn't speak up enough during meetings even though I was a junior writer with only a few months experience. On the other hand, she loved the male intern, even though his work and expertise were still evolving and obviously as an intern, he never really worked on projects solo. The last straw for me there was when my review came up, I had been the LEAD writer on a major brand for months because they couldn't seem to find a more senior writer to work on it, I expected to get promoted because at that point I had been running this brand, reporting into an ACD. But I didn't get a promotion and so I left.

This kind of stuff has happened a lot in my career. I am friendly, hard working, and I believe good at what I do, but when it comes down to it that only seems to have a very small part in my ability to succeed. I have had other women talk behind my back or exclude me from their cliques before and felt that impact my job at that particular agency. I have also seen older women at past agencies get turned down for well deserved promotions or most recently get fired, because they weren't in the agency clique and were older. 

Does anyone else feel this has happened to them? It just seems like being in the right clique is more important than how good your work is. "
6tpnqm,2,2017-08-14,Question dump about career paths,1kenzi,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/6tpnqm/question_dump_about_career_paths/,"I’m currently going into my second year of undergrad in materials/polymer engineering and I’m really torn about which career to should pursue. 

I just finished an internship at NASA and while it was a great experience, I decided that I do not want to dedicate the entirety of my life to research and academia. A 9-5 desk job sounds mundane and unstimulating as well. An ideal situation would be more time for me to explore my interests and other career options, but I do not want to spend more time than I have to in undergrad. I’ve shadowed a pathologist last summer and I have over 200 hours of clinical volunteering, but that still wasn’t enough to sell my soul to medicine, yet it wasn’t enough for me to rule out the option either. Maybe I need to volunteer in more areas? I’m thinking about doing hospice for this coming semester.

So I’m here to ask you guys what made you want to pursue medicine and any suggestions for experience I should look into. Was it the life-sciences research? Was it the shadowing? Was it the volunteering? Was it the classes you took? Was it the physicians you talked to? At what point in your life did you know medicine was your passion?


-I’ve read a lot of threads about whether it’s worth pursuing medicine, and the majority of them have very polarizing views. Why might this be the case? For example, med students who realized too late that their sentiments were disillusioned.

-How true is it that physicians are frequently overworked?

-How do physicians cope with the sheer amount of postgrad exams they must prepare for?

-Do most students who matriculate into med school already know 110 percent that med school is their calling? Or is there a decent number of matriculates who feel a tinge of doubt? Do these students ever change their mind?

-At what point do I need to make a firm decision on whether or not to pursue medicine if I do not want to spend more than four years in undergrad?


I know that some of these questions may seem naive, but from my understanding, medicine is an enormous commitment and all I’m searching for is that one tell-tale sign.

Any input would be greatly appreciated!"
6tqb11,10,2017-08-14,Always thought it was my Dad who was the narcissist in the house until now...help?,stuckwithnmum,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6tqb11/always_thought_it_was_my_dad_who_was_the/,"Honestly not sure if I fit in here...but I'm feeling very nervous about the next 14 months living with my mother and brother and kinda seeking some advice as to what to do. 

Here's a the context:

I'm now 21, and I consider myself a pretty reasonable, logical and considerate guy so hopefully I'm not crazy. To be perfectly honest my father, although he's very clearly narcissistic, was not a *bad* parent. He was just absent. Occasionally he would lose his temper extremely quickly and snap at me, and once or twice smacked me. But after I smacked him back when I was 15 he didn't do that again. His biggest crime in my eyes was just never being there for me, never being my Dad and teaching me all the ""guy things"" that he should've. I taught myself to shave when I was 14. I learned about sex from porn and the brief sex ed in school (don't worry, I am extremely aware that porn is not realistic, and I have a normal - if somewhat depressingly sparse - sex life now). Fortunately I had other male role models I could look up to for most other things. He just did what he wanted to do - played golf, went to concerts and sports games, trips abroad ""for work"", never came home in time to see me or my brothers, and left my mother at home to care for us. Eventually he packed in the ""act"" (because imo that's what it was) of being a father and just left us altogether for another woman. It devastated my mother and she was absolutely beside herself for the 2 months I was at home with her after that, before I left for college. Since then I've had a fairly amicable relationship with him - unlike the rest of my family. I speak to him every couple of days. Update him on how my life is going. But it's all very superficial. I don't really care either way, but I figured having him in my life is more useful than cutting him off as long as he's not doing any harm (he's a very successful businessman and his contacts have been extremely useful for me). 

I always thought my mum was just an enabler, locked in financially and mentally. But I'm starting to realise that actually, I think the reason they got together in the first place (and the reason that things went downhill) was they're both incredibly narcissistic - my Dad was just in the position to be the more authoritative and so masked my mother's narcissism, and it may well have rubbed off on my youngest brother too. 

I'm 1/2 way through my degree now, and from September I'm starting an internship that forms my entire junior year. Unfortunately, that means having to move back in with my mum as she lives in a big city where the company I'm working for is based. My youngest brother is also still living with her. My middle brother is cool - very laidback and funny. We mostly get on. 

I came back home from the summer, and immediately my mum and I clashed. Stupid (but important to me) things like having a long lie in, being able to lock my room, having lazy days. She started arguments with me over all of them. She'd ask me to sort something out - I'd give her a deadline by which I would do it and she'd accept it - only then to have a go at me if it wasn't done to *her own* timeline (which of course, I had no idea of). 

Any time she started an argument and I pointed out a flaw in her logic or something she was just *wrong* about - she screams at me, telling me to stop arguing/talking back/being rude etc. Even when I presented physical evidence - and even occasionally my brothers agreeing with me. 

Just today, she asked me to put away some things in the kitchen. So I did. She then comes screaming up the stairs at me to go back and wash up the stuff she asked me to. I told her she didn't ask me to wash up anything - she insists she did, so I quote her verbatim about ""putting away"" the things. She screws up her face and yelled at me to stop picking fights ""otherwise it's going to be a long 14 months, or you can just find somewhere else to live"". 

It's a small and probably quite mundane example compared to many of the things I've seen here - but it's not isolated. She does this a dozen times a day. I don't know if it counts as gaslighting - but it feels like she's trying very hard to assert authority she doesn't have over me anymore. Having no comprehension that she can possibly be wrong.

As another example of her self-centredness: We recently went on holiday (which threw up a lot of arguments but it's mostly the same stuff - she can't possibly be wrong) to a big city in another country which we've visited a few times before. I wanted to go out to some bars, possibly even a club for a night or two - just to meet the local people, have a good time. We had no other plans in the evenings. My mere mention of this desire was met with screeching and her reasoning against this was, and I quote: ""You don't know your way around, you'll get lost, walk into a nasty area, then you will get hurt. Then that ruins everyone's holiday and it'll be all your fault for being so selfish"". It's not like I have a smart phone so I can figure out exactly where I'm going, what I'm doing, and can order an uber there and back...oh wait, I do. But no - because she'll ""be worried"" and that's not fair.

I've said to her in my frustration at her constant bullshit that she was acting like a dictator where she couldn't possibly be wrong and she replied very smugly ""In my home, I am one"". It blew my mind that an adult who has raised 3 children (2 of them reasonably well) could think that's an okay attitude to have. No conversation, no discussion, debate or compromise. 

Finally...she loves shit-talking about me behind my back. On our previously mentioned holiday, we stayed with family for a few days. I'm very good friends with my cousin. We sat outside one night when everyone else had gone to bed and she told me how my mum had been insulting me constantly behind my back to her and my aunt. Saying I was a selfish, greedy, arrogant, disobedient trouble maker. In front of me and her friends/acquaintances - my mum will happily sing my praises about how great it is I got the internship, how well I'm doing at university. It's quite nice, but I know she does it because she thinks it makes *her* look good - what a great young man she brought up - it's all her achievement, right? But in front of our family - my brothers, my cousin &amp; aunts and uncles - it's all ""Stuckwnmum is a lazy, selfish piece of shit"".

Now to elaborate on my younger brother - he's 16 - still in school. He's 6'2. I'm 5'8. He's well built, I'm slim. I fear he's got some real issues both from my Dad walking out (he was 14 at the time and took it very personally), as well as from being around my mum when she's showed this new and horrible side to her. He doesn't take requests from anyone (even if I just ask him politely to get me a drink of water as he gets one for himself). He refuses to cooperate with anything, he doesn't keep his promises or agreements, disregards other people's property (breaking things and not replacing them - or even apologising). He abuses his physical superiority over everyone in the household to get his way and is very physically aggressive in any confrontation far too soon to justify it.

A more infuriating thing is as my middle brother is rarely at home (he travels a lot when he's not at college), my younger brother and my mum often gang up on me. They'll use each other as allies against me. If I ask my mum to back me up on a disagreement with my youngest brother she says ""sort it out yourself, you're an adult, act like one"". However if it's my brother wanting something from me she'll scream at me to stop being selfish if I refuse - no matter what my reason is (usually something like - last time he borrowed X he never gave it/paid it back to me and until I get that back I do not wish to lend him Y), and eventually I just give in (often my brother threatens violence against me too). 

I don't want to live with these horrible, self-centred bullies, unfortunately I don't really have a choice. I'm not getting paid enough to live independently and even if I did my mother would take moving out as an act against her and would never support me again which I just can't afford as she's helping with my college costs. 

I don't really know how to prepare myself or deal with this situation. I'm planning to throw everything into my work and make sure I'm in the office or on socials or such things as much as possible so I don't have to be in the house with these insufferable people. But there will still be weekends and evenings where I'll have to find a way to tolerate and pacify their bullshit. 

Any advice on actively managing the times when I do have to interact with them? If you need any clarifications or to ask for any other examples/details then please feel free to, although I will keep personal details vague obviously.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: Thanks for the advice so far. I do have a counsellor but I've never really spoken about my frustrations with my mother - my mother originally organised the counsellor for me after my Dad left (she organised the same person for me and my brothers). I never really felt the need to go to them so I stopped after a short while. I would go back but she's a personal friend of my mother and although I don't believe the counsellor would break patient confidentiality, I also just don't feel comfortable being 100% honest with them when she knows who I'm talking about."

This is my first post here. I'm about to enter my final year of my bachelors in Financial Math and Statistics and am sitting the L1 exam in December.

About 2 weeks ago I bought the CFAI books from Amazon thinking they were the Schweser books. I just registered for Level 1 after finishing the Quant section today and realized that I've been using the CFAI books all along. 

So my question is, if I felt comfortable on the quant section and have enough time to study using the CFAI books since my internship is only part time this summer, is it worth it to buy the Schweser books at all? Or should I just go through the CFAI books.

Thanks in advance for your advice!"

6tqsvg,2,2017-08-14,"Me [20 M ] with my EX [20 F] 2 years, clean break maybe get back together?",Dathorton,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tqsvg/me_20_m_with_my_ex_20_f_2_years_clean_break_maybe/,"Hey reddit,


I been a bit confused in my relationship recently.  And my friend advised me to use his account and just hear various opinions.  So here is a little bit of background.


Im a 20 year old guy entering my final year of college.  Nearly 2 years ago I got into my first relationship with my best friend, a 20 year old female. Lets call her Sarah. I had known her for 4 years before dating. My parents didnt want me dating for cultural reasons. For that reason I never dated anyone.  Sarah is a year below me in school so as she entered her freshman year at the same university as me she had broken up with her boyfriend in time for a school.  About a month into school she told me that she really cared about me and loved me.  After some thought I decided this was my life and I wasnt going to live it for my parents so I asked her out.  Things were going well about 3 months in my parents got suspicious and I decided to tell em the truth. All hell broke loose, Sarah and I faked a break but eventually my parents came to terms with it.  They decided it was my life and I could screw it up how i wanted.


Summers were tough as my parents would get really pissed if I wanted to hang out with her.  The first summer was tough but we managed.  The school year was great. But the 2nd summer is when life threw me a curveball.


Sarah worked retail this summer, while i worked an internship.  Being summer it was tough to see her but I texted her every day. Sarah had this coworker, lets call him jacob, who she worked with.  Jacob was about to move to the east coast in a few months after the start of summer.  So over the course of summer Jacob invited my girlfriend to go to a fair and a pool party. I wasnt going to tell Sarah not to go and ruin her happiness.  I trusted she wouldnt cheat on me.  However sometimes I would get a little jeleaous Jacob got to spend time with Sarah.


One day over the summer I was able to see Sarah and enjoy dinner and a movie with her.  Later that night however we got to talking and she revealed part of the reason she was with me was because she felt responsible for my happiness.  Since I didnt have a lot of love from my family and used to suffer from depression. She has suffered from anxiety and depression as well. She said she couldnt focus on her own happiness. I told her she shouldnt be with me for the wrong reasons and she dumped me and said that she would still like us to be friends. The happiest 2 years of my life came to a crashing halt.


Scared I would do something to myself Sarah texted me the next few days after we broke up before I told her that I didnt want to get in the way of her happiness. So we stopped texting.  I debated doing something stupid many times but I didnt wish for Sarah to feel responsible. I would occasionally have my friends text to see if she was ok.


A month after we had broken up, I had started to accept what happened. Since she has been a big part of my life I decide to text her deciding maybe I could try this friends thing. I texted her and asked how she was doing.  She told me she was depressed after being lead on by a coworker. I asked if the coworker was Jacob, who had moved to the East coast a week before we had broke up.  She told me yes and that she had flown out to the east coast to see him. 


I was shocked that she had flown from the west to the east to see a guy she had only known for 2 months. She told me that she went because she had always wanted to see the east coast and this gave her a chance.  And she flew out and spent a day in the east.  When she got back Jacob said that the distance was too much.  She told me that she made a mistake breaking up with me and she thought about me a lot even when we werent talking.  She told me that she really loves me and travelling to the east coast really showed her how much. She said she wasnt sure if she was quite ready to get back together but she still cares and loves me.


Ever since than she and I have talked everyday.  But have decided to put off anything about our relationship till we got to see each other face to face.  Probably next week some time. Every time we go to bed or say good bye she tells me she loves me. And i do the same.


Sarah is my first love, and my best friend.  I still love her and care about her.  I know how hard it is fight depression alone.  So I plan to be there when ever she needs to talk.  I guess my real concerns are that she was ready to move on to some guy that she  had only known for 2 months.  In about a month or less after dumping me.  I wonder if she thinks of me as not the best option but good enough because Jacob rejected her. She said that she didnt see me that way and sees me as the best option.  She admits she was selfish when dumping me. Im upset that she was willing to do long distance with Jacob, but couldnt get through the summer with me. I plan to talk to her about all of this when I see her face to face. 


There's a chance that she focuses on herself and healing her depression to. In which case I doubt that we would get back together but I would still support her in getting better.


I know I love her and I genuinely care about her. But im scared of losing her again the last month has been really hard on me.  I dont know if when we talk we will get back together.  But i just wanted to know what you guys thought.  Appreciate the advice.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My first love broke up with me to find herself. Flew to the east coast got rejected by a coworker. She deals with anxiety and depression and is going to therapy for it. I don't know if I should get back together after feeling broken hearted when she left. She was ready to move on in a month but says she still loves me after she got back from the east coast. She may focus on herself, or we may get back together.  But I don't know what to do."
6trkqk,1,2017-08-14,My [19 F] best friend/someone I loved romantically [22 M] for 1 year cut me out of his life and I feel horrible. Should I try to make things better by reaching out?,shadownirvana,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6trkqk/my_19_f_best_friendsomeone_i_loved_romantically/,"Basically, I started talking to a friend who I then had a friendship and a sexual relationship with. We talked everyday for the past year (literally not missing a single day) and when I made the previous post, I was deeply in love with him and felt okay in trying to pursue a relationship with him even though I am generally very scared of relationships and commitment due to previous bad experiences. However, he rejected me as he wasn't ready. After going through such a massive heartbreak, I chose to stay friends with him and continue the unnamed relationship we had going on. 

As time passed on, it seemed like things between us were getting better and that he was interested in me too. However, I had an internship in CA and flew for CA from NYC whereas he was still in NYC. Two days after I left, he did something that basically went against what the two of us had agreed to and we had a huge misunderstanding. I was very hurt and I closed all open possibilities to get involved in a relationship with him after this and he understood that and was okay with it. However, as time passed on, he started falling in love with me too, and he really wanted to have some kind of romantic relationship with me (official/unofficial, it didn't matter to him).

However, having gone through everything that I did, I had closed myself off to the possibilities of having any sort of romantic relationship apart from being friends with benefits. So, I told him that I saw no future and that I couldn't lie to him and tell him that I can give him something that I can't and simply give him false hope and keep him around as a friend.

To this, he told me that because of how much he loved me, he would not be able to just be friends with me. He said he wouldn't be able to put away his romantic feelings for me, that it would drive him crazy being around me knowing full well he couldn't have me and that he fucked up the only opportunity he had to be with me.
I understand this and I respect him but I'm very angry in some ways because I stayed with him as his friend when he rejected me. And I'm angry that he only wants me if I agree to be with him that way but not as a friend.

Everything I do reminds me of him and in the past three days since he deleted me everywhere, I've basically been bursting into tears randomly, constantly, because everything reminds me of him. I miss him so very much. In some pathetic way, I almost want to lie to him and tell him that I'll give him some romantic thing just so I can have him back in my life.

I don't know how to deal with any of this. I have a heavy feeling in my chest 24/7 and I can't sleep well because I keep dreaming about him. He was such a big part of me; we talked throughout the day, every SINGLE day, for the past year. And now he's just gone. And he has some issues he's dealing with, and I feel so helpless because I can't be there for him and support him. I don't know if he's okay or not. And I just want him to be happy.

And no matter how badly I want him in my life, if me staying away will make him happy, then I'm ready to do that. But this feels like a breakup and it's new to me. How do I get over him? How do I stop crying uncontrollably just because I pass the subway station where we said goodbye?

I've been doing everything I can to keep myself busy to distract myself but I'm just so, so sad. And I don't know what to do. And if reaching out to him is a good idea. I'm a mess.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: **Girl likes guy, guy rejects girl, girl chooses to stay friends. Now, guy started liking girl but girl doesn't want anything romantic from guy anymore, but guy doesn't want to stay friends with girl unless she can be romantically involved. She can't so she says so and guy cuts her out of his life. Girl very, very sad and miserable. How to deal? Also, should girl reach out to guy?**"

6tsdnq,4,2017-08-15,[Discussion] School choices for career in ML from non-traditional background,kxy2144,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6tsdnq/discussion_school_choices_for_career_in_ml_from/,"Hello, I'm looking for some advice on school choices for someone from a non-traditional background (undergrad and current master in chemical engineering, focused on controls) for getting into the ML field.

Currently doing 1st year of 2 in Master in chemical engineering, my research topic is applying reinforcement learning to optimal control problems in smart grid energy management/demand-side management. 

I've been learning ML and RL for the past 3 years, can currently keep up with papers, implement these papers in Tensorflow, Pytorch and working on some additional personal projects (Deep RL related). 

Ultimately I'd like to work in a ML/RL research or applied position (non-academic, in private company research labs). My current worry is that my chem eng background is a bit of a non-traditional background, and I'm not sure how much of that will hinder my goal for getting the jobs I'm aiming for. (in my current round of internship hunting, I've gotten some call backs from startups, but nothing from the bigger companies for ML/RL research/engineering positions). I do notice that I'm still lacking in some CS fundamentals (i.e. getting past the algo/data struc interviews for these positions)

for my next steps after this Masters, besides applying for CS masters/PhDs, I'm currently looking at two additional options and would love any inputs you guys have:

1. Continue a PhD in chem eng, focused on controls, continue working on RL related research. Brush up on my CS fundamentals (algo &amp; data struc, etc) and hopefully get some good internship positions with tech companies (the big guys or startups) doing ML research.

2. Enter a CS undergrad+masters combined, can finish in about 3 years with internships. See if I would like to pursue a PhD in CS after (most likely will given the need for PhD for many ML research positions).

I guess I'm curious as to how viable the first option is, as in how ""employable"" it is for internships for a PhD from a non-traditional chemical engineering background, but with research in related ML/RL area.

Appreciate any feedback!

My name is Justin and I am a recent graduate from Penn State with a degree in engineering. I am looking to obtain the CFP certification but I am having a significantly hard time being able to qualify for the experience portion. My current employment is in the engineering field and unfortunately I cannot simply quit this job to obtain a job related to a financial planner to get the hours. 

Because of this I was looking to ""intern"" or do pro-bono work on my personal time for a CFP so I can collect hours towards the certification. I thought there may be some sort of free financial clinics (like law clinics) that help people who can't afford a financial planner where they could use any bit of help they can get, especially from someone like myself with an engineering degree. However, my journey has come up with zero results. 

If anyone here can help me in any way get hours towards the certification or any leads I can hunt down I would be truly in your debt. 

Thank you all for your time and have a great day!"

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

6tupxt,7,2017-08-15,Trapped,Leah2614,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6tupxt/trapped/,"Does anyone else just feel trapped in their life because of their parents? Apologies if this is long, I think I just need to rant.

&amp;nbsp;

Earlier this year I moved out of my family home, I'd finally saved money and recognised their toxic and controlling behaviour as damaging and I just got out of there. (Just a little context: My dad had a tracker on both mine and my sisters phones and cars, he refused to let me leave the house unless it was necessary and he would time each journey, once I came home from university 10 minutes late because my lecture ran on and he took my phone from me for a week, isolating me further. Eventually I moved out because he tried to force me to quit my job, even after banning me from applying for a student loan meaning I would have no money and no reason apart from university to leave home) After I had moved into my new flat and spent a few weeks hearing nothing from them, they started trying to get into contact, with sweet messages about how great it would be for me to come home and how much they miss me and how things would be different. My dad sent me a really long text one night about how he just can't wait until we are a family again. All of this combined with the loneliness I was feeling from moving out and a friendship breakup which happened around the same time, I tricked myself into truly believing things were different. So due to financial problems, at the end of my 6 month lease I moved back home. This was last sunday. 
&amp;nbsp;


In the time that I was gone, living without them helped me really become my own person, everything in my life was easier, I was happier and healthier, more able to thrive at work and my relationships with others were so much easier to maintain. I had dropped out of university just after moving and although my parents had never attended university, they claimed I was a failure and a disgrace for dropping out even though I intended to reapply. Without all of the stress of my parents on my life, even with dropping out, I had an outlook on my life and future that I never had before, I no longer felt like a bad person, a failure or a ""brat"" and the depressed and suicidal thoughts that felt like second nature living with my parents slowly disappeared. But now I wish I had never had that taste of freedom.. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since moving home, only just over a week ago my parents have controlled my every move, they refuse to allow me to get a car, even on my days off if I am not up and cleaning the house for my mum then i'm treated like I have committed a horrible crime and i'm constantly told how i'm a failure at life, my mum has even started trying to control which time I sleep and take showers, after not having a panic attack for months, being in such a constricting environment has caused me to experience 5 in the space of a week and I feel the suicidal and depressing thoughts crashing right back into my everyday life as though they never left. While I'd felt so organised before in sorting out university applications and jobs or internships for my future, in the short week i've been here the stress has got so much for me that any time I sit down to write out applications my mind just goes into overdrive and I break down. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have no money to leave again, I have nowhere to go, I feel so so trapped and have no idea what to do anymore."

My girlfriend says I have given up recently on myself and health and everything about myself and she seems to be right. I have crippling anxiety and alcoholism runs in my family like the plague. I feel like I need a support group. I feel alone in this town and it's no fun at all. My bestfriend not my girlfriend encourages me to drink for his entertainment. I feel lost and I feel all I can do is drink to forget. You may feel as if this is not a big problem or deal but when I drink I get angry and I have so much hate and rage built up.

**Secondly, is the touch bar a gimmick?**

Has any IDE or code editor seriously made use/short cuts for it? I am not a VIM user so I don't direly need the function keys but if the touch bar is useless, I cannot warrant the $300 Canadian upgrade to go from 13"" nTouch to 13"" Touch (the extra 2 ports and CPU bump is kinda useless for me)

I am friends with an Apple store employee, so I can get 15% off the Canadian pricing. It does make the upgrades to the 13"" less ""hurting"" to put it bluntly haha :)

Background:


I'm going into my 4th/5th year of a computer science degree (taking a year long internship), so I will be taking a lot of senior courses still to come. I just sold my surface pro so... I NEED a new laptop. I'm quite familiar with macOS as I have an old iMac 2011 at home.

Some courses I'm taking this fall (Note: I can always use the comp-sci lab, but they are linux and locked down with security. It's a PITA doing anything but basic coding. Anything project based (like Android Studio or XCODE) becomes a royal pain...so I prefer to keep those on my dropbox (pc/iMac/this MBP). 

The other issue is that well, I am at the damn lab/school late into night due to in person collaboration. So as much as I'd like to use my desktops, it's simply sometimes not an option)

* graphics openGL coding (so we manually draw a sphere and illuminate and use light tracing,etc all via C++ from scratch)

* iOS special course (Industry is coming and giving us what they want and we make apps) - big group project

* An animation course (using blender and also novel programming techniques to tweak animations, etc. This would be more of a ""behind the scenes"" type of course)

* A video games dev course in the winter: Someone from a Microsoft game studio is flying out and lecturing us for 8 hours for 7 days, then we go at it and make a game for the entire semester. I can do the majority of this on my desktop but I'd imagine there will be late nights where I'm stuck at the lab. Using the lab computers is a PITA due to the project sync/etc. Another massive big group project"

I personally love the fact that I can blog to Love Laced Couture's customers. It's like having a diary online, but I get to read the responses you ladies leave and email. So Love Laced Couture has been open for business for nearly a month and it's truly a learning experience. As a dreamer, you have this vision that you know is awesome, but the hard part for me is putting the vision to work. For me, my parents always taught me that I could be anything I wanted to be. Well I went to college thinking I wanted to be a radio host. I worked hard in school and although I didn't graduate with honors, a 3.0 was the highest GPA I ever had throughout my student career. I even got an internship with iHeartMedia, the same company that produces iHeartRadio. I was on-air during the midnight hours and I even got offered a position. I thought I was about to blow up!! I was doing urban modeling at the time as well. You know the modeling in your lingerie, showing your booty. (Nothing is wrong with that. Get that money girl and get out.)

So on my way out of college, I thought I was on my way to being a boss chick. NOT! That was so not the case. The position I was offered at the radio station was part time. Barely enough to survive on my own if I wanted to. Well God had a plan for me anyways. The VP of the radio station actually never official gave me my offer papers for the position so I continued to look for my path. Which led me to Atlanta, I took an entry level job as a manager trainee for a car rental place. Not where I thought I'd be when my parents said dream big, but I continued to grind; made that rental car money. It wasn't so bad for my first job out of college but wasn't enough. I complained and cried many nights because working for someone else can be so stressful. If you are a hard worker like me, you basically put your heart, sweat, and tears into someone else's dreams. You get yelled at every day by someone else's consumer and work overtime just to have extra money to go pop bottles with your friends. Lol.

After a year and a half of grinding someone else's dream, I managed to work my way up the corporate ladder, but could only go so far before I realized that my true dreams were dying working from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. for little money. So I did what any money hungry person would do, found a salaried job that worked one hour less. Got there and by the second day on my new job, I was not happy. The boss was a female bully. (What happened to Girl Power?) She bullied any and everyone she could, but I stayed to myself and kept my head down. She didn't like that. I didn't want to be apart of her flock. Well that job lasted almost 2 months. Left there and got another job still making the same, with the same hours, and that lasted approximately 3 weeks. So I tried it again and got another salaried job paying a little more, and that barely lasted 2 months. It was always something and many could ask, ""well what's wrong with her?""

In my new walk with Christ, I've learned that nothing was wrong with me. Sure I had a few problems here and there and could have handled some situations better, but there was nothing wrong with me. I respected my co-workers, only spoke when spoken to. Again, I kept my head down and did my work. Each job I was removed from I jumped to the next thinking that I had to have a regular job to be normal. --to survive. You ever get so caught up with life, bills, kids, etc., that you forget to ask God what's your purpose. Are we living just to live or are we living for what we were put on this earth to do?

And this is how funny God can be, I begged my husband for months to start a business that I was truly passionate about. He was a bit of a budget freak. He just didn't want to chance it. I can understand, we all come from different walks of life and I know his parents instilled structure and logic in him and if it didn't look right on paper, then it wasn't going to work. Also to add on to that, We were already hit with unexpected but happy news that we were going to be parents. So the funny thing is about 2 weeks of investing money in this business, I lost my job. Now if I would have lost my job before then my husband definitely wouldn't have agreed to start this business.

I say all of that to say, walking in your purpose is not easy. There will be distractions, test, and trials, but if you keep God at the head of your desires then you will survive and reap what's on the other side. Ask for wisdom and truly desire God's will, no matter what your parents say, your in-laws, your friends, etc., Listen to the Lord. These days and forever God will truly be the answer to all my worries.I cast my cares on Him. If something is pulling at your heart, step out on faith and let God lead you. Now, stepping out on faith is not going to be an easy walk. Money won't always be there, but it's not important. Your walk is what's important and forever will be."

I just received an email about my acceptance, and it begins in a little over a week.
This is incredible news for me. Meditation has been my escape rope for a lot of issues in my life. This opportunity is a blessing.   
This also means that there are some important decisions that I'm going to need to make in the next couple of days before I confirm or deny my acceptance...   

I've been in an internship for most of the Summer (May - Aug), and I'll be getting out within the week.
My girlfriend, despite spending most of the week with me at my apartment, hasn't spent much time with me this summer (Our work is far away).   
We've been together for 5 years, and have worked to keep our relationship together despite being long-distance through college for the last 2.   
Recently, we've decided that we're going to try and work something akin to an open relationship this year.
We've only been in a relationship with each other, and we both have a lot of anxieties surrounding not developing properly through college (both with experiencing relationships with others and pursuing academics wholeheartedly).   
Our colleges are quite far apart (~3 hours), so it's difficult to see each other as often as we would like to.   
 She has a job that she works a couple of hours a week at, and she gave her two weeks notice in a little bit ago so that we could have some sort of trip together before we both go back to school.      
I've yet to tell her about my acceptance to this retreat.  

 If I went, we wouldn't have any actual time to spend with each other before we effectively part ways back at college.    
This is difficult for me to talk about, especially since our motivations towards this partial separation are due to a lot of fear and confusion.    
I can see myself spending the rest of my life with this person, yet I know that we can't continue with the way things currently are.   
Part of the reason for me needing anxiety preventing tools is due to the stress that comes with the separation and effort it takes to keep the relationship stable when we can only talk over the phone and face time to communicate for a majority of the year.   
It is also difficult knowing that this retreat experience would be immensely beneficial for me when i've had mental health issues in the past and that if I denied, I'd be missing out only to hold together a relationship that will be further apart during the upcoming year.   
This conflict speaks to a lot of internal turmoil that I've had over the past several months, and I'd love if someone could help me get some insight about it. (If this isn't the right subreddit, I'd love it if someone could point me to a better one)   
tl;dr I got into a Vipassana retreat and i'm not sure if I should go, or spend the remaining time in my summer with my girlfriend of 5 years before we head back to college (where we won't devote ourselves to our relationship as much as we have in the past)."

I've been in a governmental accounting internship for almost two months, which I'm really enjoying. The internship will last for 1 year, and my salary is $33,000. I have essentially been told I will be hired as a non-intern next year. Networking with someone who works at the organization played a role in me getting the internship.

As of two days ago, the same person came to me with another opportunity. Where I live, we have SO many governmental accounting jobs, and most of them have far better compensation and benefits than public accounting. This opportunity is with a related governmental organization as an entry-level internal auditor, and the salary is a mind-boggling $70,000. I know people coming out of the MAcc, with CPAs, at good firms, who are making mid $50k in my state. 

I'm also super interested in auditing, but didn't want to do the travel/constant long hours of external. Additionally, I sometimes feel like I don't have a lot to do at my internship, as I finish my projects relatively quickly. I'm someone who likes to stay busy constantly. 

With all of this said, how unprofessional would it be to leave my current employer for the other opportunity? Would it be something you would do? I worked my part time job from senior year of high school up until my senior year of college. I try to be loyal to places that treat me well, and this is really giving me a moral dilemma. Is it just business to do something like this?

(If anyone is an internal auditor, insight into the profession would be appreciated as well. We really stuck to external and the PCAOB in my audit and compliance class.)"

Although my internships went well, my addiction accelerated last year and I lost control of my life. I got a DUI, stopped talking to friends, stopped eating, began self harming, the works.

January came, and my work quality plummeted. In March I went on medical leave for 3 months to go to rehab and work on my mental health, but soon after I started drinking again. I haven't had anything in two days, but I'm still shaky and can barely think straight. 

As much as people bitch about busy season here, I legitimately feel the massive overtime is a contributor to the drinking. I want to find a new job but don't know how to go about it. I'm in extension season and hours are high again, wouldn't it be bad if I left before it was over? Plus I don't know if I need another medical leave to go through AA and do the steps, would that be acceptable? But if I finish the leave and take a new job right after, wouldn't that be burning the bridge with my employer? I like my coworkers and they have families and social lives, I don't want to ruin their next couple months cleaning up my mess.

What would you do in my situation? I don't care about bolstering my resume or climbing the ladder in public, I just want a decent job without stress or unpaid overtime that pays enough to cover the bills. I'm afraid I'll go on a massive bender or kill myself if something doesn't change..."

He has a baby that's going to be born in 3 months, so he went for asking for a better cut. He was willing to negotiate to ~~15~~, maybe 20 25-30% . Maybe even willing to consider ~~25%~~ 40% if they could throw in other things, because they're friends and have history together. [EDIT: According to Alex, RSD takes more than 50% of what they make. According to another source, They take 66, they say 1/3 for the instructors, 1/3 for tyler/papa, 1/3rd invests back into the company] [EDIT 2: Actually been hearing from multiple sources that Papa takes more like 45-66%, leaving Todd with only 55-33%. One of those sources is Alex Social himself from his 4weekNatural facebook group. Direct link to this post 

https://www.facebook.com/groups/4WNWORLD/permalink/365789783836494/ ""the Reddit article is bullshit. For one, RSD takes 50% of what instructors earn and the personal stuff is not true. I dont know the details, but I know hes better off with out RSD, and can be a huge success outside the industry""] [EDIT 3: If you want to see a video on Alex Social's issues with RSD, watch this https://youtu.be/k8xulztQQRs?t=48m11s ] .

Papa gave a firm no, Todd requested he sleep on it, talk it over with his mentors, etc. Then all of a sudden today Papa deleted all of articles, youtube videos, even his forum posts.

They then specifically banned Todd from RSD Summit. Not only that, he has assistants and close friends at summit, they were specifically asked to leave. They were sitting down at the seminars and were specifically asked to leave. They already spent money flying out there and buying hotel, wtf.

The most funny thing is, Papa expected Todd to cave in. He rationale was people don't appreciate something unless it's taken away from him. He thought all this bullshit would make Todd appreciate RSD more. What a fucking idiot.

Apparently Papa immensely admires Donald Trump and that's what's been causing all of his idiot behaviors in the past year or so.

I wish Todd best of luck. He has a baby on the way. That shit is expensive. He also needs to be attentive to his baby mama. He doesn't have time to restructure his income systems.
Weak leadership from Tyler IMO. Todd is infinitely more talented than Papa would ever be. Tyler should realize enough is enough and finally kick that fucking idiot to the curb once and for all. Like Alex said, he has no real talent and is easily replaceable.
As for Todd, he is the fucking Man. Many people would have caved in due to a baby being on the way, but he stayed true to his vision and his principles. This is going to be one of the most intense years of his life, and the very beginning of perhaps the most profound chapter in his life.

UPDATE 8/28/17 3:34 PM PST 

Papa is now switching from claiming to his workers that him being casted as the bad was his idea all along to protect all the other RSD coaches and execs because the mainstream audience couldn't comprehend their very good 'business decisions' ( his favorite phrase ), and he knew this all along. And then in a flash he becomes very viscerally upset at RSD's fanbase not appreciating all he did for RSD and the pickup community. The dude is in full Trump melt-down mode. 

**MAJOR** UPDATE 8/24/17 1:34 PM PST 

Todd is already back in action, and released facebooks ads promoting pickup services http://imgur.com/25d4Sns . . . and Papa's lawyers have officially have served cease and desist papers to threaten to sue Todd, since he's breaking the 'can't teach pickup before 4 years after you leave RSD' clause of his contract. 

This is a big deal. The conflict between them hasn't simmered down, it has gotten worse. Also, Todd is the first person they served papers for this particular clause. They have threatened to sue many people for breaking their 'can't teach pickup for 4 years' clause, but Todd's the first to actually get served papers. They didn't even serve Alex social any papers, only verbally threatened to sue. 

That is the big news. Here's other random intel that is being discussed among RSD employees. 

Papa was upset at Todd when he did a collaboration video with Justin Wayne, since Justin was benefiting from RSD's brand. 

Todd received A LOT of pushback from RSD for creating his week long immersion program. Some how Papa calculated that it would make RSD overall less money. I guess because they couldn't do the freetour/hotseat/bootcamp in one weekend to cut down on costs, and would deplete each city of future potential bootcamp clients. Apparently Todd agreed with that assessment, but countered it would be a superior program compared to the bootcamp, since bootcamps have major limitations to have much change they can induce (only 3 days). When Papa eventually approved of the program, he thought Todd would be extremely grateful, but Todd thought it should have been Papa who should have been grateful RSD now has the most effective pickup program created. 

Todd is also appalled at what RSD did to Vegas Immersion. That was his baby of one of his most favorite things he created. It was a masterpiece and everyone who took his, Max, Julien, or Madison's Vegas immersion said it was possibility the best pickup program to ever exist. He wanted to leave, but make sure that whoever would take over would uphold the quality. 

He didn't even know who Luke was, but was pressured into approving him by RSD in the 2 weeks that he was interviewing him. Since Luke joined the quality of the program plummeted. First thing they do is raised the price from 1500 to 2000, and remove a lot of the features like office hours, improv class, being recorded and having your infield broken down by an instructor (you gotta pay an extra 400 for that now), reduce the amount of coaching from assistants, cut down on number of debriefs, and removed Luke going out altogether. 

Luke still tells prospective clients the amount of days a week he goes out with the students, he says 'officially, 3', and students join the program and ask about his lack of going out he says 'yeah, *officially*, 3 ;) '. 

They used to also give clients advice for the best places to stay for cheap. But replaced that with an affiliate site for hotels, so that they can get more money off of clients for referrals. 

Todd was appalled by all this, and factored into his decision to distance himself from this low quality of conduct. 

Both Papa and Tyler promised Todd A LOT to get him to re-join RSD in 2012. At the time, Todd has a very promising career in working for a hedgefund. He worked his ass off to get the right mentors and jobs to put himself in the right position. A lot of the aforementioned promises were unwritten, but Papa Todd and Tyler were really close (they were all at the Project Hollywood mansion) so Todd trusted them. 

Todd felt that he jumped through a lot of hoops, and bend-over backwards to fulfill what they wanted of him (expanded the RSD brand, released products and programs that expanded the limits of what can be taught and produce transformations), worked his fucking ass off. But Papa/Tyler never fulfilled their ends. Around 2015 Todd began to suspect they're dangling the carrot right in front of him, and started restructuring his systems in the case of a business divorce. 

Realize this. Papa, Tyler, Julien, and Max are all millionaires. Todd is not (neither is Jeffy but he's notoriously lazy). To be fair, Julien had the most potent pickup brand to ever exist, and Max made a very intelligent move to include his whole hotseat in a online product. 

Todd is ignoring the lawyers order because of a combination A) planning to conduct business in states where non-compete contracts can't be enforces B) may legally have ground to sue RSD himself in payments owed C) having a lot of dirt on RSD himself (Tyler being an illegal immigrant, RSD conducting services in other countries without paying tax in said countries, RSD hiring immigrants for jobs without proper work authorization, etc.). 

UPDATE 8/26/17 3:34 AM PST 

Jeffy has finally commented on the situation, along with referring to this post. 

""yes, go on reddit to get all the false and completely made up information about the situation you need, from people with literally no insight into the actual events""

""At this point, both sides are legally obligated to remain silent. Let's just say the real story isn't what you think, even remotely""

""Let's just say little toddy may not have been as innocent as everyone thinks""

"" Interesting how everyone jumps to the conclusion that RSD are the assholes in the situation tho. Seems about par for the course for the last entire fucking 15 years.""

""Have fun with your little reddit circle jerk tho lol""

[**Edit: Jeffy deleted his posts**. Probably because he realized how retarded it is to pretend to be perplexed at the hate, when we all know RSD deleted Todd's channel, and several ex-RSD instructors confirmed the 50% cut and suing those who try to teach pickup after leaving. And the pathetic attempt to insinuate Todd's fault in the conflict. And throwing himself into this, when all the hate/blame has been primarily on Papa until now. And defending himself against Reddit, when nobody even mentioned Reddit. And not remaining silent, while claiming ""both sides are legally obligated to remain silent"". It seems like Jeffy is delusional enough to think all the hate if coming from obscure reddit thread. As if the hate is due to obscure reddit gossip, and not shit that they actually did. ]

Very interesting. For one thing, everything that was mentioned has been backed up by a ton of ex-RSD associates, assistants, and even instructors. I can't mention private sources, but public ones are Bradacus, RSD Sam (according to Bradacus) Alex Social, and Frank from pickup decoded. Even Glenn Ackerman said this was a long time in the making. 

It also looks like Jeffy has come out against Todd. As in, in his opinion Todd is to blame for the situation. Not sure what to make of it. For one thing, even Jeffy has alluded to a lot of the bullshit with RSD executives in the past. He is still close friends with Alex social. 

And so far, there hasn't been an ounce of evidence for any of the blame on Todd's side. The 50% cut has been confirmed by both Alex social as well as Frank. Both Frank (see update below) and Alex have confirmed that RSD tried to prevent them from teaching pickup for 4 years. 

Also, it's been confirmed that all of Todd's content is deleted. Nobody can find his youtube channel (of over 107k subscribers), videos, articles, or posts. 

Also, almost everyone has something bad to say about Papa, even Tyler (according to Manwhore). But, almost everyone has something good to say about Todd, except Papa, and now Jeffy. But, also almost everyone has something good to say about Jeffy. 

We will continue to look for any wrong doing on the side of Todd. But, so far there isn't a drop of evidence. I will run this by my RSD contacts to see if they can poke around and find anything. 

UPDATE 8/26/17 12:13 AM PST 

Frank from pickup decoded has confirmed that RSD tried to prevent him from teaching pickup for 4 years. From a comment on his latest youtube channel. 

""Did Papa/RSD try to prevent you from teaching pickup for 4 years like they did with Alex?""
-Some youtube comment

""Yes though i photocopy the contract before signing by then in m(May 2012)
and i had my attorney review it. I'm good""
-Frank

Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv7Yputao88

UPDATE 8/22/17 5:34 PM PST 

Frank from PickUp Decoded just posted on why he left RSD. He was assistant and employee with RSD for 3 years. A lot of the video is fluff but confirms some of the intel going on.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv7Yputao88

Starts talking about his involvement with RSD around 10 minute mark. 

Answers questions around 20 minute mark. 

Talks about Todd/Papa around 33 minute mark 

Confirmed instructors start out with 33% of what they bring in. Can negotiate up to 50% max. 

UPDATE 8/21/2017 4:21 PM PST

RSD Max just commented on the situation on his youtube vid. 

&gt;RSDMax10 hours ago Already answered it on Facebook, IG, IG stories, Snapchat and RSDNation but in case you missed it I'll copy paste it here:

&gt;Yes, Todd is no longer part of RSD, he decided to do his own thing. It has nothing to do with Papa, he simply didn't want to be part of RSD anymore. No hard feelings, 100% respect, I personally remain friends with him, wish him all the best for his future endeavors and hope to be nerding out with him in NYC soon!﻿

I guess Max is just trying to be a company man. Tyler already heavily implied the conflict was in between his two 'brothers'. If not Papa, who? Julien??

Also, anyone who knows anyone who is working at RSD can vouch it's a Papa vs Todd situation, with Tyler trying to be a negotiator. 

UPDATE 8/21/2017 10:45 PM PST

This is the first time Todd has commented since this conflict went public. He commented from his Instagram. 

""Thanks for your support guys. Not gonna make any comment on the events everyone is talking about, but my goal is, and has always been, to communicate useful and empowering knowledge to as many people as possible, no matter what obstacles may come along.""

-Todd

It's on of the comments on the Instagram picture here

UPDATE 8/21/2017 9:32 PM PST

Not a real update, just call to action. 

JulienHimself just released a video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4QPkFWMiGU

Please comment to encourage him to resist deleting his Todd collaboration videos. 

UPDATE 8/20/2017 4:58 PM PST

Call to Action: As previously reported, Papa has been pushing hard for all the other instructors to delete all collaboration videos with Todd. 

Tyler already deleted one of videos with Todd ( the one with the 2 A.D.D Asian girls on the bridge of chicago released not too long ago). So much for being mr neutral. 

I am calling on people to make an account of the RSDNation forum ( http://www.rsdnation.com/forums/main-forum ) and post a thread imploring Papa rescind the order to the other instructors to delete their collaboration videos, and to restore any there was already deleted (like the Tyler Chicago one).  Heads, you need to post at least 5 comments before you're allowed to post a threads, 5 comments through should hammer that out in less than a minute. 

The pickup community will miss out of truly great material that is helping people. Maybe people in this community will have access to them, but we must care for the entire pickup/selfhelp community. 

Todd probably has access to the original footage of his videos. But, if any other instructor put out any videos, they're the property of Papa and they're contractually obligated to do whatever Papa wants.

Papa is justifying all of his nefarious actions in the name of a 'Business decision'. Lets make this the worst business decision he ever made. Lets make this the most unprofitable business decision he ever made. 

Take the time to make an account on the RSD Nation forums, and post your feelings on the decision. And PLEASE do it in the following way:

-Spent at least 45 seconds crafting your post, just don't copy and paste something. Your message will hit harder if it's genuine and comes from the heart. You don't have spend 5 minutes, just type for 45 seconds about what's in your heart. 

-Please be POLITE. I know that there is a lot of very justified anger at Papa right now. But the most impactful protocol is to implore and appeal to his good side. Even if he has none, by ignoring a polite, peaceful, and heartfelt message, it will make him look at that much worse if he ignores the message. 

This one is mine

&gt;Papa, anything we can as a community do to convince you to stop ordering RSD instructors to delete their collaboration vids

&gt;I know you're in the middle of some very complex business decisions. But I beg, a lot of the collaboration videos are masterpieces and a lot of them are immensly helping people. Please focus on how much they're helping people as part of your business decisions. Lots of hours went into many of them. 

&gt;And please restore the one's you already ordered to be deleted. I know that the one with Tyler on the bridge of chicago was already deleted. Please restore it. I cherish every video I see of Tyler and Todd gaming. 

&gt;I understand and respect this is a very complicated time for you. But please recognize how hurtful it is to destroy content. 

&gt;With highest respects,

&gt;-Monkey

http://www.rsdnation.com/node/852702

This will let Papa know what we are watching him, and we are judging him based on his egotistical destructive behaviors. 

This is not just a business decision (that's what he's claiming, we all know it's an ego gratification decision). His decisions have a very direct and significant impact on the community. All this destructive behavior is **hurting us**. It is preventing Todd and other RSD instructors from **helping us**.  

Again, please be very respectful. 

MAJOR UPDATE 8/19/2017 7:22 AM PST

It is being rumored among RSD staff that Papa is pushing for all the other RSD instructors to delete all their collaboration videos with Todd. It seems that Tyler just deleted the last one of the collaboration videos he did with Todd.

If you can, please backup any collaboration videos with Todd from the other instructors youtube channel.

UPDATE 8/19/2017 7:22 AM PST

RSD Tyler Owen Cook just released video with a ton of social commentary on the situation, it's a video of his kids and he's essential accusing Papa and Todd of acting like children. The video is focking brilliant in my opinion lol. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LISA2fVFax0

As other users pointed out, this video implies several things. This isn't a just a conflict over 'business vision'. It's a conflict over ego, and over something tangible (money, the youtube channel with 107k subscribers). Tyler also alluded to something that was lost forever (maybe the youtube channel with over 107k subscribers). 

Also, this isn't a conflict of Todd vs entire RSD(including Tyler), as Papa has been trying to frame things to the other RSD employees. He is trying to get everything to share blame in his fucking stupid decision (again, another Trump behavior). This is definitely Papa vs Todd. 

Tyler is trying to play neutral party again. But considering every single person, from anonymous  internal RSD employee, to non anonymous ex-RSD associates (Manwhore, Frank Pickup decoded, Bradacus, Glenn Ackerman, Alex Social) has nothing but bad things to say about Papa and nothing but good things to say about Todd. Without a doubt it's Papa whose in the wrong. 

UPDATE 8/19/2017 7:04 AM PST

Glenn Ackerman also commented on the situation, confirming the contents of this article. For those who don't know, Glenn is Tyler/Julien's presence coach, and his material is actually the foundation of Julien's Transformation Mastery material. His material is still featured in Tyler's Hotseat @ Home. 

Video of Glenn working with Tyler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDBrheWIeko

This is what Glenn had to say of the Todd situation. 

""Been coming for a long time.""

When asked to comment on this article, he said this

""Sounds about right. Business divorce is rarely civil""

UPDATE 8/19/2017 6:13 AM PST

As someone else pointed out, you can still buy Brad Branson (Wade Alters) products from the RSD story. Brad Branson is a former instructor who also separated from RSD. However, his products are still being sold in the RSD store. Which further proves that RSD's treatment of Todd is highly unusual. I may have to do with Bran Branson not teaching pickup anymore, which would comply with RSD's policy of not allowing former instructors to teach pickup/dating advice for 4 years. 

Link to store 

http://articles.rsdnation.com/store/ 

UPDATE 8/18/2017 1:01 AM PST

Papa is now claiming they had the legal right to delete his Youtube channel and products. Papa is claiming that everything he filmed, edited, created, marketed, etc while working for RSD is wholly owned by Real Social Dynamics Inc. 

This is similar to how Conan O' Brien couldn't use any of the material/characters/bits he created while he was at NBC, since everything Conan created while at NBC is wholly owned by NBC, and had to come up with brand new stuff when he went to TBS. 

This is from people who are working at RSD, and not from any official statement RSD has put out. 

Knowing him and his liberal use of contracts, I'm not surprised. Even if that clause is enforceable (I doubt it is), it is still very morally wrong to do so. 

Todd expanded RSD's brand as much if not more than RSD expanded Todd's. Todd brought in a shitload of money since they take 33-50% of the money he brings in. Todd also did a lot of the marketing himself, and put a lot of his own money into the marketing/editing of his content. 


UPDATE 8/18/2017 8:01 AM PST

Manwhore wrote his piece on the situation. Manwhore was a RSD Instructor, abet one of the 'hidden' ones, like how RSD Derek was a hidden instructor. He has a very deep history with the company.  

&gt; I spit my beer at my keyboard when I saw this. Lol. RIP Todd. But something tells me he'll be back, ;). [In reference to the Wolverine/Todd Meme]

&gt; All this being said... if Papa keeps robbing Tyler of all the ""sources"" he's surrounded himself with, will his golden hen continue to lay golden eggs? Only time will tell.

&gt; And if now so many ex-Rsd A-listers have gone off on their own, either forced or otherwise... WHY would anyone really care about joining that company if it's been proven over and over again that they can do it on their own? Other than a quick boost of fame? Papa's only going to reap what he sowed. 

&gt; Papa has worked to destroy himself over and over again. As Tyler told me years ago, ""Papa's the kind of guy that would shoot himself in the head if he thought the bullet would keep going and kill his enemy."" This is nothing new, but this could be the final straw. 

&gt; This is what ruined my relationship with Papa almost a decade ago. I could not stand by while he treated interns like personal slaves, and subsequently set up the entire company to work on the backs of free labor from young men that got nothing in return but a false sense of validation. It's the same business practice at play here with Todd.

&gt; Alex (ex-Rsd) has already dropped the bomb of Rsd Tyler's special ""status"" (I will not confirm or deny) .. which would mean that Tyler actually holds no part of the financial reins of Rsd. Which stands to wonder..   does Papa have Tyler under some sort of financial slavery? I haven't associated with the Rsd guys for years, but I heard he's only renting a room in a Hollywood Hills mansion, doesn't actually own it. He's never owned a car or driven in the States (for reason stated above).

&gt; What really IS going on? 

&gt; This seems more like The Wizard Of Oz every day..

&gt; Taking the chode on the yellow brick road. We're off to see the wizard. 

Source: http://manwhore.org/forum/content/lmaoo-what-wolverine-thinks-rsd-todd

My take: wow. Everyone that I know who works with/for RSD has nothing good to say about Papa. But this is the most surgically precise comment on Papa I've heard yet, and gives new insight on why Tyler/RSD can't get rid of that leech. 

UPDATE 8/18/2017 5:06 AM PST

Pickup Decoded Frank [who was an employee and assistant with RSD for 2.5 years, actually trained RSDMax when he was starting out] put a video out on the situation. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGl7d_2njoo

Highlights: 

-gives details on pay structure. When starting out, when instructing a bootcamp, the instructor gets 500$, out of the 6000$ the company brings in (3 students paying 2000 each). That's 8.3 %, much much much lower than the 33% reported earlier. 

-For products, instructors get 33% of profit. 33% goes to Owen, and another 33% goes to  . . . .Papa aka Nick Kho. Not even 'reinvested back into the company', it straight up goes to Papa. As instructors gain seniority, they can get closer to 50%, as reported by Alex Social earlier.  

-Frank says Nick Kno has no respect for his interns. Frank never got along with him. Says Papa is greedy and has no talent.  

UPDATE 8/18/2017 4:00 AM PST

RSD Max made on one of Youtube videos:

""I already posted a statement on my IG stories and Snapchat. Bottom line: Todd's vision was to continue alone without being part of a bigger group, which is cool. I'm still friends with him and wish him all the best for future endeavors!﻿""

Source: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYSV6icIo04

Doesn't seem to cover a lot of the drama that has been going on for years. Also, absolutely no reason to end the relationship in such a spiteful and abrasiveness manner, especially deleting his
Youtube channel with over 100k subscribers.  

UPDATE 8/17/2017 7:00 PM PST

Tyler commented on the situation on his instagram. 

""rsdtylerMy awesome ex girlfriend @cjsparxx had her birthday party last night. I popped by to say hi. Go stop by her IG and wish her a happy bday!

Now if I could only get another certain ex team mate (and still very valued friend) to work things out with Papa and get the nice easy exit I worked so hard to get him, my life would be pretty epic lol.

Been working on it. Trying my absolute best. I care deeply about all parties and want to see what's right for the community. Will post an update soon.""

-Tyler

https://www.instagram.com/p/BX6mPbTAdFK/?taken-by=rsdtyler

This confirms several things we've reported so far: 

1) The beef is mainly between Papa vs Todd, not Papa/Tyler vs Todd as Papa has been trying to frame things. Although from the tone, Tyler is heavily implying the blame lie on Todd, not Papa. Tyler is trying to spin the situation both ways simultaneously. Very interesting. 

2) RSD is finally admitting that they're giving Todd a hard time on purpose, with the 'easy exit' talk. The 'easy exit' could be in reference to giving Todd back his youtube account, and this is the first instance they hinted of retaliation as a motive for deleting all of Todd's content. 

One can only speculate what exactly they wanted from Todd in order for him to avoid the 'hard exit'. But very most likely it's exactly what they wanted from Alex Social: A 4 year ban on a career related to dating, pickup, and social dynamics in general. Alex talks about it here
 
https://youtu.be/k8xulztQQRs?t=57m53s

FUN FACT, if you ever signed up for a bootcamp, hotseat, or even a freetour, there's a clause in the contract that says you're not allowed to be involved in a company that teaches pickup or social dynamics or they will sue you. Straight from their terms and conditions ""I do and will not own, operate or work for a company or internet website that teaches men how to be successful with women and dating, for 4 years after attending the program. . . . I will forfeit to Real Social Dynamics any revenue earned from operating or working for a company or internet website that teaches men how to be successful with women and dating during the 4 year period, and I am still obligated to keep all trade secrets confidential. "" 

Source: https://www.realsocialdynamics.com/Shop/Terms.asp

They also hide the terms and conditions. For example here, https://www.realsocialdynamics.com/Shop/Order.asp?Action=Add&amp;Item=274&amp;Removed=&amp;Quantity=100&amp;Variant=10962&amp;Source=&amp;src1=&amp;src2=&amp;src3=&amp;src4=&amp;src5=&amp;src6=&amp;src7=&amp;src8=&amp;src9=&amp;ref1=&amp;ref2=&amp;ref3=

They hide it at the very bottom, and make not mention to the clauses of the terms and conditions, you have to click on it. And even then, they hide that nefarious clause in the middle of the common sense fluff jargon. 

UPDATE 8/17/2017 4:00 AM PST

So far updates includes comments by RSD Tyler, Alex Social, Evolution Daily, Bradicus, and RSD Papa. Updated info includes details about the pay structure, summit drama, and overall drama. 

Please read this disclaimer. While I have sources in RSD, they are not the 15 or so people (out of several hundreds) who know **exactly** know what happened. Take this as intel, not fact. However, other RSD employees, interns, and even former instructors are vouching for the pay percentages discussed below. RSD Alex Social and Bradicus himself has said they take close to 50%. 

Also, it is a fact that RSD deleted all of Todd's articles, profiles, posts, and youtube videos. This can be confirmed by looking for Todd's youtube channel, or trying to find any of his stuff on www.rsdnation.com. 

Another fact, RSD kicked out at least one of Todd's assistant from summit. This has been confirmed by multiple sources. 

UPDATED 8/17/2017 4:00 AM PST

Bradicus commented on this post. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECx0oCrV_cU

In summary, he says there are several things in this post he knows for a fact is false. Bradicus is a very reliable person, so if he says it, it must be true. He did however confirm several things mentioned in his post. That RSD takes close to 50% of what Todd earns. That Papa isn't the most competent guy. There is something up with RSD which unfair in how it treats it's instructors. He also mentioned how he feels that RSD Sam did not leave under the best terms. 

UPDATED 8/17/2017 2:45 AM PST

One of Todd's assistant being kicked out of summit has been confirmed by multiple sources. As far as I'm concerned, that event is a fact, not intel. 

UPDATED 8/16/2017 8:19 pm PST

**RSD Tyler aka Owen Cook commented on this post** 

&gt;Agreed.  I'm more disappointed than anyone.  He's been someone I invested into for 15 years because I'm a fan and want to see him win, and I would never lose a friend over money.  Did literally everything within my power to get it right not only for him but the community.  I don't speak on people who are not present, but if he wants me to give my take on it I can.  He just sort of wanted to handle it his own way, and I respect that.  The weird quote I've seen passed around is nonsense btw.  Full random. 

&gt;I gave everything I had to get it right.  Huge amount of time, energy, emotion, and commitment to make sure he is good and the community is good.  This was an unacceptable outcome to me.  If Todd wants me to share on it I can, but I am letting him handle things his own way and I don't like speaking on people who are not present.

&gt;-Tyler

He made these comments after someone posted by post on his newest youtube video 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEFvTcpVBpc

Not sure what to make of this, calling it nonsense and full random. I have legit sources, but they are not the 15 or so people (out of several hundreds) who **exactly** know what happened. This is the best intel they could provide me. OTOH they're response was FUCKED UP by deleting all instances of Todd, and all of his posts,articles,videos with no announcement. This was very weird, unusual, and unprofessional, that is a fact. Tyler may have some shame in how things turned out. 


UPDATED 8/16/2017 2:35 PM PST

I have several sources on this, and will continue to update as more information comes out. 

**Alex Social commented on my post** 

 ""the Reddit article is bullshit. For one, RSD takes 50% of what instructors earn and the personal stuff is not true. I dont know the details, but I know hes better off with out RSD, and can be a huge success outside the industry""

https://www.facebook.com/groups/4WNWORLD/permalink/365789783836494/

They already deleted all of his articles, programs, and forum handles. 

**ORIGINAL POST BELOW:**

**Just heard this from my buddy who works at RSD.  EDIT: Details are still coming out. Out of the 700 or so people who work for RSD, there are only 15 people who know what's going on, and that includes all the instructors.** 

**Papa gets ~~33%~~  close to 50% of what Todd makes cuz RSD made his brand. Todd wanted the standard ~~10%~~ 15-20% which is what affiliates usually make. Been wanting this for a while. He has a baby that's going to be born in 3 months, so he went for asking for a better cut. He was willing to negotiate to ~~15, maybe 20~~ 25-30% . Maybe even willing to consider ~~25%~~ 40% if they could throw in other things, because they're friends and have history together. [EDIT: According to Alex, RSD takes more than 50% of what they make. According to another source, They take 66, they say 1/3 for the instructors, 1/3 for tyler/papa, 1/3rd invests back into the company] [EDIT 2: Actually been hearing from multiple sources that Papa takes more like 45-66%, leaving Todd with only 55-33%. One of those sources is Alex Social himself from his 4weekNatural facebook group. Direct link to this post https://www.facebook.com/groups/4WNWORLD/permalink/365789783836494/ ""the Reddit article is bullshit. For one, RSD takes 50% of what instructors earn and the personal stuff is not true. I dont know the details, but I know hes better off with out RSD, and can be a huge success outside the industry""] [EDIT 3: If you want to see a video on Alex Social's issues with RSD, watch this https://youtu.be/k8xulztQQRs?t=48m11s ] .**

**Papa gave a firm no, Todd requested he sleep on it, talk it over with his mentors, etc. Then all of a sudden today Papa deleted all of articles, youtube videos, even his forum posts.** 


**They then specifically banned Todd from RSD Summit. Not only that, he has assistants and close friends at summit, they were specifically asked to leave. They were sitting down at the seminars and were specifically asked to leave. They already spent money flying out there and buying hotel, wtf.** 

**The most funny thing is, Papa expected Todd to cave in. He rationale was people don't appreciate something unless it's taken away from him. He thought all this bullshit would make Todd appreciate RSD more. What a fucking idiot.** 

**Apparently Papa immensely admires Donald Trump and that's what's been causing all of his idiot behaviors in the past year or so.** 

**I wish Todd best of luck. He has a baby on the way. That shit is expensive. He also needs to be attentive to his baby mama. He doesn't have time to restructure his income systems.** 

**Weak leadership from Tyler IMO. Todd is infinitely more talented than Papa would ever be. Tyler should realize enough is enough and finally kick that fucking idiot to the curb once and for all. Like Alex said, he has no real talent and is easily replaceable.** 

**As for Todd, he is the fucking Man. Many people would have caved in due to a baby being on the way, but he stayed true to his vision and his principles. This is going to be one of the most intense years of his life, and the very beginning of perhaps the most profound chapter in his life.**


Update: Papa is telling his direct employees that it's a dispute between Todd and Papa and Tyler, implying that both Tyler and Papa share responsibility in firing of Todd. But from what people are hearing from Tyler, Tyler was more neutral, and seemed like he was playing to be more neutral to convince Papa to give Todd a bigger cut. 

So while the phrase ""it's a dispute between Todd and Papa/Tyler is technically correct, the implication is anything but. Even those closer to Papa say without a doubt this was all Papa. Though Tyler doesn't seem to care that this is what Papa is saying/implying. 

Here are some official statements made by Papa.

&gt;Todd had his business dissolved with Real Social Dynamics due to a difference in vision with how Todd wanted to do business with Real Social Dynamics. If you want high quality RSD Motivational videos, check out the Youtube channel RSD Motivation.

Someone posted a snippit of what I wrote on the RSDNation forums, and Papa replied to it

&gt;Sorry to correct you Picop31, but that is not the business relationship or agreement we had with Todd, and you can expect a public statement from Tyler in the future. In addition, we never asked any of his assistants to leave. We invited them to come to Summit. Todd was disinvited from Summit prior to deleting anything because Tyler and I believed that Todd would not continue working with RSD and we did not want him at Summit due to that fact. As I said earlier, we had a difference on how the vision of the company that Todd had for how he wanted to do business with Real Social Dynamics. That said, him having a baby was something I congratulated Todd for and I wished him the best. The issues that RSD has with Todd are not a simple issue of negotiating for money rather there were many ways that Todd wanted to do business that are not congruent. Although vague, we will give more details later.

EDIT

This post got mentioned by Evolution Daily 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XwpRp7-rA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m17s

Edit

A little off topic but I thought this was a hilarious and relevant meme someone posted below 
http://i.imgur.com/d3C38EI.png

Todd has done a shit load of work by expanding the RSD Brand and quality. He was also extremely loyal. When the Julien Sexual Assault scandal went world wide, ALL the RSD instructors stopped posted, except Todd. He even did live webinars. All the other instructors were too afraid. Alex and Brad even left. And Todd wasn't even mentioned in the initial scandal, cuz his material was so clean. He was willing to risk being associated with sexual assault and coercion in the world wide media just to be loyal to RSD. That is one of the biggest acts of loyalty I have ever seen. 

The more I hear, the more that is seems like Papa is only in RSD because A) He was one of the only people who stuck with Tyler when he was going through his piece-of-shit phase in his early 20's as depicted by The Game B) He put up the initial capital he got from his parents for Real Social Dynamics, and he littered the company's legal documents with Iron-clad contracts to make it near next to impossible to kick him out. 

Here's Alex confirming some of the stuff we were talking about (pay structures, Papa's incompetence, etc)  https://youtu.be/k8xulztQQRs?t=48m11s"

6ty4kz,2,2017-08-15,"Me [20F] with my soon-to-be roommates [22M and 24 F], one hates my boyfriend [27M] of 5 months and the other is playing Switzerland",boommars,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ty4kz/me_20f_with_my_soontobe_roommates_22m_and_24_f/,"Hi guys! Some assistance would be appreciated in this matter. This isn't a problem with my relationship so much as it is a problem about my relationship.

**Background:** I'm moving into an apartment 5 minutes off campus with a long-time friend, Red, and one of our mutual friends, Cleo. We've been moving things into the apartment over the course of this month and it's been very exciting, since we have compatible habits and have communicated well. I was so happy to move in with both of them until recently.

Back in February I met this wonderful man, Santana. He's been my first long-term relationship since leaving an abusive relationship two years ago, and it's been fantastic. We finish each other's sentences and are really comfortable with one another; we're well-suited on most levels and have been able to work through issues and insecurities peacefully. I've fallen pretty hard for him and vice versa. Almost everyone has been supportive of this relationship, and I couldn't be happier about it. Until recently, I thought Red and Cleo were happy for me, too.

**The problems:** I brought Santana with me to help move a futon and a tv stand into the apartment about a week and a half ago. Red was there, sorting his kitchen wares out, and he visibly bristled when Santana walked in. We haven't seen each other much this summer, as Red had an internship on the other side of the state, and he hadn't met my boyfriend yet. Santana is a big dude, 6'4 and very solid/muscular, and he has a visible sleeve tattoo. Red seemed intimidated and didn't include Santana in any conversations we had; his coldness was uncustomary. He also refused to shake my boyfriend's hand when he introduced himself. Santana was very friendly throughout the exchange, but Red did not thaw in the half-hour that we were there.

Something to note with Red is that he's always been an overprotective older brother sort of friend. I made some very poor decisions when I was younger, and he hasn't seemed to have forgotten it any. He's been somewhat cool with people I've dated before Santana but never this badly.

After we left, I tried to think nothing of it. Red would probably get over it when he saw that Santana treats me well. Except he didn't at all! Cleo messaged me a few days later with screenshots of Red calling me an ""idiot"" for dating a ""guy like that"" and said Santana ""had no business coming to our apartment."" She also told me that she didn't want to ""make it into an issue,"" but she wanted me to be aware that Red wasn't very excited about Santana. I felt pretty hurt. I tried to ignore it and tell myself it would improve, but it hasn't thus far.

On Saturday, Cleo and Red both came over to my mom's house while I was hosting a bonfire and a cookout; several people came through and it was generally a good time. Santana had a work emergency and couldn't make it. However, he did call the house and leave a cute message wishing me a good time. Mom came outside to tell me that, and Red, who had otherwise been socializing up until this point, got really cold and sullen. I half-jokingly asked him, ""Hey, do you hate my boyfriend or something?"" Before he could answer, Cleo told *me* to back off of *Red's* case. After Red left, Cleo told me that I just had to respect his feelings about Santana and that he may come around yet.

I'm really annoyed with Cleo now, as she's playing Switzerland in a case where I feel that Red is being overly aggressive, and upset with Red. Santana is a little hurt that Red doesn't like him and doesn't seem to trust me. He thinks it'll blow over and Red will stop making things awkward, but I'm afraid it could potentially be a source of conflict for this apartment.

Just for clarification, I already told my roommates a month ago that I wouldn't invite Santana over much, as he has his own place downtown where we wouldn't be intrusive, so I don't think it's an issue of me having a boyfriend over constantly when there isn't room for four people in our apartment.

How do I deal with Red's attitude and Cleo's need to ""keep peace"" when it would probably be better to just work out a solution?

**UPDATE:** I texted Red and I'm going to talk to him alone tomorrow in the morning. Wish me luck!

I've been applying to many jobs even out of state, but I haven't gotten an opportunity to interview other than one I was referred to. I've been out of school for a few months already and I've only gotten one interview this entire time. This has gotten me feeling depressed. I just feel so useless.

1) You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.


2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower.


3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”.


4) A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…


5) Private tutoring for a young girl


6) You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….
For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. 

If you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!


I have around 3 hours tonight, but I'll be at work all day tomorrow so feel free to send me a message whenever. 

Kinks: Cumplay, age play, lingerie, instructions, oral (giving/receiving), other vanillaish stuff

Limits: The usual, scat, gore, violence, rape, death, futa, furry, group, etc"
6ty7z2,250,2017-08-15,Me [27M] with my close friend[23F]. She had a nasty breakup 2 weeks back and is now angry with me because I didn't ask her out.,calpril,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ty7z2/me_27m_with_my_close_friend23f_she_had_a_nasty/,"Stella (not her real name), is one of my best friend's younger sister. I've known her since she was 16 when me and her brother became friends. Now we weren't particularly close for a long time, just pleasantries and small talk if we ever crossed paths, she was just my friends baby sister. 

Then 3 years back her brother got married and I was in the wedding party and spent a lot of time with her in the run-up as well as during the wedding weekend itself. We bonded over a shared hobby which is kinda niche and the fact that she was doing the same degree as me and planned to work in my industry. Since then we've become proper friends and she'd ask me for advice or help with internships, job prospects, CV, just general professional stuff and some light personal stuff. Soon enough she started joining me, her brother and SIL, and other friends for weekly drinks since she was now a proper adult. We became even better friends since she's quite fun and good company, she's been there for a few vacations I took with my friend and his wife and my then-partner. But never did I ever have any non-platonic feelings for her nor did I suspect any feelings from her direction. She's quite close with her brother and he never said anything either.

Stella had been dating a guy for 2 years. From what I know it was hot and cold and had a lot of dramatic incidents. They broke up at the end of july, and it was really nasty with accusations of cheating/manipulation from both sides, I know her brother kept getting dragged in on twitter since he complained about it to me. I didn't know much in terms of details cause primarily I wasn't all that interested plus Stella wasn't keen on sharing things on her own accord. 

On Saturday she stayed home instead of joining us at our usual haunt, her brother said that she wasn't feeling up to going out. Fair. But, I thought it would be a nice thing to text her and check up on her so I just texted her the usual things you tell your mate after a breakup- keep your chin up, everything will be fine, more fish in the sea, if you need to talk etc etc. All the cliches basically. I got a sweet reply thanking me and and appreciating that I was a nice friend to her. 

On Monday, I came across a job opportunity that she seemed perfectly suited for. So I told her about it. Now I did first text her to ask how she's doing and sent her the job details after she had replied that she's back to normal and feeling great. 

I didn't get a reply back.

But then later that evening I got a call from my friends wife,i.e. Stellas SIL. And told me that Stella is really angry with me and is going to be keeping her distance. There was an attempted explanation at why, but honestly a lot of it went over my head, basically I had caused some jealousy for Stella's ex and I featured in their fights sometimes and some other stuff. But the basic gist was that Stella was really disappointed/hurt/angry that I didn't even try to ask her out since the breakup, because in the words of my friends wife: ""she likes ya, ya thicko"". It's surprising and shocking and unexpected. And honestly it's a little annoying. How the hell was I supposed to know? And even if I did know, why would she expect me to ask her out?

The thing bothering me the most is that I know Stella is quite stubborn, if her feelings are hurt she actually will stay away from me. Which will really disrupt a great group of friends. And worst case scenario this will affect my best friends relationship with me, stella or both. 

Now, before anyone asks. Yes, I think Stella is very attractive and we get along really well. But No, I will not be asking her out anytime soon. There will be something weird for me to be dating my best mates sister and theres also the fact that I was unexpectedly dumped a few months back and it broke my heart and I'm not even close to being over my ex. I need time to be single, and Stella would be the worst possible candidate for a casual relationship.

Mate's wife is pretty clear that it's a problem with the potential to be a big problem and needs to be resolved but she also has no idea what that resolution might be. Mate himself is keeping as far away from this issue as possible, he's literally the most drama-phobic person I know and right now it's an annoying trait to me. And, I have no idea what to tell Stella or how I should talk to her. Any ideas?

I met this guy through mutual friends and we all hung out as a group over the summer. I was usually the only girl and I didn't mind adopting the 'one of the boys' mentality. 

By the end of the summer I realized that I had a crush on one of the boys, who I talked to the most, and am trying to decide if it's something worth pursuing once the two of us get back to school in a week. Our last night together as a group I got drunk and told one of his friends that I liked the guy. Later that friend told me the guy liked me, but I don't know in what way. When we got home, the guy texted me to tell me he had fun hanging out and he would see me in a week. 

He's not a big texter but snaps me every day. I think he's a really good guy but I don't want to come on too strong or anything because of our mutual friends. I'm also just a very friendly person so I don't know if I haven't given him any idea that I'm interested. Before we left our internships he was trying to figure out a time when we could see each other to say good-bye, which I thought was sweet. I've been wanting to text him this week but I don't want to come off as too strong.

6tyczc,2,2017-08-15,How important is trauma during residency?,HopDoc,Neurosurgery,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neurosurgery/comments/6tyczc/how_important_is_trauma_during_residency/,"I'm at a program that's extremely spine heavy...which is great because that's what I want the majority of my work to be in in the future. I am extremely satisfied by the spine work that goes on at my residency. I'll probably end up doing a complex spine fellowship because that's what I'm interested in.

However, I'm a little bummed by the lack of trauma that's coming in through our ED. We probably have one crash crani a week and it's usually from a 90 y/o fall on Coumadin. I love neuro trauma and it's probably one of the main reasons I chose neurosurgery.

How much of an issue is this? Hoping to start a practice in the future that's 80% spine with some simple tumor cases sprinkled in. But I also want to know how to handle TBIs and bleeds that come through the door.

I know that the more you see the better, but how many crash cranies do you really need in order to be proficient in/comfortable with neurotrauma? I'm only an intern and part of me just thinks the naive medical student is still holding onto the fascination I have with ""blood and guts"". The other part of me is seriously concerned that my training is seriously lacking because of it.

Am I worried about nothing or do you think I'll be lacking in handling neurotrauma when I'm an attending?

6tyiqx,3,2017-08-15,Should I accept this offer given what HR has told me or should try elsewhere?,sdpthrowaway3,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6tyiqx/should_i_accept_this_offer_given_what_hr_has_told/,"I interned with a B4 in audit this Summer.  When I was recruiting, you couldn't do Advisory unless you were at a huge school, so I recruited with assurance.  

During my internship I made friends with people in the FDD group and the recruiters who later tried getting me in to FDD.  I went through a half-dozen interviews and made it in to FDD, but none of the cities I wanted were open.  

The HR guy for advisory told me that they'll extend me an audit offer for now and if any spots open up prior to my start, they will rescind the audit offer and give me an FDD offer, but he said also to understand that likely will not happen given how small the group is, but there is a possibility.

So, before I sign my audit offer, should I?  I feel like if I got in to FDD here, I can do it at another firm.  I just don't want to fuck it all up and wind up without a job.  I also don't feel HR is being serious about it, but he swears he vouched for me and my prior job experience in audit along with my strong performance during the internship, which were the factors that got me considered for FDD in the first place.

Any thoughts on what I should do?  I've done audit for years now and I'm already over it.  I'd hate to do 2 more before getting a shot at FDD again when I can possibly do it now, but I'll do it if it's the smarter choice."

The Return of the Majesta Mirror

It was a quiet day on Yakodrech 7, the famously known trade centre of the Spirale galaxy (named by someone with a mexican accent that didn't actually know spanish)
Spirale was a spiral galaxy home to many of the universe's most incredible sights such as the Kintar nebula, the sparkling waterfalls of Abbon Gush and the most revered and feared YagsCost incorporation.

Yakodrech 7 had long been home to many corporations and investors trying to break into and control a portion of the intergalactic space market, most of which had inevitably lost everything due to the harsh and unforgiving nature of the economic climate on the small planet.
One corporation however had managed to take a stranglehold on the market and had been successfully monopolising the industry for centuries, the YagsCost.
The YagsCost had been founded almost three centuries ago during the Yakodrech depression as a way to pull a struggling civilization out of the dim times that had befallen the Yakodrech empire, little did the Yakodrech people know they would be helping to slay the proverbial Drudgeet parasite only to replace it with a Mork beast.

""What the Flarv!"" yelled Bodega ""I thought this was supposed to be a hub of intergalactic space commerce!"" Bodega stood with a puzzled look as he gazed upward to the rows and rows of office buildings that stood glimmering in the light of the two suns orbiting Yakodrech 7 (how was he to know it was the space birthday of 27 different important figure heads and most businesses were taking the day off?)
""Well, I guess it means I don't have to kill anybody yet"" Bodega thought to himself as he paced through the empty streets, Bodega had come here in search of Space Lewis, the malevolent leader of the YagsCost Corporation.
The name YagsCost of course was a direct reference to the cost of a Yag, the currency native to the Yakodrech empire that had spread in popularity due to the influence of the YagsCost Corporation.

After minutes of walking through the confusing yet surprisingly efficiently laid out streets of Yakodrech 7 Bodega finally arrived at his destination, YagTower, a building that was under constant construction as Space Lewis was determined to have YagTower at least three floors higher than any other building, if anyone so much as added a flag to the top of their building, another floor would be added to YagTower within days.
Passing through the lobby Bodega noticed a short stocky man sitting at a desk in the corner.
""Hello!"" the voice awkwardly screamed, ""My name is The Simonator, I'm the intern in charge of check in!"", ""Do you have an appointme-"" before The Simonator could finish his sentence a zap rang out through the lobby, ""Well, looks like Space Lewis will be needing a new intern"" Bodega chuckled to himself as he casually strolled towards the teleport pad, ""Floor 300"" said Bodega, before he was instantly zapped upward to the current office of Space Lewis.

""Mmmm yes come in Bodega, I've been expecting you, yes"", ""Have you come to offer yourself as my new intern...mmmm?"" asked Space Lewis whilst puckering his lips and looking at a small hand-held mirror perched on his desk ""You know what I'm here for padre, now hand it over before I lazgun the cosmetic surgery right of your smug face"" Bodega aimed his lazgun ready for action ""That's space cosmetic surgery to you, yesss!"" Space Lewis snapped his fingers and a huge droid with eight arms attached to eight different gyro servos and a head shaped like a bubble hovering above a body built like a fridge from the 40's appeared in front of Bodega, ""Holy Flarv!"" exclaimed Bodega ""that there is the Sipsatron 5000, almost indestructible to all known space weapons"", ""That's right mmmm, now it's time you were leaving, yes! Get him Sipsy!"" said Space Lewis all the while looking in his tiny mirror, flexing and puckering.

Luckily Bodega was well versed in all sorts of security droids including the Sipsatron 5000, there was only one thing for it, ""Hold on a minute there"" Bodega pleaded as he stealthily removed his mega-vape from it's holster, ""We may be able to come to some sort of understanding"" he continued ""I'm listening mmmmm"" Space Lewis responded without breaking eye contact with his mirror ""I propose"" Bodega said slowly ""You go suck a big ol' Dildonian ya flarvin' space scum!"", with that Bodega let out a huge puff from his mega-vape, covering the room like an autum day in the swamps of Kyticksii Prime.
""No!"" whimpered Space Lewis like a small Lebanese child ""Don't let him escape Sipsy!
""Ain't no escapin' needed here padre"" said Bodega, standing in front of Space Lewis holding the head of the Sipsatron 5000 as the vape slowly exited the room through any available opening.
""I'll be takin' my mirror back now"" Bodega gestured toward the small mirror Space Lewis had been ogling.
With a shaking hand Space Lewis slowly returned the mirror to Bodega as he whispered ""Goodbye my baby mmmmm, papa still loves you"", Bodega grabbed the mirror and casually walked back out the door, down the teleporter and back towards his ship, killing 23 interns along the way, that'd be the last time anyone else would steal the mirror given to him by his love Majesta, not only was it a gift from his beloved but it was also practical, as he had used it in many situations to refract his lazgun beams into the scrotums (or faces) of many a bad guy (or worse than him guy anyways)

Bodega jumped in the Disco Vilante, plotted his next course and left quicker than a Sperloopian stripper's titties being broken free from their fabric prison.

THE END"

After minutes of walking through the confusing yet surprisingly efficiently laid out streets of Yakodrech 7 Bodega finally arrived at his destination, YagTower, a building that was under constant construction as Space Lewis was determined to have YagTower at least three floors higher than any other building, if anyone so much as added a flag to the top of their building, another floor would be added to YagTower within days. Passing through the lobby Bodega noticed a short stocky man sitting at a desk in the corner. ""Hello!"" the voice awkwardly screamed, ""My name is The Simonator, I'm the intern in charge of check in!"", ""Do you have an appointme-"" before The Simonator could finish his sentence a zap rang out through the lobby, ""Well, looks like Space Lewis will be needing a new intern"" Bodega chuckled to himself as he casually strolled towards the teleport pad, ""Floor 300"" said Bodega, before he was instantly zapped upward to the current office of Space Lewis.

""Mmmm yes come in Bodega, I've been expecting you, yes"", ""Have you come to offer yourself as my new intern...mmmm?"" asked Space Lewis whilst puckering his lips and looking at a small hand-held mirror perched on his desk ""You know what I'm here for padre, now hand it over before I lazgun the cosmetic surgery right of your smug face"" Bodega aimed his lazgun ready for action ""That's space cosmetic surgery to you, yesss!"" Space Lewis snapped his fingers and a huge droid with eight arms attached to eight different gyro servos and a head shaped like a bubble hovering above a body built like a fridge from the 40's appeared in front of Bodega, ""Holy Flarv!"" exclaimed Bodega ""that there is the Sipsatron 5000, almost indestructible to all known space weapons"", ""That's right mmmm, now it's time you were leaving, yes! Get him Sipsy!"" said Space Lewis all the while looking in his tiny mirror, flexing and puckering.

Luckily Bodega was well versed in all sorts of security droids including the Sipsatron 5000, there was only one thing for it, ""Hold on a minute there"" Bodega pleaded as he stealthily removed his mega-vape from it's holster, ""We may be able to come to some sort of understanding"" he continued ""I'm listening mmmmm"" Space Lewis responded without breaking eye contact with his mirror ""I propose"" Bodega said slowly ""You go suck a big ol' Dildonian ya flarvin' space scum!"", with that Bodega let out a huge puff from his mega-vape, covering the room like an autum day in the swamps of Kyticksii Prime. ""No!"" whimpered Space Lewis like a small Lebanese child ""Don't let him escape Sipsy! ""Ain't no escapin' needed here padre"" said Bodega, standing in front of Space Lewis holding the head of the Sipsatron 5000 as the vape slowly exited the room through any available opening. ""I'll be takin' my mirror back now"" Bodega gestured toward the small mirror Space Lewis had been ogling. With a shaking hand Space Lewis slowly returned the mirror to Bodega as he whispered ""Goodbye my baby mmmmm, papa still loves you"", Bodega grabbed the mirror and casually walked back out the door, down the teleporter and back towards his ship, killing 23 interns along the way, that'd be the last time anyone else would steal the mirror given to him by his love Majesta, not only was it a gift from his beloved but it was also practical, as he had used it in many situations to refract his lazgun beams into the scrotums (or faces) of many a bad guy (or worse than him guy anyways)

Bodega jumped in the Disco Vilante, plotted his next course and left quicker than a Sperloopian stripper's titties being broken free from their fabric prison.

6tz05n,3,2017-08-15,[Rant/Vent] My Latest List of Flaws According to Nmom,Optimistic_Nihilist,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6tz05n/rantvent_my_latest_list_of_flaws_according_to_nmom/,"So me and Nmom had another fight. I'll cop to bringing this one on myself. I just wanted to have a quiet drama free day off since I started a second job this week. But no she starts going on and on about our neighbor loudly doing his home remodeling. This guy has been an issue in the neighborhood with this remodel. It has been going on for years. Other neighbors have gotten into confrontations but mostly everyone just lets it happen. Everyone for the most part ignores him and loathes him silently. Nmom has especially had bad run ins with him. Apparently he chased her on the freeway one time blaring his horn. Understandably terrifying, and warrants a police call which she did not do. I couldn't hide how annoyed I was about her latest rant about the noise, and the rage spilled over. Here are the latest flaws she yelled at me for:

""You can't even hold down a job! How many jobs have you had in the past year?!"" (I did have a lot of jobs in the last year. I worked as an uber driver while working an unpaid internship last year for 9 months. I took on a small work from home job for extra money which I have been doing for going on a year. I worked at a Halloween store, which was a toxic environment. It is the only job I outright quit in my entire life, since getting the job I have now. A seasonal retail job that I did so well in they brought me back permanently a week after letting me go. I also worked a second unpaid internship before the internship let me go since they terminated the program. Now I just got a second part time job with more consistent hours thus now earning three separate incomes. I have never been fired in my entire life)

""You have a problem with authority!"" (My managers like me pretty well. I have been thrilled to see them extend into outside work friendships. I do what I am told although I ask plenty of questions to make sure I understand everything. All of my bosses know that I will always be friendly to customers and have been consistently for my patience and demeanor)

""Are you gonna hit me?!"" (No I will not hit you. It was wrong of me to say you have. You slapped me maybe a handfull of times in my life. And even when you hit me out of anger and frustration it was never hard or painful. So Nmom you are right it was wrong of me to accuse you of that, but something tells me if I hit you you would get new things to tell everyone how awful I am)

""You don't do anything around here! I look like a piece of shit for letting you stay here"" (Also true that I could do more around the house. You won't let me wash dishes since it is a ""control thing"" for you, and I do the responsibilities you have delegated me to. So yes it is true I should be doing more around the house, and I agree I should. But as far as what your co-workers think of me, I honestly do not care. They will never meet me, they can believe whatever you tell them. No I may not be impressive but I am trying to get my own life and career really going on the right path.)

""You are so entitled!!!"" (I don't ask you for anything Nmom. You choose to do some of the things you do for me. But I never ask you for money or any kind of financial help. I have given you over a $1000 of money I have saved since moving home from college 4 years ago.)

""You and the rest of your generation are so entitled and care only about protecting illegal immigrants!"" (Sorry I know we aren't supposed to get political. But what does this have to do with the situation.)

""I throw up every morning knowing he [the neighbor] is here and tense up every time I hear a horn honk"" (Then you need to get help. But getting REAL help is beneath you. You want the quick fix alcohol, pills, and weed. You seem to think the reason I can't get a job is because of depression, so you give me your prescription anti-depressants. I am not depressed, I am frustrated finding full time work is this complicated. Also this is the first I have ever heard of you having this much anxiety about that situation. Then again in particualarly stressful moments you would tell me how close to suicide you are, but reassure me you would never do it. So getting help isn't exactly your forte.)

""I am going to tell your Aunt about this"" (My Aunt is pretty much the head of the family. Nmom tells her how hard it is to deal with me. If my Aunt really is annoyed with me, then she should confront me personally. If not she can believe what she wants to believe. However a part of me thinks she is savvy to Nmom's behavior.)

""Parenting you is the one thing I was proud of and you took it away. You have no idea how hard it was being a single mother"" (It was hard. But you weren't alone, I was also raised by my grandparents, whose house we lived in until they both died. And you threw a tantrum the day we had the garage sale to clean out the house because you were told to move everything out of your room. And no I do not think you were a bad mom, not even a bad person. Hard to be around yes, but not an awful person.)

""If you are going to be mad, be mad at your father who did nothing!"" (True he did nothing to help, I haven't seen him in more than a decade. So I have no relationship with him, and never tried to maintain one... Other than to keep checks coming on Christmas and birthdays. And you know this Nmom.)

""You don't even comfort someone who is crying?! What is wrong with you?"" (Interesting to go from crying back to screaming at me without even a quiver in your voice. Also why do you interrupt yelling at me to film the neighbor doing the remodel. Believing he is purposely doing it to annoy you)

""You need to see things from other people's perspectives instead of your own. All you do is take and that is why you will never be happy"" (I do see things from other people's perspective. I work customer service, it like a requirement for the job. And I know you are having money troubles, which is why I try to figure out my own situations by myself. NOT asking you to fix them)

""You are a terrible son..."" (I'm not perfect, but it's nice to be referred to as your son. As opposed to feeling like we're married and partners all the time.)

Not exact quotes some of them but still the jist of it. With recurring themes. I am so sorry I post on here so much. I am sure I am starting to look like a narcissist myself. But this was one of the last straws. While we go on the silent treatment I feel more relaxed knowing I won't see her for a couple of days. And I have been researching ways I can get out and fully free myself from her. Again I am so sorry I post on this subreddit so much. But finding this subreddit has been liberating and shed light on a lot of things with Nmom. Thank you for the continued support you all give. You are all such kind, wise, and strong people. Thank you for letting me rant and rave.

TL;DR I am a terrible son and here is why!!!"
6tz307,3,2017-08-15,Worrying about worrying about worrying...,asocialwarrior,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/6tz307/worrying_about_worrying_about_worrying/,"Hi everyone! This is my first post here and I feel like I am going crazy.

My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship; she had to complete her internship in SE Asia and would be coming back in September. I have known for a while that she will be studying abroad next year, but this morning when I received her text messages about finally taking the plunge to go abroad, I kept analysing and ruminating every single word in her message and ended up being indescribably depressed about it. As an overreaction, I replied with visibly upset messages for no reason... 

When she replied to me, I realised how wrong I was and how badly I was overreacting, just because of a trivial thing... I had thought I would never see her again and that once she would go abroad, she would forget about me and I would change and forget about her too and we would never see each other again. 

It has occurred SEVERAL TIMES to me to overthink and impulsively send her stupid messages, but she has been so patient and understanding. But this time, I think I fucked up hard, my anxiety and worry and nonsensical fears just fucked me over and over and I just want everything to stop. I just want my brain to stop torturing me, I just want myself to stop ruining things I have held so dearly to my heart. I also feel like distance and technology just bring out the worst in me, because I cannot feel her expression and her subtle raise of eyebrow and her eyes and her smiles and her frowns and text messages are just flat and contain zero emotions to me.

6tzesy,1,2017-08-15,[M4A (playing F/Futa)] Seduced by RoosterTeeth,Nmarshall273,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6tzesy/m4a_playing_ffuta_seduced_by_roosterteeth/,"Hey DPP! I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

6tzox8,1,2017-08-16,I [26/F] need advice for supporting my unemployed boyfriend [26 M] of 10 yrs. It's putting a strain on us and I don't know how to help him.,buutbuutbuut,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tzox8/i_26f_need_advice_for_supporting_my_unemployed/,"Sorry this is long, but it's a lot to explain. My boyfriend (let's call him Carl) and I graduated college recently, he with a masters in elementary education and myself with a BFA. An internship I had led to an amazing job offer, so I was hired months before graduating. Carl, on the other hand, has been less lucky. 

His program ended in August of 2015, and a few weeks later he landed a job as a 2nd grade teacher. Everything was a disaster from the start; he was given his classroom three days before school started and they didn't even have enough desks. We had to run a balance on his credit card to buy pencils, paper, and other basic supplies. The principal was absolutely horrible, and by next June she had five lawsuits against her for mistreating employees. Carl didn't make it to June, however. In February he was told to resign because he was ""oblivious to the emotional needs of his students"". What triggered this? Well, Carl had to separate two students who were chatty during work time, and one got upset. The principal happened to be in the room when this happened and pulled the kid out for 20 minutes. Whatever he said was apparently bad enough to get Carl fired. Given her track record, I'm highly skeptical that termination was actually necessary but what's done is done. Carl was both shocked and utterly devastated.

Less than a week later, he was subbing in two neighboring school districts. Money was less regular with only two or three days of work each week, but it was enough to barely make ends meet. We were hopeful that he could land another teaching job, but in spite of almost 70 applications in the next few months he only had two interviews. Those positions were filled by teachers with more experience. We also learned that his early termination--aka an incomplete contract--is a serious red flag in the teaching world and has most likely hurt him over and over.

Not surprisingly, Carl started to get burnt out on job hunting. I graduated college and started my job, so we were able to make rent on my salary. He got back into subbing and managed to get a temporary position as tech support for schools. He really seemed to enjoy the job and it was extended from two months to six. Unfortunately when it came to an end this June there was no budget to hire Carl, so he was reluctantly let go. However, his coworkers and boss loved him and they helped him locate other related job opportunities. Even with outstanding references, he was passed by for someone with more experience 4 times in a row. It's August now and Carl hasn't worked in weeks, he has $300 left to his name, $30,000 of student loans to pay off, and he is completely burnt out.

At this point I'm not sure how to help Carl. I have tried to be supportive as possible giving pep talks, resume reviews, ironing his interview clothes, and everything I can think of. He has been overweight and out of shape for years, so I hired a personal trainer to help give him motivation (I get free PT sessions through my gym at work, and it REALLY helped me). At first it was working and he seemed more confident, but after the last string of rejections he is spiraling into bad depression. The cycle of hope followed by crushing disappointment is making him frustrated and angry, and frankly I'm a little frightened when he gets into dark moods. 

I have no clue what I can do to help; for weeks I have been telling him that everyone goes through this and he just has to keep his head up and keep trying. Unfortunately, Carl is so frustrated that he doesn't even want to teach anymore. He is applying to literally any job that pays $15/hr or more, and of course he isn't getting much of a response. This is just fueling his frustration and making everything worse. I'm going through some pressing medical issues right now, and attempting to manage his stress on top of mine is proving difficult. My job is mentally draining and it's hard to come home and try to carry Carl too. Because I will be handling the bills by myself until subbing picks up, I have scaled back our spending somewhat. So far whenever I have mentioned, ""No, we can't do that for financial reasons,"" it has been like rubbing salt in a wound of his. He feels like a failure.

My only remaining idea is to hire a career counselor (a friend of a good friend through work) since I have only heard great things about what they can do. I'm a little concerned over spending so much money, but I save like a maniac and have have at least 10 months of our current lifestyle hoarded in my savings account. Financially it's viable, but I'm not entirely convinced Carl will take it to heart. He is so depressed and angry and I just don't know what to do. Has anyone been in this scenario, and how can I best support him?

6tzty9,1,2017-08-16,"Me 26m with my 24F 4-year, religion ended relationship",PurpNYellow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tzty9/me_26m_with_my_24f_4year_religion_ended/,"I don't even know where to start. I was in a 4 year relationship, with someone who I thought was the one. It is a long story, and I want to keep it as short as possible. I met this person through photography work I do, I shot a yearbook for her animal training class. She saw I was shooting it, and contacted me through facebook after she saw I was shooting it, reason being I had done the yearbook the year before, but she had other ideas, and thus contacted me. To keep it short there, we started dating before the shooting was even finished. She ended up getting a job south of Miami, training dolphins. A month later I packed my car up and drove from LA to Miami. I spent two years shooting weddings out there and living with her.

Eventually she decided that her career wasn't for her, and wanted to move back home. She wanted a career change, and I suggested and helped her decide on nursing, because it makes good money and my mom had been doing that. We moved back home, I drove my car back, flew back and drove us and all of our things back, and got her into college, and an internship at my moms hospital.
The problems hit when we were in Florida, about a year in she started getting really into Catholicism, I guess she was into it before, but never mentioned it before I moved there. But that problem kept snowballing and ended up eating at us. She ended up getting to the point where I had to goto church every weekend or else, know all the prayers, and ultimately get baptised, or else.
It stressed me out, caused strife between us, and was her ultimate reason for leaving me. I spent time learning everything, really trying, but just couldn't get into it and do it every weekend... She decided to break everything off by moving everything out while I was at work, came home to a half empty home.

She proceeded to get religious tattoos, post half-naked photos, and just ghost me. There is more to that though, when I met her she was beautiful, and I always told her so, I always told her how beautiful she was without makeup. And while we were were together ended up getting things like a nose job, lip injections even, and she ended up looking like someone I didn't even know.
It just bums me the heck out, and because I couldn't be a staunch Catholic... I mean obviously I dodged a bullet because as I type it all out, I feel like she was nuts, but I am just so bummed over losing someone I loved and losing years hoping it would work out.I just don't know how to figure out a way to get over it...

Tldr: We dated for 4 years, she got religious, I didn't. I need help, motivation, on how to get past this.

I am a recent grad from a Cal State U w/ a BS in Health Science. 
I always thought nursing was the career for me, but after interning in a hospital I am quickly realizing the thought process and overall PA profession is something I can see myself loving. 

3.7 overall gpa, 3.4 science gpa
I have about 5 pre-reqs (give or take) left
I have only 100 hours of PCE (Physical therapy aide)
I do have 3 health internships under my belt= about 400 hours
-I currently work full time in customer service and need to maintain a full-time job in order to pay my bills.

I guess my main questions are: 
-How should I go about taking all these classes, studying for the GRE, and working full time? I would like to apply for the 2019 matriculation. 
-How can I improve my odds of acceptance?
-Would a CNA certificate be worth it? (to cover PCE hours and to help make ends meet)
I would love any advice on balancing this workload while being a competitive candidate with extracurriculars, etc

Thanks so much!!

6u24ga,17,2017-08-16,"[Question] Was I raised by narcissists? I think I was, but want to make sure.",Genomixx,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6u24ga/question_was_i_raised_by_narcissists_i_think_i/,"Hey all, 

First time posting here on Reddit, ever -- though have read this and other threads for some time. This might be a bit long -- currently feeling pretty down after my dad sent me a rather soul-crushing email letter last evening, so consider this a vent/rant. I've never taken the time to write all this out.

But let me rewind.

I'm 22[M]. I was homeschooled all of my life until senior year, when I decided to take 2 semesters at university instead of being stuck at home. Growing up (until I was around 11), I was raised in rural Kansas -- literally as  rural as it gets. The nearest town was a 20 minute drive away, and had a population of 3,000. 

So my early years were lived in complete isolation from the outside world, with my parents raising me on our farm -- along with my two older siblings and younger brother. 

Funny thing -- whenever we'd go into town to get groceries, these hyper-conservative people/acquaintances would ask my parents, ""Well, this homeschooling thing sounds great, but how do your kids find friends?"" 

And my dad would reply, without missing a beat, ""They're each other's friends! They all have 3 best friends! How great is that?"" (Because we each had three siblings.)

Moving on. My parents were extremely religious here in Kansas, of the Pentecostal/fundamentalist Christian variety (our home schooling program was from a fundamentalist Christian ""academy"" which, e.g., taught creationism, taught that being gay was a sin, etc. etc.). 

And along with that came a definite disciplinarian streak. I must have been 8 or 9 when they got a book called ""To Train Up a Child."" I just looked it up on Amazon right now. The reviews are enlightening, and trigger some memories I haven't recalled till now. At one point, my parents would read -- or have one of my older siblings read -- a few pages of that book every night with the whole family just before going to bed. It was during this time, too, that my dad decided to get a piece of long rubber tubing for the express purpose of spanking us when we did something ""wrong."" 

In case you don't know, getting whipped by rubber tubing is far more painful than receiving that treatment from an ordinary belt. I recall, vividly, how during one of my first days of school I asked my dad for permission to take a break and go outside. He said that was fine, but to make sure I come back in 15 minutes. 

Well, being 7 year old me, I had no idea of 15 minutes was supposed to be -- the Timex watch on my wrist notwithstanding. So I returned to my lessons perhaps 20 or 30 minutes late. Which made him incensed, so he promptly took out this rubber tube and whipped my leg repeatedly with it. 

In addition, we weren't allowed to watch any TV at all, except occasionally when my parents approved of certain programs.

I guess this is turning out to be a pretty long post. So I'll try to speed things along. 

Growing up, I was actually pretty ugly be conventional standards -- my lower jaw was set way behind my upper jaw. On the other hand, my older brother was pretty good-looking. My parents had no problem showering him with compliments about his good looks. But they only ever told me I was handsome in a secondary, off-hand sort of way -- ""Wow, you're so handsome [Name of Older Brother]. Oh, and you too, Genomixx."" 

My self-esteem was thus severely crippled from a young age (for other reasons, too, which I won't get into). I was never the center of attention, in contrast to my older brother and sister. My older brother was the definite favorite; and any objective observer could easily tell that I was the least favorite child of my parents (later, when my brother and I were in our teens, my dad ""gifted"" a beautiful, black, $3,000 horse to my older brother who enjoyed horse riding. My parents have never, ever done something like that for me.) But my dad would still look me in the eyes every morning and tell me, ""Genomixx, you're the greatest!"" It always felt awkward and contrived.

When I was 13 -- at this point, we had moved to the Southwest and were muuuuch closer to bigger towns -- I began intensely studying biology on my own -- luckily, we had computers with access to the internet. Still in middle school, I managed to write an original research paper on DNA cryptography and get it published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. I didn't tell anyone, because I never got the sense from my parents that they actually, fundamentally cared about what I was up to (and because they were super-critical of me ""spending too much time on the computer,"" which lead to me spending time on the computer late at night in secret). 

Lacking any deep emotional connection from my parents due to this lack of meaningful attention, I was driven to find some way to become worthy in their eyes. Not being physically talented, I looked to my mind as the answer. 

I continued self-studying molecular biology, and began excelling at high school (still homeschooled though). I published another paper (this time told my parents), got an internship at a national lab, presented at a genomics conference in another city, etc. etc. Told my parents I wanted to go to MIT after high school, which they were very supportive of. Towards the end of my high school experience, they were ""very proud"" of me and didn't hesitate to tell their friends about all I'd done. I had outpaced my siblings, and by far. Finally, I was feeling like I was maybe worth something to my parents. 

I do remember a particular conversation during this time. I told my mom about my high SAT scores, and her response was: ""Congratulations! We made the right choice in choosing to homeschool you."" (Note: 70% of what I learned in that homeschooling program was garbage; I self-taught myself, via Google, more than my parents could ever imagine.)

After senior year of high school (I moved out to my own place when I was 18), things spiraled downwards for me. I guess all that childhood stuff caught up with me. I was hit with the emotional realization that no matter what I did, I would never be good enough for my parents -- that my worth in their eyes was directly linked to whether or not I was ""achieving"" or fitting their idea of a ""high-performing academic superstar."" The praise was heaped on me when I performed well; when I didn't perform well, it was all judgment and no understanding. 

I entered a deep depression, and decided to work for a couple of years on my ad writing business before applying to MIT + other colleges. Didn't want to have any debt upon graduating, so decided to grow my entrepreneurial savvy first and make money. 

And that's where I am right now. Working on my business, with plans to save up before going to a private college.  

I have not told my parents about my clinical depression, about my history of cutting, etc. etc. They, in fact, believe that they were pretty good parents -- that we had a happy home life. (This view of theirs is reinforced by my older brother and sister, who don't seem at all aware of their childhood reality.) 

And yesterday, my dad sent me an email letter (he's in Central America right now, so he didn't say any of this in person), saying that he's ""concerned for me"" and my ""direction"" in life -- because I've got a tiny one-bedroom basement apartment, am choosing to work on my business instead of applying to MIT, and ""don't seem to be going anywhere."" 

A couple of excerpts from his letter:

""Your opportunities will not be here forever. They will pass you by. Young people don't always realize that. You have such great talent and potential, and I believe you are wasting the years away...""

""Mom and I can look at you more objectively than you can yourself. You cannot really see your life as we can see it. Genomixx, you had such great promise, and I hope you still do.""

---

So -- raised by narcs or nah? I'm seeing my counselor today (again, my parents have no idea I'm even in therapy for clinical depression). Second question: do you think I should tell my parents about my depression? 

Thanks a bunch for spending the time to read through this wall of text. I appreciate it. 

Tl;dr: was raised in super isolated rural Kansas, was homeschooled and in a strictly religious environment, parents had obvious favoritism for my other siblings, and I've got clinical depression that my older siblings don't seem to have.

Hello Reddit. This is my third day sobbing over this bullshit and I need help. I'm at my breaking point.
Brief background, ever since I was 12 I've been emotionally manipulated by my family. Occasional physical abuse by my dad but constant berating from my mom and dad and nonstop screaming. (They say the scream at me because I just ""don't get it"" and maybe screeching at me will make it stick?) I've been in college these last 4 years and our relationship has improved other than my mom constantly nitpicking me (your hair looks awful, why are you wearing that you look like shit, things like that) but I'm used to it. I know it may not sound like improvement but trust me it was better. Notice I said ""was."" I moved back home (my parents paid for my school/apartment) so they could save money and we could rebuild our relationship and become a stronger unit. Okay, cool. We're all adults here and on relatively stable footing so why not? I need to finish my internship and graduate in December. If I am willing to be civil and polite for 4 months what harm can be done? See below to see the amount of bullshit that has unfurled in a month.

Now to what the fuck is going on: 1) my boyfriend of over 2 years and I are on a ""break."" It hurts me a lot but we needed to do this to strengthen our relationship. This happened over the weekend. I spent two days (one the day of and one the day after) teary eyed and sniffling. My father charges into my room and gets in my face at first telling me to get the fuck over it. I started recording our conversation at this point. I told him that I'm sorry he's forgotten how it feels to be broken up with (the day this happened he and my mom celebrated their 30th anniversary) and it hurts a lot because my bf is my best friend first. All hell breaks loose. He threatened to ""slap the shit"" out of me and make me swallow my teeth and the insisted he was helping. Slams the door and starts throwing things in his room screaming about how they are my family and I'd be no where and nothing without them but I choose my friends over them all time the time. Hours pass; he comes back and asks sweetly if I wanted dinner. I said no and he wished me a good night. His response to this situation was ""you know I do that because I love you? You're my little girl and I love you and it hurts me to see you sad."" Okay then.

2) Yesterday and my reason for this post: My parents received my billing statement for my apartment. There were a handful of charges that weren't supposed to be there. My dad saw it first (my apartment is in my mothers name. She's the grantor) and asked me about it. I have email documentation expressing that I wasn't supposed to be charged and that I would handle it. I also said that I would assist in paying for the charges god forbid I can't get them taken off my account. All is hunky dory. He drops it and goes to take a nap. I called the office and sent my emails to the person in charge. 3 hours later my mom comes home. I was asleep. I hear her before I she barges in here. ""KASSIEBBY1124 get your ass up we need to talk."" My mom is asking me questions and shouting over my answers. There is a charge of a flea treatment and damage to a chair that I have written documentation disputing these charges. I keep trying to tell her that I'm taking care of it; my dad is literally adding fuel to the fire. Saying that I should have listened to them at the time. I had a cat for a few months. My boyfriend has it now. But that this is what I deserve. Again, he is screaming. They both are. I asked why and he said ""you don't understand. You just don't understand. Maybe yelling at you would get it through your fucking head."" 
I have to work a 40hr internship and just got a part time job. My mother is hellbent on taking all the money i earn as recompense. My sister is sending me a monthly deposit as she always does; and my sister confirms this with my mom. So my mom is taking the entire check to make up for the damages as well as my entire first paycheck at my new job? This is what killed me. I wholeheartedly planned on paying for the damages but now they're being malicious. My dad threatened to hurt me how i ""hurt them."" I packed my shit up and walked to the local park about 30 mins later. As I'm going to the door they ask, once again all polite and sweet, where I'm going. I said they park. My mom then squints at me and criticizes my choice of hat. I leave and don't come back until she's asleep. My dad is still up when I get back but we don't interact.

Other instances: Also yesterday, my bed wasn't made. I had full intention of doing it but this was after he originally bitched at me about the apartment charges so I wanted to lay down first. My dad's bed was also not made. Because of the ""disarray,"" it prompted another shouting match (I just try to tune it out at this point) about how they refuse to live in filth and squalor. I calmed pointed out his room wasn't clean until 10 minutes before he came into my room to say something about it. I had two soda cans on my dresser and a laundry basket with clothes, and a partially full trash can in it in addition to my bed not being made. But they can leave greasy food soak in a sink full of water with a thin film over it overnight right? Makes sense. I tried to throw my trash away; he blocked me in and said that I'm disgusting and for all they do the least I can do is do dishes that aren't mine, do their laundry, cut the grass and keep my room immaculate because they gave me a place to stay that I openly expressed I didn't want to do in the first place but put my feelings aside to try and rebuild our relationship.

My car battery stalled out and my parents EXPLODED at me. I don't know why it did it. I realized I need to get it replaced. That's not happening now though. It's ""too expensive"" with all the charges. The car is in my name.

Last reason, part of why I moved back home other than to rebuild my relationship with my family was to help them save money. My apartment lease ended and my parents didn't want to renew. Kay whatever. I was on school insurance when i was on campus. Because I'm considered distant education, I no longer than insurance and my parents are paying 25 dollars more than my apartment for me to be at home if they choose to put me on their health care. But they blame me that it's my fault I don't have insurance and call me a financial burden, then say that they're joking and do these things out of love. We are ""blood"" after all; they are my ""family.""

Reddit, I need help. I need to complete school since I'm so close and my internship is unpaid. I have a part time job but my advisor for school won't credit my part time hours to my internship even though I've explained how to planned to relate them. The car isn't in my name and will bet my life that my parents would file the car stolen if I went somewhere with it and didn't come back. I have no money. I have no other place to stay. I'm loosing my mind and it's hurting me. My boyfriend has an apartment at our school but if I left I wouldn't be able to complete my internship I don't believe. I am so close to being done with school I don't want my shit family to be the reason why I can't.

This is the text I sent my parents when I left last night. I did not get a response other than not to make plans tonight so we can work on my health insurance: 
""I'm going to pay you back for the fees. I'm working on fixing the chair situation and the flea treatment charges. I don't understand why our discussions have to escalate to yelling matches all the time when I acknowledge what I've done and we're civil adults, if I can use that phrase. I'm not trying to pick a fight I'm just expressing my feelings. I've been trying to do all in my power to do what I need to to better myself as a person and daughter; I've been trying to improve our relationship and sometimes it doesn't feel like it's enough and it hurts. ""

I am also scared to do this because I'm worried about losing my family. I'm pretty sure the rest of my family would follow suit and drop me (my sister is a major push over, even though i love her. She's 28 and when I told her about my dad's threats, she said he just has a funny way of showing he love me. I love her and don't want to lose her. I just want distance from my family.)

Do you have any advice?"
6u2k0o,2,2017-08-16,"Parents and sibling are pressuring me to travel after college, saying they will give me a loan or even pay for it",FinalVersus,FinancialAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialAdvice/comments/6u2k0o/parents_and_sibling_are_pressuring_me_to_travel/,"The past year, my parents and my brother, have been pressuring me to travel after I graduate college in the fall. While it may seem like a tempting offer and a great experience, it would probably put me 2k-3k more in debt for the things I would want to do. My parents have been mentioning it probably once a week, in which my brother also vouches for it.

The problem, is that not only will I have to start to pay my student loans soon after I travel (around 25k), I will need to pay my brother back for the loan I took from him to pay off the rent money I used to buy a car, since mine shit the bed. 

Now, my parents are willing to let me live at home when I graduate which is nice, but I will basically be broke after I graduate due to the fact that I have to give most of the money I saved in my internship this summer toward my rent and utilities in the fall. Not to mention, the money I owe my brother. 

In addition, my parents are near retirement age. My mother is 64 and my father will be 70 next year. They have less than 200k saved for retirement and yet they still plan to take vacations frequently and also keep pressuring me to take this extended trip. I tried to explain to them their habits will leave them with empty pockets... it's the same behavior that left them with little money saved in the first place, but they won't listen to me. They honestly never take my advice. There's no reasoning with them.    

That being said, my brother is well off. Having been promoted at his work the past year, he is pretty much debt free at 25 with a 6 figure income and great benefits. As for me, I'll be graduating with a computer science degree and most likely a job offer from my current internship (the same company he works). However, it would seem like borrowing that money would just further my anxiety and woes about paying off my debts and really start saving and investing for a comfortable future and ultimately, early retirement. 

Even considering all of that, I am tempted to take the money and go, since it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. It's just a long time to put off starting a job and actually starting to pay off my debts. Any advice?

TL;DR: Parents who are retiring soon and well off brother want to give me a loan/help pay for travel after I graduate college in the fall. I currently owe my brother money, but still am considering the offer. "

I work for a small IT staffing agency out of Raleigh, NC called HireNetworks.

This developer will work with C# / .NET on the team that maintains and develops new components for the company's proprietary software product. At least a year or two of professional experience in software development with C# / .NET and SQL is required. This is not technically an entry-level position, but if you have *strong relevant internship experience and a degree* then feel free to apply!

This position can be either contract-to-hire or direct-hire depending on your preference; benefits are available for full-time employees. Salary is fairly open but the client is not looking to pay more than $85,000 as the higher numbers are reserved for higher-level development roles with more responsibility.

After I graduated from University, I realized for the first time in my life, I am actually free to do whatever I want. Perhaps it was fate that around the same time I watched my first Sovietwomble's video. His style deviates from other major Youtuber and quickly stuck on to me. It was then I decided instead of doing my Master's degree like any normal person would, I want to take this risk and give Youtube ago.

That would take us about this point in space and time. Luckily, I was able to have some money left after I paid off my student loan (internships and summer jobs) to be working on Youtube for about an year (without pays). So if you are interested, just look me up on Youtube.

Also, if you want to chill and talk to me, join the the Newtuber discord channel. I am always on it when I am editing your videos. Just look for ""Beneviolant"" on that long, LOOOOONG side bar located at the right hand side of your discord. Do mind though I might not reply immediately.

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

As everyone knows one of the main reasons for getting an internship is to decide whether or not a firm / career is right for you. I have a good chance of getting a big 4 internship this spring, but I also recently applied to a smaller firm (BDO, GT, RSM) for next summer in a different city that I would really enjoy living in. I think it would be beneficial for me to experience how big 4 and non big 4 differ as well as making a ton of money (for a poor college student) to help pay for school.

Assuming I am extended two offers for the spring and summer (I realize this might not happen), Is it okay to accept both? I don't want one firm to find out and rescind their offer down the road or something.

6u4t1y,1,2017-08-16,Depression resurfacing after fiancee decides to leave me for good.,DaemonHunt,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6u4t1y/depression_resurfacing_after_fiancee_decides_to/,"My fiancee finally decides to break up with me. For 4 years, my family has been trying to get me to break up with her. They finally did it. I'll try to summarize the past 4 years to the best of my abilities. 

**The summary:**
I'm Asian, still living with them. Parents have been controlling and critical of everything I did. I'm 20, in university with tuition paid by parents. When I started dating my fiancee, my mother in particular went nuts. For 3 years, it was a non stop verbal abuse war. She'd throw derogatory terms like ""another man's garbage"", ""problem child"", ""bad luck/trouble"" etc. every single day. Whenever I wanted to hang out with her, my mom would either:
* hold on to the keys
* confiscate my mobile phone or laptop 
* threaten to disown/stop paying for my tuition
Yes, I've fought back, but whenever I did, she'd burst into tears and wail lines like: ""You unfilial child"", ""You disappoint your ancestors"", ""You're not a *insert last name* if you do this to me"". 
She have also tried to guilt me into thinking I've put my fiancee over her multiple times even though I have never thought of it that way.
Her disdain is mainly due to my fiancee's background and personality. She's adventurous, we're extremely conservative. She comes from an abusive household, we're family oriented. Just from those reasons, my parents have deemed her ""unsafe"" for me. 

But my fiancee doesn't fit any of her description at all. Whenever my family faces problems, she'd be the first person to help us. She drove my mom and sister wherever they wanted to go (to gain their approval), she saved my dog from euthanasia by driving 40 miles, she got me in touch with people in my field of study for internship opportunities. When I'm down and depressed for the past 3 months, she was the only person who motivated me to not give up, that suicide isn't the answer. She was the nicest, considerate, selfless, honest girl I've ever known. 

I wouldn't say it's completely my family's fault as I've contributed to the problem. I've never told my fiancee about what my parents have said completely but she roughly knows the situation we were in. By not explaining to her my situation, I had to lie to her most of the time whenever my mom would throw a fit when I'm about to meet her. It killed me little by little when she'd express her disappointment towards me breaking small promises I made, just because of my mother's unreasonable actions. But I can never tell her what's really happening as she already has her own problems that she can barely solve. Over the span of 3 years, I kept it secret from everyone until I couldn't bear it anymore 3 months ago. I had difficulties falling asleep, sometimes staying up till 6 in the morning then getting up at 12pm not doing anything for the day. If it wasn't for my fiancee, I might not have the chance to write this. 

Before she broke up with me, I did not follow up to the promises I made her. She was fed up of the seemingly minimal effort I put into the relationship. I told her everything that has been happening. She told me she knew all along, that my mom has been trying to pry us apart. She couldn't take it anymore. Her clinical depression was surfacing again. We had an argument. I defended my parents. She had enough. She broke up. 



I'm leaving for Canada in 12 days. 90 000 miles away from her. I love her. I want to get back with her. I've acquired the engagement ring. I'm ready to commit myself into marriage, just as she has hoped for. But I know she deserves a better man. A man whose family approves of the relationship. A man who can always be by her side, physically and emotionally. A man who isn't spineless like me. Maybe I should have ended my life 3 months ago. Perhaps then she wouldn't have to waste the time spend on taking her free time off motivating a pussy like me.

So, should I be selfish and do everything in my power to get her back even after all the things I put her through? 
Should I go to her apartment in the morning and apologize and prioritize her over my family? 

Or should I just give up, and end it all?
*It's been 26 hours since I've stayed awake. I apologize if I'm rambling on and my thoughts are incoherent.*

(TL;DR: Fiancee left me because of family's attempt to break us off. Leaving for a few years in 12 days. Want to get back but don't know if it's the right thing to do. Depressed.)"

Since January I've had various health issues that sometimes get better and worse and different theories what it might be.  

Current symptoms I have are:   
* Complete loss of appetite and thirst + somehow loss of taste buds as everything I eat basically tastes like sand to me    
* sometimes my mouth feels really dry even though I try to drink enough    
*nausaeu on empty stomach as well as after eating (only sometimes)     
* stomach pain after eating (sometimes)   
* digestive issues in general  
* dizziness  
* feelings of discomfort/racing heart after eating sweet stuff  
* general fatigue (I'm not a fit person and don't exercise but walking 5miles is normally no problem for me, now a short walk through the park exhausts me)  
* being tired all the time  
* being really sensitive to heat/having trouble breathing in warm air   
* sometimes being overstimulated by loud sounds (but maybe that's just because I'm feeling crappy in the first place)   
* sometimes having muscle cramps in my legs     


originally I was in the hospital in January because I carried something really heavy and fucked up **my vertebrae which then blocked my lungs and heart and I couldn't breathe while driving**. I got my back fixed so this issue is no longer there. From the blood tests done in the hospital there was a bit of a high blood sugar result so I got tested for diabetes which was negative. Since then I experienced two panic attacks which is something I never had before in my life.  

The first panic attack was after I dyed my hair for the first time. I don't think it was an allergic reaction because I did the 48 hour arm test before but it may have just been triggered by my body being overstimulated from the chemicals so after it happened and I stopped feeling like I was dying I thought ""Okay, so I just won't dye my hair again, no big deal.""   

I was fine in May, felt pretty good but still didn't really eat sweet stuff but then again some people do that for health reasons anyway so I didn't think too much about it. I haven't returned to college but I had an internship lined up for July because I didn't want to waste all this time. I started my internship and everything seemed great, I'm an introverted person but felt really welcome there, liked all the people there instantly and was even excited about the work I would be doing. On my 5th day of working there I had a really good day after feeling really nauseous on Monday and was feeling calm and optimistic. Then, **when I was driving home on the ultra busy motorway I had a complete panic attack where I couldn't regulate my breathing, started hyperventilating and couldn't continue on driving** It took a long time to calm down and I felt awful. I tried again 5 days later to drive there but it happened again (on a smaller scale) and I had to cancel the internship.   

Because my family has a history of liver issues I went back to my doctor and got that checked out, the ultrasound of liver and gallbladder was okay, but **my liver result is double the amount (can be up to 30 and I had 65)**
My brother always has high liver results but only experiences symptoms if he actively eats shitty food or drinks a lot of alcohol. I do none of these things. I think the last time I drank alcohol is about 3 years ago and even back then I only drank like 2 cocktails max. because I'm not comfortable with it. My doctor checked back that it wasn't a hepatitis (which it isn't) and basically said there's nothing else he can do.  

I've already started seeing a therapist about this whole mess but I'm still not sure if these issues can be purely psychological. I've always been a cautious/nervous person and I know how it feels when I'm nervous because of something coming up but I never felt like this before. 
Yesterday I drove a mile into the city and it was a pretty warm day. **I was just randomly standing in line at the post office when I could literally feel this wave of dread and panic come over me even though there was absolutely nothing I was anxious about. I wasn't afraid of the people there, I was in a place I know, my family was literally a mile a way, there wasn't a threat to me, I wasn't even under time pressure**  

So the new theory is **I might have issues with my thyroid** which I ruled out originally because I get it regularly checked because my mom, my sister and my grandmother have issues with it. But then again my last appt. was in January before all these issues began (**I had a lack of Vitamin D** but everything else was okay) so I'll try to get it checked out again.  

**My questions basically are:**  
Do these symptoms for you sound like something familiar and are there certain additional blood results I should tell them to look at?  
Is there something I can do about my high liver result which might help? (I don't drink alcohol at all)  
Is anxiety something that springs on you completely randomly? I always thought it is triggered by certain situations/places/stressors etc.   

I'm in this weird place right now where I'm afraid my doctor will think I'm a hypochondriac and just making theory after theory up but at the end of the day I know my body and I wake up every day not feeling any appetite at all even when I'm feeling good even though I would normally be starving and looking forward to my breakfast. 
This has been going on for a really long time now and even though I try to keep busy and proactive about all this, I'd basically cry in relief if I got a (non-deadly, treatable) diagnosis.   

Any help is appreciated x

I feel like I am going crazy and sinking into my depressive phase (I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder).

My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship; she had to complete her internship in SE Asia and would be coming back in September. I have known for a while that she will be studying abroad next year, but this morning when I received her text messages about finally taking the plunge to go abroad, I kept analysing and ruminating every single word in her message and ended up being indescribably depressed about it. As an overreaction, I replied with visibly upset messages for no reason...

When she replied to me, I realised how wrong I was and how badly I was overreacting, just because of a trivial thing... I had thought I would never see her again and that once she would go abroad, she would forget about me and I would change and forget about her too and we would never see each other again.

It has occurred SEVERAL TIMES to me to overthink and impulsively send her stupid messages, but she has been so patient and understanding. But this time, I think I fucked up hard, my anxiety and worry and nonsensical fears just fucked me over and over and I just want everything to stop. I just want my brain to stop torturing me, I just want myself to stop ruining things I have held so dearly to my heart. I also feel like distance and technology just bring out the worst in me, because I cannot feel her expression and her subtle raise of eyebrow and her eyes and her smiles and her frowns and text messages are just flat and contain zero emotions to me."
6u5qtt,1,2017-08-16,[x-post from /r/CScareerquestions] Research or side projects for undergrad interested in AI?,learndeep,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/6u5qtt/xpost_from_rcscareerquestions_research_or_side/,"Hi, I'm new to Reddit and am looking for some advice. I'm currently an incoming sophomore in undergrad.

I came a poor background and didn't really have STEM activities in high school. The summer before university, I took an online Python course and greatly enjoyed it. The people I met in my first months at university also interested me in pursuing CS.

In my second quarter in university, I heard about this professor who taught an amazing intermediate class for CS majors. Due to prerequisites and final exam conflicts, I could only audit it, but it was my favorite class of freshman year. I asked the professor what CS field has the most potential, and he suggested deep learning.

Being ambitious and a bit naive, I put much time into finding a research position. I wanted to craft a niche and seeing web dev was the rage and deep learning was discussed little amongst CS underclassmen, thought I could use deep learning to stand out. The people I talked to said machine learning, and deep learning especially, doesn't require much advanced math, so I dived in. Wrapping my head around the concepts was (and continues to be) very slow however, as I had to self-study linear algebra and still hasn't taken modeling, optimization, and advanced stats. I encountered many frustrations and headaches but continued to invest time on and off into it.

It has now been seven months since I started learning machine learning and two months into formal research (CNNs and GANs with TensorFlow). I got into a research program for students of disadvantaged backgrounds which provides extensive help in applying to graduate school. I'm also poised to transfer the CS major officially (from Biology) in Fall.

I decided a few months ago that I wanted to work in and contribute as much as possible to AI research. My dream career would be working at Google. Not having much STEM in high school, I thought graduate school might be the best way to expand my problem solving skills and my best shot into Google, such as joining DeepMind with a PhD in CS. But with the vast majority of CS peers going into industry first, I'm not so sure. Machine learning is also much more popular than I initially thought but among upperclassmen, most of whom are also aiming for industry. I'm currently trying to do a bit along both paths, but I don't think that's sustainable the long term as I want to do well in classes and exercise too.

If I continue with the research route, I would be spending the next three years and summers doing mandatory research as part of the research program instead of side projects and internships. This would be in hope of getting into the CS programs of Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley, and MIT.

The industry route offers some financial security -- internships give above minimum wage and maybe even subsidized housing, and it may be tough affording grad school straight out of undergrad. Industry also offers more tangible and immediate results, as well as more social connections.

Most of my current ""side projects"" consist of small contributions to my research projects, but I'm interested in and could make a back end project before interview season.

My counselors and peers all tell me I'm young, to keep doing different things and there is no best decision, but I would appreciate any advice.

Because it's been feeling like an off-and-on insomnia-inducing and concentration-sapping existential crisis over the last few months, haha.

**TL;DR** I want to do AI research in the future and am currently involved in deep learning research, but haven't developed the math and problem solving maturity yet and feel very inefficient. On the other hand, the standard CS internships-and-industry route seems enticing, and I'm wondering if I should pursue that first."

6u6w8s,13,2017-08-16,Experience with voices and manipulated surroundings,robhernandez,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/6u6w8s/experience_with_voices_and_manipulated/,"About a year ago, my wife and I were living in Lone Tree Colorado for the summer while I was doing an internship there. I've had other paranormal experiences that I've already posted about, but This particular time was a little different from any other one that I've had. 

So around this time Pokemon Go was still a huge hit. And yes, I was one of those people who was loving the whole childhood gameboy game resurrection thing. I was doing door to door sales for a company the majority of the time that I was there and honestly it kept me sane throughout the day. 

Anyway, one night my wife and I were watching tv and catching pokemon (our apartment was definitely a hotspot), and then we ran out of pokeballs. Always ran out of those things. So I told my wife I'd take her phone and mine and go walk down the block and grab some more. We had like 3 pokestops along the street right outside of the apartment complex, so it was easy to get more.

It was like 11:30 pm and I'm pretty sure it was a Friday. The day doesn't really matter, because the apartment complex was predominantly a younger crowd and no matter what time or day it was there were usually people outside hanging out on their porches or walking their dogs. But tonight, once I got out of the complex's parking lot, it was different. There was nobody out. Like nobody. No cars were driving by, nobody was walking their dogs, nothing. 

I didn't really notice though until about 5 minutes into the walk. It was so quiet, and there wasn't a soul outside. Nobody was even hanging out on the porches. I still didn't think much of it though. 

The apartments were townhouse style and the complex was like a square with the parking lot and pool in the middle. So I left the parking lot and walked along the road/sidewalk along the outside of the complex where the outer apartments were. There was a big community rec center literally right across the street with huge open field and park. There were streetlights on the side of the apartments, and then a few here and there on the other side where the field/park was.

So I hit the first pokestop. too many potions, not enough poke balls. So I move on to the next one which is like a few hundred yards down the street. By the time I get to the second one, I realized that I hadn't seen anyone or heard anyone, and hadn't even seen a car. It started to feel a little eerie, but not anything crazy. 

Second pokestop, more pokeballs. The third stop was a little bit farther ahead so I figured I'd just go there and then turn around and head back. So I hit the third stop and figured I'd gotten enough pokeballs to last the rest of the night and I turn around. As soon as I started to turn back, the eerie feeling got stronger. 

I was now walking with the apartments on my left and the park on my right, and I kept feeling the need to look across the street over to the field and park. I couldn't see anything though. There weren't any lights in the park itself, just the ones on the side of the road. And that only lit up the sidewalk and you couldn't see into the park at all. I just kept feeling like there was someone over there. 

I kept walking and stopped for a second at the second pokestop again since it had refreshed. Then the feeling that someone was watching me switched sides and I felt like there was someone in the windows of the apartments watching me. I would look every time, but there was nobody there. It was weird though because NOBODY was home. Either that or literally every single apartment I was passing had all of their lights off. It just wasn't how it usually was.

At this point I'm feeling very vulnerable and just trying to keep my cool because the feeling that someone is watching or someone is following me is getting to be overwhelming. The hairs on my neck and arms were standing on end and I just knew that someone was there. I still hadn't seen a single person or car.

I'm walking and consciously making an effort to keep my pace normal and keep my cool so that I don't freak myself out too much. I'm walking and just looking at my phone to distract myself but I keep having to check the windows.

So this is where it gets weird, and I've never had anything like this happen before. I'm walking, and all of the sudden all of the sprinklers on both sides of the sidewalk make this hissing noise like they were about to come up from the ground, but as I pass them they go quiet. It startled me but I didn't think anything of it because who knows what kind of timer they're on. But then it happens again and again the farther I go down the sidewalk. All of the sprinklers make this noise like they're going off and then as soon as I pass they stop. This happened for like a good 45 sec to a minute and I kept turning around to see if any of them actually turned on and none of them did.

Meanwhile, the feeling that someone is behind me and following me is getting worse and worse. 

Also, the apartment complex has these mini streetlight things that also have banners on them with the complex logo. And they are placed about every 50 yards. Finally the sprinklers stop and everything goes silent. Like really silent. No bugs or crickets, no car noises, nothing. I'm still walking and doing my best to keep my cool, and then I pass one of the mini streetlights and it starts shaking, like there's an earthquake or something. 

The only thing I can think of that's similar is like in most horror movies when the entity is angry or whatever, everything in the house starts shaking. As soon as I pass the light post, it stops. I'm starting to walk a little faster because tbh I was freaked out. When I pass the second one it happens again. I remember stopping in front of it and just looking at it like wtf is going on and I was pretty spooked. I kept moving towards home and as soon as I passed it, it stopped. 

This happened three times with three light posts, and then it went silent again. At this point when it stopped I stopped walking because it felt like someone was standing right behind me. I couldn't move. I felt sick. And then as clear as day, in my ear in a low kind of gutteral voice, I hear ""hello."" I whipped around and there was nobody there. No lights on in any houses near me, nobody on any porches, and nobody on the street. I freaked and olympic speed walked towards the parking lot and the feeling of dread and that someone was following me stayed with me the whole time until I got into the parking lot and thankfully saw a few other people getting out into their cars. 

As soon as I saw other people everything went away, but I was still shaken up. I've never had anything like that happen where things around me were affected nor had I ever heard something speak to me that clearly and that directly.  

Any thoughts, comments, or possible explanations would be awesome. "

In what was originally a post from the forum KanyeToThe that has since been deleted, a user has posted screenshots of what they allege to be texts from Coach K saying that for them to work together he (KTT user) has to let Coach K's intern toss his salad (aka eat his ass). 

In this [repost of the KTT thread](https://boxden.com/showthread.php?t=2483833) the user quoted it, which I'll paste here for some extra background. 

&gt;""Head of QC the label, manager for Lil Yachty and Migos, Atlanta icon, got in touch with my roommate recently who's hoping to work in the music industry and well he said some very suspect sh*t
&gt;
&gt;I blocked out my roommates name to protect his privacy but in the first photo he wrote his first name and last initial, then he added his full last name because my friend didn't believe him""

The text messages include two pictures Coach K sent for proof and shows that the area code is 404, which matches the Atlanta zip code you'd expect from Coach K.

There have been constant conspiracies involving hip hop acts being made to do incriminating acts as blackmail, and this only adds fuel to that fire. 

Some users in this thread are alleging that the pictures of Coach K are photoshopped to include the paper. I did an ELA analysis and to my admittedly amateur understanding of how it works the images did seem legit. However, that does not prove whether or not the conversation was photoshopped or whether the number is even his. 

What do you guys think? Does this seem legitimate, or fake? "

- She's spent a lot of time with myself and another grad teaching us how to use software and creating project schedules and just basic shit after hours- and she's a REALLY busy woman - she's the program director and all the senior management love her because she gets things done but she still is ok to teach us things. 

- She's given us small project (20-50K to manage) so that we have experience in project lifestyles. My last job was all grunt work and making Powerpoints. This is stuff that is actually bringing in revenue for the company and I'm out in front of clients and stuff with the supervision of a more experience Project Manager as a ""buddy"".

- She's paid for myself and this other grad to have training- which actually increases our skills and puts on on a path to a certification.

- She's always helpful or finds someone to help us if she's too busy and she never makes us feel dumb.

- She meets with us weekly to see how we're going over coffee and seems genuinely interested in what we have to say.

- She takes our performance management and goals seriously. When I told her I was interested/studied finance, she used her contacts to CREATE a grad role for me in the finance department who normally don't take grads. This were I'm going next and she introduced me to my now mentor. I'm really excited about that actually. I didn't think it would happen so soon and usually your 3rd role is where you stay. 

- She's really scary and everyone listens to her. We have a pretty motivated team because even though everyone works long hours, she's really good about time in lieu, working from home, morning teas and team activities and stuff and pretty much everyone there is really smart and don't treat us like idiots or a nuisance. I like going to work and I don't mind working late because I feel useful. 

- Most importantly, when two other grads who I've become friends with were upset about an asshole boss who was treating them like crap but were too scared to say anything, she fixed it.

I brought it up with her randomly during our weekly catch ups and she looked concerned and told me to set up a meeting after hours. So I did and they showed her some of the emails that he'd sent that were abusive. 

She spoke to our HR grad manager and the HR people basically told that boss that the grads were needed elsewhere and he'd have to put a business justification through as to why he needed grads more. He couldn't as it was grunt work and my two friends were relocated to newly made roles and are a lot happier with their new boss. Their old boss also doesn't know that it was due to the complaint that they made so they feel safer career wise as well. This guy isn't going to get grads for awhile. 

I thought that was so cool what she did but she just said that if you get into positions of power, you can't change or fix everything but you need to have the smarts to change what's in your influence even with organization politics. Like she went out of her way for two grads that had nothing to do with her! I totally want to be like that if I climb up the corporate ladder and be good to the little guys like I am.

Anyway I'm moving on at the end of this month to new last rotation and I feel really sad about leaving because she's such an awesome manager but I'm also glad because the work I'm going to is more relevant to my career goals and degree. 

I want to give her a present or something but I'm worried that's inappropriate because I didn't do that for my old manager and grads don't do that. But I really want to say thank you in a more meaningful way. My parents and friends already tease me about being in love with her because I'm always going on about how great my boss is but I'm not in love with her, I just think she's really awesome and the best boss I've ever had. She's even left a really flattering and detailed recommendation on my LinkedIn and for the other grad too. My old bosses never did that.

What's an appropriate and professional way to say thank you? My dad says I act like a puppy when I mention her and I don't want to act like some kind of squealing fan or a stalker. Like I know I'm just another grad and she treats all the grads and her direct reports well but I guess it just means something to me because I wasn't expecting this much. 

TLDR: What's a professional gesture of thanks to an awesome manager?"

I'm a 16 y/o f, and I have pectus as well as some rib flare on the left side of my body. This is mainly a result of my marfans syndrome which I was diagnosed with when I was 10, I'm also dealing with mild scoliosis and other marf stuff. I fit the marf MO quite well, tall and underweight, its also hard for me to gain weight.

My doctors are recommending the nuss procedure to me because if i need heart surgery later in life due to the marfans the pectus could possibly get in the way of my heart and complicate that procedure. 

I really have nothing to say other than I am so terrified and could really use some support. I have never undergone any surgery in my life and I am terrified that I am not going to be strong enough to get through this. I'm not a very strong person and have never really worked out properly (though now I am starting to bc surgery prep) and I have a pretty low pain tolerance. I can't even imagine the pain i will have after the surgery, and thinking about it makes my stomach churn. I'm afraid of  how it will affect me academically in relation to college (i know the surgery will be happening in summertime if it's going to happen, but that's time I could be using to apply to and do internships or get a job or do ***something*** to beef up my resume, instead of recovering from the surgery). 

I'm really scared it will look weird/bad as well. How intense does scarring tend to be?

idk, i'm just looking for some support/advice, esp on surgery prep/recovery, bc i most likely will be getting the nuss procedure done due to the potential of it complicating possible future heart procedures if the pectus is left alone. any comments are welcome, and i would especially appreciate some from other women because this procedure does affect us differently. thanks :)"

I'm in college and I can't find anywhere to employ me no matter how hard I try. I've spent years building up my school transcripts and my personal resume with community service and internships, but it's not good enough. My poor sister and mother are stuck helping me financially. If I die, then they only have to worry about wasting their money on me one last time. 

2. I'm a forgettable person. If I were to die, people might be upset at first, but over time they would forget about me and move on with their lives. They would find other people to fill the spot that I once held in their life. My mom has other kids, my siblings have other sisters, and my friends have plenty of better friends to replace me with. No one even notices when I'm not around now. Why would it be any different when I'm gone forever?

3. I couldn't even save the person I cared about most. I spent six years trying to take care of my grandma and keep her from dying. All my efforts were futile. Illness raged though her body and took her from me because I didn't try hard enough. 

4. I can't feel anything. Most of the time I feel nothing. No emotions, just the empty void of my pitiful exisitance. 

5. No matter how hard I try, I can never find love. I've gone 19 years on this planet and I've never been able to find a relationship. Nothing. The closest I've ever come is being used by the person I liked for their own personal gain. I didn't even get a relationship out of it. 

6. I'm weak and I've turned to drugs and alcohol to try and drown out the numbness that I consistently feel. 

7. I am scared to live my life and be who I am. I constantly fear that people will judge me for who I really am, so I hide parts of myself and deny who I really am. 

8. There is no point for me to be here on this planet. I have no talents and I mean nothing to the people around me. I've never made a difference in anyone's life and I never will. 

Reasons to stay alive: 

1. My cat might miss me... but probably not. She would probably find someone else to replace me. "

Ever since this break started I've not gone one day without crying about it. I love this man more than I love myself. We've been together for over two years and have been best friends for almost 4. I met him my first year of college. We celebrated our second anniversary a few months back and got engaged. I was (am?) ecstatic. The thought of spending my life with this man is everything I could ever want. It is everything I want. I was under the impression we were smooth sailing. 

Fast forward to now: I've moved out of our college town and back home to complete our internship. He and I have fought a little (I think distance is a factor) but I thought we were still on solid footing. Sunday is when everything flipped for me. Now it's day 5 of our break, day two of going completely no contact. My fiancé says he needed to do this because of months and months of hurt I've caused (some of which I was somewhat aware of and trying to improve upon, though not fast enough I guess, and some that I didn't know and am still not fully sure of). He needs to work on himself and find himself outside of me. And that he would speak to me when he's ready. 

I hate feeling like I'm waiting by the phone but in a sense, I feel like I am. Everyone keeps telling me to channel my energy into something positive; go do something, take your mind off it, forget about him, cheer up, GET OVER IT. How can you do that when a person is literally what you think about the moment you open your eyes in the morning? The moment you close then at night? The reason why you smile? He says I depend too much on him and. I won't say that's wrong. But he's my best friend first. I love him more than anything and it hurts me that I've hurt him and he feels the need to stop talking to me to preserve a friendship or hopefully rebuild our relationship. It hurts a fucking shit ton. I'm trying to act like I'm okay. My mom and dad keep telling me to get over it and shit happens but I can't. I don't know why I can't, because lord knows I've been trying, but I can't. And I don't know what to do. I just want he and I to be normal. I want us to be how it was a couple of months ago. I want..us I guess. He said he'd reach out to me when he feels like he can but I have no idea how long that will be. 

I went through a brief feeling of anger because he was a bit hostile towards me which probably contributed this no contact period but now I just have regret about being angry momentarily, sadness about my relationship, and a feeling of loss within myself and without having him with me anymore. 

How do you forget and move forward? Or at least tolerate and move forward?

Tl;dr my fiancé and I are taking time apart and while he's going and living his life, I'm crying almost every morning. I want to move forward but don't know how. "

#*Problem Statement &amp; Background*

This is my first post in this subreddit, but I’ve been lurking for a few weeks in a few editing subreddits including this one in the hopes of fixing this issue. I was wondering if you guys have any ideas on how to better clear up/sharpen video.

My main projects at my internship are to produce videos. These videos range from video manuals, overviews, procedures, etc. I’ve never had a problem like this persist in the year I’ve been editing videos. The problem I’m having now being blurry video clips of the console screen even after editing them a bit. Since I’m relatively new to video editing, and have only done it for work, I’m sure there are tools I don’t know about, or am not utilizing properly. I’ve watched/read many Lynda, YouTube, Reddit, and Adobe Tutorial videos/articles in attempting to fix this to little benefit. It seems most people love the Unsharp Mask and it works just fine for them. I’ve used it in the past on other videos with success, but only to subtly sharpen video already in good shape.
 
Currently, the edited clip features the **Unsharp Mask**. I applied a well-known technique of adjusting the effect’s variables, but the console screen is still blurry. From what I have tried, Unsharp Mask did the best job of sharpening the footage, and was just marginally better than the Sharpen effect. The four **Convolution Kernel** effects were too intense, and I couldn’t understand what each variable’s effect was on the video. **Brightness &amp; Contrast** hardly did anything, but I believe Unsharp Mask is essentially a local sharpening of the image using Brightness &amp; Contrast anyways.

I’ve included 3 screen-shots to show what’s going on. The first screen-shot shows the edited clip, ***GOPR1576.MP4***. All I’ve done to this clip is reposition, scale, and apply an Unsharp Mask. The second screen-shot shows the unedited clip, ***GP011581.MP4***. The video effects applied to these clips are shown in the third screen-shot. 

The overlaid title tells the viewer to *“Maneuver to “Feed End Timing Encoder.”""*
The text *""Feed End Timing Encoder”"" is shown in the white drop-down menu towards the top of the console screen under the top menu ribbon, however, it’s blurry and difficult to make out. Without the overlaid title that the text reads* “Feed End Timing Encoder,”* the viewer probably wouldn’t be able to make out the text in the drop-down menu.

Once the clips are edited to be clear as possible, I plan on applying those Master Effects to all the clips. Is there anything I am doing wrong, or any tools you think would be useful that I haven’t used? I appreciate any advice, as it will help me finish this project my boss wants done.

#*TL; DR*

The video clips were shot out of a very wide-angle camera, and the console screen I need for the video is blurry when scaled up to fit the screen. I’ve used Unsharp Mask, Sharpen, Brightness &amp; Contrast, and the four Convolution Kernel sharpening effects. It’s certainly possible I could’ve adjusted the variables incorrectly. Is there something I am doing incorrectly or not doing at all?

Thank you very much!

Stacy rolled her eyes, clutching the piece of paper between her fingers. It had her name on it, which meant she officially inherited the role of office slut/cumdump from Hannah.

“Oh thank god,” Hannah sobbed across the board table. The young dark-haired intern had been taking the job for 6 months running now. Every time Stacy returned from her lunch break, she would see Hannah bent over the printer, taking it up the ass from Mr Finnigan, who had a particular anal fetish. Sometimes he would request that Hannah wear a buttplug to work, just so he could fuck her ass any time of day he liked, and leave her plugged with his cum so it wouldn’t drip on the dreary grey carpets their office was covered in. Hannah’s moans and grunts from taking his large cock used to leave her asshole sore, which the entire office knew about. Everyone felt sorry for her.

She had a smear of cum across her cheek from when Derek facefucked her for her 3pm – Stacy didn’t have the heart to tell her. 

The other women at the table heaved collective sighs of relief. Of course they wouldn't get picked. Stacy was young, blonde, blue-eyed with perky tits. No doubt Jeremy had something to do with this.

“Come on, this is ridiculous,” Stacy said. “I did my time! Two whole years of it!” She was a junior executive now, no longer a fresh – or cum-drenched – face intern. The celebratory office gangbang at the end of her tenure still haunted her dreams sometimes.

“Exactly, and now it’s your turn again,” said Charlie. Stacy knew he had a particular fondness for her tits – back in the day he would make her kneel at his desk and pull them out of her blouse while he stroked his cock to them, spilling thick white cum all over her creamy skin. She remembered how hard it was to get those stains out of her blouse.

She wondered if Randy still liked having his asshole licked. That kinky fucker used to prop his feet up at his desk while he made her tongue and kiss his asshole for hours, before blowing his load all over her face. He enjoyed making her walk around the office for a bit before cleaning it off.

“I didn’t know we were taking turns,” she grumbled. 

“We are a fair workplace,” Mr Finnigan said mildly. When she was office slut, he used to bend her over his lap and finger her asshole in perverse fascination, buying larger and larger buttplugs for her to wear and making her pull them out at the end of the day, spreading her cheeks and winking her gaped asshole at him while he jerked off onto her ass cheeks. When he was particularly stressed, he would make her sit on his face while he busied himself ramming his tongue inside her asshole. 

Her asshole clenched up at the thought of taking his large cock up her ass.

Jeremy smirked at her across the table. “Don’t forget the uniform,” he said. Stacy groaned – of course. It comprised a blouse one size too small for her, the top two buttons undone and a skirt that barely covered her round ass cheeks and showed a peek of her pussy if she did anything so much as lean over. Underneath, a bra that pushed up her ample tits to show them off as much as possible, and lace panties that framed her puffy pussy and were often tugged down and up throughout the day whenever someone wanted to use her. Often, she would go home without any panties when one of the men took them as souvenirs.

“You start today,” Mr Finnigan informed her. “The gangbang will be commencing after this meeting, of course, Hannah, so do get prepared.” Hannah gulped nervously. “But it’s business per usual for you, Stacy. I expect great things from you.”

“I bet you do,” Stacy muttered.

*

Stacy emerged from the ladies’ bathroom in her mandated office slut attire. Everyone was just leaving the meeting room, zipping up their pants and tucking their shirts back in. Just beyond the glass walls, she could see Hannah bent over the table, her outfit a torn mess, cum slick on her lips and dripping from her two holes. 

“Stacy!” Randy exclaimed, still licking his fingers clean of Hannah. “You look better than I remembered in that getup. Come by my cubicle first, I want that tongue between my cheeks before lunch.” He winked, and walked away. Mr Finnigan was busy rifling through a cabinet in the office, full of dildos and ring gags and vibrators and anal beads and whatever else these heathens could come up with. He looked at her, smiled, and held up a thick butt plug.

Stacy groaned.

Hi DPP! So this is somewhat of a sequel or companion prompt to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6ltzwg/22f4m_charity_anal_booth/).

The previous time I posted this, I received plenty of upvotes but close to no good responses. I still very much would like to play this out!

There are many directions this can take, but the role of office slut in this particular office is quite unique, in that everyone takes the position seriously and doesn't demean her for doing her job. Any kind of humiliation is more tongue-in-cheek and office-prank style than truly degrading. 

You will be playing one (or more) of the characters in the prompt, depending on what you're into! 

* Mr Finnigan: anal fetish, rimming (her), butt plugs, anal, face sitting. Some ideas have already been mentioned in the prompt and I'd love to play them!
* Derek: blowjobs, deepthroating, facefucking, not being allowed to clean her face/lips
* Randy: rimming (him) while he smirks and barks orders to lick deeper
* Charlie: jerking off onto tits and making her walk around with his cum on them
* Jeremy: the enigmatic one - what's *his* kink?
* The rest of the office: free use of her pussy!
* A gangbang during an office meeting is always on the table (get it because Stacy might literally be on the table *wink wink nudge nudge*). I love the idea of the office fucking her senseless while discussing business.

I'm open to name changes and you creating a character of your own with his own unique kinks, but the ones as detailed in the prompt are the ones I really like. I'll be playing Stacy, not Hannah (who will be blessedly excused from the proceedings), so please don't expect a FFM threesome :P

Smut is primarily on the agenda here, but a bit of detail to add a dash of realism and characterisation would be great! Please be literate and mind your spelling and grammar. This RP will be in **third person and past tense.**

Do let me know what character(s) you'd like to play, and include a response to the prompt itself if you can! Take your time sending a response, and it is **not** a time-sensitive offer. Responses don't have to be as long as the prompt, of course. I like realistic dialogue and characters - as realistic as an office slut set up can get :P I'm looking to make this a long term RP, so this doesn't have to be responded to in the immediate hours after this is up.

I hope to hear from you! &lt;3 

Kinks: rough sex, lots of cum, spanking, dildos, buttplugs, anal beads, vibrators, anal, reluctant or forced orgasms, humiliation, ball sucking, rimming (giving and receiving), having cum on face/skin/clothes, **office banter**

Limits: name calling, scat, gore, ageplay, incest, ""daddies"" and George in HR"

#*TL; DR*

The video clips were shot out of a very wide-angle camera, and the console screen I need for the video is blurry when scaled up to fit the screen. I’ve used Unsharp Mask, Sharpen, Brightness &amp; Contrast, and the four Convolution Kernel sharpening effects. It’s certainly possible I could’ve adjusted the variables incorrectly. Is there something I am doing incorrectly or not doing at all?

Thank you very much!"
6uadvm,23,2017-08-17,The basic truth about the motion design industry...,designer_6487,motiongraphics,https://www.reddit.com/r/motiongraphics/comments/6uadvm/the_basic_truth_about_the_motion_design_industry/,"Greetings to all motion designers, graphic designers, etc.

I'm posting this to inform all designers regarding their careers and ways to possibly improve on their work. All of this information is based on my experiences and what I've seen in other designers reel/portfolio.

1. Create original content for yourself only, DO NOT recreate tutorials and apply it to your portfolio/reel. It's one thing to use a technique or use a shortcut towards your project, however, don't follow a tutorial step by step, change the colors, and call it your work. Chances are, when other designers see, they will easily be able to tell that you used a tutorial. 
(NOTE: Some companies/studios possibly, may not tell that you copied a tutorial, however, they'll expect you to do work that's only going to be just as good or better than what you showcased. Overall, create work that you can be proud of in the end). This whole point refers to the next point.

2. At some point in your career, you're going to run into a problem regarding any Adobe programs, Cinema 4D, Maya, 3Ds Max, etc. and the internet won't be able to help unless you refer to creative cow, or Reddit. When you get into the industry and you're serious, you become a problem solver to yourself and to the company that hires you. Being a problem solver means that you are going to be learning no matter what. It may not be every day, but you will learn constantly about a new feature, a new shortcut, program, anything that'll only help you in the long run.

3. Don't work for free, unless...
It's regarding your internship that'll help you build a portfolio/reel.
(This is my opinion, internships overall but especially in the design field, should pay, whether it's minimum wage, or not. I believe that creativity should be rewarded with compensation, not only a good looking resume or referral). Lots of family members, friends, or people that are looking for free designs will expect you to do work for free. They expect you to do the ""hook me up"" bid. Be careful with who you affiliate yourself with when it comes to your career.

4. STAY AWAY from clients that say the following lines...
""C'mon you can do it in like 5 minutes, I can do this myself.""
""This will be an exciting opportunity for you. You'll be a great member of the team.""
""When we go big, you'll definitely be paid for your work.""
""I'll know it when I see it.""

5. Studios/Companies/Agencies will only post their best work on their website. This is something that every designer does. However, don't be surprised that studios have lots of pieces they're proud of. Truth is, the work showcased on their sites may not even pay as much as you think. These places have clients that pay for the roof over their heads, yet, they're not proud of it. It's unfortunate, I know.

6. (Lastly) Put out the work that you want to be hired for. If you want to be hired for Animation, then put out Animation work. If you want work regarding visual effects, do some compositing work, you get the point.

7. I know this is hard for those (like myself) who live far away from the major cities like L.A, New York, Chicago, or even the UK, but try your best to attend events, conferences, and meetings that seek your interest. It's great to connect yourself to all sorts of people. I know, I know, you're probably not an open person, but you gotta break the shell and just meet people. Be open but be careful with who you meet. (Reference to #4). On top of this, try your best to look for any remote work. Most places want you to work on-site so that they can say that the studio made the content, not you entirely. Hopefully, you can find some nice work out there in the field, whether in person or not. 

If you want more stories on clients and designers or anyone that experiences a bad client story, visit clientsfromhell.net

(Not trying to show off but...) if you're curious as to what I do, you can look at my instagram: @ljones6487

With all this information, please comment if you have any stories or similar experiences. Also, comment if you have any other advice for all designers they should be aware of or consider."
6uas3p,2,2017-08-17,"Me [23M] with my longtime girlfriend [22F], I'm way richer than her and it's damaging the relationship.",joaohonesto,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6uas3p/me_23m_with_my_longtime_girlfriend_22f_im_way/,"Hello mates. Thanks for reading and helping :) Sorry for any grammar errors, as English is not my native language!


Both me and my girlfriend come from upper-class brazilian families; my parents were always financially responsible and saved for their retirement, while her parents were really imprudent and lived over their limits.

An year ago, her dad got fired and had to find a new job paying 1/4 what he earned before; so their family is going downhill: fights between mom and dad, lack of money, they had to move to a smaller house, sell their cars, etc...


Meanwhile, 6 months after graduating (Economics), I landed a great, stable job that pays ~110k USD/year in another city. Considering that we live in Brazil, you guys could imagine how 110k is a really high wage.


She's on the last year of college (Biology) and had to start working part-time to survive and maintain herself on college, earning about 6k USD/year on an internship. As that's not enough to live by herself in another city, I offered to help to pay some expenses (like rent/utilities) until she finishes college and can move with me.


The problem is: she's, understandably, unhappy with the situation. She didn't wanted to receive my help until she understood that, without me helping, she would have to quit college as her or her parents didn't have the money to pay her rent of her food.


She's crying a lot due the situation and end up having fights with me, saying things like ""I don't want you paying for my things as, later, you'll throw that in my face"" or ""Your family/friends will think that I'm only with you for money"". But I just love her and want her to finish her last year of college, so she can get her degree to start her professional life.


How can I make this situation more bearable?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I got a high paying job while my girlfriend is having financial problems. I want to help her to survive while she's living alone to finish her degree, but she's sad and mad about the whole situation. How to make it better?"

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me.

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested.

6ubvg7,6,2017-08-17,Why does talking about being depressed make it worse?,thachristmaspoo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6ubvg7/why_does_talking_about_being_depressed_make_it/,"I have been depressed for a long time. Most of the time, I just keep it go myself, because I feel like it's the only way I can be normal and try to make friends and be happy. But as time goes on and I keep it all to myself, it just grinds away at me. It's like I'm eroding from the inside out until I feel like a hollow shell of a person, numb to all experience. At these rougher times, I sometimes try to talk to a friend. But once the floodgates open, it all just comes out, and I don't try to do it but I think I overwhelm people.

I usually just end up losing my friends or feeling so self conscious about it I cut them off completely. I've tried therapy, but the same thing happens where I can't make myself keep going and then it's even worse because I have to pay someone to give a shit and then I stop going and get billed even further. 

I've ruined all my relationships, and the worst part is that I'm the prime candidate for the ""what do you have to be depressed about"" conversation. I am conventionally attractive (not that that means anything), I've had decent jobs and internships, and I go to a very selective college. Everyone thinks I have nothing to be depressed about but I still just want it all to go away and I feel like talking about it just doesn't work. It makes it worse."

It didn't went so well. When I was told about what I would be doing they were not very clear on what I would be doing so I ended up in a job that I ""couldn't"" do and a job that should not be done by me. I winged it, everytime I needed to do something new I'd searched online, ask here and there and ended up making something that failed through with my exit due to paperwork and stubborness. 

Meanwhile I'm investing my time on courses and learning new stuff. The problem is, nothing makes me fell fullfilled. Nothing makes me say ""I'm absolutely sure that I like this and I want to do this!"". Nothing. My degree is a a masters in electronics engineerng with a specialization in industrial management. I've been learning data analysis and data science in my free time. I have knowledge in lots of areas and still nothing appeals to me. All seems meh to me. So I don't know where should I turn to even start searching.

I'm pretty sure many people have been in this situation. What do you have to say to someone who's struggling with this? Did you ever found a job that made you happy and fullfilled? Did you skipped jobs in order to find what do you really like to do? You made a drastic move and switched to something completely different? Tell me all about it"

I am currently working full time and going to school for my masters in counseling. Once I finish in December 2018, I plan to leave my current well paying job and starting my intern hours. I will probably make about 45K a year during that time (about a 1/4 of my current income). In order to make it through the lean years, I am working to save as much money as I can. I have managed to sock away 25K (the most I've ever managed to save), but I have a couple of debts which require a pretty significant payment each month.

I come from a cash poor family with few money management skills. Having this money in my savings makes me feel secure which is why I get nervous about spending a large chunk, but I have a feeling that's not the best strategy.

School Tuition: $12,500
Medical loan: $6200
Savings: $25,000

Option 1: Keep following my current payment plan (about $650 a month) and keep saving whatever I can

Option 2: Pay these debts off now which reduces the debt and monthly payments, but obviously makes a big dent in my savings. If I follow this approach I would just put the extra $650 into my savings each month.

Option 3: Pay the larger debt only and keep the medical loan which costs me $175 a month and put the difference into savings each month.

I look forward to your advice.

How much should I invest, and what kind of investments should I look at?

(Sorry this turned out longer than I thought so bear with me). 
I'm a 20 year old undergrad CS student going into my 3rd year at a fairly decent CS public university. I've been interning at software companies for the last 2 summers and have close to 20k saved up. I want to put as much as money as I can in high-medium risk investments.

The way I see it, now is the time to take risks. Every penny well-invested at this age will make a huge difference at 30 or 40. I have no baggage that comes with adult life, and have the energy and focus to learn and invest. I've had summer internships paying 20 &amp; 30 an hour for the last 2 years, and I'm confident I'll find more income opportunities throughout college. I have the privilege of having parents who pay for my tuition and have gotten to be pretty well-off themselves since immigrating to America. So I know this is probably a super privileged thing of me to say, but right now I'm not that worried about financial stability after college; I want to take risks early on for a chance to make it big. My current thought is: worst case, I lose everything I have, and I'll spend a few months earning it back as a software developer. Best case: I get lucky and get a solid head start at a young age.

As of now, I have about 7k invested in a few stocks (most in Google, some in Netflix, and a few penny stocks). I've cashed out ~500 already since last year, but am trying to increase my returns. Recently I've been monitoring bitcoin and other cyrptocurrencies and am trying to learn more about investing in general.

So my questions are: 

1) How much of my savings should I be investing? 

2) Is my viewpoint of high-risk, high-reward investing wise or just naive? 

3) Depending on 1 &amp; 2, what kinds of investments should I be looking at?

Bottom line is I want to invest as much as I can while I'm still young and healthy without doing something stupid I'll regret later. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks!"

Also, any general recommendations would be greatly appreciated. I will be graduating in 2019 and hoping that this internship will help me to land a job in 2 years down the road.

Thanks"

We have fun here, but we can't lose sight of our ultimate goal of being assholes and nuisances to people who deserve it. I will try to keep a compiled list of targets for when you're bored.  
  
  
--- Red Level --- 
  
Those under this level of severity have displayed extreme faggotry or autism beyond reproach. They are worthy of your strongest Chipperson bombardments and dick pic attacks.  
  
- Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes  
Detriment to comedy on the show for years, a true narcissist, a compulsive liar, and purveyor of fat mammaries. A lost cause.   
  
- Brother ""Jenkem"" Joe  
Professional leech and seller of used songs. Notable accounts of child abuse ranging from depriving his own of an education to coerced extraction of bodily fluids from others. Possible motorcycle gang ties, USE CAUTION.   
  
- Jason Ellis  
As if the fact that he's Australian isn't enough, he's a 57 year old cuckhold faggot who wants you to believe he's a radical skateboarder or something. Fucks his dad and makes pissy swipes at other channels on his platform.  
  
- Covino and Rich  
Generic homosexual radio duo that compete with Ellis for a mancave-dwelling dudebro market. Passive aggressive and disingenuous to the highest caliber. Especially prone to Edgar attacks.   
  
- Sam Roberts  
Professional wrestling shill and wannabe broadcaster. Sustained only by chicken nuggies and shitty pop like Mr. Pibb. Undeserved ego and entitlement. Provides nothing to his radio show nor his child. Face of a cro magnon and possibly a brain of one considering his juvenile fixations on pornographic action dolls.   
  
- Patton ""the Smotherer"" Oswalt  
5'1"". 260 pounds. All wife murderer. Never denies sexual abuse of his daughter, so also likely confirmed. If there's one thing he hates more than his spouses, it's drumpf xDD  
  
- Von DeCarlo  
Untalented whore who makes her bones off the memory of her dead boyfriend, Patrice O'Neal. He was 14 years old.  
Conned his fans of a couple hundred thousand toward European vacations.   
  
- Dante Nero  
A mess of fat and skintags that would like you to believe he's as talented as Patrice. He's not, and shows no remorse making money off his memory.   
  
- ""Cellar Crowd""  
Basically Dante Nero but in the form of a YouTube channel.  

- Joe Matarese  
Some boring old failed comic selling any dumb shit possible to remain relevant. Normally people like this fade away when ignored, but Matarese hangs on like a cancerous tumor. Posts three new GoFundMe pages a day.   
  
- Nia Burr  
Confirmed monster and animal abuser. Despises anything male and white. Has ruined a formerly great man's comedy routine and podcast. Cheated on her husband and is forcing him to rear her black baby.  
  
- Sherrod ""my tongue is not"" Small  
Racist characiture brought to life. Preys on white people, particularly the female and overweight. He also wants to reeducate today's youth with historical misinformation. Argumentative tactics range from screaming in an autistic fervor to the trademark negro violence tecnique.   
  
- Jim Jeffries  
Long-time Aussie and recent hair plug recipient. Sold himself to (((Comedy Central))) as a self-righteous SJW fag.
  
- Amy Schumer  
Makes Bob Kelly look thin. Makes Rich Vos's material look fresh and hilarious. Basically a smelly, thieving farm animal.
  
- Gavin M. and the Proud Boys  
On a vast campaign to turn young men gay by targeting alt-right basement virgins. LOVE to shove things up their ass.   
  
- Father Dorris and the Philly Crew
Currently competing with the Proud Boys for turf, marking their respective territory with each other's cum. Essentially Lyndsi Margera's white trash family pretending to like Opie for just a taste of that radio money. They also violate the sanctity of marriage not only through their sexual behaviors but by clothed, gay ritual. (Source: Opie's Eye) 
  
- Brother Wease  
Some faggot buzzard who willingly gives sexual predators like Gregg Hughes a place to speak. Also named himself ""Brother Wease.""  
  
- Danny Ross
Oy vey, goyim! Danny is a fag (fag) fucking douchebag (bag) who gets fired from every job he's worked for being a cantankerous little crybaby bitch. Only remained relevant as long as Anthony used his mouth for a pocket pussy. Currently selling bootlegged Nintendo products for quadruple their worth in order to get some money for hair plugs.   
  
- Kieth the Cop  
Has been entertaining Ant's dwindling mental faculties for years and has been adopting the ruthless business moves of the shady Jews he claims to hate, except without the success. Wants to make sure no one on the internet can hear CP Media unless you pay $8.95 a month and a vial of blood from your first born.  
  
- Doug Benson  
DUDE  
WEED  
LMAO!  
  
- All Jews  
  
  
--- Yellow Level ---  
  
Those who have displayed inconsistent faggotry and/or have some redeeming qualities to their autism. Hateable, not as much as red level.   
  
- Anthony Cumia  
Rib-shattering kicks and jaws of steel. He also administered multiple doxxing threats following innocent congratulating of his relationship with confused gentleman, Sue Lightning. Suspected terrorist ties and operates a shady business network. Can be funny though.  
  
- Carl ""Mad Cuban"" Ruiz  
Professional laugher. Still stands with a sex offender. Cries over chocolates. Probably makes good food though.  
  
- Joe Rogan  
4'7"" pontificating faggot. Sucks protein and testosterone supplements straight from a gazelle's cock. Still thinks weed makes you cool. Sometimes puts on a good show.   
   
- Bill Burr  
Cuckhold and balding ginger. Makes Nia Burr feel loved, a crime in and of itself.
  
- Daniel ""Bobo"" Kurlan   
Notorious money swindler and a quarter retard. Continues to beg good people for a NASA shuttle's budget in order to buy Advil for his mom's leg.   
  
- Joe DeRosa  
Shoulderless zilch who still deserves harassment though he's almost fully faded into obscurity.   
  
- Louis C.K.  
Basically a manic spic who lets his employers decide his political values. Also forces women to watch him masturbate. Still funny though.   
  
- Big Jay ""Pig Gay"" Oakerson  
Lost Korn roadie who thinks he's a comic and insists on ruining podcasts. Unforgivable choice in hand accessories.   
  
- Gail Bennington  
Inherited her father's figure, but none of his talent. Also flagrantly racist against the African-American community.    
  
- Troy Quan  
Similar levels of Jason Ellis faggotry, but fucking his dad is still up in the air. Murdered his girlfriend through gravity and frequently debates world-renowned scientists, armed with wikipedia print-outs.   
  
- Any regular callers to Opie's former show.
  
  
--- Green Level ---
  
Largely forgiveable silly geese that still retain qualities worth making fun of to prevent them from entering ""good egg"" territory.   
  
- Jim Norton  
Unsuccessful comedian who is ultimately a sweet boy and has just recently begun to deliver lip-synched slideshows for his ""animated cartoon"" GoFundMe. Thinks he's smart and likes to rail for hours on eggs and sobriety. This needs to stop.   
  
- Dani Golightly  
Some dumb mousey golddigger who is ultimately just a confused victim at the end of the day. Same goes for any female in Anthony's company.    
   
- Artie Lange   
Funny guy. So funny that you'll want to hear his anecdotes 100 times... and you will!  
Needs to get clean. Absolutely will not get clean.   
  
- Lauren ""Chins McGillicutty"" Kubera  
Tries to contribute, ultimately just pulls down anything funny within radius. It's our duty to keep comparing her chin to industrial tools and other non-feminine objects.  
  
- Scorch  
Radio and television veteran. Budding actor. Known to cheat co-hosts and the IRS. Loveable but cannot be trusted.   
  
- Vic Henley  
Redneck dyke lost in New York. Drives a ""meat truck,"" both the term given to his vehicle and his asshole. Left Gregg Hughes the second the money was gone, but still joined him in the first place.  

- Esther Ku   
Unfunny slope with the most scrumptious little body.  
  
- Roland Campos  
Expedited Opie's inevitable firing, but still morbidly obese and fairly retarded.  

- Erik ""Piggie Boy"" Nagel  
(See Roland)

As you can see the problematic hop is Zayo intern. I contacted Blizzard support, I got the answer:

&gt;Look there are already forum posts about it
&gt;It's your ISP's fault, contact them

First I [contacted Zayo directly](http://www.zayo.com/contact/) just to hear them saying:

&gt;It's your ISP's fault and we can't help you since we can't help the customers of our customers, unfortunately


Okay. I am living in a student hostel right now and I am directly connected to the university network. The ISP is bascially by neighbour and my friend, so I just called him/sent him all the details and guess what:

&gt;Sorry I really can't help you, as you can see the problematic hop is Zayo intern. I wrote them a message and pointed out the problem, but that's all I can do. 


GG... I mean **[literally](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17612922301?page=1) [all](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20749107652) [those](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20745114397) [threads](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758548053) [and](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4lpjgk/uk_latency_overwatch_zayo/)** they just answer in support tickets or in forums ""It's your ISP's fault"", ""Disable X"", ""Have you followed our guide?"" =&gt; You get the feeling that they can't read traceroute files.

It's triggering me. It's Zayo's fault, and the only ""customer"" of Zayo who is able to fix this stupid problem is guess what - BLIZZARD. It's really amazing, I've played many games in my life, but this is the first game where I see so many people complaining about routing problems.

**TL;DR:**

Sitting in Germany, trying to play on EU Server in Paris (normally 15 ms), but because of Blizzard + Zayo my packets are routed over half the planet around the US and Blizzard does not seem to feel responsible for it, even though they have to contact Zayo to resolve the problem.

Point of this thread: To get attention. ISP can't help, Blizzard can't help, Zayo can't help. Maybe reddit can't help - let's see."

I'm currently a junior and I was hoping I could get more information about a career in audio.

6ufwxm,15,2017-08-18,My current employer (engineering internship) is offering to pay off my school loans and provide me with a job immediately after graduation.,Dibz15,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ufwxm/my_current_employer_engineering_internship_is/,"Some background: I got an internship for this summer at an engineering company, and I'm currently working towards a B.S. of Electrical Engineering full-time during the year (I will be a junior this fall with a 3.98 GPA). I've been working here so far for 2.5 months, and so far I have enjoyed the work I do, the people I work with, and the experience that I've gotten.
Today, I had a meeting with the CEO and HR manager about possible future employment. They said they've enjoyed having me and they see me as a valuable asset and would hate to see me go or never have me again in the future. What I wasn't expecting is that along with future employment, they said that they would pay off my student loans ($90,000) in return for some set period of employment with them. Needless to say, I was very surprised. They didn't mention specifics of what this would look like, they said they just wanted to see if I would be open to that sort of agreement. I said yes to see what it would look like, but I have some questions/concerns:

Is this a common situation/offer? If so, what's a common way to handle it. 

This is my first engineering job, and I'm afraid I won't know if I could get a better offer somewhere else. What things could I find out to know if it's a good deal, and how to avoid it being a bad situation?

Any general tips or questions to ask them? Anything to watch out for?

In general, I've been very impressed with them, and I've gotten to know the management pretty well. I feel like they're being honest with their intentions, but I would like to know how to handle this. 

Thanks!"

All of my shifts are midnight to 8am, Thursday to Saturday, watching the four floors of the building my company is contracted to. My internship is 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.

In the last few days, I've gotten 4 hours of sleep a day. I just fell asleep for around 10 minutes.

I guess I feel kinda bad about that. I know I'm new to this, but I'm just so tired.

I thought I could balance working in two places, but my security company gave me a shift that wasn't on the schedule I signed off on when I signed the papers to work for them (They put me on the schedule for Wednesday too, accidentally or otherwise). It's only my third day this week. I have to work tomorrow night, too, and I'm only gonna be able to get around 4 hours of sleep today.

I am writing here on behalf of my friend who studied Diploma in Patisserie from Le Cordon Bleu in Malaysia. She just finished her diploma around two months ago and she has been unable to do a proper internship because her distant hometown has really not much of any pastry stuff going on.

She took up internship at Mariott Hotel, but unfortunately for a hotel of that caliber they did nothing everyday in the kitchens to a point she just withdrew. It was really pathetic. The whole kitchen would just be empty, no stock of important pastry ingredients as well. 
I think this is due to the fact the pastry demand in her hometown is very less.

However, after much consideration she is planning to take up an Advanced Diploma in Bread course at Le Cordon Bleu for 6 months. 
Do you all think it is worthwhile? What would be your suggestions?

Thank you, and regards! 
Looking forward to your replies."

Grew up very poor (shared bed with brother growing up, shared the room with 4 siblings). No air conditioning. No running water for years. Single parent (father). 

Because of my accomplishments (hackathons,  competitive math and programming competitions) I was able to get an internship this summer earning $25 /h at a company you've heard of. 

Lurker here for a year. 

I'm a kissless virgin

I'm not balding

I'm 6 ft tall, White 

I fully acknowledge I'm socially crippled. I've had video game sessions that were 36 hours long. I'm actually good. grand master ranked  in overwatch. 

I was beat up by a group of girls in middle school. White  knight teachers and students refused to intervene and there was no consequences for the girls despite video evidence. It scarred me emotionally. 

I've considers suicide but I have to to help my siblings (I have 9 total) Before I can find peace going.  Because of my internship I have already done a lot of good. 

I acknowledge I waste too much time browsing these forums wallowing in my own sadness. It's toxic for me. But also cathartic to hear others stories.

I will be graduating in the Spring and I am trying to decide what to do career wise. I like the work/life balance of the government, plus the pay is decent. The only the I don't like is the difficulty and amount of work. I know I shouldn't be complaining but many times I am just sitting at my desk for the day. I like to be challenged and currently I am not being so. Once I graduate, I can be converted to a full time employee at a level 7. I was told it is easy to move around and get broad experience.

My question really is does anyone regret staying in the government and not pursuing a career in the private sector? In my case, I am a finance major. How did you weigh the pros and cons? If I am able to easily move around, I will most likely stay in the government but I just want to be challenged. Also based on experience, how quickly can you move up in pay grade?"

I've been here since then (Intern, Inside Sales, Account Executive, Supervisor) and have developed a love/hate relationship with my career. I can get into more details at the bottom of this post, but my general questions are:

- 1) To anyone who has worked in sports sales, where did your next career move take you? Outside the industry? Was the pay much better? Did you hate your job? What industry would you recommend? How did you go about finding it? Do you regret it? Is it worth ""sticking it out"" or looking at other departments within the organization?

- 2) To anyone who has no experience in sports sales, do you know anyone who was in my position? Maybe someone that you worked with that came from sports? Same questions can be applied as above...

*More about me:

- I have worked alongside and under some amazing people. I've always been able to learn from them, ask questions, pick their brains, and get close with them to where some are now my best friends.

- The culture and environment in sports is always said to be ""like nowhere else"". From being at every single event, to being able to provide unforgetable experience to fans, family, and friends, to getting those same people down on the field/court/ice or in the locker-rooms. The benefits and perks are there, but sometimes even those things can't prevent you from thinking: I want my weekends to myself, I want to make more money and be properly compensated, etc.

- I was close to leaving in Fall 2016 when I was ""ready to take on a new challenge"" (aka was fed up with the stress and pay and wanted to be compensated better, while not having to make 100 calls everyday and dealing with the same issues at hand). At that time, another company (tourism) offered me a managerial role that would pretty much double my salary at the time. However, that salary was the maximum I could hit and after trying to negotiate a little higher, the fit just didn't seem right.

- I was also interviewing for a sales role within the construction industry. I had a friend who worked in the company and based on our conversations, he was pretty well off. Interviews went well but when it came to salary talks, I just wasn't getting what I expected and it didn't seem worth for me leave something I ""loved"" for something that wouldn't be paying that much more. Funny thing is, they reached out to me again last month asking if I was interested in interviewing at another branch, but the location just didn't work out for me.

- I eventually stayed here as a new position was created (supervisor) which came with a slight pay raise and then obviously still had the option for commission (~$20k).

- I can always provide more info but don't really want to make this a type of ""Guess Who?"" game. Any help and answers would be much appreciated and if there's anything I can help with, please let me know.

Thanks for reading!!"

Erik Prince thinks he can turn around the war in Afghanistan, and he’s got a PowerPoint deck to explain the whole thing. The Blackwater founder brought it with him to the Corner Bakery on North Capitol Street in Washington last Thursday, printed out and placed in a presentation binder. He’s been shopping it around D.C. And on Friday, when President Trump huddles with his advisers at Camp David to plot a way forward it will be in the mix.

The 16-year-old war in Afghanistan has become a central point of conflict in the White House as the administration passes the half-year mark without having settled on a new strategy. Trump has so far rejected the proposals brought to his desk. The troop increases favored by his generals, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, are strongly opposed by his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and the president himself is skeptical of such approaches.

The “America First” ethos on which Trump campaigned is bumping up against the approach of his military brass. But an answer may finally be at hand. Trump and top administration officials will gather at Camp David on Friday to discuss South Asia strategy. Vice President Pence is even cutting his Latin America trip short to join the talks.

But this is not just an argument between warring elements within the administration. Plans to privatize the war proposed by two businessmen with ties to the White House have become a linchpin of the debate. Prince is proposing to send private contractors to Afghanistan instead of U.S. troops, and have the entire operation overseen by a “viceroy.” The billionaire investor Stephen Feinberg has also submitted a proposal using contractors. Both have met with top administration officials on the matter. Their involvement was [first reported](http://ift.tt/2wXkTlj) by _The New York Times_last month. In recent weeks, their lobbying effort has ramped up, as Trump signals he is nearing a decision. And Trump is said to favor using at least some of Prince and Feinberg’s proposals.

However, a document has circulated within the National Security Council and to Cabinet members this week, according to a senior administration official who reviewed it. It offers notes from meetings ahead of Friday’s showdown, summarizing a plan to convince the president to agree to the “R4+S” escalation plan. The document, this official said, characterizes the surge as the only credible option for Afghanistan, dismissing the other options of withdrawing completely or using contractors or paramilitaries with a minimal U.S. counterterrorism presence. Asked about that characterization of the document, NSC spokesman Michael Anton said it “sounds wrong to me.”

When I met Prince, he was coming from a morning of TV hits. Prince has been campaigning hard in favor of his proposal, as well as shopping it on Capitol Hill and in the White House, where he was headed next.

Prince calls his proposal “A Strategic Economy of Force.” It entails sending 5,500 contractors to Afghanistan to embed with Afghan National Security Forces, and appointing a “viceroy” to oversee the whole endeavor. Prince said some version of the idea had been percolating in his mind since he first went to Afghanistan in 2002; he knew then, he said, that the Pentagon wasn’t going to be able to resolve this. But it wasn’t until the Trump administration that he felt it really had a shot; “There are some phone calls where it’s not even worth wasting the electrons on,” he said when I asked why he hadn’t proposed this idea during the Obama administration. Obama approved a substantial troop increase for Afghanistan in his first term.

Prince wouldn’t let me keep a copy of the plan, though he showed it to me and walked me through it, and let me take photos of a couple pages—especially the page comparing his idea to Trump’s turnaround of the Wollman Rink in New York. “Make sure to get the Wollman Ice Rink,” Prince said. “Please be sure to use that in the article.”

[](http://ift.tt/2uYjZTY's%20proposed%20plan) Prince’s proposed plan (Rosie Gray) Under Prince’s plan, the viceroy would be a federal official who reports to the president and is empowered to make decisions about State Department, DoD, and intelligence community functions in-country. Prince was vague about how exactly this would work and which agency would house the viceroy, but compared the job to a “bankruptcy trustee” and said the person would have full hiring and firing authority over U.S. personnel. Prince wants to embed “mentors” into Afghan battalions. These mentors would be contractors from the U.S., Britain, Canada, South Africa—“anybody with a good rugby team,” Prince quipped. Prince also wants a “composite air wing”—a private air force—to make up for deficiencies in the Afghan air capabilities.

Prince said McMaster’s office called him to discuss his ideas after he wrote an op-ed outlining the plan in _The Wall Street Journal_in May. But McMaster “hates it,” Prince said. Since then, Prince has met with McMaster to discuss the proposal. “He remains committed to more troops and more money,” he said. “We’ll leave it at that.”

The same can be said for the other military brass playing key roles on Afghanistan policy.

“The adults hate it,” said a congressional aide who has seen the plan, referring to McMaster, Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Mattis acknowledged that his analysis of the problems in Afghanistan is correct, Prince claimed, while disagreeing on his recommendations. On Monday, Mattis confirmed in a press gaggle that the contracting proposals were under consideration. A Pentagon spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

According to officials familiar with the proposals, Mattis, McMaster, Tillerson and others in the administration have two main objections to the Prince plan: One is that they believe Prince is downplaying how much it will truly cost, and the other is that they assume allies will ditch the U.S.-led effort once a switch is made to contractors instead of uniformed troops.

It is Bannon and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner who have advocated giving Prince and Feinberg’s ideas a hearing. Prince said he had not yet met with the president himself on the issue. “I know he’s seen part of it. I know he liked my op-ed,” Prince said. According to a source familiar with the process, the Prince proposal hasn’t been formally presented to Trump.

Feinberg, on the other hand, has met with Trump, as well as Kushner. One senior administration official said Feinberg has met more than once with Trump in the Oval Office. Through his investment firm Cerberus Capital, Feinberg controls the huge military contractor Dyncorp. He is also a confidant of Trump and has known him from business circles since before Trump became president. Feinberg was considered for a czar-type position overseeing an intelligence review earlier this year, but the idea was stymied by a vehement backlash from the intelligence community. Feinberg does not have an intelligence background.

Feinberg is proposing ideas similar to Prince’s; Prince said the two were 95 to 98 percent in agreement, though “he wrote his thing, I wrote mine.”

A source close to the situation said Feinberg had been asked to submit a “strategic recommendation” for Afghanistan that is “materially different with respect to the use of independent contractors from the plan Erik Prince proposed.”

Sean McFate, a Georgetown professor and former DynCorp contractor, described Feinberg’s plan for contractors as “more status quo. He wants to take the current mission and just make it bigger.”

But according to one senior administration official, Feinberg is angling to be the “viceroy” described in Prince’s plan.

Prince wouldn’t tell me who he has in mind for the viceroy job, but he confirmed that Feinberg is interested in it. “He’s one of them,” Prince said. “He has a lot of business experience and turning around distressed businesses. So, that’s an option for a guy. But it has to be someone who understands the military and intelligence aspects as well.”

A senior administration official said that the administration has been talking to Feinberg about taking a senior job somewhere in the national-security apparatus, and one option that has recently been discussed is a role in the Afghanistan-Pakistan portfolio.

Feinberg and his aide Lou Bremer, a managing director at Cerberus and former Navy SEAL, have been to the White House recently. Bremer’s Instagram account shows him posing for photos with a litany of Trumpworld figures over the last few months, from Sean Hannity to Rudy Giuliani. One of those photos shows Bremer’s ticket for the presidential reviewing stand at the inaugural parade. Both declined requests for comment.

The pair also have influence at the CIA, whose leadership is said to favor using some elements of Prince and Feinberg’s plans, according to sources. Another source familiar with the discussions said that Pompeo and other CIA leaders are “open to another approach in Afghanistan and realize a change has to be made, because the same thing is not working. They also know it comes with the risks of this town, the type of hyper-politicized town this is,  Donald Trump could even cure cancer and people would find ways to criticize him.”

While some members of Congress have dismissed the idea out of hand—Lindsey Graham told The Washington Post “It’s something that would come from a bad Soldier of Fortune novel”—Prince is finding a degree of support for his plan on the Hill.

Representative Dana Rohrabacher has known Prince for years, since Prince was his intern, and his top aide Paul Behrends is also close with Prince, having worked as a lobbyist and spokesman for Blackwater. Rohrabacher wrote an op-ed last week in The Washington Examiner lauding the proposal.

In an interview, Rohrabacher said that he and Prince had been talking about these ideas for “over a year.”

“Some of us [in Congress] are aggressively pushing” for the plan, Rohrabacher said, adding that Representative Duncan Hunter is also a big fan. But Rohrabacher said the plan was being resisted by “military professionals.”

One of the issues raised by Prince’s plan is that U.S. law prohibits using contractors for combat operations. The workaround is that instead of being categorized under Title 10 of the U.S. code, it will be housed under Title 50, making it subject to the same regulations as intelligence operations. This has sparked concerns about transparency, but appeals to some in the secretive intelligence community.

“I would think the CIA and some other intelligence agencies may have people in the upper echelons who have a better understanding of operations like what Erik is proposing,” Rohrabacher said.  

“The biggest drawback is, our military people, our military professionals just hate the idea of not using regular combat units in which there is a really command and control aspect of the mission,” Rohrabacher said.  

Critics say Prince’s plan will lead to a moral and legal quagmire, as contractors from around the world fighting in place of U.S. forces present a host of possible problems. What happens if a Canadian, for example, kills an Afghan civilian while fighting as a contractor under the leadership of the American “viceroy”? What if the contractors get in a real bind—does the U.S. send our military in to help them?

“Quality is a problem, accountability is a problem,” said McFate, who wrote a book about modern mercenary warfare. McFate raised the possibility of the Prince fighting force changing allegiances; “It could go into business for itself. It could be bought out by ISIS, China, Russia.”

Over the past 10 years, the industry has become increasingly regulated and professionalized, said Deborah Avant, a Denver University professor who studies mercenaries.

“I would say that most of the industry from 2007 on became sort of increasingly professionalized, normalized according to particular regulatory structures,” she said. “Erik Prince decided to completely go against that.”

Prince sold Blackwater in 2010—Feinberg reportedly considered investing in it—and now heads the Chinese-owned Frontier Services Group, which he says primarily does logistics. He moved to Abu Dhabi in 2010, where he raised an army of Colombian mercenaries for the U.A.E. in 2011, but told me he’s now based full-time in Virginia. His sister Betsy DeVos is Trump’s education secretary, and Prince was an enthusiastic backer of the president during his campaign. He even met with a Russian national close to the Kremlin in the Seychelles during the transition. _The Washington Post_[reported](http://ift.tt/2n594s1) the meeting was an effort to set  up a backchannel between Trump and the Russians. Prince told me he didn’t even know the Russian’s name, and only met with him briefly.

One criticism of the Feinberg and Prince plans is that they are being proposed by people who potentially stand to make a profit off of them.

“I think it will make Erik Prince billions of dollars while he loses the war for us,” a congressional aide who has seen the plan said.

Prince’s argument essentially boils down to: So what?

“If someone is doing that, saving the customer money, is making a profit so bad?” he said. “And let me flip that on its head even more. Before anyone throws that accusation, I think they should interview all the former generals, all the former Pentagon generals, and all the boards they serve on, and all their recommendations … advocating for the Pentagon $50 billion approach to continue on like we’ve been doing for the last 16 years. Which one is it going to be? I’m happy to have that debate.”

Top administration officials, including the president, have said a decision on Afghanistan is coming very soon. Bannon’s faction has sought to slow down the process and give space to ideas like Prince’s. But the extent to which Prince and Feinberg’s proposals are given real consideration could be affected by Bannon’s precarious position in the White House. Trump is under pressure to fire him. News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch are reportedly pushing for him to be removed. After Charlottesville, the pressure to remove Bannon has increased, though Trump has not done so, even after a surprising on-the-record interview Bannon gave to the progressive American Prospect in which he attacked his enemies in the administration by name and undermined Trump’s stance on North Korea.

McMaster, the target of relentless attacks from Bannon allies in the media over the past two weeks, sent a shot across  Bannon’s bow on Meet the Press last Sunday, refusing to answer whether he could work with him.

Bannon has been described in news stories as having “ties to” Prince, though Prince said he only met Bannon over the past couple years when he started doing Bannon’s Breitbart radio show to promote his book. Prince has in recent weeks repeatedly promoted his Afghanistan plans in interviews on Breitbart, telling the website just this week that Trump is considering his proposal. Prince also recently gave an interview to the to alt-right reporter Cassandra Fairbanks of Big League Politics, a spinoff site founded by former Breitbart reporters.

Prince said he intends to keep pushing what he calls “the moderate option” in the public discussion. “There’s pullout completely, there’s double down, triple down, after 16 years,” he said. “Even though you might not like the use of contractors, what is there as a better alternative?”

6uk8pe,0,2017-08-18,Questions about switching from upfront cost Roth to flat fee Roth account.,Juliet_Whiskey,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6uk8pe/questions_about_switching_from_upfront_cost_roth/,"Hello, 

I am a 21 year old college student, and I have some questions about a Roth account a set up two years ago to save some money I made from internships during college. I have no debt and my parents are paying my college expenses.

I have about $9k saved in American funds. Currently I am using Edward Jones on the advice of my dad. Initially when I set up the account I paid an up front fee, however now with regulatory changes I need to change to a fee-based account with an annual fee of 1.3% on the first $250,000 that I would pay every month. I have $1.5k I would like to place in my Roth from my internship this year, but I'm unable to make any contributions to my current Roth since it's not a fee based account. 

I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice on what my next step should be. I could transfer my current Roth to a new fee based account within Edward Jones. I also know of another firm that would charge 1%. Or I could just go at it alone and not pay anything. However, I'm wary of doing that considering how green I am at this stuff. 

Sorry if I didn't explain things well, I'm happy to clarify anything, but any advice or help would be appreciated!

&gt; Over time, according to the theory behind Angela Merkel&amp;#039;s decision to open Germany&amp;#039;s shores to these migrants, they would be integrated into German society, boosting the country&amp;#039;s shrinking labor force, contributing taxes to help alleviate the country&amp;#039;s looming revenue problem, and increasing the nation&amp;#039;s savings rate.

&gt; The primary motivation for Merkel&amp;#039;s decision might have been humanitarian - many of the new arrivals were refugees from conflict in Iraq and Syria - but it was often claimed the move would ultimately revitalize the German economy, too.

&gt; Two years have now passed since the main flood of migrants in the summer of 2015 - not enough time to confidently analyze the long-term effect of migrants on the German economy, but enough time to make some preliminary inferences.

&gt; While German authorities continue to predict that half of asylum seekers will find work in five years, it turns out that, when unpaid internships and minor employment are put aside, only 21 percent of asylum seekers arriving in 2013 had found employment at the beginning of 2016.

&gt; The German commissioner for immigration, refugees, and integration recently told the Financial Times that up to three quarters would still be unemployed in five years and that &amp;quot;For many others we will need up to 10.&amp;quot; An OECD report found that less than 40 percent of asylum seekers had completed an &amp;quot;Upper secondary school&amp;quot; education or higher - the equivalent of four years of high school in the United States - and that 31 percent had fewer than four years of primary schooling.

6ulfn5,0,2017-08-18,Nervous Breakdowns Led To Our Breakup... I Want Him Back (Eventually). Help?,s_lena,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6ulfn5/nervous_breakdowns_led_to_our_breakup_i_want_him/,"Three weeks after our breakup, after a couple sexual encounters, awkwardly moving out of his place, and some horrendous fights, we've started a no contact period.

I was in a really, really bad place. Our relationship was amazing, he was so kind and attentive. Treated me like his queen. I slowly however began to suffer from nervous breakdowns and would lash out at him, often shoving him and yelling.

We finally broke up, mutually. He was so cold the day it happened. But since, I've seen lapses where he showed emotion. Why just last week he said he would help me get better, healthier. That I am strong underneath all of this and that what I'm undergoing is temporary. That we needed to see through the breakup for ourselves.

Until I pushed him on the street and yelled at him because I didn't want him to help me move out.

Yeah, I'm a mess.


I went to his place the other day (he's living in his fraternity until he starts dental school) and I saw him with another girl. After days of ignoring me, he took me across the street to a parking lot where I cried my heart out. That was when we decided it's finally time to cut contact. The thing is..... he was So. Fucking. Cold. He was a robot. He was almost mean. He grew angry at my emotions. He said ""there are no more emotions, there are no more feelings."" He said he didn't want me. That he didn't love me romantically anymore. Stoicism to the extreme, a full 180 from a week ago. He even told my best friend that he didn't think he wanted to be even my friend again.

I don't want him back any time soon. I need to focus on myself. I've gone to a new therapist and have been going through talk therapy and discussing medications. I've started to go to the gym again and am eating healthier and sleeping better. I've been excelling at my real estate internship. But he was my closest and my best friend.

I want to lay a foundation while we are apart that will allow me to reenter his life positively. He'll be very busy with dental school, and I'll be finishing my undergrad (same university). I want to put myself in the best position to have something in the future -- so I'm not contacting him.

He said he would reach out to get coffee ""maybe after orientation.""

So.... here I am. A bizarre limbo.


Does he mean it when he says there's no emotion? Can he really turn everything off so quickly? I will be mentally healthy again, I will. I have been before and I need to take the steps to be again, right now that is my priority. Am I a lost cause?"

10 Things I Hate About You"
6um64x,2,2017-08-18,"44F4A - Open-minded MILF calling for all young, strapping guys and girls...",MarriedMILFMischief,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6um64x/44f4a_openminded_milf_calling_for_all_young/,"Hello, all.

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
6umo8s,3,2017-08-18,I don't want to live the life I'm headed for,imlivingalienow,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6umo8s/i_dont_want_to_live_the_life_im_headed_for/,"I'm in college, majoring in chemical engineering. This is my third year, having covered my basics at a community college. Now I'm taking actual chemical engineering courses, but only a few at a time because of financial reasons. This means I have at least 3 more years to get my bachelors. If I want to be successful, I need to start networking, studying extremely hard, and look for internships. But the truth that I've been repressing is that I don't want any of it. I feel like I have social anxiety, and interviewing for a job or networking absolutely terrifies me. I try to just ignore it but when it pops into my head I get super panicked just thinking about it. 

The truth is, I want to direct films. I love movies with all of my being. I love going to the movies, especially alone because most of my friends like to talk during the movie and don't take it seriously like I do. I grew up poorish and without internet so I didn't have a lot of access to movies. But once I figured out how to pirate movies (bad, I know) at a friend’s and then watch them at home I realized how much I really love them. Then I got a public library card and started checking out 5+ movies at a time. I was watching about a movie a day for an entire semester, all while maintaining straight A's in basic engineering classes. Then I decided to go a little deeper and started checking out books on movies. I started reading books on film cover to cover. And I actually took notes on them in a spiral. All for no reason than for myself. Deep down I think I wanted to keep my pretend fantasy of being a director a possibility. 

For my whole life, my mom has had me on the path to be an engineer. Specifically, chemical. She said I'll make a lot of money, and will do great things. She allowed me to do some arts but never really encouraged them. I taught myself guitar and would write songs starting in fifth grade. I tried showing some songs to her but she would just ignore me. I joined band in school and became pretty good at the trumpet, earning first chair in my state in 8th grade. I did marching band in high school, and became a section leader. I loved the show aspect of marching band and performing. 

But back to being a chemical engineer. In the best-case scenario, I get hired by a company and make $70,000+ a year. But I don't really care. I don't really have anything I need that type of money for. I don't want a family, at least for the near future. I don't want a fancy house, I'd rather have a modest apartment. I don't want to eat expensive food, I'd rather just have healthy and cheap food. The only thing I can see myself doing with that money is saving up for retirement, helping out anyone who needs it, and buying stuff to make a movie with. Maybe also buying recording equipment to record some music. 

But at that point, I'd have spent 5+ years towards something I don't really care for. My heart and being desires films, even if my life is some shitty apartment and ramen noodles daily. I know for a fact if I grow up and just do chemical engineering, I will regret not perusing directing. But I don't think I have the guts to do it. I don't know if I have the personality or the support to say screw it and go on to pursue my dreams. I'm afraid I've gone too far in a different direction. I never joined theater in high school, and I'm already third year in engineering. I'm afraid it's too late for me. All I know is I wish more than anything that I could restart my life knowing that I want to make films. I believe I'd be able to get over any fears of talking and connecting with others if it put me closer to achieving my true dreams.

Sorry for the long post, but damn that feels good to at least type it all out. Thanks for reading. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

TL/DR: I'm a chemical engineering student, but all I want to do is make movies

Should I do business minor? Also are there any internships that could give me some experience in the field but require little experience
6un1aw,341,2017-08-19,I was a red pill woman and it wasn't what you think,exrpwthroway,TheBluePill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/6un1aw/i_was_a_red_pill_woman_and_it_wasnt_what_you_think/,"I got into red pill read about 4 years ago, and found the subreddit about 3 years ago.

Many of the red pill women who posted here don't seem affiliated with the actual internet phenomenon, but more were involved in specific abusive relationships or with fundamentalist partners. However, it is my opinion that many RPW women are like me, and that their relationships as depicted online are a bit of a act. I was never a conservative or a sexist. What appealed to me was it gave me a clear guide to reclaim a sense of worth when I had so little.

I graduated with a public relations degree in 2011 and worked as a waitress during college. I had no real connections or serious internships while in school. I followed my boyfriend to another city which was close enough to see family and friends, but not keep my old job. I wound up getting fired from a restaurant job in a relatively well connected small city, and was unable to find shifts at any of the better places. I took a temp job that paid almost nothing at a small company where my boss treated me a like a personal assistant and never taught me any useful skills. I eventually got so depressed it made me sick and I stopped going to work. Overall, this was negligible to our financial situation. My boyfriend was happy to support me, the car payments and extra expenses didn't exactly make my $400 a week a big deal for us.

I graduated from a top school with good grades, but fell behind on my student debt and had no real desire or reason to go to grad school. I was told my whole life how smart I was and how I would certainly become successful. Reality was humiliating for me. Unemployed, I began to spend more and more time online, reading obscure and absurd. Often to occupy my mind, often to make myself feel smart or significant again. That's the period of time I found the red pill.

All I needed to do to be a high quality woman in the eyes of this community was to be thin, cook, and be nice to my boyfriend. I was told that all those friends who were single but had things I envied were the real failures, while I was great success as long as the scale stayed down and my boyfriend was happy. I patted myself on the back when considering the women in my life who dressed sloppily, couldn't cook, were disagreeable, had lots of student debt, took pride in their basic jobs, etc. Some of this was grounded in normal human flaws I observed around me, some of this was based on some straw man modern woman I had created in my mind to prop myself up. With regards to my friends who were also in loving relationships, I would find instances of disrespect and other dysfunctional behavior, and would comfort myself with the thought that their relationship was inferior to mine. In five years, my boyfriend and I would still be together, because I never snapped at him or told him not to play 8 hours of video games.

Keep in mind, during none of this time did my boyfriend give a shit about my submission or my housekeeping. He saw me busying myself around the apartment, picking up new projects, and paying more attention to my fitness and grooming. He cheered me on because it looked like I was coming out of my depression. And the reality is, yes, making him the center of my focus did increase my feelings of affections for him. Our relationship felt oftentimes like the crushes I had in high school. I would make decisions based on how he would see me, like wearing that nightgown slip with the itchy lace trim in the dead of winter instead of flannel pajamas and soaking in every look he gave me, while priding myself on the amount of cold I was suffering for that extra taste of affection. Other girls wouldn't do that sort of thing, after all, I must be a hot commodity.

What was interesting to me when I first found the community was how so many of the young women were exactly like me, especially when speaking privately. Young women whose lives had not turned out the way they had imagined: not necessarily ""failures"" but competitive women with active minds who had few outlets. Some were highly educated and married to high income men on the coasts, but did not have the types of careers that women in their social groups had to justify working, especially with kids in the mix. A number of women had live-in boyfriends and were not working. They were a break-up away from living with their parents, at best, some even had kids. This community did get very competitive, often regarding every conceivable status-marker apart from type of employment.

I never had an epiphany where I discovered feminism or anything like that, since I was never isolated and this belief system was entirely in my head. What happened was gradual. I got a life. I took a volunteer job at a local charter school, which turned into a paid full time position. I tutored after school and helped run a creative writing club for students. I got out of the small world I had created for myself and realized I neither had have a big fancy job nor be anybody's dream girl to feel self worth. I also found that many of the complaints which I had prided myself on not having, like those involving partner that doesn't do equal house work, were grounded in reality. I saw the ""bitchy"" ""fat"" girls get married to good men who were crazy about them. I saw the career driven bullish women quit to take care of their growing families. I stopped having that subtle compulsion to compare myself to other people, especially other women.

As this change occurred in me, I found more and more of the behavior and writing in the red pill women community petty and grating. I saw myself in these women, and tried to give them advice that wasn't necessarily feminist, but would give them a sense of self-containment and pride. This was received poorly.


tl;dr I got into Red Pill Women because I was insecure and it made me feel good about myself and my relationship. When I found other ways to feel good about myself, I didn't need it anymore."

I was in a strange mood. A female friend of mine had invited me out to party, but her friends were less than enjoyable.

I pulled away from the group and was going to go home, as I'd rather be alone than with shitty company, but a good friend of mine showed up and reminded me what good company is.

We left the bar and headed into town. We danced like fools at a dope club.

While dancing, a sexy brunette approached me and told me how much she loves my long hair. Not a few seconds later, her jealous friend came over and pulled her away. She stared at me as she left.

We hopped to a few other bars but I got bored, so we started walking home.

As we pass the last of the bars on the street, I see a cute brunette looking at me from her table. We lock eyes, I smile, and I keep walking.

She says something to me in Romanian. I stop and turn back to her. 

""Sorry, what? I don't speak Romanian.""

She smiles and says to me, ""I love your hair"" and reaches out. I step to her and let her feel my hair. I meet her and her cute blonde friend who ends up being her cousin. My buddy comes over and meets them.

After a few minutes of talking he moves to the table next to us and stays on his phone to avoid any awkward moments with the cousin who isn't into him. Amazing wingman. 

She's sitting on the chair while I'm crouched next to her, but my knees star to hurt. I tell her to stand up. She does, I take her seat, and then pull her onto my lap.

""Good girl. Sit in papi's lap.""

She smiles and asks me if I'm her papi. I tell her yes. I bring up sex and she tells me she's a virgin. I tell her that I'm going to be the one to take her virginity. She begs to differ.

She's 19 and been going out since she was 16. Given the empirical evidence (I have more evidence than her), these girls seem to be a bit more conservative than their Western counterparts, on average. 

I ask her why she's never had sex and she tells me she's never found anyone who was worth giving it to.

I tell her again that I'm going to be her first. She teases me again.I grab her face and kiss her. Her cousin is smiling. 

I push VERY hard to bring her home, but to no avail. Perhaps twenty or thirty minutes pass and I decide it's not going anywhere. She doesn't want to get pulled in front of her cousin.

I grab her number and text her.

Me - ah

Me - what are your plans today?

Her - I'm just gonna sleep

Her - last night I slept only for 2 hours

Me - we should cuddle (kissy face)

Her - You wish ;)

I don't respond for 4 hours. 

Her - That was it? You gave up? :)

Me - no, I was waiting for that second text

Me - I told you, I've been doing this a lot longer than you my love

Her - Doing what?

Me - The art of romance

Her - :):) you should teach me some lesson then

Me - tomorrow night. me, you, a bottle of wine and many lessons for my little girl

Her - I don't know...depends on what kind of lessons you're thinking about

Me - we only learn what you want to learn. as i told you last night, you know my desires, but spending time with you always is enough to make papi happy

Her - Promise you won't cross the line?

Me - I promise I will never do anything don't want to do

Her - ok then :)

Me - Le'ts do 5pm. we can cook dinner together too :)

Her - Sounds great!

Me - perfect. now give papi a kiss (kissies)

her - (laughing emoji and kissy emoji)

____________________________________

We figure out logistics the next day and she asks if she should bring something

Me - just look as beautiful as you can

me - papi takes care of everything tonight

Her - Ok then. I'll come over in pajamas and with no makeup. Is that beautiful enough? (Kissy face)

Me - lololol

Me - (I send some pic of a chick in lingerie)

Me - If thats what you mean by pajamas, sure ;)

Her - (laughing emojis)

Her - Close enough

Her - (sends a pic of some bitch in unicorn pajamas)

__________________________________________

Silly bitch.

She comes over a few hours later. 

It takes me about 10 minutes to take her virginity. She even hands me the frame. She tells me how her cousin and her friends told her not to come over, and then when she was adamant, they told her not to do anything with me. I asked her if she's going to spend her whole life listening to what other people say she should do.

She gets quiet.

GG.

I take her clothes off and she asks me to be gentle, since she's new.

I am gentle....at first. I also confirm the virginity. Lots of blood. 

Our second round, I put this bitch's knees on her chest and piledrive her. It hurts her, but she enjoys it. She stares at my cock as it drives into her and I ask if she likes watching papi stretch her virgin pussy open. She tells me yes. 

I fuck her like four times. 

The next time I text her, I ask her to come over and she gives me shit about only wanting sex from her. I tell her that I like spending time with her. She continues to give me shit so I ignore her.

The next morning she texts me, ""Hi papi! :)""

Totally new attitude. We have a brief conversation, then I wait a day and text her ""hey baby.""

She comes over that night and we fuck again. This time, while hanging out, I tell her that her cousin is hot and that we should have a threesome. She gets mad.  

A few days later, she sends me a picture of her and her cousin licking ice cream. It's beyond suggestive. I give her some devil emojis and then ignore her next texts, because I felt like being an asshole for some reason. 

The next day, she sends me this

__________________________________________

Her - You really see just the slut in me, don't you?

Her - Well, I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING SLUT!

Her - So let's end whatever this is

__________________________________________

I try to calm her down but she keeps acting up.

Pimp hand ready.

__________________________________________

Me - Look, if you want to believe what you're thinking is true, then go ahead. It obviously doesn't matter what I say. I told you that I like you and enjoy spending time with you. I Also told you I can't promise anything more than that. I've been 100% honest from the start so I have nothing to justify and I don't have to defend myself. So if you don't want to see me anymore, then thats fine but don't accuse me or insinuate that I'm a bad person by giving me this attitude. I did nothing wrong.

___________________________________________

She apologizes and tells me that she thought she could handle a casual, sexual relationship but has feelings for me. I understand. I was her first.  

We end things on a high note.

A few months later, I randomly hit her up and she comes over that night. We fuck (and on one more occasion after that, before she leaves the country for an internship). 

She tells me how she still hasn't slept with anyone else. Maybe it's a lie. Maybe it's not.

Doesn't matter. 

I ask her why she hasn't fucked anyone else and she says all the other guys are boring. I ask her why she's with me then if she knows I won't date her (she's nice, cute, and fun to fuck, but I have other things in mind.)

She tells me it's still better than the other guys. "

Or so you said. We clicked, we did a lot of amazing things, plus we had similar goals. We wanted to eventually settle down. No games, nothing, we decided. It was good.

We never even told each other that we loved each other for quite a while, because i was bent that we should always mean the grand words we say, and when you said it, I was elated.

Whenever I saw you check me out or just watch me laugh, I knew you loved me.

And then you went home, and your mom happened.

Things weren't as sweet anymore. We fought. I cried a lot. I slipped into depression. I tried to kill myself so many times. We talked about it. You said you were sure this was gonna end badly. Then you told me you'd figure something out. And then after so many days, you told me you'd fight for me incase your parents get involved again.

And then my exams happened, and I was stressed a lot. I cried everyday. You didn't help. You were the most unstable thing in my life and I hate unstable things. You gave mixed signals. You started reading my messages and never replying. Or you gave one word replies. 

You stopped telling me you love me.

Then you got this internship away from me. It was a new city, vibrant and full of all the party life. I can understand the appeal to a young man in the prime of his life. Its not me, I'd much rather prefer the quiet solitude of home with my family, but that's just me. You told me you really want a permanent place in that firm despite having another offer near me. And everyday in that city far away from me, you found your own life, and I cannot begrudge you for that. Its your life.

Day after day, you talk less, you care less. It feels like you love less. I wish i could tell you all this but you are going to just tell me that I am too emotional, I attach too much meaning to things and I care too much and am selfless.


I agree I am all that. You don't deserve it though.

I cry all the time. Its my fault and Im not entitled to anything from you. Im sorry that I expected. I will learn not to."
6uowua,2,2017-08-19,Laptop Recommendation,shrubberi,laptops,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/6uowua/laptop_recommendation/,"* **Short Version:** I'm a computer science major in need of a relatively good laptop. My budget is $1500. Should look relatively professional. Should be relatively thin and light. Either Windows or Mac. Screen size between 13 and 14 inches. I want to play some games on it. Stuff like CS:GO, LOL, and Overwatch. I'd love to be able to run GTAV, but I realize that's not very possible.

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Must be under $1500 (Total price $1500, so no $1300 laptop with $400 power core or something). I live in Europe, but I'm taking a trip to NY next month so availability isn't a problem.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I like 2 in 1's, but they're not a necessity (realistically, I'm not sure how much I'd really use it). Good battery life is sort of important. As long as it's over 7 hours I'm fine. Either way I can always charge it in class. In total, best specifications for the money is what I'm really looking for.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Relatively important. I have an internship, so I can't show up to a meeting with some high-tech, weird looking Alienware. Also, I need something pretty light, since I'll be carrying it around all day. Thinness is also a pretty important factor. Basically something that looks relatively sleek and professional.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 I don't require any OS, but I definitely prefer Windows and Mac.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Not really. I currently have a 13.3 Mac Air and It's all I need. Anything bigger is fine, but nothing smaller.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
I'll be doing video editing, so the computer should be able to run a program like Sony Vegas. I'll also want to play some games on it. It should be able to run stuff like CS:GO, Overwatch, etc... Running GTAV would be my dream, but that's not a very realistic expectation. I don't need crazy FPS. As long as there's no noticeable lag I'm fine. Probably anything over 30 fps. (I have a PS4 which runs at 30 fps, and I don't have any problems).

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Keyboard should be decent. I'm looking for something that feels like the Mac Air, but I'm open to anything. Should be sturdy - I'll be carrying it around all day so It's bound to get a little hit at some point. I really like touch screen, but, as I said before, I'm not sure I'd use it too much so It's not a necessity. I don't need a CD drive. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
As for the touchpad, I'm looking for something similar to the Mac Air. One of those 'tap anywhere to click' sort of things. An HDMI port would help for connecting to projectors, but there's always dongles if not. At the time of writing this post, I'm torn between the Dell XPS 13, and the Razer Blade Stealth. I know that the Razer Blade is a lot better, but the only thing holding me back is that the XPS is definitely a lot sleeker with it's infinite edge (I think that's how it's called) display, and 2 in 1 compatibility."

I've had this plot kicking around for awhile and finally feel comfortable enough to share it with all of you. If you're interested, please PM me with your character idea, kinks, and limits. Any reply not containing all three will be ignored. Please be willing to write at least a paragraph per reply. Ages will be determined in PMs.

Tommy Daniels is one of the hottest young commodities in Hollywood. Despite being under 16, the actor has earned praise from A-list celebrity co-stars as being a talented professional, fun, and incredibly entertaining, Producers are lining up to cast him in movies, and Directors sing his praises. He had, by age 10, already starred in big-budget films as a main character, and doesn't seem to be stopping soon.

What no one except those around him knows is that the blond-haired and blue-eyed Tommy is a desperate, eager little bottom even in spite of his age. He goes out of his way to find at least one person to fuck him on each film he does - be they co-star or producer or director - and wins them over by indulging their darker sides: their kinks, their secret shames. He'll do anything to get the cock he's picked - and for his newest film, he's picked yours.

******

So are you a fellow young actor Tommy has set his sights on, or an older celebrity he's starring with? Perhaps you're the director or producer, or even the college intern who got stuck as Tommy's assistant. Anyone at all is welcome to be the object of the young star's attentions, and so long as you're willing to fuck him, he'll do anything you want to get your cock.

My only limits are Scat and Snuff, anything else is absolutely on the table, and kinks can be hammered out over PM. I hope to hear from you soon, APP!

I made post here after I failed my AS exams after my father was ill. I got all D's but was predicted all A's as I aced my mock exams but I broke down in the real thing.

I was considering starting from year 12 however, can I start from year 13, resit my math modules and do the A2 content for my other subjects and maths?

Subjects I wanna carry on


Math
Physics
Chemistry

I would take these three to A2, and resit my math modules from AS, as those ones count, and the science AS exams don't count for A2 grade. I will then take a gap year and do an internship, then apply for university the following year, hopefully with amazing A2 grades.

Can this be done? This is speculation right now but if this can be done I really want to do this, instead of going to yr12, learning AS content I already know pretty well, I just broke down during my exams.

But note that my experience with databases is limited and I'm a developer intern. I was chatting with a database administrator and she was asking me how ember communicates with a database. I explained to her that the way it works is you use something in Ember called an adapter that helps standardize data getting sent into ember. So I showed her my firebase adapter as an example. But she's an oracle developer. So the first thing she asks is if there is an adapter for oracle? My initial response was, of course, because I thought everyone uses Oracle. 

Nope. So I looked through the ember adapters list in Ember observer.

https://emberobserver.com/categories/ember-data-adapters

And I can't find adapters for MySQL or Postgres either. These are all RDBMS if I recall correctly. Is there something I'm missing here? Why would Ember have adapters for these hugely used databases?

Caleb Flahey had always been a bookish man; this was told by thick spectacles and a ponderous slouch, by the crow’s feet at his eyes, or by the coffee stains from the spills of a late night read.  Yet, today, he had slunk further into his maze of words, his back pressed deep into the spine of a leather chair.  A coffee mug sat by his right arm.  It was cold and stale.

It was raining outside -- droplets of water fell against a large window pane with a pitter - patter that spoke of tiny footsteps and soldier toys -- but Flahey’s eyes held only love for the computer set before him.  *Fetters, unchain the fetters,* he thought.  His elbow nudged the coffee, but there was a large enough distance between the him and the ceramic that it did not spill.  *Fetter, fetter, all the better.*  The machine beside him hummed lightly, and a fan whirred overhead.  *“No,”* one said.  *“Yes,”* said the other, and, for the life of him, Caleb Flahey could not decide which statement was more true.

“Stop that,” said Jayla Pinesfield.  “You know I hate it when you smoke.  I can smell tobacco through the doors.”

“Yes?” Flahey asked politely enough, but feared that Jayla might’ve seen his lack of care.  He looked at her through the side of a fishbowl, not quite hearing and without fully seeing.  Something about smoking, was it?  He wondered how the cigarette had ended up lit and in his hand.  He had promised to quit; it had been his only resolution for the new year.

“You’re smoking.  Stop.  Please.  I have asthma,” she said, in a way that one might wave a get out of jail free card.  But he snuffed his smoke against a damp wall and walked away.  

It was still raining as he crossed the street from Mulberry to 47th.  “Move your slow, white - collar ass,” the crossing guard told him.  The neon sign opposite the sidewalk blinked, “twenty, nineteen, eighteen.”  He reached it with ten seconds to spare.  And why *was* he here?  To buy another pack?  He doubted it, even as he walked past three teens, each with a cigarette or paper bag in one hand.  *Screw the rain, damn it all,* he thought angrily.  Trees swayed above him, long and green and willowed, great leaves dripping water like sweat.  Elsewhere their branches were bare, missing cloaks of brilliant shades or dappled brown come fall.  It was winter, though, and a great gust had picked up along the side of the road.  With it came a sheet of water and garbage and the hems of Flahey’s coat too.


The market straddled the top of a muddy hill, who bore one road that round thrice about its sides before coming to rest at the very top.  It was not always this hard going, but mud sloughed off where the tree roots were weak, splattered the walkways with a coat of slick dirt.  Here and there, small divots in the concrete had turned to large puddles.  By the end, Caleb’s socks had become damp with wet.  “Don’t forget it, don’t forget it,” said the wind.  “Buy it, buy it.”  But he gave in halfway through and headed back.  He wondered why he hadn’t taken his car.  And why not?  It was at the forefront of his mind as he would his way down, through a dark tunnel where homeless slept, and past the three teens whose bottles were regrettably empty.  The crossguard was absent when he came to cross 47th to Mulberry, and he gave his thanks for that.

“We’ve faced worse conditions than this,” Flahey said.  A burly man stared back, padded in white - purple clothes, a lettered sigil displayed upon his left breast.  The helmet and its bars blocked the response of “yes coach” from the first and those behind him.  “A little rain, a little wind?  The ball will fly straight and true.”  But Flahey found himself quite wrong, for it was not just a little rain.  There was quite a lot of it as they burst through the doors and found empty seats to cheer them on.  

“Caleb Flahey?” An intern asked.  “It’s an honor to meet you, sir.  Is there anything I can get you?  A cup of coffee, a dry lab coat?”

He stood by his computer once more, staring at his cup of mostly filled coffee.  A puddle of water had collected by his feet; his leather shoes would be ruined by now, but he found himself surprised that he didn’t care at all.  The computer blinked, the machine hummed, the fan whirred.  *“Click yes,”* one voice hissed.  *“It’s so simple.  Just click the button.”*  Flahey’s finger hovered over the mouse.  *“Click no,”* said the other.  *“There’s no coming back from what you’re about to do.”*  Finally, he said, “Some dry clothes would suit me best.  And warm the coffee for me, would you?”

The intern left, but Flahey stayed with the hums and whirs and the voices he heard.  *Fetters, fetters, like the debtors.*  His fingers swayed once, twice, thrice, but in the end he clicked yes.

They walked together from the room, and through sliding doors and empty halls, down past locker - doors where the faint scents of axe - masked sweat came through.  Near the final step, Caleb Flahey closed his eyes, for each and every turn had been graven on the backs of his lids.  He prayed when he opened them that the seats would not be empty.

On average, how many hours are needed per day or per week for a pre-study internship for university requirements?
And during what time of the day do pre-study internships start?
I am asking because I applied for a preparatory student visa mainly to learn the German language, and since my language school is from 8:00 to 11:30 on weekends, I figured that I can use the rest of the day to work on the internship if I manage to find one. 

Is it possible to work on a pre-study internship/Vorpraktikum during these times of days and under this particular visa?

6uq808,13,2017-08-19,Do I need a college degree? Or just keep pushing?,jgw1985,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6uq808/do_i_need_a_college_degree_or_just_keep_pushing/,"Hey all - might post this to /r/cscareerquestions as well, just wanted people's opinions here.

Cliff Notes:

* Have 2 years independent exp.
* Can't get job without experience. Can't get experience without job.
* Completed Nanodegree courses by Udacity.
* App on Play Store.
* Should I enroll in local community college (more knowledge and internship opportunities) or just keep pushing?

Long Version:

So about 2 1/2 years ago I discovered programming. Started with basic web dev and transitioned into Android. I've been doing it on a personal/independent level for about 2 years now. About 4 months ago I started applying for jobs for Android Developer (never see Jr postings and I always inform them of my position), and internships that I see posted. I've gotten a few interviews, some have gone 3-4 interviews long. I mesh well with the dev's and people I speak with and generally their ""concerns"" are that I do not have professional experience. I have had two companies tell me specifically ""you would be a good fit for our culture and needs but we need to ramp up production and we need someone with professional/team exp"". Is this just a BS excuse or does it seem normal?

I am 31 looking for a career change, is it worth it to go to a local community college for CS for that extra boost and possibly an internship, since most that I see posted require you to be a college student. I have completed the Nanodegree's by Udacity, read a few books (Big Nerd Ranch 2nd edition, Head First Java, Head First Android. Just got Clean Code). I have a GitHub with 20+ small applications. An app on the play store. And continuing to learn daily. What can I do to get my career started? 

I currently live in Colorado. What should I be looking for compensation wise given my situation (going rate of Jr Dev out here is around $75,000/year according to glassdoor)? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks - sorry for the long post.


**Edit**
Thanks all for the advice and time you took to explain it. I got some work ahead of me but I'm confident I'll land that hard to get first job in the near future."
6uq8sk,27,2017-08-19,"I [40 F] found out husband [46 M] is cheating (again). Long post, but advice needed.",bendywich,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6uq8sk/i_40_f_found_out_husband_46_m_is_cheating_again/,"Okay, so here it goes. This is really long, but background info might help.


My husband and I married in 2010. In 2013 I returned to school to finish my degree. Apparently turning some of my attention away was too overwhelming for him, so he turned to Craigslist and started banging people he met online. I found this out in April 2014 when I got a facebook message from the friend of someone he was chatting up and meeting from that site. We had a huge blowout, he apologized, did everything to make me think he was really remorseful about what he did, we started marriage counseling, and I decided to make it work.


In 2015 we bought a house. The downpayment of $14000 was paid for by my money because he has a spending problem and even though I was a preschool teacher at the time, I was able to save and my mom helped me by adding to the pot. I have since then paid for the new central heating and air unit and tankless water heater installation from my personal accounts, painted and updated rooms, bought the appliances, all from my money. We had a big hailstorm blow through in 2015 that totaled out both our cars. I paid a $4k down payment on my car using the insurance I got from my truck, and a $4k down payment on his car using funds from my savings account.


I keep saying my money because his money goes to buying toys and other things online. He's constantly in overdraft, and the only way we stayed up to date on mortgage and car payments is because I paid them. I don't know how many credit cards he has, I don't know the balance on them because when I ask, he tells me ""I don't ask you about your money and account, do I?""


In March I found out that he was back on Craigslist trolling for some side action. During this time, he was also having an online relationship with an 18 year old female from his D&amp;D group (he's 46). It was a very unhealthy relationship. She is a little, which means that she likes age play and for males to be dominant over her and tell her what to do. He was sending her messages about wanting to beat her ass and asking to take pictures of his hand on her throat. He was sending her messages on his new FetLife account and getting her to take the BDSM test to find out what fetishes she had and linking her his own. It is completely false because we've discussed these things because I enjoy them, and he always said he never had any interest in them. So one of those statements was false. Don't know which.


As I was discovering these conversations, I was sending them to my email and my sister's email in case I had to delete the evidence I was saving. Worst of all, I had to wait. I had entered my internship semester for my degree and had to quit my job to focus on the intense amount of work that I had to graduate. I was relying on him to support me and was absolutely helpless if I confronted him about what he was doing and he decided to just walk away.


It all came to the surface last weekend. I had been inviting him to spend time with me Friday night by having game night at my dad's house with my family, he said he didn't feel social and would pass (no big deal to me) and promptly called his mom and invited her to go out with him for the night. I got a little miffed about it and got my bag and said I was going to dad's and left. He comes outside and asks why I sounded pissed. This resulted in a HUGE fight because he couldn't believe I was so selfish that I would want him to not spend time with his mom. We go back inside because I don't want to fight in the yard and be THOSE neighbors who air out their business for all to watch. Once inside, as he's yelling at me about how selfish I am, he uses ""fucking"" as an adjective. When he sees me react, he knows he's pushed a button so he starts actively cursing me. ""Fuck you, fuck you""
At this point, I'm just wanting to get away from it, so I start to walk back outside to get in my car and leave. He grabs my arm and yanks me back inside. My last husband was very physically abusive to me, so this puts me right back into the mindspace that I was during his abuse. As I'm slapping his hands away and freaking out, now I get to be called ""crazy"" because I'm suddenly getting to relive past traumatic events while currently in the middle of one and having a bit of a breakdown as it happens. I finally bolt out the front door and get in my car and leave for my dad's.


I have bruises from this. I made sure to get pictures of them. I did not tell dad how major of a blowup we had because my dad is very protective of me. I got home Saturday and the husband was here and we started talking about divorce because that is the last time he will ever do anything like that to me.


The husband wants the house, his car, and two of our five dogs. I'm digging my heels in because I consider this my house. He says he can show that he paid the last 6 months of payments using his money (that's true) and that he's done updates on the house too (that's a lie). I just got a job. My first paycheck was yesterday. It's a $40k a year job as a middle school science teacher. I can pay for the house and my car and bills and such with ease now, so I'm not helpless anymore. I can take care of myself. But I don't want to lose my house. Especially after the mental abuse that has happened over the years (that I have documented each time) trying to make me think that being upset over something shitty he's done is in fact my fault and that I'm the shitty person for being mad and now the physical part of the abuse. I don't feel safe. I don't feel stable. I just started a new job as a first year teacher and I am a full time graduate student. I have the payment history for our mortgage that shows not only on time, but over payment while I was making payments. When he took over during my 6 month unemployment, the history turned to 16-20 days late, checks returned due to insufficient funds, and making minimum payments.
What are my odds here in not losing everything I have worked so hard to have in this marriage? He has literally contributed jack shit and says he can take it all if we divorce because he makes $75k to what I make. What can I do, and what do I NEED to do to make sure I don't lose everything?  I'm looking for advice from online sources because he has lawyer friends all over town and I know they talk because I've been around them when they do.


TLDR: Husband likes to bang strangers from the internet, mentally and physically abusive, trying to tell me I'll lose everything if I leave him. What do? Help?"

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

6uqcx8,3,2017-08-19,[21 M] I don't know if I'm growing out of partying or if my depressions coming back,AcquiredBluetongue,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6uqcx8/21_m_i_dont_know_if_im_growing_out_of_partying_or/,"about 18 months I was severely depressed. Everything was ""wack"" to me. Parties, people, school work, everything.

It started over not being in school and then getting back into CC before trying to transfer back to my old school while still in the same town.

A key part of my depression was parties being boring to me. I like to have fun, I'm in a big group of friends with a few I feel close too, and I do pretty well with girls even though I could do better if I wasn't in my own head so much. 

Now, I'm in a better place. I have multiple internships, I'm at a different school than I had hoped but it's close so I still live in the same college town so I can be close to the Greek system and my fiends. 

I recently went home and noticed that the bars were Fucking boring. I started feeling like this again at school this year. Only time it was interesting was if I was with a girl, or saw one I wanted to take home/ or knew. Most times I just felt like ""bleh"" going out and would have to nearly black out to find any enjoyment. 

I can't tell if this is depression coming
Back or if I just grew out of it. My goals are different. I want to finish school, I have two internships, and I'm trying to work on myself and find a girlfriend if something works out.

There might be a chance I'm just bored with the entire social scene, but I'm also worried it's my depression. 

I currently can't go see my therapist because I'm broke and he's no longer inmy insurance, otherwise I'd ask him. So I'm asking Reddit.

TL;DR I was depressed. I'm not now, I don't feel like I'm depressed, but I noticed that going out and drinking isn't fun to me anymore, and that was a big symptom of the depression I already went through. Want some outside opinions, since
i'm too broke to see my therapist since my insurance no longer covers him. "
6uqir4,0,2017-08-19,I have hit a major roadblock [24F] with my bf [24M] after 5 years of dating regarding our FUTURE,aihtnyc,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6uqir4/i_have_hit_a_major_roadblock_24f_with_my_bf_24m/,"So my bf and I have been dating for about 5 years now - since the end of freshman year of college!  I love him so so much, but recently we've hit a major life road block that has put a serious strain on our relationship.

Basically, I just finished school and have started working, so after a bit of saving and settling in, I am ready to start seriously considering marriage and a family.  I have dreamed of having a family and kids of my own ever since my parents got divorced as a kid, because I have really wanted to create something special and loving that I never really had. 

So here is where the problem starts: I have brought up to my bf about how I would like to set a timeline for our future about when we might plan to get married and have kids. (obviously I know that often ""life"" gets in the way and plans can't always turn out as we hope, but I'd like to have some sort of timeline as I prepare and save for the future).  The big problem is that he is studying in an MD/PhD program, so he will have incredibly long hours and studying for a very long time. He has completed so far 2 years of med school, and so far has 3-4 years of finishing his PhD, 2 more years of med school, and then finally 4-8 years of internship and residency - before making a real salary. So being willing to compromise with this difficult schedule, I have recommended that we get married after he finishes his last 2 years of med school, and plan for kids soon after that. By that time I plan to be pretty settled in my career, so I can do a majority of the care, with our parents help.

But here's the thing - HE DOESNT WANT KIDS!! He would MAYBE adopt but he is completely MORALLY OPPOSED to having BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN because he thinks people don't know how to be good parents and it's not fair to a kid to give it a life that might be terrible and filled with suffering (i.e. if the child has autism - like his brother does).  Furthermore, he think it would be unfair because he won't be home enough for it during his residency, and it's unfair for the child to barely see one of its parents.  He also doesn't think he'd be able to handle all of the additional work that comes with being a parent while has long hours of work. I guess I'm more of a person who ""works to live"" and loves coming home to him, tv, reading, pets, family, etc and just goes to work to do a job, while he ""lives to work"" and prioritizes his science and experiments.  He also hates that I use the phrase ""CREATE a family"" when he says he already has one (his parents, brother) and will be ""GROWING"" one.

So basically, all this disagreement regarding our future has left our relationship in a super weird limbo. We love each other so so much and I love seeing him at night for dinner and staying over and cuddling. I don't know how I'd live a life without him. We are each other's first and only real relationships. 

So I guess my question is: what do we do??? Do we try to work through this? Do I break up with him because of this? I dont know how to break up with him!!! I feel like even if I did, I would still see him in the meantime because I love being with him and doing things together. So do I just stay with him until I find someone else? I absolutely HATE dating and I dont really want to be with anyone else to be honest. I would feel like I were cheating if I were to even kiss anyone else, even if he and I weren't together.

This whole thing has left me so anxious and our relationship so confusing and I don't know what to do to make this work :/ Do I just abandon the love of my life in order to find someone I don't necessarily love as much, but can give me marriage and a family?

I don't know if it's also helpful to note that we both suffer from clinical depression and anxiety, and have really been there for each other at both our worst and best times. He's the most supportive person in my life and I don't really have anyone else for support.  But of course this has obviously lead to some tension at times when one of us is going through a hard time and doesn't want to go out or do anything.

  **tl;dr**: Dated BF for a long time, both thought each other were ""the one"", but then found out we have completely different future paths."

But I just feel like every day is a constant battle to make everything perfect, and when something goes slightly wrong I fall into this bottomless pit of self-hatred and regret.

I'll give you the example from today that's spurred me to write this post. Spoiler alert - what you're about to read isn't me bragging, I still genuinely wish I hadn't been born after today. So, after waking up at 8:00 in the morning and going to the gym and increasing all of my lifts, I go home and work on career stuff. I'm a junior CS and Business double-major at a school that is top 15 in both programs, and I applied to about 10 more internships today. I then continued to study, and correctly answer, technical interview questions to practice. I then got a Snapchat from not one, but four very attractive girls asking about when my fraternity's next party is (I'm not back at school yet, so sadly I didn't know). Yet then, my friend asks me to go to the bars with him in NYC. I don't feel like getting drunk the day before my flight to school across the country, so I say I can't tonight.

All of a sudden it hits. You're letting him down, themooseexperience. He's not going to want to see you anymore, you've lost he last remaining friend you have at home. You should just go to keep the friendship. But then your parents will be upset that you left your last day home with them for the next multiple months. You'll eat like shit and drink a lot and feel like shit the next day themooseexperience. It's your fault your friend and your parents are burdened by you now. It's your fault, themooseexperience. Now, both of them are upset because of you. Etc etc. 

I'm now laying in my bed at 6:00 on a Saturday because I can't talk to anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone. I feel like everyone rolls their eyes and gets a pit in their stomach when I walk into the room. ""Oh, here comes themooseexperience, get ready to be brought down by him."" 

Another example would be when I step on the scale in the morning and am a bit heavier than I want to be. I've lost 80 pounds over the past 18 months and am considered extremely in-shape and muscular by most. Yet, if I'm 3 ponds heavier one day than I expected, my whole day will be fucking miserable because of that one little detail being not perfect.

Fuck me, man. I need help, but know the therapist would just roll his/her eyes at my story and problems too. 

**TL;DR** Have a perfect life and do my best to stay happy, but one thing goes wrong and I freak out. Had a great day all today. Gym, studied for internship technical interviews (CS, gotta love it), got texts from cute girls. Then I had to cancel plans on a friend, got the feeling he, my parents, and everyone I've talked to in the past week actually dislikes me and now I'm sitting in my room under my covers at 6:00 on a Saturday because I don't want to see anyone and want to just disappear. Fuck man."

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
6usf89,1,2017-08-19,"All the best Mazda Miata MX-5 NA pics I could find! Gold stash of Miata porn, Also, I have a question to ask..",akankit,Miata,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/6usf89/all_the_best_mazda_miata_mx5_na_pics_i_could_find/,"After 5 days of youtube binging, I have decided to buy a Miata NA. 

Here's my album of all the best Mazda Miata MX-5 NA pics I could find - http://imgur.com/a/CSOQE

I am an international Master's student in the US, studying Mechanical Engineering and learning CAE (computer aided engineering) primarily in the CAD and FEA sub-fields.

Earlier, in my initial online search for cheap cars, I had decided to buy a Porsche Boxster 986/7, as it's a Porsche and I wanted to buy something that wouldn't let me down too soon.

But now, upon seeing the Miata NA so closely, so many times, I have fallen in love with it!

It's just the sort of car that resembles a simple and little RC car I owned once that my grandfather had bought for me..

I am in my college's (Michigan Tech) Formula SAE team working on the Composites-Chassis of the car, basically focusing on the structural part of things as  the powertrain, electronics etc have specialists that I can just buy/build parts from, (also, as a master's student you gotta specialise somewhere).

Me and college's FSAE and other SAE team members went for an SAE conference once in Detroit and during that time I and the students I was sharing the room with got to talking about cars.
I care primarily about the Power to Weight ratio and not just the ""HP"", and also would only own and truly respect a car that can do 0-62mph in 3 seconds. This prompted them to talk about some cars that would be illegal in the US (but legal in the UK) to drive on the road. We talked about cars like: BAC mono, KTM X-Bow, Ariel Atom you name it.

Being a performance-economy purist, I care about the equilibrium between the two concepts and therefore I truly respect the 3 wheeled Scorpion Motorsports P6, see video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7ctW6oagME

It costs $32,000 and can do 0-62mph in ~3 seconds.


Anyway, I won't have that $32k yet and I may be going on some internships soon (I don't have one yet) and will need a car to drive and for that purpose and intent, I have chosen the Miata NA.

In my FSAE team, I use Carbon Fiber (CF) regularly and in my study of the Miata, I will very easily be able to reduce its weight a lot by using CF where the weight loss will be worth it, also, I will be adding a full body roll cage for protection and that would actually allow me to remove a lot of heavy out of date technology based structural elements.

In my brief study of the Miata, I think 150 pounds (68kg) can be removed very easily (by removing unneeded parts), furthermore, I shall be able to reduce another 250ish pound (best case scenario).

I also plan to upgrade the engine, as I believe that the driveline, handling, etc in the Miata NA is well respected and with an ultra light body with a good roll age, the only thing missing would be an engine.

The purpose of this is to make the car go 0-62mph in ~3 seconds, I know that may sound odd, but its doable with AWD, Torsen/LSD, a V8, CF parts, etc.

With a full tire diameter of ~22inches, and 0-60mph in 3 seconds at a total weight of 1000kg (2200 pounds)
I need a tire/axle rpm of 500 with a torque of 2000lb.ft (2700nm) exerted on the ground.
You can assume any gear ratio that you might think works. The HP can also be calculated using these numbers. 

What are your recommendations for such a setup?
You guys have experience with what shall work and what wouldn't and I would like to use that in my journey.

Lastly, I do not plan to build an ill-engineered car but a well-balanced track ready car. You can assume that I am just using the Miata NA as a body for a totally new car, but that's not the case, as my intention is to combine classic with performance here.

Is this a scam or a cult? What should I do, if anything?",stopmemeow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6usigo/my_25f_sister_19f_moved_to_la_to_be_a_dancer_she/,"My sister and I are kind to each other but not very close. My immediate family (including myself) are very mentally ill and fucked up, my sister is the exception, she is functional, athletic, popular and beautiful. I am extremely proud of her for thriving on her own and moving to LA for her career (she has been doing well, though she is confused about her exact path as most of us are - I'm being vague about her career just in case someone I know sees this). And I am extremely proud of her for thriving given the shit she was born into (it wasn't that bad compared to people who actually had horrific childhoods, it just was very stressful for both of us). I am not a role model of any kind, she is far more successful and basically better than me in every way edit: I just wanted to edit this to explain how it feels strange to try to parent her or guide her in any way, since I'm such a fuck up. She's been avoiding talking to me because she knows I'm an atheist (I'm not an arrogant atheist and do not think less of people for believing in whatever they believe in, I do not actively try to turn people into atheists or judge them for disagreeing with me) and she fears I will judge her for her newfound spirituality even though I've tried to be reassuring. We were not raised with any religion whatsoever but my mom has been 'spiritual.' I have no issues with that, I personally agree with a lot of Buddhist principles and have found relief in them, my mom and I discuss spiritual matters often. I don't even consider myself an atheist anymore, probably more of an agnostic. 

I was actually really glad (at first) that she found a community out there and I think religion can be a fantastic source of support and guidance for many people. I explicitly told her I supported her in the beginning several times and I talked to her about the spiritual books she had been reading and tried to be receptive to them. Then she started wanting me to watch videos of the 'preacher' of her church. The video she showed me bothered me a lot, because it basically stated that atheists were 'at war' with God and that life without God meant life without love, creativity etc. It's fair to believe what you believe, but I resent the fact that they have to insult other people's beliefs and act self-righteous about it. So I told her that I didn't want to see anymore videos and I told her why the video bothered me. She has begun to try to force my parents to start watching her preacher's sermons as well. My mom has communicated with her about how we all find answers in different things, and our beliefs are our own personal journey and can't be dictated by other people - but my sister has been acting like Jesus is the only way of life and everyone else is wrong.

The church basically seems like a church for LA hipsters to be honest - the church is called Mosaic, I have not found anything online that says they're a cult - but the Wiki page of the founder alarms me. He used to be a fashion designer or something and now it seems he's made a business out of this. His videos remind me of any Oprah-type self-help gurus. I have no problem with self-help gurus until they try to sell their vague inspirational ideas to scam people. There are little short films before his speeches (at least in this video I watched) of young, beautiful LA people next to beautiful scenery with inspirational/religious quotes over-top. Apparently a lot of famous people attend and it's fairly well-known in the area.

Even though I disagreed with the video she sent, nothing about it seems actively malicious or anything...and I highly doubt it's a cult like scientology, I just get nervous because she's so far from home and I don't know what to do.

Sometimes the line between cult and religion appears to be very thin.  But I always told my sister if she respects my beliefs I will respect hers. Recently she began texting my mom about how she wishes she would find 'Jesus,' which really freaked my mom out because we thought this church was kind of a more casual Christian interpretation that wouldn't push people to proselytize. My mom has no issues with religion in general as long as it does not harm people. Her parents were jack mormons, and so we're wary of a lot of organized religion because of how bad the Mormon church was.

My sister is going to ask my grandparents for help with money for the Mosaic ""college"" thing (our immediate family is broke, but my grandparents had a limited amount set aside for college if my sister chose to go) and my mom already told them that she would rather them save the money for actual education rather than this but I don't think it's enough. Those particular grandparents are religious so I'm worried they'll jump at the chance to send her there (sidenote: that particular grandmother tried to ambush-baptize us when we were younger without our parent's permission - I think my sister remembers me as an angry atheist because that side of the family tended to drive me insane with their conversion tactics, my uncle told me I was responsible for sending my sister to hell if I didn't convert us - I was 14 and she was 8 at the time, it left a sour taste in my mouth).

My sister already paid thousands of dollars to be their intern this summer, my mom tried to talk her out of it but it didn't' work. Since I barely talked to her I didn't feel it was my place to say anything but now I wish I did.

I don't want her to waste time and money on this. It seems like a scam to me. I want her to be happy and I am glad she has found a community - but I do not think a healthy, happy community would push their believers into spending thousands of dollars on them (but maybe they don't actively do that?).

Do you think this is a scam/cult? I'm hoping to find some people who have experience with this, or it would be amazing if anyone knows of this church and could chime in. I'm open to being wrong about my judgements. Should I say anything to her or just let it be? I would appreciate any advice.

**TL;DR** my little sister joined a seemingly progressive liberal Christian church in LA (she got baptized, she was never religious before this because our family was not). she spent thousands of dollars to be their intern this summer and wants to spend thousands more on their religious school (earning no actual college credit, 8k+ a year). Should I be more concerned? should I be trying to talk her out of this even though we are not extremely close?

**edit** Wow! I only expected a couple of replies. I am so grateful for all of your amazing responses, especially from those of you that are religious - your perspectives helped me the most because I do not want any of my residual distaste for organized religion to taint my relationship with my sister and I do whole-heartedly believe religion can be a positive force in her life and I do not want her to feel judged by me in any way. I'm compiling a lot of the advice I've found in this thread in a word document to remind myself how to approach her (this might be strange, I have a terrible memory). I'm extremely glad I made this post! Thank you guys for all the varying opinions. 

I am pretty certain Mosaic is not a cult at this point (there is a wonderful redditor that PMed me who is a former Mosaic member and they helped me understand it much better...if you're reading this, I really can't thank you enough), but they do have a tendency to pressure people into paying more money than they should - I'm comfortable in calling parts of the church an out-right scam at this point, because it does seem kind of predatory especially since my sister is a teenager who is not at all wealthy -  so once I rebuild my connection with my sister I'm going to gently nudge her in the direction of another church but I'm not going to hostile or harsh in any way, I just want to be a supportive presence in her life no matter what. She agreed to talk to me on the phone tomorrow, I will definitely be as gentle and supportive as possible (as most of you rightfully recommended) - thank you all again :) I truly appreciate it"

I have an absolutely terrible work ethic. It does not help that I am a technology addict and have been from a young age. In school I would divide my attention between my computer and my work. I procrastinated my school work constantly despite studying at school with no issue. 

During my 2nd year of college, I decided I didn't care as much about school and took a semester of 4 online classes and 1 in person class. The in person class was an A, the others were all F's. My first job was an intern position and after doing my duties, I would find myself going online to other websites and splitting my time between slacking off and working.

This continued through to retail positions where I would hang out in the back or behind my counter and just sit on my smart phone. I was caught a few times but acted like it was an emergency. One of my most recent jobs in a call center I mastered ""looking productive"" to the point where I had logged about 20 hours of pretending to be on calls for every 20 hours of work. Even after getting caught, I continued to do it in different ways and push the boundaries. I was fired from that job for having my phone on the floor (site rules are no personal electronics use on the production floor). 

I was almost fired from my last job for the same thing, doing work but blending not doing work at the same time. I'm now at my new job, and it's a small business with strict rules. I'm doing okay with not getting distracted but I don't trust myself at all to not completely mess this up for myself.

This also seems to creep into my relationship, where I've caught myself and been caught completely spacing out to my computer/phone instead of the conversation being had. 

I think one of the more obvious solutions is to lock my phone up, either by not taking it with me or by putting it in airplane mode or something. But that doesn't stop me from browsing the internet on the job and other distracting things. I feel like the answer is so obvious but I just feel too dumb and addicted to this stuff to even overcome it."

Hope you enjoy.

This is the story (stories maybe, if you guys like this one) of my sexual adventures over the last two years. I'm gonna give you a bit of background of myself, because if you'd told me I'd be a part of these stories two years ago, I wouldn't believe it.

**BACKGROUND**


So, I'm 24-years-old, 5' 9"", and have olive skin. I'm bisexual; my gay experiences had been limited to getting (and giving) head and making out with friends prior to these experiences. I used to get a lot of attention from gay guys in college, mostly because of my bubble butt. But, I never considered myself a bottom and nothing happened.


My sexual, or homosexual awakening if you will, was through my flatmate Mike in college. Mike and I met in freshman year of college, were the same major, and quickly kicked it off despite our different personalities. Mike is more of a free spirit, also bisexual, and really fun to be around. He's very personable and loved by everyone. His body type is similar to mine, except he has paler skin and has dirty blonde hair.
When we became flatmates, through the thin walls, I found out that Mike was exclusively a bottom when it came to guys. I'd already decided not to get involved sexually with my flatmate, but over the years, I always had to fight the urge not to do so. All that happened between Mike and I during college was a few drunken make-out sessions in parties, which I barely remember.



I should also mention that, despite what he'd tell you, Mike made it through college because of me. I always made sure that Mike was up to speed academically and somehow he managed to graduate with a 3.0 and ended up with a great job at a pharmaceutical company. I, on the other hand, despite having graduated with highest honors and several internships, ended up jobless. I'd interviewed with a lot of companies, but none of them seemed to be interested after the interview. I was catching up Mike 5-6 months after our graduation, and he told me he could see why this was the case. ""You never show interest. You make them feel like they're the ones who should be offering something to you, not the other way around. That's what's driving them away. It's the same with your relationships. Remember Anna? (an ex-gf) She had to ask you out because you wouldn't."" He was right. But I knew I couldn't change myself. So, I straight up asked Mike if he could hook me up with a job at his company. He said: ""Totally. I'm surprised you didn't ask earlier. I'm gonna ask Eric on Monday."" Eric was the CEO of Mike's company. Mike, with his charm and all, seemed to know him on a personal level; so I was really relieved.


I didn't hear from Mike for a few days, until he called me on Friday and asked me to meet up. He told me that his boss wasn't able to offer me a job at the time, but he had referred me to a smaller company in our area. Mike had followed up, and told me I'd be meeting with one of the company's seniors tomorrow for drinks. I was surprised, because I hadn't heard about an interview over drinks before. Mike could see my expression; he said: ""Hey, I'm gonna be real with you for a sec. There's a reason I'm doing so well at work. I've been fuck-buddies with Eric since the day we met."" I started to laugh awkwardly, but Mike said: ""Nope, it's true. Eric's a great guy and as far as I know, he has a few other fuck-buddies in our company. But he wanted me to let you know that your arrangement with this guy will be the same."" I was really taken aback. I said ""Mike, I didn't go through college just to get a job through fucking people!"" he said ""Me neither"" I said ""You didn't-"" He laughed and said ""Alright, I know. Look, the guy already likes you. You basically have the job. If it gets bad you can quit and be happily unemployed again."" I ignored his sass and said ""wait a minute, what do you mean the guy likes you?"" he took a sip of his drink and murmured ""I may or may not have sent some photos of you to him along with your resume."" At that point, I got up and began to leave. I heard Mike saying ""let me know if I should cancel!"" behind me. I'll spare you the details of what factors contributed to my desicion (living at parents' was one), but I decided to meet the creepy fuck who was ""already into me"" the day after. So I called Mike and told him I was gonna go meet the guy.


**SEX STUFF HERE**


Mike said he was gonna give my number to the guy. Saturday, around 6 PM, I got a text saying ""Hi. It's Richard, Let's meet at X (nice hotel bar) at 9."" So I cleaned up, shaved, put some nice clothes on and went. Richard came in at around 9:20 and was not who I was expecting at all. Now I wonder if Mike didn't describe him on purpose just to fuck with me. He stood at about 6' 1"", had black-slightly-graying hair and beard, with a shirt and and a blazer on that outlined his burly figure. He looked to be around 35 or so, although later on I found he was 42. He shook my hand firmly, and ordered us two whiskies. He didn't initiate conversation, and I got nervous, so I started talking. a lot. Over the course of the next few drinks, all I heard was a few ""Aha""s and follow-up questions. After about an hour or so, he suddenly said ""have Mike and Eric talked to you about what we expect from you?"" I nervously said ""Yes. Mike said some stuff about-."" He said ""And?"" I shyly nodded my head. He said ""Alright, let's head back to my place.""


The cab ride was quiet, but Richard seemed more relaxed when we stepped into his place. He had a beautiful house in a rich neighborhood, and the inside was just as nice and well-kept as the outside. I wanted to comment on that, but Richard, smiling now, said: ""This is the part where you take your shirt and jeans off."" This did it. I let down my defenses and said ""Look, Richard, I'm pretty sure you know I'm bisexual. Obviously we're gonna sleep together tonight but you should know I've never had full on sex with a guy before."" This made Richard laugh, he said ""I didn't know you were this nervous! never had sex huh? this makes things more interesting. When was the last time you did anything with a guy?"" I replied ""a few months."" He got closer to me and said ""well, don't worry about a thing. We're just gonna have some fun and celebrate your new job tonight. OK?"" This kinda put me at ease. It had been a few months since I'd gotten laid...He said ""here's an idea, why don't we undress and head to the hot tub?"" I agreed and began to undress. As soon as I took my jeans off, Richard paused and stared at my ass. I said ""Yeah, it gets a lot of attention."" he replied, ""it's gonna get more than that tonight"". It was a cheesy comment, but it made my heart race. Moments later, I turned around and saw Richard was fully naked now, his cock on full display. I'd sucked two cocks before. But his was on a whole nother level. It wasn't fully erect, but its girth and veins stood at attention. Richard saw that I was staring, and took the chance.

 He approached me, grabbed my hair with one hand and grabbed my ass with the other and started making out with me. This was much different than a college hookup. Richard had confidence, more experience, and was definitely in his comfort zone. It was strange, but at this point, I had completely let go; I'd been usually dominant in my past relationships. Richard continued to fiercely make out with me, and moved his hand from my hair to my other butt-cheek. He began spreading them, and moved his tongue to my neck and ears. I was in heaven, and my breaths were numbered. He took his time, and slowly moved to my nipples and started sucking on them, alternating between each. He seemed to notice that my left nipple was more sensitive, so he started paying more and more attention to that one. I was moaning like a bitch at that point and Richard knew he could do whatever he wanted with me that night. He sat down on a couch and I knew what I had to do. I put my tongue out and licked the shaft of his 8"" cock. I moved on to the head and squeezed it with my mouth. Once again, he put his hand in my hair and began manuevering my head up and down. I didn't mind, and enjoyed the fact that my mouth was full with his cock. After a couple of minutes, he grabbed me by the shoulders, made me turn around and stand on the sofa. He sat up straight and began to viciously eat my ass. This was the highest point of my life. He had his arm wrapped around my legs, and I was helpless. I did the only thing that came to my mind, and started jerking my own cock. He quickly stopped me and moved my hands to his head. I was now pressing his head against my ass. And richard was finding his way to my tight asshole. He worked around it for a few minutes and lubed me up well, before putting a finger in. I was not about to stop this session because of the pain, so I just went through with it. The combination of Richard's tongue and finger put me over the edge and I was precumming like crazy. I moaned to Richard ""I think I'll cum soon. Can I cum...please?"" Richard, with a gruff voice, said: ""cum, but taste it"" I barely understood him, but started jerking my cock. Not two pumps later, I began cumming so hard that I saw stars. Richard had seized the opportunity and put another finger in my ass. I came all over the coffee table and the floor, but managed to collect some with my hands. By Richard's request, I put it in my mouth. Richard said ""Now suck my cock, hold tight"". He moved his hand to my butt-cheeks and reclined on the sofa. I went back to sucking his cock in this new 69-like position. After a few minutes, and another one of Richard's fingers, Richard said ""I think you're ready."" he left the room and came back with lube and condoms. 

I was so horny that I had continued to finger myself while he was gone. Richard grinned when he saw this and spanked me hard after he put the condom on. I was so horny that I told him to just go for it and not be gentle. He took my word, bent me down started fucking me doggystyle while we were on the couch. He started dirty-talking and spanked my ass every now and again. He put one of his fingers in my mouth and said: ""You like my big cock in your tight virgin ass?"" All I could do was to suck on his finger and say ""mmhmm"". This drove him wild. He moved his hand from my mouth and began pulling my hair, commanding me to moan louder for him. I did and got spanked harder as I moaned louder. He suddenly picked me up, had me stand up against the wall (a painting). Before going in again, he tongued my asshole and reapplied some lube to his cock. Then went back in and started pounding away. I had nothing to hold on to, so he grabbed both my wrists with one hand from behind and held on to my hair with the other for more control. My face was pressed against the painting while being fucked, and I think this was the hardest and closest I'd appreciated art in my life. I could feel he was getting close, so I asked ""are you gonna cum for me"" he grunted ""uh-huh"" I said ""come all over me"" he said ""I'm gonna cum in your mouth"". I was hoping he wouldn't, but there was a confidence in his voice that made me not object. He pulled out, ripped off the condom, and held out his cock. I quickly began sucking on his cock, and was rewarded with 7-8 spurts of slightly salty cum. I swallowed it all quickly, and grinned at Richard. He grinned back. I suddenly remembered, ""weren't we headed to the hot tub?"" He said ""We will eventually, we're just getting started here."" I didn't object, I couldn't believe what I'd been missing in my college years!"
6uth5f,9,2017-08-19,The Wizard's Idiot,WinsomeJesse,winsomeman,https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/6uth5f/the_wizards_idiot/,"Millen was a goof without peer. From his posture to his haircut to the little sizzling sounds that came out of his ears when he tried to do simple arithmetic, there was nothing about Millen that didn't scream *I am trying my best and this is genuinely all that's come of it*. 

And yet, somehow, some way, the boy had come to apprentice under the renowned Silver Wizard Balthabug. This was no simple summer internship, either. Balthabug was an enormously prickly fellow, blessed with powers and perceptions well beyond the ken of the townsfolk at large. His wizardry cured sickness, poorsightedness, rickety backs, and wibbly knees. His cruel sorcery beat back the wargs and the night gobblies on a regular basis. If the villagers had believed in a higher power, they would have believed that Balthabug *was* that higher power; and in fact, they only didn't because Balthabug told them not to and you generally did what Balthabug said, no questions asked.

So why was Millen chosen as apprentice? It was a good question and no one had the foggiest idea of an answer. There were other, more capable boys. And, if you were more progressively minded, you'd note that there were even *more* capable girls. In fact, if the boys and girls of the village were stacked up on a ladder of aptitude, Millen wouldn't even be the bottom rung. Nor would he be allowed to hold the ladder for the other, more worthwhile children. No, he would more likely be asked to sit ten paces to the side, looking the other way, with his hands in his pockets.

It was a mystery, certainly, but mysteries were commonplace in a town with Balthabug at its center. 

For Millen's sake, the apprentice was more emotionally taxing than anything. He was asked to clean occasionally, but only in a very particular manner, following a long list of conditions, where most of the bullet points began with, ""Do not touch..."" He was never asked to assist in any wizardry and he was never taught anything at all. Millen had thought, at the outset, that perhaps he had some secret talent that only Balthabug could perceive, but this was not the case, which the wizard made clear one day:

""You are here because your villagers seem to think a wizard needs an apprentice,"" growled Balthabug. ""The mayor has been very insistent on this point. They seem to think a wizard alone in a wizardly castle is perverse, where a wizard alone in a wizardly castle with an underage boy is *not*. Rest assured, young Millen, you are not the only idiot in this town.""

Millen was not certain that this was meant to be reassuring, but he chose to take it that way all the same.

One day, however, the tidy harmony of emotionally abusive wizard and intellectually inefficient boy-servant was shattered. Literally. Or, that is to say, a very horrible and powerful piece of wizardry was shattered (literally) causing the harmony to be shattered (metaphorically). It was an unpleasant sort of Thursday.

You see, at the center of Balthabug's workshop there was a flickering, purplish orb. It was a terrifying thing to see if you were not magically inclined, coursing through with wicked, sparking power. It was the Orb of Creation, and as the name seemed to imply, it was a bit of a big deal.

""This is the source of my power,"" said Balthabug, answering a question Millen hadn't asked. ""My greatness comes from my ability to draw from the natural energies that surround us. You, too, could be a wizard as great as me, were you not such a pointless, hillbilly rube.""

Of course, Millen's duties were designed to never bring him into spitting distance of the Orb of Creation. The trouble began when a rat slipped into the workshop.

Normally, Millen would ignore such a problem. That was his management style. If he saw a rat in the outhouse, Millen would excuse himself to the forest and do his business there. A rat in the cupboard? Millen would resign himself to a week or so of hunger. Anything to avoid a conflict.

But there was the rat, sitting atop the Orb of Creation. That felt very, very dangerous to Millen, especially considering the way the purple lines all seemed to converge on the rat, racing upward, flowing into the rat's body.

""He'll become a wizard rat!"" shouted Millen, imagining a town ravaged by the tyranny of an all-mighty rat, seeing his parents and siblings and Meg, the washgirl next door, all turned into giant blocks of cheese. A nightmare. He couldn't let it stand.

He swung his broom heavily, clipping the rat, sending it tumbling off the orb. But the edge of the broom caught the top of the orb as well. The globe tottered and teetered in its stand. Millen held his breath, praying to whatever strange, impossible force kept objects like Creation Orbs from flying around the room. But it was no use. The orb tipped, wobbled, and fell. The crash was horrid. The screams that followed even worse.

""My orb!"" bellowed Balthabug, racing half-dressed into the workshop. ""What did you do?""

""There was a rat..."" mumbled Millen, whose eyes were drawn to the orb's terrible wreckage. He had half-expected an explosion. Possibly total, earthly annihilation. Maybe a pack of spirits rising out of the glass, tossing off curses as they floated into the ether. There was none of this. Just a strange sort of glass that wasn't glass, various bits of metal, two brownish, rolling cylinders, some wires...

Balthabug cleared his throat. ""Well, I suppose you've figured me out. I specifically picked out the simplest child in the village to avoid a situation like this. Everything you no doubt suspect about me is true. My origins. The true source of my power. What will you do, boy? Give me up for a heretic? Have me tossed out of the village? Burned alive? I can't escape this place. The portal's closed now. I can't go home. My life, as it is, is now in your hands.""

This was a lot for a boy like Millen. Perhaps a significant amount too much.

""There was a rat,"" he muttered, blinking up at the wizard. ""Please don't be mad.""

Balthabug blinked back. ""Hrm... Did you... Did nothing I just say register with you?""

""Please don't turn me into a hamster,"" whispered Millen.

Balthabug pulled at his collar. ""Oh. Well. I suppose you *were* the right boy for the job. Well...sweep this up. And...I suppose we should tell the villagers that you destroyed my Orb of Creation, which means my services are about to get a lot more pricey.""

Millen nodded. ""Yes. Of course. They'll understand. Thank you. Thank you.""

""Don't thank me,"" said Balthabug, turning to leave. ""Just...don't break anymore of my stuff."" As Millen set about cleaning the mess he'd made, the terrible Silver Wizard Balthabug let out a sigh and wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead. ""God bless idiots."""

(Me, male 23) The past few years have been the worst of my life, when they should be the best. I changed my life for the better, made myself healthier, more attractive, more sociable, but always was overshadowed by the horrible things I've dealt with. I have hit my lowest point during this time, bordering on suicidal, even having thoughts of how things would be easier if I were dead. In September of 2012 my best friend died. We weren't on speaking terms, we'd had a falling out, and then, when he needed me, I wasn't there. In October of 2015, my sister died in the middle of the night. She was gone for no reason, and to be honest I didn't know if I could take much more. The absolute agony I was in constantly lasted for months, and seemed like it wouldn't end. I carried on with school, getting accepted to my sisters old university for grad school, and now every day was painful just knowing I was in the same place she use to be. I just found ways to survive, and I didn't even know if it was worth it. 

Then, in September, I met this girl (25). She talked to me first, that's why I knew it was something different. That never happens to me, ever. We met at the dog park, she wanted to meet up again so our dogs could play. For months we kept this up, eventually I started messaging her about other stuff and we became friends. We were both insanely busy and didn't have time to do much else, but we wanted to get together. But, I could already tell I was into this girl. She...made me happier, made the anger and hate I had for the entire world go away for a little while. We finally got to hang out a few times, I learned some about her, I was hooked. But there was a catch. She was fresh out of a relationship, a very serious one, and a very long one. I thought to myself then that the last thing she needs is some amateur like me to be trying to start something with her. I felt like what she needed the most right now was a friend, and to be honest, so did I. So, I didn't really push the issue past being friends. But, there were a few instances where I thought for sure she was into me, and something would happen naturally, but never did. 

The truth is, I think this girl saved my life. I was so far down, was so full of anger, misery, and pure hatred for everything, I was getting to the point where ending things was starting to creep in my mind. I had so much taken from me, and I know my situation isn't nearly as bad as it could be, but we all respond differently I guess. I was so close to the point where I wanted nothing anymore, but to just die. But she was there, whenever I felt bad, I would text her, or she would randomly send me funny instagram things, etc. and I was helping her deal with stuff, she confided in me, and me in her. She honestly was, and is, my best friend in the whole world. 

But, I think I love her now. I'm terrified of that, but excited by it too. But, I think I waited to long. I went away for the summer for an internship, and we got together with some friends when I got back. That was when they accidentally told me about this other guy she'd been talking to, and honestly I felt like I was gonna be sick. I blew it, whatever chance I could've had, I became the good friend, when I want to be so much more than that. This girl deserves everything, and I want to give it to her. I don't know if she wants this too, I don't know if she's ever even thought about it, or if she's just flirty in general. Now, she's moving away, and I can't stand it. She's not going far, but it feels like she's leaving forever. She doesn't text me as much anymore, or send me things, or confide in me, like she use to. I think it's because of this new guy, or maybe I just fell out of her graces. But I'm hurting so bad right now. I would settle for being friend with her if that's what it has to be, I just can't lose her completely. She may never understand how important she is to me, what she means to me, and what I would do for her, and that's ok. I don't want to scare her off, I don't want to creep her out, but, at this point I think maybe she should know about this? I've been going over and over in my head about how to tell her, what to say, how to make it feel like I'm not trying to coerce her into anything. I just want her to know what I feel, and I want me to be a man and say something for once, I'm tired of being the nice guy who stays quiet and finishes last. 

I just...don't know what to do, I almost feel like I should be ashamed of this. I love her and we haven't even 'dated'. She's just this amazing person, she makes me laugh and brings me out of the dark. I can feel my entire outlook on life rising up over the last year since I met her. But...these last 3 weeks since I found out about the other guy...I feel it all slipping, I feel that anger and hatred coming back, I feel that hopelessness. I know that's weak, I know that's pathetic, but that's just who I am now, I've taken as much as I can, I can't lose anymore and keep going. But I don't want her to be forced into loving me either, I feel like if I tell her all this, she'll feel obligated to be with me, to save me. I don't want that, I want her to be happy for reasons that she actually wants, and if that's with me, or someone else, I want it to be guiltless. My head is just so messed up, I thought maybe putting this down somewhere would help. I don't know what to do, she's gone soon, if I'm going to do something, it needs to be before then. "

Thanks in advance!

1) I found the lists for career fairs on the UNCW site but companies attending aren't always specified and I'm curious about what types of companies show up for the computer science realm and what your experience has been with them (internships, job offers, etc)?

2) I've heard that the Computer Science building is quite nice and that the program itself is pretty good so whether you experienced this from internships or once you graduated and joined the workforce, how did you feel your skills compared to those in a similar profession from other schools? 

3) I remember reading that getting in from out-of-state is a much harder task than getting in from in-state so may I ask what your test scores and unweighted GPA's are (preferably out-of-state but both are helpful)? Any honest prediction on my chances?

4) What's your favorite thing about student life as well as the area?

Extra:
- ACT (28)
- GPA (3.52 unweighted)"
6uu2d6,11,2017-08-20,"[Paid/Negotiable] I want to break into the gaming industry as a Producer/Project Manager, and you need someone who can control the chaos. Let's talk!",zettovyker,gameDevClassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/6uu2d6/paidnegotiable_i_want_to_break_into_the_gaming/,"Hello Gaming Industry! 

My name is Peter, and I have always been a passionate gamer, but have never taken a serious attempt at trying to give back to the gaming industry that has molded me into the man I am today - that is, until now. 

The reason I have come to reddit is to make a bold attempt at throwing myself out into the ocean of the internet and swim like there is no tomorrow until I can be picked up by the rescue boats of a development team.

You see, I have made a name for myself as a invaluable team member at the non-profit I currently work for. While I love being a part of the gears and cogs of their operations that provide necessary services to under-served communities, I keep feeling the call to action to pursue a career in helping the stories of future video games come to fruition. The games I played growing up are what lead me down the path to become a person who talks to everyone, helps strangers in need, seeks new friends, supports a team mentality, and is always ready for the inevitable trouble on an adventure. 

It was these life lessons that have lead me to champion many successful projects under my belt. It's ridiculous to say that games really were the cause for all the skills I have developed over many years - yet here we are with you reading about my job and accomplishments. As my official title is long and is the combination of several roles, I will just talk about a couple of things I do at my job and let you see for yourself how much experience I have at the ready to be transferred over to the gaming industry.

- I manage over thirty outreach and volunteer events a year (including staffing, recruiting, inventory, forecasting, and logistics/budgeting for these projects). 

- I handle scheduling for over one hundred students who come through our doors every school year. This includes doing a one hour presentation for each group, a tour of the facility, pairing with staff, overseeing their second hour of observations, and being the point of contact with their university instructor to facilitate rotations.

- I screen potential volunteer and intern applicants through a pipeline interview process and communicate all candidate information to several teams, spanning across five company locations in three cities. 

A couple of achievements I am especially proud of accomplishing are making a connection with 3M which lead to a full two week case study that we received funding for, and expanding our current student education program to a new university (an increase of sixty to one-hundred-eighty students for one location).

That was a lot to read, I'm sure. But if you have made it this far I have at least created some interest in your mind as a potential hire. The good news is that I am completely open to negotiations and interviews in the field. Everything between an unpaid part-time position to help an indie dev team get on their feet, up to and including re-location from where I live for a full time position with an established company.

If you are interested in giving me a chance to invest my time and expertise with you and your team, please message me via reddit, skype, or discord (all ID’s as ZettoVyker) with some information about your offer and what you are looking to have me do for you. I would love nothing more than to hear about how I can be the link that ensures your game makes an impact on the future of gamers and developers alike.

6uu2y5,6,2017-08-20,How much would taking 4 A2's make me stand out as an Oxbridge applicant?,nibba678,6thForm,https://www.reddit.com/r/6thForm/comments/6uu2y5/how_much_would_taking_4_a2s_make_me_stand_out_as/,"Hey everyone,

I'm having a hard time deciding whether I should keep my fourth A-level, computer science, or not. 

Currently, at AS, since I'm doing the older ones, I got 4As in maths, further maths, physics and computer science. Knowing how my school predicts people's grades, if I continue with 4 A levels, they would predict me 4 A* (or 3 if I drop one)

Although, I hate computer science. I don't want to continue it at all. But I feel like it would be beneficial in standing out as an applicant at Oxbridge and for future jobs / internships as well. 

Advantages:

1) Possibly standing out more than other applicants
2) Would help in the future with internships / jobs
3) A really well liked subject 
4) Already got a mid-tier A at AS, so getting an A might not be that difficult at A2

Disadvantages

1) Absolutely fucking hate computer science 
2) Teacher is bad
3) Very little resources 
4) Massive workload 
5) Might end up getting a bad grade instead (could drop from an A to a B)


What do y'all think I should do? Is keeping the 4th AS worth it to boost my application? Or should I just do my best in 3 A levels instead?

Thank you for any help

I love college and I am just doing so well. But no, they expect so much from me. I can't deliver. A 3.2 and possibly less if I keep failing math. I can't get an internship my mom is setting me up for.bi LIED and LIED to her about my gpa being higher. I'm afraid to fail agin. I'm so scared to see everything go downhill. My mom gave up so much and now I'm throwing it all away. 

I'm so afraid of disappointing her when she finds out the truth. All of the money going into retakes of math courses. I'm so scared of the future."

Does it have good connections for internships and jobs?

6uv78k,0,2017-08-20,"[20F] I, [23M] broke up with me. Serious and first relationship. How do I deal with the memories?",suedi4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6uv78k/20f_i_23m_broke_up_with_me_serious_and_first/,"Hello everyone, the break up happened yesterday. It would have been 1.7 years of dating. 
And I'm torn, even though it was difficult. My love for him never decreased and I thought he was the one for me. Things got messy but messier when I had to go away for an internship. I was very insecure about me being in that relationship as he had very close female friends. I felt awkward with one of his friends and decided to talk to her, I agreed with her with majority but some felt like it was crossing the boundary of questions she assumed. Anyways, despite that I decided that this could work, I have to accept all of these hard feelings because I am willing to do so much for him. To make him feel happy and loved. But when he came to visit me that week, he was not.
I do think of my boyfriend a lot. During school semesters we were 24/7 together. Even when he's not there, I think of My bf loving a certain thing and noting in my head that we should come here one day. I love him so much. And I just don't know if I'll find someone like him again. I promised myself that I would change for the better, but he was exhausted of me by that time. I'm just devastated. I know I have to work on myself to be better. And I hope one day he will see me and understand that I am a person of promise and growth. That I was going to be a promise of my word and support him through everything.

TL;DR first relationship, we both believed we were the one for one another. He is exhausted of me and I had just given the mentality that I will do my best for him. Should I just try erasing the MANY happy moments I have of him presently to make this easier for me? They keep popping up and it hurts even more of the promises and future we said we'd build together. How do you know when you're over a break up? Do those memories become bittersweet? Accept it without crying?"

**40,400** art lovers *loving art* for **5 years**

&amp;nbsp;


/r/ICanDrawThat; a place full of artists and art lovers alike. Browse, and look at the wonderful pieces of art produced by budding artists, or be the artist - draw wonderful pictures, meeting peoples various, peculiar requests. 


Want to share your amazing, unseen art talent? Or maybe you have a wacky idea that you want to see sketched out? Either way, head to /r/ICanDrawThat and you will not be disappointed. [Ever wanted to know what Snorlax looks like to someone who hasn't seen Pokémon?](http://i.imgur.com/3RLkW0P.jpg) Probably not... Until now. It's intriguing, wacky ideas like this that fuel the sub, and with a page of submissions rolling in every day, they aren't going to stop anytime soon. If you've ever wanted to see what something looks like in someone else's head, this is the place to be. Explore the world through artists eyes - just give them a prompt and wait for the wacky but well-drawn results!


According to the mods, the community is full of budding, talented artists and lunatics with crazy ideas. If you identify as either of them (lets be honest, you probably do), you would fit in perfectly. So, sketch yourself some weird ideas and get on over there!

&gt;##1. What inspires you to keep the sub running?

&gt;&gt;**Paralux** The amazing community and my fellow mods are what inspires me to be active in Reddit as a whole, without them, I wouldn't be who I am today. The mod team, especially me, have grown a lot from this great experience. Going through the subreddit will probably always be my favorite time of the day. After a stressful day, you know you can always just go look in the hot page and see some random and fun request, and an amazing artist who makes the idea into reality.

&gt;&gt;**ecclectic** We have a great community, and the artists find new ways to keep things interesting.

&gt;&gt;**SaltySolomon** I would also have to say that the community often manages to make me smile while clearing the mod q of other subs, there are just so many kind and talented people in the community.

&gt;&gt;**CrystalLord** Personally I love to see what artists come up with here, and overtime improve. If you focus on the repeat users, those who request a lot of new content and those who offer their time to make requests reality, I think ICanDrawThat has a fantastic community. Some requests here are truly far beyond my imagination, and I love to see them get filled.

&gt;##2. What is the most interesting request you've ever seen drawn?

&gt;&gt;**Paralux** We have a special user flair for users who make artwork that stands out to the mod team as unique, or the first time we've ever seen something like that done. My favorite request was probably /u/Drook's [gif offer thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/2x2hwf/offer_home_from_work_looking_to_do_some_animating/) from about two years ago. This really isn't a request, although it was at the time the first gif offer/request thread that I'd ever seen, and it still stands out as a unique thing.

&gt;&gt;**ecclectic** [Reddit as a map](https://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/jj4dx/reddit_drawn_as_a_map_with_each_subreddit_as_a/) was interesting). /u/netwoodle has done some really great offer threads as well.

6uvkht,13,2017-08-20,What causes inceldom? - My theory,BetUrProcrastinating,IncelsWithoutHate,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelsWithoutHate/comments/6uvkht/what_causes_inceldom_my_theory/,"First off, let me say that I identify as an incel, and I'm relatively new to this community. I came here because I didn't agree with a lot of the stuff that was being posted in /r/incels , (ER worship, roastie name calling, etc.) and I thought the community as a whole really gave a bad name to us incels. In my opinion, if we want people to take us seriously, we can't post things that discredit the rest of our arguments. Most people are going to see that we worship mass murderers in our sub and completely dismiss us as a bunch of loonies, which I know is not the case. Judging by the number of incels who post in /r/inceltears, the popularity of the less vitriolic /r/foreveralone, as well as the fact that this very subreddit was created shows me that a lot of incels are also unsatisfied with the /r/incels sub. This sub seems kind of dead, but I think it would be a good place to post some incel theory and rational discussion about the incel cause.

In my opinion, perhaps the most important question related to incels, and the most relevant in trying to solve it, is ""what really CAUSES inceldom?"" It should follow that if we understand what causes someone to be an incel, we can address those causes and help that person stop being an incel. I know some incel hardliners will say that incels are permanently incel, and I agree that this may be the case for some, but at the same time I know that there must be at least a FEW incels out there who can change.

There are many speculated possible reason for inceldom. In general, most self-proclaimed incels think that physical attributes prevent them from having sex/getting into relationships, such as height, race, frame, and of course-face, while normies tend to think that the personalities, attitude, and my favorite, hobbies, of the incels are the root cause. Of course, this is a massive generalization. There are tons of incels who think that mental illness or social incapability are the culprits, and there are some normies who do say that looks are extremely important. I know I'm making generalizations, but my point is that there are many speculated reasons for inceldom, and that they are generally divided into the physical vs. mental. I've also noticed that incels tend to think that they are permanently fucked, and that they have no ability to change their situation, while normies think that incels can overcome their problems and get into relationships if they put in the work. Furthermore, in my discussion I will not be talking about people who have a very readily apparent reason for inceldom. If you are legitimately disfigured, suffer from severe physical/mental handicaps, live in Antarctica, etc. what I say will not really apply to you. I am addressing the people for whom there is a lot of contention surrounding their incel statuses.

So how do we figure out what actually causes inceldom? Is it face, physique, hygiene, mental illness, bad attitude, a lack of confidence, race, height, acne, disfigurement, accent, location, bad luck, something else, or a mix of all of these? I decided to find out straight from the source. I basically went into /r/iama, /r/casualiama, /r/confession, /r/advice, /r/sex, etc. and typed into the sidebar ""virgin"" and then clicked on all of the threads that had stories from people 25+ who were virgins. I scoured what they had written and all of the suggestions in the comments to try and find a common thread. I did this for a LONG time too, as in, I would go through pages and pages reading this kind of content. It was probably not the best use of my time, lol. But in the end, a pattern did somewhat emerge. Most of the people, at least from their own descriptions, were not ugly. Not to say they were all models, but they seemed around average. There didn’t seem to be one race overrepresented, either. I’m going out on a limb and saying that they were probably all relatively in shape, had hobbies and interests, etc. Hell, most of them seemed to have fine personalities also. The vast majority of them had a few things in common, though- low self esteem, social anxiety, and sometimes depression.

This was what I always suspected. Probably, in part, because it resonated deeply with me. I think that my own social anxiety and abysmal social abilities have been the number one thing preventing me from getting into a relationship. I’m not particularly ugly, I’m not a horrible person (at least I hope, lol), I’m not super short, I’m not bland or boring- I just have absolutely no friends and no social ability, lol. 

https://mic.com/articles/112062/the-way-most-people-meet-their-significant-others-is-not-what-you-think#.S3MWfyrUJ

I think the above link is very telling. The page details how most people meet their romantic partners. And guess what? 39% met their romantic partners through mutual friends, and 22% more say that they met their’s in a social setting. Not only does a person with very severe social anxiety have to deal with coming off as a complete tool around women, they also have to worry about not even having the chance to meet people in the first place. If you have very few friends and rarely go out to social outings because of your anxiety or inability to interact normally with others, that makes it much, much harder to meet people. Online dating sources CAN work, but they require a good amount of know-how and are based heavily on looks. 

Let me explain why I think some of the other attributes are not as important as some may think they are when it comes to getting into a relationship.

Physique- Ugh, sorry normies, lifting and showering isn’t as useful as you may think it is. Yes, being in shape does make you more attractive. But let’s look at the population of America for a second. Something like ⅔ of people are overweight or obese in this country. The majority of people are very sedentary, don’t go to the gym, are not active, and have poor bodies. Yet inceldom only affects like 1% of men. Sure, getting in shape is great, but normies treat it like the key to getting laid. Getting in shape will do nothing for most incels, except those who are severely overweight. Getting shape is good advice to give to normies who want to get laid MORE, but is in general not great for incels. Our problems lie deeper.

Hygiene, poor dress, bad haircut- Once again, same as physique. In some extreme cases this COULD help incels, but the majority of us are average. As in, we have average hygiene, dress fine, and have a fine haircut. Not only is this not great advice for getting laid, it’s also insulting. You guys just assume all of us are filthy neckbeards living in our parents’ basement.

Lack of hobbies/interests- Just plain insulting and untrue. I’m willing to bet the average guy on /r/incels has some interesting hobbies.

Personality and attitude- This is where it gets kind of dicey. I know normies are going to shit themselves saying this is our problem, but I’m kind of skeptical. Here’s what I’ll say. In order to maintain a relationship, having a good personality and attitude is very important. You can’t hide yourself from your partner forever. As for merely getting INTO a relationship or having sex… I really don’t think it’s that important. Think about how many complete douchebags, murderers, psychopaths, and abusers have gotten into relationships. I’m not saying it doesn’t matter, I’m just saying it’s not one of the more important issues.

I think my argument basically boils down to this: You see guys all the time who are assholes, or who lack hobbies, or who have bad haircuts/clothes, or, hell, unattractive/fat get girlfriends. Do you see many super socially anxious or borderline autistic people with GFs? I sure haven’t.

Now, I know at this point incels (and probably some normies) are getting ready to spam their keyboards and call me a fakecel or whatever for saying that social ability is the most important thing. I am still acknowledging that looks are important, guys. Ugly people are going to have an objectively harder time getting laid than attractive people; that much is obvious. But I’m not blaming you, incels. I think a lot of normies forget that incels don’t really have control over their social skills/really bad anxiety or depression. And this is part of the reason normies’ advice is ridiculed.

When I was looking at the posts of older virgins, I noticed they had something else in common Normies LOVE to give advice in the comments. A good portion of it was mostly “hit the gym, dress better, get hobbies, etc.” BS that you see everywhere. I think the reason that normies love to give this advice is because they like the idea of a just world. They like to think that if someone just WORKS ON HIMSELF hard enough, he’ll be able to get out of their wretched pit of despair. And telling people to hit the gym or dress better is very formulaic; if you follow this advice, it will work 100% of the time. People who go to the gym get in better shape. People who buy better fitting clothes dress better. People who get more hobbies have another thing to tack on to their resume, etc. The problem is that normies don’t want to admit that maybe there’s a deeper problem. It is MUCH harder to give advice to try and fix festering social anxiety and inhibition than it is to help someone dress better.

And you could see this in the advice that the normies gave when it came to mental health. While half of the comments that were giving advice told incels to dress better, get hobbies, etc. the other half pointed out the mental problems of the OP. They acknowledged that social anxiety or social inability or whatever was a huge hurdle. But they failed to really give advice. They gave a smug diagnosis of OP’s problems, telling him he had a bad attitude (although he acted more civil than a lot of the people in the comments) and saying he just had to “be confident” and “work on himself” and other mindless drivel like that. This advice is ridiculous. Not because it’s bad, but because it’s so vague. What does “be confident” even mean? How do you do it? How do you simply overcome mental illness? There’s no step by step solution for this. This is why normies love to give the shower-gym-dress spiel. Because they like thinking that the world is fair, and that there’s always a formula to overcome any challenge. For mental illness there is no formula. Hell, there might not even BE a solution. This scares normies, I think.

But for a moment, I’ll go back to the problem of mental illness/lack of confidence/lack of social ability/low self esteem/whatever you want to call it. Can you truly fix these kinds of issues? Normies will say yes, incels will say no. I understand both sides of the argument, and I think the answer lies in the middle. I would say it is POSSIBLE, but the likelihood differs from person to person. Some people may be able to overcome their poor social skills, some may not. It depends on the person and the circumstances. I think it’s a lot like being poor. If you’re born into a poor family in a poor neighborhood, sure it’s possible to become rich. But this is rare, because they have their environment working against them. Bad schools, violence, and an ingrained acceptance of one’s fate are all contributing factors that kind of lock people into poverty. And this is demonstrable. People rarely escape poverty (at least in the USA).

It’s kind of the same for incels. I know it’s not a perfect analogy, but work with me on this one. I’m going to lay out the genesis of an incel. Someone who is ugly-average, odd socially, maybe also has bad acne, is short, is a minority, has a weird voice, or some other foible. They don’t have a lot of friends, get bullied, and lack acceptance. And I think people don’t realize how damaging not being accepted by others can be. Humans are social animals, and to be denied friendship, family, or romantic success can genuinely hurt someone. And yeah, there are incels who DO have friends, but are nonetheless very socially awkward with women, but romantic success is just as important as friendship, IMO. And so they get low self esteem from not having friends/not having a relationship, and this impacts their social anxiety more, and the process continues. And a huge part of a man’s success is how he does with women. If a man is not only rejected, but HUMILIATED by women, that can have a serious effect on his self esteem. And like poverty, this cycle is very hard to break out of. Make not impossible, but quite difficult.

To an extent, when normies talk about “changing your personality” I always get kind of a “pray the gay away” vibe. There are certain mental problems you can fix, and some you can’t. Can autistic people stop being autistic if they try hard? Can schizophrenics stop their mental illness if they just try hard enough? Can depressed people just “change their attitude?” Maybe, maybe not. Best case scenario it’s exceedingly difficult. Worst case scenario, it’s not possible. I’m really curious about this actually. Can someone really cure severe social anxiety and lack of social skills? I have heard of it being done, but mental illness is a very personal thing that varies from person to person. For some it may be possible, for others not so much. My basic point is that the psyche is an immensely complicated thing with many factors. It’s not fair for normies to tell us just to change our personality, especially when the vast majority of them didn’t need to do this.

So far I’ve mainly been talking about social ineptitude, but now I’ll address the other major factor that we incels face: looks. I know I said before that looks may not be the deciding factor in getting a relationship, but they are extremely important nonetheless. The only reason I don’t think that it’s the main hindrance we face is because the majority of incels seem to be around average in terms of looks. The main problem is that a lot of normies pretend like it doesn’t matter at all. Even those of us who aren’t ugly get shit for our looks. I have been teased for how I dress/how I look many times in my life. This is an obvious blow to one’s self esteem, which just makes the problem worse.


And I think from here we get the crux of the incel problem. Incels suffer from social anxiety, being bullied, social rejection, etc. often combined with some relatively unattractive traits, but are mostly somewhat physically average. This toxic combination has caused us to be socially isolated and in many cases scorned by society. This breeds anger and resentment. But our anger is also directed at the hypocrisy of modern society. This is where you come in, normies. There are so many contradictions and delusions perpetrated by normies/society that it drives us crazy. The most prominent one I mentioned before is how normies lie about what makes someone ‘attractive.’ Apparently one of the most important things is personality, so even someone who’s super ugly can find someone. How come so many assholes get gfs, then? How come plenty of nice people (genuinely nice, too, not nice guyTM) never find anyone because they are timid and ugly? If an incel says something even remotely weird or assholish on the internet normies will flock and condescendingly berate the incel saying “this is why you’re single. You just need to improve your attitude” completely ignoring that many psycopaths get laid. Richard Spencer, the fucking WHITE SUPREMACIST had girlfriends (asian ones too, for some reason). Does that mean he has a personality that’s better than a sexually frustrated man in his late 20’s who occasionally vents on the internet?

 How come normies try to downplay the importance of looks and height? They’re not as important as social status and charisma, but they are absolutely necessary for any relationship. I remember one instance: I was at my internship the other day, and two girls were talking to each other. One of them said she was hanging out the other day with a guy she thought was annoying. OK no problem, normal conversation. Then the other girl asked if he was cute and she said that he looked fine but was shorter than her. The other girl literally said “ew.” Like, WTF? Some girl literally acted disgusted because a guy was short. I hear this kind of shit constantly about other men, (and myself) and I bet I would hear it even more often if I had any friends. Normies like to pretend that height and looks aren’t important, but ugly, short men are some of the most ridiculed people in the world. Do you know how I know? Go to the sub /r/themasterrace which makes fun of white supremacists/nazis based on their looks. One of the posts had a picture of that dude that punched that chick in the Berkeley rally, and it turns out he’s short. People in the comments were lambasting him for it. This is what society thinks of short men. Normies pretend to have the high ground, saying that plenty of short guys get gfs, but then turn around and gleefully mock a short guy under the guise of him being a white nationalist. Why not just make fun of him for his other glaring flaw, which is, IDK, that he wants a fucking white ethnostate? 

The advice normies give is self serving, unhelpful, and contemptuous. Another instance of hypocrisy- normies go on /r/incels or /r/foreveralone picture threads and say that the guys all look around average, but then turn around and act like we’re neckbeards, telling us to improve our hygiene and lose weight. Average looking guys get laid, we look average, so what gives? Normies pretend like Tinder is fair. Tinder is literally the worst shit ever invented if you’re an ugly dude. I had this stupid conversation with this girl on /r/inceltears who was CONVINCED that she could tell if someone was confident by just looking at their pictures… Normies tell us things will get better and that “we’ll find someone eventually.” You guys realize that plenty of people die alone, as virgins, right? Stop trying to assuage us, please. We want the truth. Normies act like we should be happy that when we get older more women will want us. We should be happy that we are plan B? We should be happy that women will only consider to date us when they can no longer get with young, hot guys because their looks have begun to degrade, and they want to settle down with someone “stable” i.e. has money? What happens years later when it becomes obvious that she isn’t attracted to us and acts cold and distant? Normies give us conflicting advice on whether we should try as hard as we can to get laid or take a break from trying and focus on our hobbies and education. They tell us that nobody cares if you’re a virgin, ignoring the fact that something like half of women over a certain age said they wouldn’t date a virgin (sorry don’t have a source off-hand but sure I saw this somewhere) and that one of the go to insults on the internet is calling someone a virgin. It mainly boils down to the fact that normies just can’t accept that some people out there are assholes.

 We incels are definitely angry b/c of a lack of romantic/social success, but also because of hypocrisy in society. Here’s a message to all of the normies out there. If you honestly want to help, have some compassion. Incels are going through really painful struggles. Don’t tell us lies; don’t pretend like the world is a fair place.

 You being condescending and giving us the most generic advice is not helpful. Think of it like being poor. Sure, telling a poor person to work hard, learn programming, or whatever is solid advice, but it’s downright cruel to insinuate that it’s their fault. The odds were stacked against them. It’s the same for incels. We got dealt a shit hand in terms of relationships and social ability, and while the generic advice isn’t necessarily bad, it’s unhelpful to present it like “follow this advice and you’ll get laid, if you don’t, it’s your own fault.” Stop trying to act like we wanted this shit to happen.

So what now? Are incels permanently fucked? Not necessarily. Hell, I really don’t know. I’m not a psychologist or anything; I’m just some random dude on the internet. I know people in the past have overcome various mental hurdles, so I’m sure it’s possible for at least a few incels to fix their situations. I think most of the advice normies give is good for distracting yourself, but it probably won’t stop you from being incels. Getting a new jacket or becoming slightly more muscular isn’t going to undo years of mental anguish. Getting in shape is good advice period, but don’t do it with the expectation of automatically getting laid afterwards. My main advice would be to stop using /r/incels , /r/foreveralone , etc. Going on those subreddits is only going to make you more angry and bitter. Going to a therapist and going to more clubs (if you’re still in college) are both good pieces of advice. If you disagree or have something to add I would be glad to have a conversation in the comments.

6uwb50,4,2017-08-20,"After months of nagging doubt, I [20/f] broke up with my boyfriend [24/m] of 2.5 years even though I love and care for him. Did I make a mistake?",stickyplanets,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6uwb50/after_months_of_nagging_doubt_i_20f_broke_up_with/,"Hello everyone, it's been 7 months since my last post here (found on my account) where I talked about all the ""yellow flags"" in our relationship - though on paper everything was fine, we loved each other, we were generally happy, I could not stifle a tiny voice of doubt that told me that this was not the guy I wanted to marry and have kids with. He was my first love and my first everything, which is why I'm so confused now because I have no previous break ups to compare it to.

In the 7 months since my post on Reddit, I continued to feel that way. This summer, we did a mini ""long-distance"" because I flew across the country for an internship. During that time, we still talked everyday but slightly less. For the first time (I started dating my ex when I was 18), I was fully independent and felt so happy and confident. I realized that I was still young and that I enjoyed being independent, something which I had barely had time to do since I rushed into a relationship at 18. I still had so many places I wanted to see, people to meet, experiences to try, and I could not see him in that future with me. 

Yesterday, I finally caved and told him exactly how i felt (we have had similar talks like this before). I broke up with him amicably and told him that I just wanted to be on my own for a bit. We were both sad and heartbroken, and I cried a lot. But I felt relief, and as if a weight had been lifted. 

I can tell my now ex is heartbroken and it honestly makes me want to sob. I love him and I care for him and I want him to be happy. We had so many good memories, and even up to yesterday morning he was so sweet and caring. He was my best friend, someone I could be myself around and someone who made me a better person. However, this doesn't negate the fact that I often felt our emotional maturity was incompatible, and the little things we argued about continued to happen. I am ambitious while he is okay with settling for mediocrity. Part of me wonders if I could have talked to him more about these feelings (I did, many, many times) or work on our little problems (he admitted he wouldn't change about some things, but will ""try to work on it""). 

Please tell me everything is going to be okay. I always thought breakups were for huge red flags (cheating, lying, abuse). It feels wrong to break up with someone when you both love each other and care for each other. 

Thank you.

  **tl;dr**: After months of nagging doubt, I broke up with my boyfriend of 2.5 years even though I love and care for him. It feels wrong because we still care for each other and he is genuinely a good guy.. I just didn't feel 100% ""right"" with him. Did I make a mistake?"
6uwfzt,171,2017-08-20,ENOUGH WITH THE CLEVER PLANS. LET'S LAY OUT FUCKING FACTS. CHARACTER BY CHARACTER.,LosPollosHermanos018,freefolk,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/6uwfzt/enough_with_the_clever_plans_lets_lay_out_fucking/,"**And before i do so, i need to say something first. I'll just try to predict what will happen to characters in the end, based on what we saw to date, and some of foreshadowing. Take everything i said with grain of salt because i'm hardcore Jonerys kneeler/shipper and i'm not even remotely sorry about that. To all those who think this is a thread where i seek approval of their survival, as good old George would say, FUCK YOU TO THOSE GUYS. And i'll do this character by character so you can see which one you like the most. By no means is this 100% accurate because this is fucking Game of Thrones after all, anyone and everyone can die.**

Let's assume Night King is defeated, which will happen. All those theories about apocalyptic ending are just wrong, and i'll not go into why is that. Our boy Beric said that if you kill Night King all white walkers would fall, so there's that hive mind bullshit there. It may or it may not require sacrifices to defeat him. Viserion is enough for me, i cried like a bitch for a CGI flying lizard, and i don't know what'll happen if he kills someone else. So here we go:

**Arya** - If she ever gets some sort of nickname, it should be Wandering Wolf. She really is a wanderer in her core, despite psychopathic tendencies she has as of late. After all she's seen, like her father's head being chopped off, or her brother's lifeless corpse being paraded through the Twins with Grey Wind's head sewn onto his body; AND after seeing the reality that Westeros/whole world is, i can't imagine her just remaining at Winterfell for rest of her days, and i'm like 90% sure that will not happen. When fighting ends, when zombies lie lifeless again, when her list of names gets done to the last name, i imagine she'll go into some sort of journey around the world. Possibly to Essos, i don't think it will be ""west of Westeros"" because that's too fairy tale for my taste. Bitter part would be her saying goodbye to her family, maybe forever, maybe not. They can even throw in her line ""That's not me"" if someone asks her to stay. Again this is assuming she lives, which i mostly think she will, because there is so much more she could bring to the ending when she's alive.

**Bran** - This dude right here is basically Frodo of this story. He is sworn enemy to the Night King, and his whole purpose seems to be defeating him. I'm like 50/50 as the whether he lives or dies, simply because he's purpose are White Walkers and nothing more. If he dies, he is probably that sacrifice (if there is even a need for that) to defeat Night King, and he'll probably go down mindfucking him. If he lives, i'm 100% sure he'll go somewhere to live as recluse. Reason for that is because he said himself ""I can never be Lord of Winterfell, i can never be lord of anything"". And he is emotionless at this point, so there really is little chance for him to get some nice conclusion. And it saddens me to say it, because i love me some Starks.

**Cersei** - Her three children died while she was trying to stop prophecy of her three children dying. That's the moral of the story here, brothers. And that is what you all Azor Ahai/Nissa Nissa cunts should look into. ""Prophecies are a dangerous things"" and they should NOT be taken literally. Anyway, back to Cersei. In this season we get to see her pregnant again, she gets some hope back, ""Maybe prophecy isn't true after all?""...only to get miscarriage. I think that in season 8 this will break her completely, coupled with the fact that Jaime left her. She'll go mad, for real this time, or pretty close to mad. People who have nothing to lose are dangerous, and in season 8 she'll have nothing to lose, so she might even burn whole King's Landing to the ground. If she can't have the Throne, no one will. And it goes into what GRRM said about last conflict being ""human one"". Props to Lena Headey for her performance.

**Daenerys** - Oh here we are, bitch. Jonerys shipper talks about Daenerys. Well i'll try to be objective. She spent six seasons in semi-irrelevant Essos, and she finally comes to Westeros after all that shit. Her dying would be a bit unsatisfying. Also, there's pregnancy. They mentioned children a lot of times last episode, it just has to be one big fat foreshadowing. So if Jon does indeed impregnate the bitch, i think she will get the plot armor to survive. Childbirth death won't happen, people need to deal with it. You don't have a strong willed, determined female lead character and then have her die in childbirth. ""Death has to pay for life"" - it's not her death, it's Viserion's. Whether or not she'll end up as a ruler tho, that's another story. But i think she might even get to that simply because both her's and Jon's stories have been one leadership arcs.

**Jaime** - He's basically one man suicide squad at this point. He just doesn't give a fuck whether or not he dies as long as it helps something he thinks is right. True knight to the core, minus that little hiccup where he threw Bran from that tower. At the end of this season he goes to fight the Dead. He might die there, but his death will be worth it if it happens. He might even get to kill/damage Night King - KINGLSAYER. If he survives, he'll confront Cersei, and i think this scenario is much better. Either way, his happiness in the end will be little to non-existent, simply because he lost too much in this story. If he makes peace with Tyrion, we might get to see Lannister brothers together in the end. A little sweetness for him is all i want! Truly this is a brilliant character, and deeply hurt by others who labeled him as traitor through his whole life for doing the right thing.

**Jon** - This guy is BIG TIME in story. His recent hype regarding him being Aegon Targaryen is something that will be played later on, considering how he is too focused on Night King right now to care about his identity. Call me sweet summer child, but this guy suffered ENOUGH, maybe more than any other in this show. I think he and Daenerys will get nice closure in the end, and not because i'm Jonerys shipper but because logically speaking, their romance is the only sweet thing we have left in Westeros. Anything less than both of them surviving and finding some kind of peace in the end is just tragic and depressing. I'm positive on that. And even if you hate Daenerys and love Jon, you don't want Dany to die because it will deeply hurt him. Also, there is just too much foreshadowing for them being alive in the end, but i'm just too lazy to write it down now. He might even be King in the end, because there's no reason to hype him up as Aegon Targaryen. He could remain Jon Snow and it would not hurt story, and that is precisely why he has good chance to be King in the end, with Daenerys as his queen. Call it cliche, call it however you want, but this show is NOT innocent of having cliche things, so stop bitching about it. After all, IT'S FUCKING FANTASY. Yes it's darker. Yes it has more gore/violence/rape. But it's still fantasy. You have your secret princes with secret heritage which makes him rightful king, you have beautiful queens which fall in love with those princes, you have dragons, you have beautiful castles which are impossible to exist in real life, you have giants, you have ancient race of humanoid beings which want to wipe out everyone, etc. Whether or not you want to acknowledge it is your problem, but PLOT ARMOR IS STRONG WITHIN THIS ONE. And George loves him some Targs, so don't be surprised by Targaryen Restoration we might get in the end.

**Sansa** - If she doesn't die in some political intrigue orchestrated by Cersei, which i think is NOT likely, she'll probably be Lady of Winterfell, assuming Winterfell makes it through show. After being torture toy to Joffrey and rape toy to Ramsay, she's probably done with men, unless Pod the Rod shows her what a real man is. Either way, i think those speculating that she will be Queen of Seven Kingdoms are wrong, because Sansa does not want to leave Winterfell again. She left it once and look where it got her. I'm positive she'll remain there for the rest of her days, unless Pod gets her on some holiday down in Dorne. Her emotional well being will probably be fucked up in a sense. You can see Littlefinger asking her ""Why aren't you happy?"". She is truly forever changed by her experiences. THAT'S THE BITTER PART YOU BLOODTHIRSTY CUNTS. People don't need to die for you to feel sad.

**Tyrion** - I think The Pimp is legit safe. He won't be fighting in front lines, he's too smart for that. He will remain behind providing advice and drinking. After everything ends, he will probably get his ""Imp's Delight"". Peace for him right now is relative thing. He is partially responsible for near destruction of his House. He killed his father after all, and Tywin would have ensured Lannister name lives on. He watched his countrymen being burned to ashes in Fields of Fire 2.0 , so yea - he might be pretty guilt ridden in the end. I always envision scene with him walking through Casterly Rock, realizing that everyone he knew there is gone, and he remains (possibly) the last of his family. Pretty sad to me. And i think Peter Dinklage could act this out brilliantly. He might even become Hand to Jonerys in the end, who knows. Generally i think that for ending to be satisfying Arya, Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys need to be alive, because they pretty much have biggest fandom.

**Theon** - Alright, this might be my FUCK YOU to those who think Euron will kill Jon because of some stupid thing maesters said. Theon will kill Euron, most likely. His story goes in that direction in the end of this season, and that's his only goal as of now. There is a good possibility of him dying while killing Euron, so he truly becomes Yara's ""protector"". He sacrifices himself for her. Really tho, he really doesn't have much reasons to live after all he went through, so his sacrifice could be sort of redemption as he finally gets rid of ""Reek"".

As for the rest, some secondary character will probably die, just to make ending more ""bitter"". But i'm against any shock death as of now, because that's what they would be, just pure shock value, and i hate that. Look what happened to Barristan, death without purpose to story, just pure shit. That's why majority of characters i ""analyzed"" are possibly alive in the end. You don't need characters dying by thousands to get that BITTERSWEET ENDING (FUCK YOU HBO INTERNS), bittersweet is already here, it's real, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN REAL. Those who think this ending is some kind of Disney happy ending, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION. Realism this story has alone guarantees you that we are well away from full happiness even if everyone remains alive in the end.

**EDIT** And just to spice up things a bit more, i'll add something for Cersei which might be a good addition to ending. GRRM always says how brilliant the ""Scouring of Shire"" is in LotR. And that can very well happen, with her carrying that out. This story has always partially been about how humans are real ""monsters"" sometimes. The extents to which human cruelty goes is really without doubt, especially in this story. So even after they defeat white walkers, they return to their kingdoms, only to find them ravaged by half-mad/mad Cersei and Golden Company. SCOURING OF WESTEROS, BITCH! It really fits the theme of the show, or maybe that's just my opinion."

my family is in australia, and i was supposed to move there after getting my bachelors from my home country

before getting a degree from home, i met this amazing girl who i wanted to marry, we were like the ""idea"" couple, and for good reason... we were very practical, mature, and dedicated towards each other... we also both were not fans of relationships just for a relationship's sake, were conservative minded, and planned to marry each other eventually

the thing is, she was a US green card holder, and so i had to switch plans, and come to the usa if i wanted to be with her... the usa was also better for me career wise compared to australia, but she was definitely the biggest reason..... so the plan was, she would transfer and finish her undergrad there, while i finish my undergrad in my home country, and get a higher degree in the usa(i'm older obviously)

so we both came, and we come from very conservative families, so marriage was not an option then &amp; there, and since she moved to the usa with her family, seeing each other was also difficult... so we had a hard LDR, but we were happy, because we were worth the hard work and patience...... that was 2015 when we moved, it was already 2 years into our relationship, so were making things work, happily i might add

but in the last several months, she started changing, she wasn't as close as we used to be, shared less about her life, and after a bad argument, during one of her annual trips back home, was so cuddly with one of her guy friends, people actually thought we had broken up already.... this was while i was messaging her, and she would ignore them

at one point, she started to get weak for her friend... she instantly felt regret, became extremely upset and remorseful about these feelings, and after coming back to the usa, let me know... at that point, i went to NC to meet her, and worked it out.... she asked for forgiveness, i forgave her... we were normal again

during summer, she had her internship in philly... she was alone, far from her family and friends, so i managed to come from texas, and spend a heavenly week with her... i finally thought things were really going good, and convinced her to marry me next summer, when she graduates

after coming back, 3 weeks later, she tells me she changed her mind and does not want to marry for the next few years, citing marriage as a ""mental stress"", and says that she wants to experience ""freedom"" for a few years before marrying... basically, she enjoyed the freedom of being alone for work, far from friends &amp; family, and wants it more.... bear in mind, that i encouraged her to work wherever she wanted, that the marriage was so that we could visit each other whenever we wanted without inhibition, make the relationship even stronger, and start a family after a few years.... i emphasized that marriage is not a stress in any way(at least from me), but she would not listen

last week, she confessed that she had this change of mind, after going to the bar with her co-workers(we were strongly against alcohol, yes, we were that conservative)..... she drank, and kissed a co-worker, someone who she has absolutely no future with, would be berated by friends &amp; family if she actually started something with him(conservative family, co-worker is of another religion &amp; race)...... furthermore, though she said she regretted it afterwards, #1 she confessed weeks after this happened, and showed no remorse during those days, she basically kept it well hidden from me, #2 her regret means nothing, considering after kissing another guy, she decided she wants more ""freedom"" (again, which i was happy to give her), and held off on the marriage(which she agreed to previously)......... at that point, i was done, and broke it off with her

now, since i am basically alone in another country, everything that i own, my apartment, my life here, was all centered around her....... i was very dedicated, never even thought of having any thoughts of infidelity, while she was on the brink/past the brink twice.... the study i am pursuing has enormous pressure, which seems insurmountable because one big purpose of my life is gone... i am miserable now

we were 4 years and 3 months together, and i thought i met the future mother of my children..... she was an amazing person the 1st 3 years, and became an unrecognizable person during the last several months"
6uxh0u,27,2017-08-20,"I hate myself because my mom hates me, too.",alyciadawn,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6uxh0u/i_hate_myself_because_my_mom_hates_me_too/,"I cried several times while writing this post, so sorry if some of my sentences doesn't make sense.

I'm 21; the youngest and only female in my immediate family. I'm in my fourth year of college, interns at the public library, volunteers at youth programs, pays my own bills. Despite all this, I'm never going to be good enough for my mom. Ever since I started puberty at the young ol' age of eight, my mom has destroyed my self-esteem and body image. Puberty made my hips widen, breasts grow, fat settle in my thighs and hips, and my mom hated that I was no longer her perception of beauty anymore -- tall, thin, and straight.

She hates the way she looks, so in order to feel better about herself or stronger or whatever the fuck goes in her head when she talks, she points out things that she doesn't like about my face, body, personality, decisions, etc. 

These are a few of the things that she has told me since I was a child:

* ""Why don't your ankles poke out like mine? You got cankles. Gross.""
* ""You would be so much prettier if your hair was like mine,"" or ""I don't want your hair curly. You look like a negro. Go straighten your hair.""
* ""You have a widow's peak like your father. We need to shave it off.""
* ""Why do you smile with your mouth close? You look stupid. Stop it.""
* ""Look at your stomach. You look pregnant. You need to stop eating.""
* ""Stand straight. You look like a retard.""
* ""Look at your thighs! I hope you don't have thighs like your aunt. She got some ugly thighs. We need to give you plastic surgery or something.""
* ""You have the flattest nose I've ever seen. You look like a monkey.""
* ""You need to wash your face every single day. Those blackheads are disgusting. No man wants a girl like that.""
* ""The reason why you're lonely is because you're so fat. I'm never going to buy you food again.""

Among other things. She doesn't like that I have liberal views. She doesn't like that I'm quiet. She doesn't like that I'm started to speak for myself. She doesn't like that I went to school to study creative writing. She doesn't like that my friends are POC. She doesn't like when I'm happy. She doesn't like hearing about me struggling with my mental health or financial issues, because she believes they don't matter to her. ""Why would you cry about not making enough money to get a tax return?"" She said, ""Are you stupid? You don't have anything to be proud of. You don't have kids, a house, or a car. Don't expect things from the government if you're gonna be useless like this.""

I, also, think that she's a bit racist and regrets sleeping with a black man. I look like my dad and she doesn't like that. She doesn't say much now but when I was little, she would coach me on how perfect white men were. I would tell my family and teachers that I'm not allowed to date black men because they beat their wives, or Mexican men because they do the same and cheat, or Native American men because they drink too much, or Asian men because they're ugly and have small dicks, etc. I would tell them that I'm only allowed to date white men because white men are perfect and the best men in the world. I stopped repeating this sentence when I told my godmother and she pointed out how wrong that was. 

I hated my niece because of my mom, because she compared my niece's face with mine. My niece is also mixed, but has her (white) mom's features. She would brag about how pretty my niece is to everyone in our family and our family agreed. I started to hate my family because of this. My hate started to fade when she grew up and I started to notice the same treatment I used to get. It got worse now that I moved out.

I can't look at myself in the mirror because of her. I can't enjoy shopping because of her. I can't accept compliments because of her. I don't feel good in my own skin because of her. I always second guess my self and feel anxious about what other people think of me when I'm in public because of her. I want to die because I know I will never hear the end of it. I, physically, don't feel right in the body that I'm in. 

I go to therapy now. I've been diagnosed with general anxiety and major depressive disorder. We talk most about improving my self-esteem. It hurts so fucking much to be forced to listen to what she says. I wish it would all stop so I could continue working on my self. She wants me to drown in her own insecurities and I hate that it's working."

6uz5kf,0,2017-08-20,How I Overcame The Pay Wall: I Don't Care If FortNite Dies,JaiX1234,FORTnITE,https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/6uz5kf/how_i_overcame_the_pay_wall_i_dont_care_if/,"I know there are too many of these but this probably needs to be said. No one probably really cares how bad or shit this game is or how badly it needs to change to be more successful. As summer comes to an end (atleast my summer) and it becomes clear I (or many others) don't care if Fortnite dies or lives at this point so here are a few of my own opinions. But most importantly, there are countless other better games coming out that will be less of a headache and of course along with my return to College(I'm sure others too) in the fall. - (I'll talk about this)  

  

I received the standard edition as a gift and upgraded to the Ultimate edition. I sold the 4 copies to friends for $30 each and it wasn't a bad deal overall. If I took a guess, I spent a rough estimate of $250 (full cost) - $40 (free standard) - $120(sold copies) =  $90 (Math could be wrong, don't care).  

  

I am one of those F2P gamers who has the Ultimate edition and spent a large sum of $10 dollars on in-game currency. I was always that one guy who was trailing 20 power levels behind my other Pay2Win/Progress friends. I don't get to try out new schematics/heroes/sub-classes, I don't have enough EXP/EVO manuals to level anything beyond the basics (Weapons/Melee/Traps/Survivors). However, I am in Twine and have been there for a 1-2 week or so now. I have played around 600-700 hours of FortNite at this point and I'll try to sum it up in 3 paragraphs.  

  

**First**, the way I see the game? the game is pure trash but continues to still seem somewhat fun. Fortnite has one of those over the top free to play models that simply crushes everyone who doesn't pay to gamble and this could be why it's not fun. I've spent a lot of time playing F2P games in my lifetime (College student but untraditional) and this is definitely one of those... ""don't ever invest money in the cash shop."" They have the llamas and they make the gameplay boring hideous and on top of that they make sure you gain nothing in the process ..but they also make it too obvious they don't give a shit and just want you to buy the llamas.  

  

**Second**, there isn't much to this game. You're either gathering or you're building, then you defend for a few minutes... Of which you barely do any of the above if you understand the mechanics of the game. You don't build up storm defenses, you don't build glamorous forts or put deadly traps down etc. Best Farming simulator NA. This is all under the assumption that you can even find people to play with (million players????) or someone who won't leave the ""play with others"" every 2 mins. There are so many things that need work outside of just core play.  

  

**Third**, the progression and my experience(the longest point here). Honestly? in my 600-700 hours, I can't say I've earned anything towards my own progression by actually just playing the damn game. No schematics, no epics, no rares, no nothing and this is what you should get used to for gameplay progression through Twine. This includes heroes, survivors, weapons, melee, traps and anything you can think of (You will never be able to work towards these and get what you need/want). I don't have a single thing outside of the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;free quest rewards&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; that I am able to show for. Then there's the Transformation system...and I've heavily utilized, a rough estimation of about 15-20k people, a decent amount of research and also used the free keys from quest lines most of which just sit there due to the lack of material to transform.  

  

**Finally**, with all that said, there's just too much crap to say that's not worthy. There are problems and lots of it. I don't hate the game but I also don't care enough to see where it'll go. So, I'm returning to college in the fall and I've played this game over the summer like 2 full-time internships... I mean jobs... I knew once I hit that gray area where things started to slow down and items had to be a grind... I knew at this point I would never be able to commit to the amount of time the game required casually. I've made it pretty far for Twine SSD3 and the pay wall isn't progression because it's straight up selling power in the cash shop or better wording ""Schematic gear/items"".  

  

The truth is I never overcame the pay wall, merely accepted it as I played with only the items that came in the Ultimate edition. I don't expect anything from this game or the Devs nor will I ever. I simply played the game and I just kept playing because why not? I paid $90 bucks for an empty shell that consisted of senseless useless and unproductive unfun game mechanics and it's..what I paid for. For me? I fully understand that this game only buys the time for the next game on the list or when I have other things in life I want/have to do with my time because this is what gaming has become these days. I have over 400+ games on Steam and a lot of them are EA and while some have been fun some just rot there. FortNite will be one of those rotters.  

  

But I won't say don't buy it...go ahead and buy this trash tier game with a trash tier gambling cash shop, go ahead and have some fun and talk it up to something it's not. There's nothing wrong with spending a little money for some fast-entertainment. Don't buy this game if you think this is the next best thing because it's just another EA trash title.  "
6uz5yv,2,2017-08-20,Should I transfer to queens computing?,queensinterest,queensuniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/6uz5yv/should_i_transfer_to_queens_computing/,"I currently attend a Canadian university where I'm only paying around 4k a year for tuition. Ive got it cheap on living expenses with room mates. I understand that technically any computer science degree could get you jobs at big companies. Some people even get in without any. But from what I hear from my upper classmen is that my university has horrible professors and that I should try transferring. If I'm interested in research then queen's will have better opportunities to get into top cs grad schools for masters/phd. If I want a job queens has quip with 16 month internship. My school has a co op but from what I hear its mainly a ""throw a big net"" databank of companies and that its not really that impressive. My only concern is that I won't have the money for queens where housing and tuition a year will near 20k. Im out of province.
TL;DR : My university is mediocre with bad profs but I most likely can't pay to go to queens. "
6v07x1,1,2017-08-20,New to RBN,daughterofmoon,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6v07x1/new_to_rbn/,"I'm new to this subreddit, but I want to share my experience with who I perceive to be narcissistic parents. 

First of all, my step father had surgery on his back in 2010-2011, and ended up quitting his job and started to collect social securty disability from the government. He hasn't had a job since then, and my mother works to support him, me, herself, and my brother. I'm calling social security fraud because he works on cars and equipment in his garage, goes bike riding, kayaking, and four wheeler riding. If he were really hurt enough to collect social security and not work, then he shouldn't do any of those things either. 
He insists on buying so many things. He spends hours upon hours a day on eBay. He bought two brand new kayaks, $700 a piece. My mom bought him a $600 bicycle for his birthday. His had three new trucks in the past year. He has a brand new side by side ATV that my mom makes $200 payments on every month. He doesn't do anything to need an expensive computer, but in the past year has bought 2 new laptops that each cost at least $300 each. He spends money on whatever he wants.

Yet my mom says we're supposedly living pay check to paycheck. I'm in college, and work a part time job while also doing a 20 hour a week internship. I recently had to have my car fixed so it could be inspected. The parts were $160, the inspection $80. I asked if they could help me out with the cost since it was so much at once, and they said they didn't have the money. Yet, the next day, my step father went out and bought a $60 printer, and $50 worth of fishing stuff. The only time my mom has money, is when he wants something.

He relentlessly criticizes me, calls me fat, and unattractive. I'm only home long enough to sleep, eat,and get ready to leave the house, yet he constantly tells me that I never leave the house, and don't have a life. 

I'm trying to apply for grad school, and he is not supportive in the least bit. He brags to his family members that I get good grades, but turns around and yells at me for studying, and constantly says that no amount of education I get will make a difference in the job I get. 

I've been told this behavior is narcissistic, not sure though? "

If my goal is to get a MS in CS with ML/AI focus what courses can I take to help me prepare in my final year? What else can I do to improve my chances of admissions? Do CS master's programs value research/projects or internships more?"
6v0kce,39,2017-08-21,Republican and Democratic July Fundraising Reports - The Official FEC Filings.,LoneStarMike59,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/6v0kce/republican_and_democratic_july_fundraising/,"Well finally!  The DNC had released their report on Friday and the Republicans finally filed their report at 11:02 PM EST - 58 minutes before the deadline.

**[Republican July 2017 Fundraising](http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/623/201708209071107623/201708209071107623.pdf)**

- $44,707,217.51 - Beginning Cash on Hand 07/01/17
- $10,599,628.58 - Total Funds Raised in July
- $8,205,366.68 - Total Disbursements Made in July
- $47,101,479.41 - Ending Cash on Hand 07/31/17

Their cash on hand **increased** by $2,394,261.90 during the month of July.

**Year-To-Date Totals 01/01/17 through 07/31/17**

- $25,328,011.79 - Beginning Cash on Hand 01/01/17
- $85,998,439.71 - Total Funds Raised YTD
- $64,224,972.09 - Total Disbursements YTD
- $47,101,479.41 - Ending Cash on Hand 07/31/17

Their cash on hand YTD has **increased** by $21,773,467.62

The RNC has **NO** Debts or Obligations

Now let's look and see how the Democrats did.

**[Democratic July 2017 Fundraising](http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/575/201708189070466575/201708189070466575.pdf)**

- **$7,492,435.34** - Beginning Cash on Hand 07/01/2017
- **$3,826,913.49** - Total Funds Raised in July
- **$4,444,098.06** - Total Disbursements Made in July
- **$6,875,250.77** - Ending Cash on Hand 07/31/2107

So their cash on hand during the month of July **decreased** by **617,184.57**

So now lets look at the Year-to-Date data - Jan. 1 through July 31, 2017.

- **$10,507,786.02** -  Beginning Cash on Hand January 1, 2017
- $41,998,197.59 - Total Funds Raised YTD
- $45,630,732.84 - Total Amount Disbursed YTD
- **$6,875,250.77** - Ending Cash on Hand July 31, 2017.

So during the first seven months of 2017, their cash on hand has **decreased** by **$3,632,535.25**

Here's a little data on their debt and obligations.

- $4,135,425.97 - Debts owed by DNC as of 12/31/16
- $3,725,341.10 - Debts owed by DNC as of 01/31/17
- $2,794,520.90 - Debts owed by DNC as of 02/28/17
- $1,780,666.68 - Debts owed by DNC as of 03/31/17
- $2,478,884.76 - Debts owed by DNC as of 04/30/17
- $1,901,185.17 - Debts owed by DNC as of 05/31/17
- $3,285,691.55 - Debts owed by DNC as of 06/30/17
- $3,439,389.15 - Debts owed by DNC as of 07/31/17

So it looks like through March, they were doing a pretty good job of paying down their debt, but in April it went up by just under $700,000.  The only thing I can think of that happened in April was the hearing for the DNC Fraud Lawsuit case, but the judge hasn't made a decision yet.  There's also the other lawsuit for not paying the interns overtime, but I don't know when that lawsuit was filed.

Then in May, they were able to bring their debt back down by roughly $577,000, but in June it went back up by about $1,384,000.  What happened in June? Money spent on the failed Ossoff camapign?  And now in July, it's up another $150,000.


Regarding the debt owed by the DNC, $1,000.000.04 is the amount left on a $2,000.000 loan made to the DNC by Amalgamated Bank.

The rest of it is outstanding amounts to vendors which were not made in the same month they were incurred including:

- $24, 076.40 - **Alpha Telemarketing, Inc.** - for Telemarketing
- $75,000.00 - **Bully Pulpit interactive, LLC** -  for Internet Advertising
- $42501.89 - **Conversant, LLC** -  for Internet Advertising
- $100, 014.00 - **DCM** - for Telemarketing Services
- $140,828.95 - **Donor Services Group** - for Telemarketing Services
- $214,636.19 - **Gordon And Schwenkmeyer, Inc.** -  for Telemarketing Services
- $106,725.28 - **Infogroup** - for Direct Mail
- $137272.92 - **Integral Resources, Inc.** - for Direct Mai
- $459.83 - **Merkle Response Services, Inc.** -. for Postage &amp; Shipping
- $92,231.75 - **Mal Warwick Associates, Inc.** - for Direct Mail
- $17,209.50 - **New Partners Teleservices** - for Direct Mail
- $150,000.00 - **NGP VAN, Inc.** - for Data Services Subscription
- $13057.09 - **Pacific East** - for Telemarketing Services
- $40,079.32 - **Perkins Coie** - for Legal and Compliance Consulting
- $19,400.20 - **Public Interest Communications** - for Telemarketing Services
- **$1,075,870.64** - **RWT Production LLC** - for **Design/Printing**
- $45000.00 - **Targetsmart Commuication, LLC** - for Data Services Subscription
- $83,508.35 - **Telefund, Inc.** for Telemarketing Services
- $61,516.80 - **Your Voice Media** for Telemarketing Services

Obviously, the huge debt to RWT Production jumped out at me. These figures are just for the month of July:

- **$985,867.87** - Outstanding Balance Beginning This Period
- $344,895.43 - Amount Incurred This Period
- $254,892.66 - Payment This Period
- **$1,075.870.64** - Outstanding Balance at Close of This Period

The DNC seems to be going further and further into debt with this one company


Now here's another interesting little tidbit I noticed.

Every single month I've ever looked at, there have been charges incurred and payments made to the DNC's law firm Perkins Coie.

Not last month, though.  On Schedule D (page 4,137) it shows a beginning balance owed to Perkins Coie of $40,079.32.  This is most likely the monthly retainer fee ($40,000) and $79.32 of other miscellaneous charges (like postage) for a previous month.

- Outstanding Balance Beginning This Period - $40,079.32.
- Amount Incurred This Period - $0.00
- Payment This Period - $0.00
- Outstanding Balance at Close of This Period - $40,079.32

I find it odd that there are no charges at all from Perkins Coie and the balance from June (or a previous month) has still not been paid.  Is Perkins Coie still the DNC's law firm?  

Another explanation could be that Perkins Coie is now billing and being paid from a different DNC account or maybe a PAC affilliated with the DNC.  I truly don't know, but it's definitely something that jumped out at me.

6v0mdl,1,2017-08-21,"My [19 F] crush [19 M] is still hung up on his high school ex. Is there anything I can do to win him over from her, or am I better off just staying friends and finding someone else?",amarie7186,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6v0mdl/my_19_f_crush_19_m_is_still_hung_up_on_his_high/,"I'm a sophomore at a very large university and over the last year have settled into a pretty comfortable group of friends. I've really connected with one guy in particular. However, despite us having obvious chemistry and having connected with each other on a very deep level multiple times, he still seems hung up on his first girlfriend, who he dated his senior year of high school and broke up with last fall. 

He's the kind of person who I can sit up with all night talking to, and have gotten to the point where we've revealed some of our deepest secrets, fears, dreams, etc. during our late night talks. We also enjoy spending time together during the day, and like talking about casual things such as our shared interest in music. We also have a comfortable banter going on, though we seem to know when to be serious with each other. Emotionally, we are very well connected, especially considering we've only known each other for a little more than half a year. He's a truly genuine person, and as a result of me sort of sensing that, I've really opened up to him, and I was shocked the other night at how much he opened up to me as well. He made himself very emotionally vulnerable, which I suppose is a good sign that he does really care about me, even if just as a friend. 

And as I've mentioned before, we do seem to have a lot of chemistry. One of his favorite ways to tease me is to compare our hand sizes (since his are unusually large and I apparently have baby hands) and wrap his fingers over mine. He also likes to rest his elbow on my shoulder when we're next to each other, and always seems to lean towards me when we're sitting next to each other talking, or when he shows me something on his phone. He does a lot of subtle things like that, but the obvious tension that results from it is starting to drive me crazy! And out of all the girls within our group of friends, I'm the only one he actually does any of this to. 

But despite not having seen his ex all summer (since he was on campus working both an internship and taking part in research) and going to a university far away from her, he still seems to talk to her all the time, and the other night he mentioned something that ""a person who is very special to him"" said to him, and judging by the way his expression changed when he said that, I knew that it was her. And it made my heart sink. I've glanced his phone, and on his snapchat the only person higher than me on his friends list is her, and while a group of us were hanging out the other day he answered a video chat from some friends from high school, and she was in it. It's just small things like that that leave me with a sense of doubt. Maybe I'm just overreacting, but I've always had a very good way of sensing other people's relationships, and he doesn't seem to be over her. 

My question is, is this worth waiting out for a little while? While he is obviously still thinking about her, I don't see their relationship going anywhere anytime soon, realistically speaking. And he seems much more interested in her than she is in him. However, he gets very attached to people, and I'm worried that he's going to spend much of his college career pining over her, and if that's the case I'd much rather move on. And is there anything I can do to make my interest more apparent? He's said to me before that he is very bad at picking up on small nuances from other people, and usually needs things spelled out for him. I'd like to be obvious enough to make him notice, but not obvious in a way that could interfere with our friendship should things not work out romantically between us. Either way, he means a lot to me as a friend and as a person, and I don't want to lose him. 

I'm a rather patient person, and don't mind waiting a few months if we really have a chance (since she was she was his first girlfriend, and I know from experience that the first relationship is very difficult to get over, especially if they remain in contact ""as friends""), but if this seems like a lost cause, I'd rather not risk our friendship over it. 

Thank you for reading, and I'd appreciate any thoughts! 

TL;DR my college crush is hung up on his high school ex. Should I wait and see if he gets over her himself, make my interest in him more obvious, or simply just remain friends and move on?"
6v0tzb,266,2017-08-21,My brother (29m) assaulted me (25f) the other week. Now I think he's stolen *private* photos of me (also update to my other post),jakabab,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6v0tzb/my_brother_29m_assaulted_me_25f_the_other_week/,"First off, here's my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qmcww/my_brother_29m_is_on_trial_for_a_very_serious/


If you make it through this, you are in for a doozy. 


So now a quick up to speed. Shortly after I posted that, my dad came in to my room and said something incredibly cruel, incredibly passively. I had been reading your responses and a lot of you actually said I was entitled and.. you know what, you were right.

I packed my shit and I left with 66$ in my pocket and went completely no contact. I didn't mess up my stuff either. In the last month-ish, I have gotten 3 jobs, the internship I wanted, I put went back to work an old job for a week and made enough to put down security and prorated rent on a tiny little.. place. idk. it's mine. I have been so lucky to have the friends I have. I haven't had to sleep in my car once thanks to them. 

In short, I have been working my ass off. I'm totally freaked out because idk if I will be able to afford Septs rent but I'm going to try and I'm ok living without internet or electricity for awhile. I'm trying. 

So update continues up to where we are now. It's be hard. One day I stopped by my parents house when no one was home to grab my hygiene products. Someone had emptied out all the bottles and put them back in place. I'm talking like... tons. I'm really into skin care and k beauty and he dumped everything. Like, right now I have a little travel bottle of shitty soap and cheap conditioner and shampoo I've been milking for almost 2 weeks cuz I don't even have money for food so.. fucker. 

This sucked. I sent my parents a short text like, ""hey, this happened. Please don't let any of my other things get damaged."" and made a plan to actually get what few furniture things and other belongings I own asap.  


So my moms on a trip. Dads on a trip. I only have one day off work to go get my furniture and my friends have planned to help me out. I let my dad know multiple times. ""this day, this day, coming, blah blah blah"". Turns out my brother is living there now. So I didn't want any problems. I didnt want to talk to him at all. I've been tired and exhausted. I wasnt planning on being mean or hurtful, I just wanted to be left alone.


He sees me and disappears down stairs. He reappears a moment or two later saying, ""I saw my hat in the back of your car. Give it to me."" Mind you, this is a hat that has been sitting in my car for literally.. years.. He hasn't cared about this hat in years. 

I say,
 ""I'm doing something right now, please leave me alone."" Maybe it was my mistake for not dropping everything I was doing to pander to him but I just wanted to get my stuff and leave. He keeps standing there and I just brushed it off and kept packing. He then sees my car keys on my bed. He slams me into a corner, hitting my head really hard and takes my keys. And that is just beginning! 


Honestly, maybe my next few moves weren't the greatest but they illustrate the shit I've been living with well. I'm not perfect. I've had my psycho moments. I am not going to pretend to be an angel. 


My brother has hit me before. He's beaten the living shit out of me before. In fact, the lowest low point of our relationship, he held his hands around my throat and screamed how he always wanted to watch the life leave my eyes. That was at the height of his coke addiction like 5-6 years ago tho. Yeah, we all have problems.


So today he shoves me, hurts me, terrifies me and my reaction is to scream at him that I'm calling the police and he violated his bail (hes on like 100k+ bail) which is true.. but I wasnt actually gunna call the police. I pretended like I was and he got in his car and peeled out. I was just scared and wanted him away. My friends were on the way at this point.


So it gets worse. Im completely freaked. I call my mom cuz idk.. i fucking miss my mom and this is hard and I just got assaulted in the home I'd been living with for the past few years over a hat. And you know what, she threatened to call the police on me. She said it was my fault for being there and that I was trespassing. She called me a psycho bitch and said I was the problem and whatnot and if I called the cops on my brother I was dead to her. 


So que total meltdown on my end cuz I'm just now even more freaked out and like wtf.. and she starts threatening me like crazy like shes calling the cops and they are coming so I'm like yo what the fuck he hit me and he left all his drugs here and shes like well you are trespassing (I had cleared this with my dad beforehand, remember)


So then I'm like k wtf do I do... I end up calling my brother to be like hey, just dont come over until I leave.. I'll let you know when I do. IT GETS EVEN MORE WORSE! He says ""What, I'm coming over with the cops. I have scratches all over. You assaulted me. I have people who are witnesses."" 

HAHA so thats the fucking world I live in.

So NOW to today.. I had gotten the major furniture out that day but then I just dug because I couldn't really handle what was happening. I was going to sleep on a carpet for a few months but my dad reached out and said they wanted me to take the bed. Ok. Well under the bed is my big plastic box of precious things. It's my grandmas old clothes, jewelry, polaroids no one else should see.. and 2 flashdrives. They are hidden. You have to really dig through my shit to find them. One has my writing on it (I love to write) and the other.. well.. a naughty folder along with some other stuff. 

I go back today and on my bed is sitting one of my hats. Under the hats are the 2 flashdrives, under the two flashdrives are photobooth pictures of my brother and I. Que freak out.

My dad is sitting there at the table so I brought them out and straight up told him the truth. He said I was making a mountain out of a molehill and paranoid. 

Now my brother has hit me, dumped out hygiene products, and now.. sent me a message. 

So I'm like wtf. I call my mom to talk to her cuz I'm stupid and I keep thinking that protective parent thing will happen. I'm borderline and got out of a really abusive relationship this year(like think boyfriend who doesn't listen when girl says no then gets mad at her for crying), I just like want to feel loved a bit? you know? I feel alone and I've struggled with self harm and suicide issues this year a lot cuz of all this shit. Surprisingly, while I've cried and been hurt so bad, I haven't done any of that for like a few months now. 

So like... Idk honestly.. Idk if he really took the pictures or if he was just sending me a message. I don't know what to do. My parents have both said that by leaving i've ""broken their hearts"" and it was vindictive and they have blamed me for EVERYTHING and said stop playing the victim. Honestly, I don't wanna play the victim, sorry if it seems like I am. I just wanted my parents love and stuff.

What do I do? What if I am blowing this out of proportion? I can't call the cops. That isn't an option. Also I haven't been able to get in touch with my therapist so I don't have anyone to talk to.


And also, if anyone has any tips on adulting. Idk what the fuck I'm doing. I'm in this apartment with like... 200 books and a bed and nothing else. I can roll with it. I just don't know what the most important thing to start with is. Electricity I guess and then internet? Idk what kinds of things I need to watch out for or be worried about. Any life lessons you guys got, throw them my way. 

  **tl;dr**: Over the last week my brother has damaged my belongings, physically harmed me, now he left my secret flashdrive of private photos that I had hidden on my bed under a hat and on top of pictures of us.... Not sure if he took the picture or if this is a sick message. What to do? "

We have done a bunch, and people gave us great feedbacks. 

We would like to extend to SCU computer science 3rd or 4th year students, who are expecting to look for intern jobs or full time job but don't know how to get started. We have four available spots.

The service will be totally free, and will be done at the library or some on campus building. We would like to see if this pilot program is meaningful/helpful or not. 

Anyone could let us know where can we reach some scu students?

When I try to update the sdk, the maven metadata.xml files will be updated (checked the timestamps using ls -l), however there won't ever be a new sdk version in the version specified by the gradle script. The previous android dev said that it worked for him, and the gradle script says that the build was successful; however, there is no updated sdk in the .m2 directory. It seems strange that there wouldn't be a new sdk even though the maven-metadata files are being updated. I was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience?"

[Rant]",fulgencia,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6v23nd/i_feel_weak_depressed_and_close_to_giving_up_rant/,"My whole life, I've had a father that genuinely shows zero positive emotion towards me or my brother, just like he was never shown any love from his father before him. Is that an excuse to be such a miserable asshole? No.

Nobody forced my father to beat up my mother every other day and to put his hands on her throat whenever he felt like his food wasn't warm enough when he got home from work. No one told him to cheat on my mother with countless women and make sure she felt like she and her children were worthless without him. Or did anybody coerce him into leaving our family behind for months at a time and refusing to pay for the bills around the house, leaving us without electricity and water, basic human needs for his two children? 

Growing up, this monster told me how worthless I am because I am a girl. I could never be smart, even though I had straight A's growing up. I could never be beautiful ""because I looked too much like my fat mother."" My virginity belonged to him because he was the head of the house and I was automatically meant to be a whore, just like my cousins to got pregnant at a young age. He felt no love for me and he made it especially clear when he started to beat me up for small mistakes I made, like accidentally hanging up on him. I was just an outlet for his rage.

Was it because I'm a girl, though? No... My brother has been on the receiving end of this monster's rage, and he's the only male. My brother's personality is too much like my ""stupid mother's,"" so obviously he can't stand to even look at him. My brother is too rebellious and too carefree, for this my father made sure that my brother grew up thinking he's worthless and un-funny. In reality, my brother is one of the best people I've ever met. He has a heart of gold, he is handsome, he is smart, and he is charismatic. My father cannot stand to see him be great and loves to put him down... Little does he know my brother only cares for my opinion and a few others' ever since he realized what kind of creature donated its sperm for our births. 

This man ended up impregnating one of the women he cheated with. Out came my sister, amidst a disgusting divorce, one that I am glad finally happened. Needless to say, the woman he is with now is vile and disgusting, but that is a whole other post... My sister, however, is a shining light of joy for me. The only problem is, to see her, I have to get through my father and her mother. I hope she understands one day that I simply cannot continue to subject myself to their abuse. 

I've attempted to commit suicide twice, already. I suffer from major depressive disorder and from severe anxiety. I have made countless mistakes in my personal life and in my relationships. I don't care about my health as much as I should. I cannot trust anyone without having my doubts. I look in the mirror and see a worthless sack of shit looking back at me. I hate myself, and I am positive it all comes back to him, my sperm donor. 

However, I'm a senior in college. I'm about to be a Computer Engineer, graduating from a top school. Three internships later, I have my full-time job offer from a big company. I've stopped self-harming. I have an amazing group of friends that would do anything for me. I met the love of my life at an early age and have been going strong for almost three years. I grew a fucking spine and I have built myself around it, despite every obstacle he purposely set for me. I am going to let out the biggest ""FUCK YOU"" once I finally get my diploma and leave you behind forever. 

I survived you. I will make sure my little brother survives WITHOUT you. I will take him under my wing once I am financially able to. Neither of your older children give a fuck about you and, deep down, you know that and it bothers you that you have lost control. You are nothing. You are worthless. You are an ugly monster. You have no love in your life. You will grow old knowing you fucked up. And you know what? We honestly could care less."

The summer had recently ended and with it all the interns have returned to their college life away from the real world. This is a story about our electrical engineering intern who overall was a decent intern but made one huge mistake. 

His project was to create a board and develop the software to go along with it. Now I don't know much about hardware but he had plenty of help in that department. At the end of the summer his project turns out to be one of the better ones from the interns. He is told to save his semantics and code to a shared folder. He proceeds to take screen shots of all his code and upload that to the folder. 22 images in total of his python code! The best part is he is obtaining a minor in computer science!!

The worst part is his laptop is sent away where it might of already been formatted effectively losing 60% of his project for the summer.

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

I only have 5 internship experiences under my belt with 5 months of full time towards my current position as a software developer.

----------

I am attempting to pursue an opportunity with greater pay, better opportunity, at a tech company. Although, the pay is not the biggest motivator. 

Why I want to leave? One of the reasons is my clients use outdated softwares for development, my team lead has a bit of attitude with me but not others, lack of challenge (our best project was no longer being funded by our client) and was replaced with another mediocre garbage work. I feel that I am not learning anything. 

The current company that i work for, has a big name in the industry. 

Only concern is that people continue to warn me not to take up this opportunity because risks there are too high. Take something thats laid back ( like my current position) because unemployment is a scary period to get out of. 

So my question: 

**How long should one stay for a company to avoid being a job hopper?**  Some have even told me that its OK for someone who just started their career. While some have told 2 or more years but I am not sure."

*Deep breath*

I have seen, in my fair share of time that i was here, a lot of posts with word bittersweet. Very few of those posts, and i mean like 15-20%, have managed to bring that EMOTIONAL CONTEXT to ending of this show. Now what i mean here, is that their idea of sadness rests only, and exclusively, on deaths of our beloved character. Now there are a lot of things for which you can be sad - break up, losing a job, parting with good friends who are going abroad to work, etc. Yea yea i know, i'm sweet summer child, SOMEONE NEEDS TO FOOKIN' DIE, blah blah. I bet your ass someone's gonna die. How about Night King? He's going to die! How about Cersei? Euron? Not satisfied? Alright, you have like 25 characters right now. Which ones are going to affect end game the most after this all shit ends? Gilly? Grey Worm? I don't think they had enough screentime for me to at least care what happens to them in the end.

Now JONERYS on other hand (oh boy, Jonerys shipper talks about Jonerys), they have fucking reasons to stay alive. I know it would be ""poetic"" to some for Daenerys to die in childbirth. With all due respect to you guys, that's fucking bs. After seeing her in battlefield with 100 arrows pointed at her, or being surrounded by guys in gold masks in fighting pits, SHE FUCKING DIES IN CHILDBIRTH? Are you even serious, if not to yourself then to this story? A woman portrayed as fucking conqueror and shit dies in childbirth? Do you know what shitstorm would follow after that fiasco? And that's not bittersweet at all, that's sad. Speaking from Jon's perspective it's even more sad. Dude already lost Ygritte, Rickon, Robb, Ned, BENJEN (Now his watch is ended!), and dozens more brothers of the Night's Watch he was close too. Imagine him after Dany supposedly dies. Dude would be SUICIDAL.

As for Jon himself, yea he could die heroically fighting The Night King, but i think he won't. Reasons for that are his upcoming hype as Aegon Targaryen, or the fact that he died once - seems a bit of overkill to me, or the fact that if this motherfucker dies, Dany is sad. Just like Jon would be if she died. Now again just like Jon she lost some people too like Drogo, Barristan (such a stupid conclusion to character), that maiden who repeats ""It is known"" like there's no tomorrow, our boy Viserion. She didn't even have family to begin with besides one big cowardly molester she called brother. She finally finds our boy Jon and his magic pecker, and he dies? Sad to me.

So bittersweet, good folks, usually means positive outcome with some bad emotions. I guess if you played Witcher 3, there's one ending in which two main guys say goodbye because one girl called Ciri is leaving to becomes empress, so she has to leave our protagonist behind and say goodbye. Brings tears to me even now. Now that's what i would call bittersweet. Frodo leaving Middle-Earth is bittersweet. Look at all those little hobbits crying. For this story bittersweet could mean many things like ravaged lands, emotionally disturbed characters, characters saying goodbye to their families because they just can't have peace anymore. Even the fact that Game of Thrones ended would be bittersweet enough for me, i followed that should for years, and now it's gone.

People are overthinking that whole bittersweet concept. It really is something happy, but there are little things in there which reduce you to tears. Look at our boy Viserion, i cried like little kid. And there could certainly be some deaths that make you sad like Jorah, Tormund, Davos, Brienne, The Hound, Bronn, Theon, Jaime and many more. I ofc hope none of them die. But really Jon and Daenerys have the most potential for ending of this show, simply because they are strong rulers in their own right. If you don't like happy endings, that's ok, and you won't get fully happy ending here, not after everything that happened. Shout out to Ramsay Bolton and his quote. Thanks, but no thanks. People are overusing that.

So lean back in your chairs, and enjoy Targaryen Restoration! Fire and Blood!

**P.S.** Don't talk about democracy coming to Westeros, i don't like that. This ain't USA. It's goddamn Westeros. It's full of farmers and common people who don't know how to react properly to fucking snow, let alone being granted a position to choose who's going to lead them. And that's not sweet part of the ending. We care about characters we spent 8 years with, not commoners who were throwing food while they were rioting for being hungry."

I had been asked to deliver you some coffee to your dressing room after you finished up. i was so nervous but so excited as i knocked on your door holding coffee for one of the most sexually attractive men on the planet....

That is the basic set up, but feel free to add to it in anyway, we can flesh out the characters more if you like. There are so many way we can do it just let me at your big famous cock!

I wish I didn't.,waytooselfaware,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/6v7mm7/i_hate_pharmacy_i_wish_i_didnt/,"This is rant post that I want to get off my chest that will probably end up being downvoted to oblivion due to its overly edgy nature thus the throwaway account. This could just as easily be posted in /r/depression but I’ll post this here because maybe someone else in this small world (as every pharmacist reiterates) might relate or could relate at some time in the past. 

You could say I'm in the middle of an existential void right now. I'm close to finishing pharmacy school, only a few rotations away in fact. But I'm taking time off after failing two rotations, and I'm in a depressive rut knowing that the rest of my class is already well on their way to getting their licenses. But the worst part is that I can’t seem to feel personally involved in pharmacy. I only went into pharmacy school because I didn’t know what to do even one gap year following my undergrad bio degree. At one point I was inspired to become a doctor but medical school seemed a soul-sucking abyss and pharmacy school the easier path, especially as my older sister was also just finishing up pharmacy school at the time. 

The problem is a multilayered one. From the surface it appears as a lack of confidence that shows and what could be called fraud syndrome. I never went into academic probation and passed all my classes just fine. Yet I don’t feel like I really belong. Most of the time I feel like I got passed along as a result of grade inflation. This feeling mostly stems from the fact that I barely invested any time into studying. I always got along just fine studying a whole classes’ worth of material the night before an exam. This applied throughout all my educational years but this total lack of good study habits is no way to actually remember anything (the curse of intelligence as others have put it). And this behavior stems from me not really giving much of a shit for pharmacy in the first place, always waking up and feeling like lecture/rotation was a total waste of time. All I could ever think about was how much time was left until I could go back home. 

On top of all this is a lack of internship experience (which I recognize is my fault) which I feel I can’t do anything about anymore this late in the game. I figure that makes me unhireable which makes me feel like giving up more. Fortune-telling distorted thinking, amirite? Yes, I’m familiar with CBT distorted thoughts as a result of self-help &amp; therapy but that doesn’t change the fact that I don’t give a shit about pharmacy which I think is the root of all this. The problem with this is that I feel like I’m locked in. I have 6 digit debt like most everyone else and I’m obligated to sell my life away to pharmacy whether I like it or not. I feel trapped on Mr. Bones’ Wild Ride and I can’t get off. 

I wish I could be more interested in pharmacy, but even when I do something that is supposed to be substantive (renal adjustments, cleaning up polypharmacy messes, etc.), I just can’t feel good about it because it only takes one mistake to bring it all down (but you fuck one sheep, amirite?). Yeah, I get that pharmacy is for perfectionists, I get that. It’s more than just “discounting the positive”, another CBT thought distortion, but holy fucking shit, every other preceptor seems to fall into the “overgeneralization” trap. You make one fuck up, and for the rest of the rotation, they don’t trust you to do anything else. It’s made me feel like a total POS time and time again, and again, I want to get off this ride. My attempt to get off 2 months ago was successfully interrupted by a visit to the ICU, for better or worse I still do not know. 

I lack ambition and conviction. I have neither the motivation of one seeking to achieve something great nor that of one seeking to escape poverty. I’m a fucking spoiled brat that can spend all day at home being a NEET with no lack of unproductive things to keep me preoccupied and content on a day-to-day basis. I recognize the need to bust my ass and do something productive, but without any passion, that need carries no fuel to act upon. Other opportunities appear closed off, moreso in a time where it takes a debt-inducing college degree just to be a janitor. For I could go on and on about the generational differences about how once jobs literally grew on trees for even the most pitiful of high school dropouts, but there’s enough of that over at /r/latestagecapitalism. 

I'm already aware that most people hate their jobs. Half of those people go as far as to think their job as useless. I’m no exception and this is nothing new. I wish I could geass or hypnotize myself into suddenly liking my chosen profession, but I know it doesn’t work that way. I just wish I didn’t have to wake up every day bitter and loathsome. "

I'm currently living in Southern California and as many of you know, to obtain your CPA degree you need either a masters degree or equivalent units.

So a couple years before finishing my bachelors degree I got a job as a staff accountant at a corporation.

I currently still work there, and I'm obtaining my masters degree right now. However, there's no CPA where I work so I'm not fulfilling the hours requirement.

I'm kind of confused on how recruiting works, because for a lot of firms you need to have an internship with them first, but I'm not able to do an internship because I have to pay my rent and I can't just quit my job.

I'm not entirely sure what to do yet.

If I go into public accounting at a firm, will I be able to get a direct hire job? Or do I pretty much have to do an internship of some sort?

If I go into government is it hard to get a job if you don't have a CPA license yet? And if I do work there will it fulfill the hours needed for the CPA license work hours requirement?

If I go into a corporation, that's probably the easiest route for me because I can easily find a company that has a CPA that works there, and working for a corporation is what I most want to do (other than getting a government job) but I don't want to screw myself by never getting that public accounting experience.

What are your thoughts? I feel so lost on what my next move should be and I have so many questions.

I feel like a lot of my peers are just doing their internships, finishing school, and then getting jobs... but I really can't afford to do an internship and not have a job lined up. Also, I can't really afford to get paid internship wages either (if the internships are even paid). "

As an avid fan of *Pillars of the Earth*, re-reading about Henry's death and the bloody Anarchy that followed was entertaining, but I didn't see anything about a solar eclipse in the article. All it mentioned was the story about the lampreys and the fact that Henry died on December 1st, 1135. I then went to NASA's website to see if they had anything about it and it turns out they do. On the [Eclipse Misconceptions](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/eclipse-misconceptions) page is this short blurb about the belief that solar eclipses are bad omens 

&gt; Total solar eclipses are not often recorded in the historical record, but they do tend to be recorded when they coincide with other historical events. For example in 763 B.C., early Assyrian records mention an eclipse in the same passage as an insurrection in the city of Ashur, now known as Qal'at Sherqat in Iraq, suggesting that the ancient people linked the two in their minds. **Or when King Henry I of England, the son of William the Conqueror, died in A.D. 1133, the event coincided with a total solar eclipse.** With a little work you can also find numerous cases when something good happened!

Spotted the problem yet? NASA says Henry's death 'coincided' with a total solar eclipse in 1133, but he didn't die until 1135. Now I was puzzled, somebody has to be wrong here unless Henry died twice. First I verified the date of Henry's death with the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/henry_i_king.shtml) and [Encyclopedia Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-I-king-of-England) just to make sure I wasn't going off bad information. Then I considered maybe a NASA intern just made a typo, putting **1133** instead of **1135**, but that left the question of how such a story could start in the first place. I needed to know if an eclipse actually did coincide with Henry's death, so I went back to NASA for more answers.

Several links sent me back to the same 2017eclipse page they had set up, which didn't contain historical eclipse maps. Finally, I found a site called Hermit Eclipse, which contains an easy to search a database of eclipses going back all the way to 2000 BCE. The site pulls all its data from NASA as far as I can tell, including the maps of the paths of the eclipses. After narrowing into the [1120-1141](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/lists/solcat/1121) period, I saw that yes, in fact, there was a total solar eclipse in [1135](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/eclipse/1135_07_12), but there was also one in [1133](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/eclipse/1133_08_02). Problem is, BOTH are on the wrong date!!! And, if you look at the maps, you can see that while the 1133 eclipse is perfectly centered on Northern Europe, the 1135 eclipse was only visible to some penguins and kiwis in the South Pacific. 

So we arrive back at the question of who is right. Either we have an extra 2 years and 5 months in Henry's life, or NASA saw something I didn't see. One possibility that I think may explain this error is a  [January 5th, 1136](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/eclipse/1136_01_05) that was visible in Europe, but this certainly isn't a **""total solar eclipse""** as claimed by NASA. 

I emailed a shorter version of this to NASA, and will update if I hear back from them. 

A more entertaining possibility is that Henry died in 1133, but was raised from death by the power of the eclipse, only to succumb to the lampreys in 1135, but I think we can discount this possibility. Everyone knows only the Night King can raise the dead, the solar eclipse was just how the Ogdru Jahad planned to enter our world."
6v92zf,6,2017-08-22,I'm never going to experience romance again in my life,Super_Sand_Lesbian_1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6v92zf/im_never_going_to_experience_romance_again_in_my/,"TL;DR: A lack of romance in my life is giving me a crippling feeling of loneliness and depression.

I'm a 21 year old male, and it's been almost 2 years since my break up with my first and only ever girlfriend. Ever since then, it's been an emotional rollercoaster of how I've felt about the breakup and how I've felt with moving on. 

I have had a single (failed) date since then, and just a week ago I had an opportunity for a one night stand with a Tinder match, only to be ghosted twice by the same person. 

I have been struggling with my idea of self worth in all areas of life, but even when I succeed at anything besides romance, it feels worthless because I don't have anyone to share it with/impress with to make the achievement feel real or concrete. I got a cool internship this past summer, I'm doing well in school, I play electric bass and write music, and I'm in the best shape of my life and am only continuing to improve. But it's all pointless. 

I feel so lonely, and I keep going back and forth between wether I want a real relationship again or to just get my dick wet. I want both a friend and companion that I can spend time and experiences with, but I also need to release all of this pent up sexual tension. 

Through unwanted hearsay and unfortunate circumstances I know that my ex has already been with multiple people in both manners, which has only filled with me with anger, jealousy, and sadness. I don't like who my ex is as a person anymore and I'm better off without her, but I can't help but feel inferior/inadequate because two years later I have had next to nothing resembling what she has had.

I don't know how to talk to women, I hate going to bars, parties to a lesser extent, I'm a dork who is obsessed with Dragon Ball and Pokémon, and I am starting to just get more depressed when I drink now rather than feeling happy, so I can't even rely on alcohol as a crutch. 

I don't know what I'm missing. I put so much effort into improving myself every day, and yet nothing about me is attractive to anyone else enough to give me a chance. Do I just need to put myself out there more? Go harder on my exercise and dieting? Fix my wardrobe? Find just the right amount to drink before going out? I don't have an answer and I'm not sure if I ever will.

My father told me the story about how me met my mom and how we are very similar. It involved her being interested enough in him that she approached him and they started dating. I often feel like that is the only possibility for me as well, because all of this romance nonsense is too obtuse for me.

6vau7r,2,2017-08-22,Depths of the Sea,laseroy89,N_attempts_to_write,https://www.reddit.com/r/N_attempts_to_write/comments/6vau7r/depths_of_the_sea/,"[TT] [We should not have encroached upon the ocean depths. Now it is too late.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6unrxi/tt_we_should_not_have_encroached_upon_the_ocean/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit)

I peered out of the porthole as the sub descended rapidly into the depths. Lights flashed past my eyes as our sub moved past the undersea towers.

Just a few years ago, colonising the depths of the ocean was unthinkable. Yes, people live in airship residences in the sky, and had floating cities on the surfaces of seas and rivers, but under the sea? Man, there were so many skeptics at that time, saying how the overwhelming water pressure will make it extremely difficult to even build there, and will crush any structures before they even take shape. Or how aquatic life will wreak havoc on the exterior of any buildings, causing them to lose their structural integrity over time. Or a bunch of other trivial concerns. 

And look where we are now. In a submersible moving past the enormous water city of Poseidon, named after the great god. I was the head architect, and I was proud of my creation; after all, it was completed in a record-breaking time of five years. Oh, how I loved the looks on my rivals when I invited them to the opening ceremony of the Poseidon Town Hall. 

Today, we were heading to the Anma Temporary Deep-Sea Research Lab, to meet with my friend, the legendary oceanographer Prof Anma Tikali, who was my main advisor, and inspiration, behind Poseidon and a few other projects. He set up the lab on the seafloor roughly 4000 metres below sea level, about the end of the Bathypelagic Zone, to study whether it was feasible to expand human civilisation to that depth. That was what drew me to Prof Anma in the first place - he was farsighted, and always thought about the future. He knew that the population of the world was growing quickly, and we needed to house those people. Fast. I swear, Prof Anma is saving the world, one underwater city at a time. 

But he didn’t look a little bit optimistic at all, when I stepped past the submarine airlock and went straight to him with a huge smile on my face. I gave him a warm, welcoming hug, a favour which he returned, but without any change in his forlorn expression.

“What’s wrong, Anma? How’s your research?”

“Not going good, I’m afraid.”

“Oh come on, I never knew you as a quitter. You’ll always have a breakthrough. Just need to throw more brain juice and enthusiastic interns at the problem and voila! one brilliant idea that will save the world.” I walked to his worktable, and turned back to see that he gave no indication of appreciating my attempt at lightening up his mood. 

“So, have you found a way we can build in the much greater water pressure here? I assume that we will be using far more advanced suits and machines then we used at Poseidon.” I looked out at the porthole above his workdesk. There was not a single ray of light out there - just pitch black. It was going to change. I was going to change that. We - Prof Anma and I - were going to change that.

“No, it’s….” He trailed off. 

“It’s okay, I won’t rush your research. Quality results cannot be produced from rushed work. Of course, don’t forget we have to find a way to combat the intense cold at this depth. Centralised heating systems, with pipes that extend all the way to the surface? Or pipes that extended deep down to seek heat from hydrothermal vents? Now those are ideas…..” I looked back at Anma with an expectant look. 

“That’s the thing. The hydrothermal vents. They -”

“Ah, *that’s* the thing! Some answers. At last.”

“Listen to me. DON’T INTERRUPT.” Anma sounded hurt - no, more than that. He sounded serious, and worried. I wiped the smile off my face. 

“The hydrothermal vents, they aren’t acting normal. They used to be just spewing out overheated water, and building up thanks to constant deposit of minerals, but ever since we drilled into one of them….they are still doing that, but at a much, much faster rate. Like, forty times faster.”

I continued staring at him. There was more to his answer. 

“I don’t know how to phrase this, but….they are *opening* up. Cracks were observed splitting from the base, and growing all over the seafloor. Something’s happening, and I don’t like it one bit, Chad.” Anma was really worried this time round. 

As if on cue, a rumble started. 

It sounded distant, but all of us in the room felt inclined to look out of the portholes. 

“Whenever the cracks grow, they make this noise. It’ll stop after a while.” I could tell Anma wasn’t really sure about his answer.

The noise didn’t stop. Instead, it grew louder, until it became more of a groan. Subconsciously, we all held onto the walls of the lab. Before long, the walls started to tremble.

I pressed my face to the porthole.

I promised that I would be the one to light up the depths. It seemed that I was wrong. 

There was a light out there. A faint one, but getting brighter nonetheless. It seemed to be….the shape of a large fish. A fish that seemed like the size of a blue whale, and growing in size by the second. There was also a huge cloud of dust, a murky black cloud that surrounded the base of….the creature. There was no doubt that was a creature, a living, swimming one that is far larger than any known to science.

I've heard so much about monsters in the deep. I always thought that *we* humans were the monsters, with our advanced technology and the bravery to explore every frontier. But as I looked at the *thing*, which by now had filled up the entire porthole and *was still growing*, it was unnatural for me to suddenly feel so *small*, so fearful of what we thought we understood, of what we thought we could conquer.

I could make out more details of the creature. Large scales the size of cars. Long, jagged scars the width of small streams like the ones back home, which I didn't think I would ever see again.

It was more of a roar at this point in time. All of us had started to stuff our fingers into our ears. 

I looked at the mock-up of Poseidon, sitting so innocently at the entrance to the lab. 

We should not have encroached upon the ocean depths. Now it is too late.

I'm currently faced with a difficult decision that has caused me a lot of internal turmoil.  I feel like the title is already long but there's just so much so I will try to make a pros and cons list to make things easier.  Thank you in advance to everyone who responds.  I'm kind of overwhelmed so any input or advice helps.

---
Background Information:

* I am currently in New England due to health reasons.
* I need my car with me no matter where I go.

Choice A:  Move back to California and go back to school there.

* Pros:
 * The area is better for my field, and the school is more well-known.
 * I love living in California.
 * I love the school.
* Cons:
 * I will have to be there within the month and to do that I will need to set up a housing situation from here, and drive 3k miles to get back there.
 * I will have to leave my SO in New England and be long distance. (We have no relationship problems, but he is not ready to move there.  He means a lot to me.)

Choice B: Stay in New England and transfer to a school here.

* Pros:  
 * The school I will try to go to here is about as prestigious in my field as the school in CA according to rankings.
 * I am currently in a great internship that could really help me in my field and can possibly advance in it if I stay.
 * I will get to stay with my SO.
* Cons:
 * I hate living in New England.  I miss California so much.
 * My family is moving out of the area so I will need to still find housing (although it would be easier to handle than the housing situation in California).
 * If I stay here I will probably really disappoint my family.

Anyone mind indulging my questions here?",remphos,environmental_science,https://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/6vcf4f/im_being_given_the_option_of_getting_a_masters/,"So, I'm returning to school at the age of 24, and basically needing to start from the beginning to get this degree (which is like a robust ES degree that my college is pretty well respected for). 

Initially not knowing what I will do with it, I thought at least that there are a large amount of GIS analyst jobs around me, and generally things like the forestry or fishery or other similar things usually tend have odd positions waiting to be filled.

Now that I'm here I'm being offered a way to get my Masters in 5 years, and how it works is I will basically take the normal classes the first 3 years, in year 4 I will be put right into Masters level courses with grad students, and in year 5 I will do some kind of real world impact project as my Masters project.   

I still pay about the same tuition for year 5 as I do for the undergrad years. But save time and money by getting it done quickly.

I guess I just want to ask, do you think this is alright from the perspective of gaining employment later on. For example, will an organization look at it funny to have a Masters Degree with no work experience aside from an internship here or there? (which I do plan to do)

The upside of this route is that I will get to do my own basically passion project with a real world impact, which I think is really cool, and my university gives you a lot of assistance and resources to help you accomplish this (students have done sustainability projects all over the world, India, Kenya, Mexico, and at home, etc etc).  

Once I move on from this 5 year route though, and paying this money back will become the big issue, do you think this might set me up in a good place to have just gone straight for the Masters?

It was passionate. It lasted 3 years with a significant drop from 2 years and a half when he started to show less love towards me. We had a difficult relationship as we lived our first 6 months really closed to each others (same school, same area) and the rest was a distance relationship (from 500 to 10000km apart as I moved frequently for studies and internships). A bit before our 3 years anniversary I saw there was a problem and I had to force him to say what was wrong. He left me and I blamed myself for the all thing (still thinking everything is my fault and that could have done something). The distance through the relationship made me unbearable and he really had the courage to be there for me and to encourage me until he couldn't bear it anymore.
I can understand the reasons why it ended : distance, my mood swings, the fact that he didn't love me enough to continue. 

BUT, it has been 8 months since the break up and we are still talking to each others every single damn day by text and by phone calls, still with my mood wings as I cannot understand what we are, why we are doing this and where we are going. I know, it was the thing not to do at all !
I am still deeply in love. He promised to be there for me forever but how could it work ? Still he says he doesn't love me enough, that he doesn't want to reflect on his feelings because it feels good to be single. 
And I am here waiting. For what ? Idk. However I have the feeling that there is still something about love between us. We manage to see each other every 2 months and we do kiss and have sex. Sometimes I am OK with it, everything is super fine : we laugh, we joke. I know he is gonna be there for me even though he shouldn't be the person but sometimes I cannot bear it, I think about ending all contacts but how could I live without any news from him? I sometimes have suicidal thoughts. I talked to him about it: at first he was really worried and through time he ended up saying I cannot be serious.

Since the break-up, we've seen other people but it was not like us. Really, we say everything to each other, like best friends, but we are not.
I deeply hope that we will go back together but I am afraid I am being stupid. And it really hurts. Our relationship is unhealthy but I still think we can do something.

Next week we both will do exchange studies, him in Taiwan, me in Hong Kong and we planned to travel together for some days.

Complicated story, I don't know how to explain all the details. Can you help me ? Do you have any advice to help us/me going through this ? Did you go through the same thing ?

TL;DR: After a 3-year relationship, he broke up with me but we are still in another kind of relationship, like best friends caring about each others a lot, and I don't how to deal with it. Should I end everything ?

https://youtu.be/M7iv8Ya7cZ0

**Some details**

--I used deep learning to accomplish these results. Both the architecture of the network and my training method are very customized to Overwatch. 

--I had 168000 samples to train from!

--It was tricky to get it to estimate your SR per hero. It's approximating your SR as though you were a one-trick at that hero. 

--While I did all the code, I had a designer help me with the webpage! 

**Why did I do this?**



It's a fun proof of concept that -- to some extent -- can predict your skill rating from your in-game statistics.

But more than anything, I'm aiming to get an internship at Blizzard. Consider this part of a cover letter :) 

My impression is that game designers usually run away from machine learning, because you can never tell exactly what the underlying model is doing, and you want your user experience to be consistent. This is a reasonable critique for most situations! However, I think there are several ways a learning algorithm could be placed along a normal well-designed algorithm.

Potential examples include:

**Matchmaking:** Matchmaking seems to work pretty well in Overwatch. However, a common community complaint is that games can be one-sided too often. One of the suspected reasons is that you guys don't want to force a meta onto overwatch, and always put 2dps, with 2 heal, with 2 tanks. Where the learning algorithm would come in here is to be used as a sort of ""outlier"" detection. If my model suggests that the pairing you make gives one side a very large advantage, say &gt;75%, you try to make a different match. This way only in extreme cases does the algorithm kick in, which shouldn't force a particular meta.

**Adjusting SR gain, switching heroes:** Another community complaint I've seen floating around is the idea that switching to characters you play less will cause you to lose SR, even though by switching you're improving your teams chance of winning. It's a frustrating idea because it feels like you're being punished for helping your team! With a large database of games and heroes played, I think it would do-able to offset that sort of loss. I could use my learning algorithms to adjust the chance of winning based on the current heroes chosen and their ability, and if one player drastically increases the odds of winning by switching, the adjusted SR can be less punishing to that player. To make sure we only address these sorts of situations, it might be useful threshold some values

**Adjusting SR gain, padding stats:** Similar to the idea above, I can make a model that gives incentives behaviors that lead to win. So rather than just ""more is better"" all the time, my model would be more discriminatory than that. This sort of system might have prevented the infamous rez problem (not sure this actually existed, but the community seemed to think so!) with Mercy where people could abuse getting lots of 5-man rezzes would give them more SR. This sort of system may be able to automatically label that behavior as bad if it leads to a lower estimate win%.   As the designer, you could decide to use my model to set thresholds for certain stats, use my outputs to adjust your SR gain or loss, or perhaps a combination of the two, or something I just haven't thought of yet!

**Evaluating group strength:** The community seems to have a lot of different suspicions on what the optimal group size is. The most consistent complaint I've seen is that queueing with groups is always harder. Using a machine learning algorithm alongside your current design could more accurately assess their strength. I'd go into more detail here (I'm thinking of a model that estimates win% as opposed to adjusted SR, and combining that statistic with yours) but I don't know enough about your underlying system to really know exactly I could help.


Although I am not a trained game designer, I am certainly open to learning. I'm a Ph.D. student specializing in artificial intelligence and this particular project uses deep learning, but I'm certainly capable of using other learning algorithms. I'd like to think when paired with a game designer, and given some time, we could work together and create powerful solutions to difficult problems, even if they aren't listed above.  I also have been working on research I plan to publish on Hearthstone! But that's for another day :)

6vcqpw,13,2017-08-22,"Me 23F with my boyfriend 22M of two years, how do I talk to him about our communication problem or how do I get over it?",pronounverbnoun,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6vcqpw/me_23f_with_my_boyfriend_22m_of_two_years_how_do/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years, and we are currently long distance. We've been long distance for a year now and will be long distance probably until 2019. We are states away so we can't drive to see each other and have to plan ahead for visits due to plane trips. Same time zone, though. We are each other's longest relationship we have a good relationship blah blah blah typical r/relationships spiel. Sorry if this is choppy, I'm on mobile.

One of the biggest issues I have is how we talk. We text sporadically throughout the day. We are getting past the honeymoon stage, I love talking to him but I don't NEEEEEED to talk to him every second of the day. We are both adults. I am currently in grad school (starting classes next week) and work here at the school, he has an internship that may potentially turn into a job offer.

He usually is at/getting ready for his internship before I wake up, like 5 or 6 and doesn't get home til 4 or 5. I have a ""make my own"" schedule, I work Monday through Thursday five hours each day. When classes start I will have a busier schedule and I will have programs and a more sporadic schedule. *I am assuming once I become actually occupied this won't be a huge deal.*

I want to text or call him more often than we do. He used to send me multiple texts, call me randomly, etc, but within the past six months it has stopped. I am chalking this up to the honeymoon period. I know we are both busy. I tend to double or triple text everyone, and I have a tendency to ""blow up"" his phone, which means I send about 3 or 4 texts in a row but it is over the course of many hours. The most I've sent is 6 or 7, but that was over the course of 10 hours during the day when he wouldn't answer me.

I get more irritated when he doesn't respond after he gets home from work. I tell myself he is probably just doing stuff around the house, but I like telling him about my day. Sometimes, if I text and he doesn't respond, he's sleeping. I would send him a text at like 3:30, then 5, then maybe 6:30, and he'll finally respond with something short.

These messages are like ""I have to deal with this BS at work"" ""Hope the drive home goes well"" and ""Love you"", it's not ""answer your phone you fucking bitch"" or anything. I do tend to get upset with him when he doesn't answer for many hours, with zero communication.

He is not as attached to his phone as I am. I am trying to be reasonable, and I certainly don't want to talk to him every twenty minutes. Am I being unreasonable by wishing he would text/talk to me more often? I kind of want to set up a weekly phone call but I want my schedule to be a bit more set in stone.

It's worth saying I know he isn't cheating on me or anything, it's not a trust issue. But when he doesn't talk to me, it makes me feel like a burden and that I am not important to him. If I know I'm going to be MIA or unreachable for a few, I let know. The few times I haven't, he double and triple texted me as well.

I have talked to him about it before. He usually goes MIA for hours. I blow up his phone, he gets mad at me for blowing up his phone even though he never communicated with me about what he was doing. I understand I am not entitled to know what he is doing, but I believe it should be a thing of respect. Sometimes, he will leave me hanging for four, five, six hours, then explain that he was hanging with his friends or whatnot. I have told him it makes me feel unimportant when he just doesn't tell me what's going on, and that I would appreciate it if he were to send me a text before doing something, like ""Hey, I'm doing xyz.""

All my friends say that I should be okay with not talking to him for a day or two, and that I am completely unreasonable for asking him to send me a little text with what's up, but they are coming from a normal relationship, where they see each other constantly or even live together, so I need a different point of view.

**Am I being unreasonable or manipulative or childish by wanting my boyfriend to text me more often? Is it unreasonable to ask him to let me know when he's about to go MIA? Is there a better way for me to express my feelings to him? If I am being unreasonable, how do I get over it and deal with it?**

TLDR: Boyfriend doesn't text me too often, and he makes me feel manipulative and childish when I send him two or three texts over the course of an hour. I want him to let me know if he is about to go MIA instead of just leaving me hanging, but it rarely changes. Am I being unreasonable? How do I deal?"

6vek9h,182,2017-08-22,"DC, Drugs, and Security Clearance",clearancedcthrowaway,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/6vek9h/dc_drugs_and_security_clearance/,"I'm posting this to share some information, opinions, and experiences that I think will be useful to other people in the community, in particular the user who (stupidly) posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/6vaz5i/attn_people_familiar_with_security_clearance/).

## TL;DR

Recreational marijuana use is legal in DC, but remains illegal federally. The Trump administration is currently maintaining Obama-era policies with respect to enforcement, giving states (and DC) the autonomy to enact legalization locally. 

Regardless, (according to my interpretation of publicly available information) you are still required to disclose your legal marijuana usage when applying for clearance. Despite its legal status in DC, you should anticipate that clearance specialists will take the position that your cannabis usage calls into question your ""ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations"" and may be considered disqualifying. It is still possible to receive a clearance after reporting recent drug use (marijuana or otherwise) by providing a case arguing that you have mitigated the investigators concerns with respect to your drug use (see the [adjudication guidelines](https://www.state.gov/m/ds/clearances/60321.htm#h) for details, or the public [clearance decisions](http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/industrial/2017.html) for examples). 

If you decide not to disclose your marijuana use to a clearance investigation because you considered it to be legal and it later is revealed to investigators, you should expect this to be treated as providing false statements to the clearance process and will likely be immediately disqualifying.

If you disclose recent drug use and make a case for mitigating factors, if your clearance is not denied outright it is possible (although not necessarily the case) that you will be prompted to provide a detailed report on your entire history with drugs for your clearance application to be further considered. Failure to provide such a report if one is requested will likely result in denial of clearance, but will not have legal consequences like falsifying information can.

If you have a clearance denied or revoked, all future clearance applications will ask you to provide the details and documentation associated with that investigation.


## Background: the Executive Branch and the legal status of MJ in DC

### Federal status

As you are almost certainly aware, Marijuana is a [Schedule I](https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml) drug, which means the federal government draws no legal distinction between how they see weed and heroin. Suffice it to say, it is illegal at the federal level.

### Obama Administration

In 2013, Obama's Deputy AG issued a memo to the state AG's advising them that the Justice Department wouldn't interfere with state efforts to legalize marijuana.

In 2014, a [ballot measure ](http://wamu.org/story/14/11/04/pot_legalization_approved_by_dc_voters/) legalized the recreational use and possession of small quantities of weed in DC, under certain conditions. It was then and remains today illegal federally. 

In 2014, Obama made [public statements](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/14/marijuana-policy-white-house-states-rights_n_5586188.html) promoting the position that marijuana legalization is a states rights issue, and that enforcing the federal position of marijuana illegality in states where it had been legalized would compromise state autonomy. Obama also made a [statement](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=105331) criticizing congress for using budget appropriations to constrain how DC could implement their legalization (i.e. you can have it, use it, grow it, and gift it, but you can't sell it). 

### Trump Administration

Marijuana legalization has increasingly gained momentum across the US, and the Trump administration has not directed the justice department to enforce federal law in states where Marijuana has been legalized. This isn't to stay that situation isn't volatile or subject to change. 

In February, press ecretary [Sean Spicer](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-marijuana-20170223-story.html) told reporters he expected the administration to increase drug enforcement. 

In May, the current AG, Jeff Sessions, sent a [letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/13/jeff-sessions-personally-asked-congress-to-let-him-prosecute-medical-marijuana-providers/?utm_term=.aee5802fc187) to congress asking them to roll-back federal medical marijuana protections, specifically so his DoJ could prosecute people in states where MJ had been legalized, referring to the current state of marijuana use in the US as ""an historic drug epidemic"" and associating it with an uptick in violent crime. 

In February, Sessions created the [Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-announces-crime-reduction-and-public-safety-task-force), which many [speculated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-jeff-sessions-wants-to-bring-back-the-war-on-drugs/2017/04/08/414ce6be-132b-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html?utm_term=.555355861b8e) would be used to justify ramping up the ""war on drugs"" and reversing pot legalization efforts, in accordance with Sessions public position. The task force produced a [report](https://apnews.com/ad37624fcb8e485a8d57a013d48a227c) a few weeks ago with no new recommendations wrt marijuana legalization beyond echoing the Obama-era DoJ's positions and promoting continued research. Additionally, there are reports that Sessions has made [privatel comments](http://herb.co/2017/03/07/cannabis-crackdown-jeff-sessions/) to several Senators advising that there would be no reversal in federal policy towards marijuana legalization any time soon.

Although this particular task force didn't give Sessions any ""ammunition"" for reversing policy, this isn't to say he (or Trump) might not do it anyway. Lately, it's come out that Sessions is on Trump's [shit list](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/opinion/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-alabama.html) for recusing himself in the Russia investigation, so it's possible Sessions may get removed as AG in the near future, in which case his specific views on this issue may not matter. 

At several points during the campaign, [Trump](http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/feb/28/gavin-newsom/true-campaign-trump-said-states-should-decide-lega/) voiced his support for marijuana legalization, but he has demonstrated that he doesn't feel beholden to his campaign promises and his positions in general are... flexible and ill-defined to say the least. Trump also seems to have a penchant for [reversing](https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+reversing+obama&amp;oq=trump+reversing+obama&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l4.2791j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) Obama-era policy, regardless of the potential harm or consequences that could result.

### In summary

* Weed is illegal federally
* The jurisdiction of DC does not consider it illegal if you smoke weed
* The department of justice is currently acting under Obama-era laissez-faire policies with respect to enforcement of federal law in states where marijuana has been legalized
* The Trump made campaign promises supporting marijuana legalization, but his campaing promises are unreliable
* Trump's AG opposes marijuana legalization, but has also (maybe?) said that he won't make any changes to DoJ policy in the immediate future
* Trump and his AG are in bad terms, so Sessions may get replaced in the near future and then who even knows what the administration policy will be

## Marijuana and clearance

### The Questionnaire (eQIP)

All levels of security clearance will require completing a questionnaire that will ask about your criminal record and, regardless of criminal record, ask you to disclose your recent history with illegal drugs. For Public Trust clearance (the lowest level of clearance), they will ask you about drug use in the last year. For higher levels of clearance (e.g. TS/SCI), they will ask about drug use in the last seven years. Marijuana is listed explicitly. Here are sample questionaires so you can see specifically what questions are asked:

* [**SF-86**](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86-non508.pdf) - for TS/SCI. The drug questions are section 23 (page 93, the 96th page of the pdf).  
* [**SF-85P**](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/SF85P.pdf) - for Public Trust. The drug questions are section 21 (page 7, the 9th page of the pdf).

### Do clearance investigators care if I smoked marijuana even if it was legal under DC law?

Yes. I'm pretty sure the current OPM position is based on a 2015 [memo](https://www.chcoc.gov/content/federal-laws-and-policies-prohibiting-marijuana-use) issued by the director of OPM clarified the agencies position with respect to marijuana in the context of state legalization efforts (and DC specifically). Here are some highlights from that memo:

&gt; Federal law on marijuana remains unchanged. [...] Thus knowing or intentional marijuana possession is illegal [...] persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for Federal employment. 

&gt; Involvement with marijuana may be considered when agencies make suitability determinations for covered positions under [5 C.F.R. part 731](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/731.202).  Drug involvement can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness or ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, thus indicating his or her employment might not promote the efficiency or protect the integrity of the service.  However, the individual’s conduct must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  

&gt; [...] An individual’s disregard of Federal law pertaining to marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant to suitability determinations and relevant for disciplinary actions.

### Am I required to disclose recreational or medical cannabis use if it was legal under DC law?

Almost certainly, given the language of the above memo. The questionnaires ask about ""illegal"" drug use. Let's say you choose not to disclose your marijuana use because recreational use is legal in DC or because you had a prescription for medical use or whatever. If it somehow comes up later, it is clear from the above memo that the investigator's direction is to treat your use as illegal, and therefore it will likely be their perspective that you were not forthcoming on the questionnaire, which by itself is justification not to grant clearance and could get you in even more trouble. In case you've never looked closely at the language in the certification at the end of the questionnaire:

&gt; My statements on this form, and on any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith. I have carefully read the foregoing instructions to complete this form. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (18 U.S.C. 1001). I understand that intentionally withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information may have a negative effect on my security clearance, employment prospects, or job status, up to and including denial or revocation of my security clearance, or my removal and debarment from Federal service.

It is sort of interesting that, considering [over half of the country](http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html) has enacted some form of marijuana legalization, this grey area isn't something that is addressed specifically in the eQIP. This is direction given to the *investigators* discussing how to adjudicate, not to the people seeking clearance discussing how to complete the forms. It's possible that this is to deliberately create a loophole in which people in these jursidictions can justifiably say they haven't used drugs illegally on the eQIP, while still giving appropriate direction to investigators to deny clearance based on illegal drug use if it is disclosed or discovered. It is not my opinion that this is the case, but I'm not a lawyer and will happily concede that it's possible that this loophole exists and may even be there deliberately.

### If I disclose recent marijuana use that was legal in DC, will I still be able to get clearance?

Maybe. It's up to the investigator to make that determination. If you do disclose (which, again, you are probably required to and you should understand that), the best thing you can do for yourself is present a case for ""mitigating"" circumstances. From [OPM Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information - Guideline H: Drug Involvement](https://www.state.gov/m/ds/clearances/60321.htm#h):

&gt; **24. The Concern.** Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 

&gt; ...

&gt; **26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:** 

&gt; * (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
&gt; * (b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: 
&gt;   * (1) dissociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
&gt;   * (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; 
&gt;   * (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; 
&gt;   * (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation; 
&gt; * (c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; 
&gt; * (d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. 

Also worth perusing are the public [adjudications](http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/industrial/) of security clearance decisions. My understanding is that these cases were all people who had clearances denied or revoked (I think mainly the latter, but maybe some of the former), and the decisions are the result of the appeal process. Searching the decision summaries for ""drug"", ""marijuana"" and ""guideline H"" produce the relevant decisions. Here's a sampling of results from 2017 adjudications:


&gt; * Applicant possessed and used marijuana on about 20 to 25 occasions from March 2013 to February 2014 while holding a security clearance. More time without illegal drug use is necessary to fully mitigate drug involvement security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. CASE NO: 15-03924.h1
&gt; * Applicant repeatedly used marijuana over many years while holding a security clearance. He falsified security clearance applications by failing to disclose his illegal drug use. He failed to mitigate the Guideline H, drug involvement and, Guideline E, personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-01297.h1
&gt; * Applicant used marijuana from 1991 through 2012. In November 2003, he had been granted a security clearance. He has failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 15-03844.h1
&gt; * Applicant self-admitted himself to a treatment center for alcohol dependence or abuse in 2012. He had a security clearance at the time. On admission, he tested positive for marijuana, but was not told of this result, nor told that his diagnosis for alcohol dependence was appended to include cannabis abuse. He was unaware of this diagnosis until his clearance process began. He credibly denied past drug use and the clinic's own paperwork is inconsistent. Five years have passed. Applicant remains sober, has changed his life, and continues to remain committed to his 12-step program and a holistic approach to self-maintenance. Drug involvement, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted. CASE NO: 14-00538.h1
&gt; * Applicant used marijuana regularly while holding a security clearance, but he did not intentionally provide false information on a security clearance application or to an investigator. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 15-02331.h1
&gt; * Applicant worked as an intern during college for a federal contractor and was granted a security clearance in 2008. Applicant used marijuana five times from 2009 to 2014, while holding a security clearance. He did not have an appreciation at the time for the significance of his actions. He has matured and does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He has mitigated the Guideline H, drug involvement, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted. CASE NO: 16-00130.h1
&gt; * Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his lengthy history of drug use. Although he recently ceased illegal drug use, he has not shown that he has ceased contact with his drug-using associates or avoided environments wherein he previously had used illegal drugs. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 15-07110.h1
&gt; * Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated because Applicant did not falsify her answer regarding her illegal drug use on her 2011 security clearance application. Security concerns raised because of Applicant’s illegal marijuana use after being granted a security clearance are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 15-08344.h1
&gt; * Applicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from approximately June 1995 to January 2015. She credibly testified that she last used it four months before she went to work for her current employer, and she does not intend to use any illegal substance in the future, while she is with her present employer and/or holding an security clearance. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted. CASE NO: 15-07983.h1

And of special note, here's one from 2016: 

&gt; * Applicant uses marijuana for medicinal purposes that was properly prescribed for him in a state where personal use and possession of marijuana is generally legal. He also has used marijuana for recreational purposes where it is legal to do so. Changes in state laws pertaining to marijuana do not alter the existing illegality of marijuana possession under federal law and the general proscription against illegal use of controlled substances by person's holding a security clearance. Most of Applicant's marijuana use has occurred while holding a security clearance. Applicant intends to continue using marijuana. He has not mitigated the security concerns about his drug use. His request for continued eligibility for a security clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-05263.h1

### What are the take-aways from these adjudications?

* The revelation of a failure to disclose drug use is pretty much categorically disqualifying
* Illegal drug use while holding a security clearance is disqualifying, unless it can be demonstrated that it was mitigated by a drug rehab program and lifestyle changes
* Relatively recent but infrequent drug use may be forgiven if a convincing argument is presented that there is no intention to use in the future, and/or the conditions associated with that drug use have been mitigated (e.g. no longer associating with the people involved, completion of a rehab program, a signed statement of intent, etc.). 

### I know people who have high-level clearance and also do drugs. Did they lie on their eQIP?

Maybe? Who's to say? It's ultimately up to the investigator to make a clearance determination. I'll say this: I experienced some problems after disclosing using marijuana legally a handful of times in 2016 (i.e. within the past year, although I hadn't smoked at all the previous two years) on an application for public trust clearance, and many people with whom I discussed this told me I was an idiot for disclosing and essentially suggested (through the questions they asked me about my disclosure) that they only would have disclosed if they expected the use would be something that had the potential to be unearthed in the investigator's research.

Although I don't know anyone like this (probably because I don't do hard drugs), several people have described to me that they know or knew people with secret or TS clearance who used illegal drugs recreationally while holding a clearance. From my research, it is my strong suspicion that these people achieved and maintained their clearance by lying to investigators and probably having (probably by request) friends and family lie for them as well. Despite the recent incidents of high-level Trump administration officials ([Kushner](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-failed-to-disclose-dozens-of-financial-holdings-new-document-shows/2017/07/21/1a11a566-6e35-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html?utm_term=.68dbece5cee1), [Trump Jr.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/07/11/donald-trump-jr-s-russia-meeting-may-have-been-legal-but-thats-a-low-bar/?utm_term=.bbe7eb3035f7), [Manafort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-trump-campaign-chairman-paul-manafort-files-as-foreign-agent-for-ukraine-work/2017/06/27/8322b6ac-5b7b-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html?utm_term=.321a95d700e3)) failing to disclose important information in their clearance applications, providing false statements in a clearance investigation is a felony and can result in fines or [imprisonment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/maryland-resident-charged-making-false-statements-and-submitting-false-documents-applications)

### Are there any consequences to disclosure?

Obviously, you could have your clearance denied or revoked. The reasons for the denial will be sent to you directly, so your employer won't know why your clearance was denied unless you tell them, but they will know clearance was denied and this could obviously have consequences for your employment status. 

Moreover, if your clearance is denied or revoked, it will follow you around. I'll relay a personal experience to explain what I mean:

The eQIP for TS/SCI only goes back 7 years for the drug question, BUT both the SF-86 and SF-85P ask if you've ever had a clearance denied or revoked, and ask for accompanying documentation. When I disclosed that I had used marijuana in the past year on my application for public trust, I was prompted to provide very detailed (and intrusive) additional information describing my entire drug history. Not restrained to the past year, not going back seven years: all of it. Here's the additional information I was asked to provide in response to disclosing five instances of cannabis use within the past year, the most recent of which was several months prior to submitting my eQIP:

&gt; Please provide a detailed statement describing the circumstances surrounding your drug
involvement. Your response should answer the following questions:
&gt; 1. Are you now using/abusing any controlled substances or illegal drugs? If yes, answer questions a-e below.
&gt; 2. Have you ever used/abused any controlled substances or illegal drugs? If yes, answer questions a-e below:
&gt;   a. What were the circumstances and timeframe when you first used/abused illegal drugs
or controlled substances?
&gt;   b. What illegal drugs/controlled substances have you ever used/abused?
&gt;   c. With what frequency have you used/abused these illegal drugs/controlled substances?
&gt;   d. When was the last time you used/abused these illegal drugs/controlled substances?
&gt;   e. Have you ever sought professional or non-professional treatment for drug/controlled substance use/abuse? If yes, specify dates, treatment facility, program(s) attended, medication(s) prescribed, and the name(s) and address(es) of care provider(s).
&gt; 3. Have you ever been involved with the sale, possession, transporting, manufacturing, and
distribution of any illegal drugs/controlled substances? If yes, provide details.
&gt; 4. Have you ever been arrested, charged with, indicted for or convicted of any drug/controlled substance related offenses? If yes, provide details.
&gt; 5. What is your intention for future drug/controlled substance activity?

&gt; [...] If you fail to respond to this letter, the issue remains unresolved. The Personnel Security
Division will be unable to make a favorable suitability determination, and a recommendation will be
made to deny your access to the USCIS contract.

I won't describe my specific situation further than to say that I produced the requested detailed report of my full history with drugs, which was essentially limited to marijuana (with some halluncinogenics in college). Ultimately, my clearance was denied based on my history of drug use. 

Because I have had a clearance denied, future applications for security clearance are guaranteed to request the details and documents associated with the investigation for the denied clearance. That means that even if I haven't done any illegal drugs within the time window that the eQIP asks about (one year for Public Trust, seven years for TS/SCI), I will always have to submit this report: hence, this will ""follow me around"".

It is worth noting that I was compelled to produce this report, I was not *forced* to. The only consequences for not providing it would have been the investigator making their decision without the information I provided, which I expect would still have been to deny my clearance.

I'm a 5 ft 6 26-year-old Chinese guy living in the UK. 

My upbringing (I should note even though my family is Chinese they are very much 'westernised') was pretty meh as my alcoholic Dad made it clear he didn't want me at a young age and my mother struggled to feed, cloth and buy presents for my birthdays or at Christmas due to her being on a minimum wage job. I had a lot of fights during my teenage years with my father and at the same time, I was bullied in high school quite a bit. I don't know if it's a North England thing or a teenage thing but kids were explicitly racist to my face calling me a ""chink"" often, I had really bad acne too which was another thing for them to ridicule me with. When I was younger I really hated being Chinese and it stemmed from the abuse I was receiving, but now I I'm glad that I'm Chinese and born in the UK as I have lots of heritage and culture built up within me. 

I spent a lot of time during my teen years along with video games and porn, they were pretty much the only release I had during those rotten years. I played WoW daily and by the time I quit from age 13 to about 18 I had clocked up over 300 days playtime. As you can expect I didn't learn how to communicate socially with people and I used to walk along staring at the ground with 0 self-confidence. I developed an anxiety disorder sometime around 16 and I started having weird panic attacks happening to me whenever I was around people, and I had no fucking clue why it was happening to me. I did some counseling for a while with a therapist but it didn't really help, so I just kinda learned to deal with the anxiety. I still occasionally feel panic attacks at moments but I've gotten a lot better at controlling them.

When I went to university I spent the first year in student accommodation as I was keen to meet new people, but I just ended up being afraid and I spent most of my time in my room with my gaming PC. I am extremely regretful that I didnt make the most out of that year as I moved back home to complete my degree after the first year, so I hardly met anyone. Some of my friends from high school got me out clubbing a few times and after some alcohol was down me I was a lot more open and easy-going. I ended up experimenting with Ecstasy a few times and I had many memorable nights speaking to my friends about very personal details about my life, to which they pretended to understand for the moment. I even danced with a few girls at that time as all of my mental barriers had disappeared, drugs can be quite amazing sometimes.

After university, I spent some time at home before I started applying for jobs. I ended up getting hired as an intern for a web development agency and after spending a few years there I was recently promoted to project manger. I have been able to pass my car test, motorbike test and now I am saving to move out of my parents home. 

It's probably quite obvious but I've never interacted with women and I've never really had any friends. The friends I had from high school ended up kinda going their own way, some moved to another area and some just got addicted to drugs so I cut communication with them. So most weekends I spend them alone or helping out around the house. Sometimes I ride my motorbike which is quite fun. 

I've read a bit into Red Pill and seduction but I have no idea how I would even implement any of that, and quite frankly I'm scared to speaking to women sometimes. I speak to women at work and I constantly stutter and fall over myself. A lot of the women in work call me 'cute' or 'innocent' whenever they ask me about my past, I take it that's not a good thing for a 26-year-old man to be innocent like a child. I've tried Tinder/OKC dating apps and as you would expect I get absolutely nothing on them. I get a few matches but they stop talking to me after a while. I had one date with a girl and I took her to Starbucks, but she stopped speaking to me after that date.

Where do I go from here? I feel as though there's no hope for me, as if I'm so mentally messed up there's no escape from the black hole I'm in. I've spent the past 10 years fapping alone in my room to images of women rather than being outside, I've spent it hiding away from the society that ruined my child/teenagehood mercilessly smashing what little self-esteem I had into the ground. One thing I hate about myself is I am extremely lazy and don't seem to be able to motivate myself to change. Maybe this is the results of spending the last 10 years hiding and only doing what I felt was safe rather than challenging myself.

Even though I have a full-time job and an okay career for myself, I feel completely empty without friends or a partner. I understand that even if I had a partner she would leave me probably as my mindset isn't correct right now to love myself let alone love someone else. Make no mistake I understand what hole I've dug myself into, I'm not delusional, however, I am very scared of what direction my life is heading. I might hit 30 without having done anything to call my 20's one of the best periods of my life, like most people seem to call it. I almost feel like it's over due to not taking advantage of the social aspect of college or university. 

How can I fix the wreck that is my life? Is there anyone here that lives in the UK that could almost be like a mentor to me? I know that sounds stupid but at 26 I'm not a child anymore and I need serious help to dig myself out of this hole :( 

**Edit:**

Thank you for the replies everyone, I've read them all in great detail and I've had some time to reflect. I haven't got the time to reply to everyone indivudually, but the gist I'm getting is to focus on purging the negative thoughts from my mind, hitting the gym, being more social, just being outside and speaking to people more often. 

Truth is though, is that words can't do that alone. I have to figure this out myself, I have to figure out what will fix me and it may take a few years. So again, thanks for the replies everyone. Maybe I'll make another thread in a few months talking about how things have (or haven't) changed. "
6vfk6m,12,2017-08-22,Bad Career Advice from Parents,Chronos2016,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6vfk6m/bad_career_advice_from_parents/,"So I recently signed a contract to write blog posts for a local flower shop. I'm writing one post a week and getting paid $50 per each post. It's not a bad amount for someone who is a newbie to content writing. 

But of course I'm going about this all wrong and I'm stupid for accepting $50 according to my NParents. 

Some backstory first: I graduated last year and since then I have had two internships. My last internship ended in May and I have been looking for a full-time job since then. My parents bullied me into going back to school for nursing. They kept taunting me and saying things like ""You'll never get a job in marketing. Indians don't make it in marketing. That's for white people."" and just so much other bullshit. Thanks for ignoring the fact that I have had TWO jobs in marketing so far. And I had to do my internships after college because I didn't get a car until 2014. So I'm starting my career way later because they wanted to save money on insurance. 

Now back to the main story: I got this cool gig as a content marketer with a flower shop and I'm only doing 10-12 hours a work per month maximum. On Sunday my mother said, ""Don't do this blogging job. It will interfere with your schoolwork and you won't be able to focus."" Just overall trying to get me to not do this. And she also kept telling me to stop looking for jobs and just focus on school. She also told me to leave my current tutoring job completely. So then I wouldn't be earning any money. When I tell them this they say ""We'll pay for your gas and necessities. Just stop buying makeup and going out with friends.""

This made me mad because if I don't get money, I can't pay for my speech therapy. And if I can't afford speech therapy, they will keep pointing out my speech impediment and say I need to go (can't go if I don't have money!) and it also means that I can't interact and go out with my friends as much and that makes me sad. They keep trying to cut me off from my friends. They tell me to deactivate my social media and to stop texting etc. They also keep telling me ""Listen to us. We know best,"" and keep telling me not to tell other people about my career situation. 

Now onto today. My dad called me downstairs and he told me ""So you're getting paid $50 per blog post? Ask for $100.""

I'm honestly floored. I already signed the contract and I let my parents know that after three months I can renegotiate my pay. But asking for a 100% raise is honestly dumb and the flower shop would most likely terminate the contract if I did that. I don't tell them this of course but instead, I say I want to go back upstairs to read my book. This really ticks my dad off. He shouts, ""You listen to us when we talk to you. We are talking to you in a nice way and this is the attitude you give? We are trying to give you career advice. Next time I will throw your books out."" (Side note, he ALWAYS threatens to throw out my books and I hate it. He even does it jokingly. I wish he wouldn't do that because it really does hurt my feelings and I love my books a lot, but that's what he always goes for every single time he gets mad at me and wants to put me in line.)

This past year has just been stressful. I've been constantly shouted at and berated for not having a full-time job yet. But the most frustrating thing is that last year I actually had an offer for a full-time job. The pay was shit, but it was an offer and my parents told me to turn it down. I'm still kicking myself over listening to them. I could have had way better pay and I could have had a better job now because that job I turned down would have been a huge resume booster. I had it in my fucking hand just 2 weeks out of college. And now they are wanting me to ask for 100% raises now. And I know that they know making those demands would make people not want to work with me. 

It's just frustrating honestly. Every day I look for job and on average I have had 1-3 interviews per week. And I did all this while working part time tutoring and taking the summer class my parents forced me to take. 

I am still going to apply for jobs, I am still going to interview, I will continue with my tutoring job, I will continue with my freelance blogger contract, and I know that I WILL NOT BE A NURSE!!!!! 

I just really needed to let off some steam. These past three months have been frustrating and this past month has especially been bad. My mom has been bullying me a lot more and it's even more intense when my little sister isn't around. She won't bully me around my sister because my sister puts my mom in her place. So she does it when my sister is at work. It's been frustrating and I've spent a lot of time crying. I just really want a job soon. I'm supposed to hear back from two companies this week and I really hope I get it. I don't want to be a nurse. I hate school. I hate the idea of being a nurse. It's not a job for me. 

Thank you for listening. "

My freshman year I met this girl who lived across the hall from me in my dorm. By the end of freshman year I had fallen in love with her. The next year was amazing. We dated for a little over 2 years when she started getting weird and never really communicated. Last October I finally get fed up with what was happening and cut it off. She wasn't trying and I was. 

EIGHT MONTHS LATER she begins to talk to me agin saying how much of a mistake separating was and that she wanted me back in her life. That was 3 months ago. So because I still absolutely loved this girl I abandoned the girl I had been dating in the intern (I'm a piece of shit for doing this). 

Now she is beginning to pull the same shit she did before we broke up for the first time so I told her I wasn't going to do the 'things get weird but time makes it better' thing again. Now she hasn't talked to me in 3 days (after spending an entire week with her family at the beach last week). 

I swear she came back into my life just to fuck up what I had because she saw I was happy, and once she achieved that she left. 

How. The. Fuck. Do I get over this girl. I thought dating another girl would make things better. Sex with other girls didn't help. Dates with other girls didn't help. I guess my question is: I'm in love with a girl who has treated me like shit, doesn't deserve me for a second. Yet I still love her. How do I move on. This is starting to affect my daily functions. I feel depressed and it's not getting better. 

P.s. My uncle (like a father to me) is having a quadruple bypass tomorrow and my entire family is stressed as Fuck and this girl abandons me now of all times when I need someone to talk to most."
6vhk9m,2,2017-08-23,"m4f - the reluctance and confusion of an innocent, well behaved lady meeting a male pornstar",veryyoungveryhung,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6vhk9m/m4f_the_reluctance_and_confusion_of_an_innocent/,"As the title suggests, both scenes involve a naïve, well behaved or at least very professional young lady suddenly realising that she is meeting a male pornstar.

I love the contrast between the two characters backgrounds, the difference between how they both think and act. Especially though I love the change in thoughts that go through her head, from shock and potentially disgust (or something similar) to eventually intrigue and more...


**Interview with a pornstar**

I roleplay as a fictitious male pornstar now going into more legitimate films. In this rp your character would either be a little shy and possibly nervous about meeting a man with that sort of a background or she would be entirely unaware of my previous employment (I could be going into legitimate acting and you are interviewing me regarding a new movie I am in).

Gradually, as the interview progresses you start asking me about my previous roles and experience, not quite realising what you are getting yourself into!


**Don’t talk to the neighbours!**

We've lived next door to you for a while and for as long as anyone can remember, we've butted heads with your parents. We were too loud, throwing parties two or three nights per week, music blaring, people shouting and likely plenty of drugs. They've called the cops on us a few times, but it seems we're pretty sweet with them too - if only your parents knew how and why! Naturally your parents have told you to stay away from us. You couldn't really figure out why, after all we seem really nice and always wave and say hello. We don't look strange - quite the opposite in fact, we're rather attractive; my wife a pretty and athletic brunette in her early twenties and me a tall, muscular guy in his early thirties. But being a good girl, you did as you were told. Keeping it to just a friendly smile and nod whenever you passed us.

So when your parents start to get really strict (whether it's over your grades/getting a job/your behaviour etc) and you want to get rebellious, there's an obvious place to go. I mean we're only next door, we seem like the kind of people to listen!

I mean, how are you to know that we're pornstars?

**A pornstar in the office!**

The office is generally very boring. People here don't hate Mondays because of the stress their job gives them. They hate Mondays because it's the start of another work week of mind melting monotony. Dull, tedious work that seems to transcend the very concept of time. 

But this week there's something new. Something different. A new starter who seems somewhat mysterious. He's tall, around 6'2 and while he's only averagely attractive with his blonde hair and beard, he's built like someone who would look more happy swinging an axe around on a battlefield somewhere. Broad shoulders, muscular arms and chest fill out his plain work shirt to the point of it stretching. While his plain black trousers must have been specially made to fit round thighs that more resemble tree trunks than legs. 

There's talk going around too, spreading through the air like a virus without a host. 

*'Former prisoner, 'once killed a guy'.*

*'Don't be silly, we don't hire ex cons. No, I reckon he's a failed sports star'*

*'Janine says he was in a couple of films'*

*'I've not seen him in anything! Are you sure?'*

*'That's because he was in porn. Hung like a gifted horse apparently!'*

*'No way! Bullshit!'*

*'why not send in the intern. Find out the truth!'*

The girls snigger before approaching you. You've not worked here long but all the time you've been dying to be brought into the circle of trust. It wasn't hard for them to get you to agree to do his induction...

((So I'm trying to set up a rather awkward interaction between my character, a former male pornstar who has taken to working in an office to try to get a real job. And your character, an innocent, naive intern who has very little sexual experience and would certainly never have watched porn))


**Celeb possibility!**

You're filming a new TV show/movie but you're co star is completely is completely unfamiliar to you.  Which is strange, because he seems to confident in front of the cameras and he says he's been in dozens of films before..

(i5 vs i7, laptop size, recommended resolutions)


A little bit of background, I am switching over from a 13 in. 2015 Macbook Pro with retina display. I love my MBP, but it doesn't currently serve all of my needs. I will be keeping my MBP and using it alongside the Thinkpad.


I will be using the Thinkpad primarily for:

-Heavy modeling in Excel

-Heavy PowerPoint usage for building slide decks

I used a PC during the course of my internship and found that they are vastly superior to Apple when using Microsoft Office.

I'm looking for the following features in a laptop, with the most important features to me at the top:

-Feel and shape of the overall laptop. I would prefer a squared/boxed shaped laptop

-Keyboard feel and layout (F1-12 keys are important to me, as well as how it feels when I press down on keys)

-Durability/longevity

-Trackpad feel

-Screen resolution


I don't really care for:

-Battery life

-Touch screen

I will be using this laptop mostly over the course of the next year in school. After that, I will be graduating and working on a laptop provided by work. Because of this, I'm open to purchasing a refurbished laptop if I can find one that fits my needs and would appreciate any insight on the process of finding one as well.


Thank you so much!"

Hopefully you all find some inspiration from me, and commit to healthy changes. 

Most of all this post is for /u/uberwolf0 It's my way of repaying the countless hours of content he's made that I love. For making me laugh, for keeping ME motivated and genuinely being someone who's just an awesome guy.

Ok here we go...In 2012 I weighed 365lbs.  It was the result of years of depression, rejection and self hate (figuring out why your so big is important).  I had just interned for 9 months at my dream first after college job, and they told me they didn't have a spot for me. This despite being asked to come back and intern for an additional 3 months, 3 months prior.  Needless to say I was crushed.  For the next few months I spent my time eating, sleeping, crying and sending out resume's.  I didn't as much get a rejection email back. I had no hope and I weighed 400+ (The scale maxed out)
After giving up on the job market I took up a standing offer from my Uncle to move to Mexico and learn to get healthy.  I left all my excuses behind in the States and needed a complete reset.  After starting eating healthier and working out I started to lose some weight.  When I weighed myself in Mexico I was 360lbs.
When I left cabo I weighed about 290ish (I don't remember)
I recorded videos for my journey, it was a crazy one where I got REALLY sick and even had to come back to the US to have a non cancerous tumor removed from my pancreas. 
I now weigh 237lbs.  My life is infinitely better than before I started to lose weight.  I'm engaged, I have my own company, and I love myself.
So if your out there, worried that you cant do it, I'm telling you that you can.  
If anyone has questions about weight loss I would be happy to answer them.
So proud of you boogie that you took the steps to change your life.  You help motivate me every day.

Apologies for the low quality and the microsoft office as opposed to a PDF but I'm writing this up at 2AM in the morning after working/dealing with uni projects all day. 

I've diversified my applications to both IT and Finance streams and although I'm moderately confident with my IT resume, I'm not sure if I should send this same resume in for the finance intern roles. My IT roles show the ability to take on new responsibilities and without the IT work experience there's not much on my resume. 

Any feedback would be great. "
6vjjkj,3,2017-08-23,"UPDATE: Me [20F] with my soon-to-be roommates [22M and 24 F], one hates my boyfriend [27M] of 5 months and the other is playing Switzerland",boommars,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6vjjkj/update_me_20f_with_my_soontobe_roommates_22m_and/,"Hey y'all I just wanted to update you on this weird situation with my roommates Red and Cleo,
 and my boyfriend Santana. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ty4kz/me_20f_with_my_soontobe_roommates_22m_and_24_f/. It's sort of resolved, but it also left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.

**Chatting with Red:** Red agreed to talk to me, but he avoided it for days like a procrastinating middle schooler and kept making excuses to not do it. He's not normally that sort of person, so it worried me. I ended up making a somewhat impromptu road trip out west to visit family, so that also delayed our chat for a few days.

We talked Monday (finally!) on the porch at his parents' house like we were kids again. He finally came clean--those of you who suspected he had feelings for me were correct. Red has apparently had feelings for me for close to four years now. He never thought there was a right time until he had some weird epiphany at his internship. Because of this, he wanted to ask me out as soon as the internship ended for the summer, but I finally went public with my relationship in the beginning of July. That put the kabosh on Red's plans. He's angry with himself for being ""too slow"" and ""wasting a chance"", but he also told me he's angry at me for never really giving him a chance. Red also said he wants space from me, knowing that we're sharing a living space starting in a week and a half.

I honestly lost my cool a little, and I chastised him for being that dishonest. Honestly, if he had asked me out before I met Santana, I would have given him a chance; however, since he feigned disinterest in me, I never thought to ask him out or pursue him in that manner. I feel that most of that problem is his own making.

Nonetheless, we did talk in more civil terms. I agreed to not bring Santana over to the apartment for a while and also told Red I'd give him space before we officially move in. I also very firmly told Red that Santana has become very important to me and I wasn't interested in tiptoeing around that subject for the entirety of this school year. He seems to understand that this ship has sailed, but I don't know how much of an adult Red will actually be about the rest of this. Not to mention these solutions are mostly short-term, but this may be a situation that I have to play by ear. 

I don't think we're in good standing. I feel like I don't know him, and I feel used, as though he's just been circling and waiting for an opportunity to spring. I hope we can overcome this, as this will otherwise be an awkward year and potentially the death of one of my longest lasting friendships.

**Cleo:** As for Cleo and I, I told her about what Red told me. She told me she had known for a while that Red was into me, but she also discouraged him from pursuing me. She reasoned that it would interfere with our friend group's dynamic, and it would also be dishonest, considering that he wasn't open about his feelings before. Cleo also thought that Red would forget about it if he went away for a summer and worked with people his age in his field. She apologized for keeping that away from me. I understand where she's coming from a little better. I feel okay with her, but she also wasn't the one who dropped a fricken bombshell on me.

**Santana:** My boyfriend is still being a pretty good sport about all of this. He keeps joking that I should just move some of my clothes and personal items to his place so I can go there on a moment's notice if Red gets unbearable. It's a nice concept, but his apartment is an hour walk from campus and has no readily accessible parking nearby unless you're a tenant. Either way, his good attitude is much appreciated. He also isn't openly angry with Red (at least when he talks to me), which is allowing me to think through things and eventually make better decisions, I think.




  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Y'all guessed it. Red has feelings for me. Cleo knew, and was trying to spare me an awkward conversation with her diversions. Santana is being really helpful. Probably about the best I can expect from this weird situation."

Since then, I have picked up other responsibilities such as the college server, managing the inventory system, and even serving on a faculty committee, while solving issues from ~100 faculty and staff.

&gt; My friend studies abroad and is currently back in our home 
&gt; country during summer break. She has also decided to get 
&gt; an internship during the break. Now all of this makes her 
&gt; understandably stressed out.
&gt;
&gt; At first, she interned at one company, learning the ropes, living the 
&gt; normal 9 to 5 workday etc. She did this for a month. She 
&gt; enjoyed it, but was tired at the end.
&gt; 
&gt; All was well, until her parents decided to use their connections 
&gt; and put her into an intern in a governmental position, **against 
&gt; her wishes**. She understandably, wanted to rest; but her 
&gt; complaints seems to have fallen on deaf ears, somehow.
&gt; 
&gt; To make matters worse, the government intern job turned out to be a 
&gt; nightmare. The superiors saw my friend as just another kid 
&gt; using connections, and instantaneously dismissed her as no-good.
&gt; They give her no real job, having her sit all day in an 
&gt; office, basically doing nothing. And since her parents used their 
&gt; connections, if my friend was to abandon the internship, it 
&gt; would only reflect badly upon her parents. So my friend was 
&gt; forced to endure a job she hated, for another month.
&gt; 
&gt; And to top it all off, she must visit all her family, after the 
&gt; internship is over. With her grandparents living in one part of the 
&gt; country, her parents in another, and my friend herself working 
&gt; alone; she finds this all extremely exhausting. And to visit her 
&gt; family *(something she can't refuse)* would deplete the last of 
&gt; her summer break.

-----
  
She has told me all this over Skype video calls. She is visibly stressed, and cried many times while recounting her experience. She told me that she hated all this, and *Although she loved her parents, she wished they understood how exhausting they made her feel.*

As such, I have been extremely worried about her well-being. I have tried my best to comfort her, saying things like *""You're not alone""*, or *""I'm always here if you ever need me""*. However, I scarcely can meet her in person, and believe these words are just, not enough.

So I plan to bring her some gifts, maybe take her out this weekend for a walk or watch some movies. But I'm not sure what would be the best way to comfort her?

**Edit 2:** I'm not sure whether or not there *is* a better way to comfort her? Even if I bring her gifts, and take her out; I just worry that none of this would be enough.

-----

  **tl;dr**: My very close friend is extremely stressed out by her family and job, how can I best help her?

What is GTA V?
GTA V is the latest edition of the saga Grand Theft Auto, a sandbox arena with a story line, I'm pretty sure that you guys have heard about it. It takes place in the same city than San Andreas (my fav game of the series) and have a new scope in the story, where you can experience the story from the view of each one of the main characters.
Why do I want it? 
Just to play the story line again (I've pass it while taking care the house of my friend while he was on a trip) and to play with one of  my best friends the online mode.
Why i cant get it on my own?

So if you guys can gift it to my i will be really thankfull, and if you can't or don't want it to, there is no problem. Hope you guys have a terrific day. cheers lads!

(also sorry if this seems a bit jumbled, I'm not used to posting)

I personally would like to thank everyone at **Cow Chop** for what they do, for the time they continue to dedicate to the channel for us, the viewers, even during these hard times, whether it be the amazingly funny commentary, the incredible editing, the awesome bits, etc.

I have been wanting to write a post like this for a while, but I think it was their latest CCTV which has really pushed me to say something. Just having four members of Cow Chop (or 3 with guest) sitting down and talking to us, talking about their past videos and adding to them with the extra info is something that I very much enjoy.
To the people who came from The Creatures like I did, I thought the same thing with Creature Talk. Just listening to their stories made me like them that much more. 

I just wanted to say thank you from all of your fans for all that you guys do,

- Thank you **James** for your constant involvement with the fan base and sincerity

- Thank you **Aleks** for your memes and amazing personality

- Thank you **Trevor** for spicing up videos with your uniqueness

- Thank you **Joe** for being you, never change

- Thank you **Brett** for managing such a destructive group (and being a part of it)

- Thank you **Asher &amp; Anna** for your amazing editing work and additions to the group, am loving seeing more of you two in videos

- Thank you **Lindsey** for keeping everyone safe and ""under control""

- And thank you **Intern**, haven't seen much of you but am sure you will do great things too


Don't want this post to be too long, hope to see so much more from you guys and to eventually meet you some day (here's hoping)
Love you guys"
6vlxbt,30,2017-08-23,"Tomorrow will be 9 months sober, but today I was really badly triggered. I could use some advice.",Catalonia1936,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6vlxbt/tomorrow_will_be_9_months_sober_but_today_i_was/,"So I got out of rehab earlier this year and I've never been sober this long in my adult life. I had really bad PAWS for the first few months, lost my job and my license was suspended too. Things finally turned around recently. I just got my license back, landed a really good job and started an internship just last week.

Today I was working at the internship and I went to get some milk in the fridge in the break room. I opened the door to find a whole lotta bottles and cans of alcohol. I slammed the door shut, told my boss I had to leave early and called my sponsor. That was an hour ago and I'm still shaking. I wasn't tempted to drink but being around alcohol still makes me really uncomfortable in a way that is hard to explain, but I'm sure you guys know what I'm talking about.

I'm in the office a couple days a week, and I also know there will be events I'll be working where there will be alcohol as well. I've decided to tell my boss about my recovery. He seems like a good compassionate person, and we even have a mutual friend, so I think I can be honest with him. Anyway, I'm grateful I got through it, but I'm still processing things and felt like sharing this experience.

Side note: the damn milk was expired!

Edit: Thanks for the encouragement guys!"
6vlydf,4,2017-08-23,"Current 2L post-OCI Strikeout, interested in tax law, seeking strategy advice",lawschoothrowaway,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/6vlydf/current_2l_postoci_strikeout_interested_in_tax/,"I am currently a 2L at a T2 school. From 1L grades, I am in the top 10% of my class (technically top 5.5% -- hopefully I will be able to pass that benchmark this semester) and thankfully, I graded onto law review. 

I came straight from undergrad where I was an accounting major. During my summers in between junior and senior year, senior year and 1L, and then 1L and 2L, I have interned at Big Four firms. The first internship was at one Big Four. The subsequent two were at another Big Four firm. (trying to maintain anonymity here)

The internship immediately before coming to law school was straight tax compliance, so just pure accounting. The internship during my 1L summer was with the State &amp; Local Tax department, so more so tax law work.

The SALT team invited me back for next summer. First, they discussed giving me a job offer, but I, diplomatically, asked for just the summer offer because I was applying for BigLaw OCI. Feeling also that it looked better if down the line I wanted to go back to the Big Four firm, that I just rejected a summer, rather than an FT offer.

Essentially, I am interested in either BigLaw or working for this Big Four firm. BigLaw seems to be finicky, in that if you do not get in at the start of your career, it is incredibly difficult to get in later. That is my predicament.

I would say I live in a big, but secondary legal market (in the Northeast). I applied to the BigLaw firms coming for OCI and, thankfully but unfortunately, only got 6 interviews. Overall, I felt like the interviews went well -- no silence or grimaces and I had researched and prepared appropriately for questions and conversation for the full 20 min periods. The only negative it seemed for a lot of the interviewers was my experience and interest in tax. I found myself having to really justify that I was not married to tax, that there were transferable skills, that tax shows up on all business transactions, etc. But given that I have now received two formal rejections and heard nothing from four of them (the interviews were two weeks ago), it seems I was unpersuasive. While I researched and tried to target firms with comparable tax groups (relatively), the interviewers appear to not see it as an opportunity (though in my interviews, I was trying to align myself with straight corporate transactional work).

If I am being honest, I am mostly interested in BigLaw just for the incredible pay. I think I could handle the stress and workload. I also feel like given my credentials, I have as ripe of an opportunity as I ever will to achieve that goal.

The Big Four firm seems like a great place to work and has great benefits and will pay for my LLM and bar (I am pursuing a JD/LLM at my school because my school allows half of the credits to double count). I assume a law firm might do something similar but even if they do not, they are paying it seems like 125% what the Big Four firm is. It really just comes down to the pay.

I am writing this long-winded post to see if anyone, especially those with tax backgrounds, has any advice for my strategy.

Here is what I am thinking:

I have my offer for next summer at the Big Four firm for the same department expiring soon. I am going to try and push back on that as much as I can and see if I potentially move up on the list of one of the no-response firms (trying to be optimistic, I am hoping that I am on some alternate list, like a second wave of callbacks maybe). 

If I end up doing a second summer at the Big Four firm, I will try mass-mailing NYC and applying to, if any are available, 3L BigLaw OCIs for my city. In undergrad, I spent a semester in NYC working for a boutique law firm (not tax) so I have tenuous contacts. I know my law school has a few pockets of JDs in the city as well.

If none of that bears any fruit, hopefully I will receive a full-time offer for the Big Four firm and I will work there for at least roughly two years (part of the deal for them to pay for the LLM -- though if I got a good enough salary laterally, I could pay it off myself), then seek tax associate BigLaw positions in my city and in NYC.

If none of that pans out, try just working up the chain at the Big Four firm.

I am seeking advice just while the metaphorical iron is hot and I have a chance at BigLaw. Does the strategy sound good? Is there anything I should consider (potential pitfalls)?

Thank you so much for your time and any advice you can offer!"
6vm2ih,20,2017-08-23,The religious intern [MMf] [freeuse] [rimming] [watersports],littleloops,Ageplaystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ageplaystories/comments/6vm2ih/the_religious_intern_mmf_freeuse_rimming/,"**The myth**

""So then I shoved it back in her face. At first she didn't want it, but after some persuation she sucked it perfectly clean. Oh man, I gotta tell you, ass to mouth is where it's at!""

Rob closed his eyes while his friend was talking to him. Usually he enjoyed hearing about Jimmy's sexual endeavors, but sometimes he started to feel sorry for the women he fucked. Although he knew he shouldn't, as they were all sad and desperate cases that willingly went home with him. Usually in a drunken state, lured by rumours of the size of his cock.

""And, did she spend the night?""

""No way, I didn't wanna wake up next to that beast, hahaha! Oh boy, but eh, tell me Rob, did you ever do that to your sweet Jolene, ass to mouth? I'm sure she's into that.""

Jimmy certainly had a big cock, but it didn't bring him home the girls that he wanted. Whenever Rob and him are out drinking, he'll be chasing skirts, even though he's in his late fourties. Nothing changed from 30 years ago. He'll start hitting on the most conservative, prudish and up-tight women he can find. Only to be turned down left and right, until he ends up with some ugly fat slut that would fuck a lamp post if it said hello to her. Somehow Jimmy got it in his mind that the modest and timid looking women, Rob's wife included, were the actual freaks in bed. Rob was never able to convince him that his Jolene's prude exterior only concealed more prudishness. God, the last time she gave head to him was his birthday three years ago.

""Ah you don't have to say, I just know she does stuff like that.""

""Well Jim, if you believe it, then there's at least one of us.""

""Okay, whatever man... Oh hey, talking about freaky girls, did you know there exist something like a slave-church?""

""A what?""

""I heard it from a friend of a friend. Apparently there's this cult where the women are told to obey men always. Not only the men of the church, but ALL MEN in general. It's like they're not allowed to say no to anything, including anything sexual. Can you imagine?""

""I don't know Jimmy, I've heard those stories before. If they'd be true, don't you think it would have made the news or something?""

""No really, this guy says he's seen 'em. He said they always wear black and white ribbons in their hair to signify their membership of the cult or something. He said it's really true!""

""Black and white ribbons, you say?""

Rob could not understand why that description sounded so familiar. Only on the drive back home did he remember where he'd seen that before. The new girl that started interning at his office wore two ribbons in her hair, black and white. He is surprised about the coincidence, but it assures him that the story must be fake. That girl was way too young for anything freaky like that. She must be in highschool still. Yet, he couldn't shake the thought off somehow.


**First encounter**

Next day at the office, Rob's eyes automatically pore over the open work space to see if she's there. And yes, there she was, busy working on something at one of the desks. He walks up close to check that she indeed was wearing those ribbons in her hair that he somehow remembered. After tapping on her shoulder she looks up, startled to see one of the senior associates standing next to her.

""Don't be afraid dear. My name is Rob. You've started last week, didn't you? Why don't you come over to my office so that we can introduce each other properly?""

""Uhm, okay.""

Her voice sounds soft and shy. Exactly what you'd expect from her appearance, which was bland to say the least. Her clothes are grey or black, with her skirt reaching well below her knees. Her hair is neat and well-groomed, but also very boring. Yet you could see she had an attractive body as she walked behind Rob towards his office. Rob gave her inspected her curves some more as he closed the door behind her and locked it inconspicuously. She was still quite young, 15 maybe 16, he thought to himself.

""Please sit down and tell me, what is your name?""

""Samantha, sir.""

""Now, welcome Samantha, how do you like our office so far? Has everybody been friendly to you?""

""I like it very much, sir! Everybody is really nice."" she says as she's sitting down opposite Rob's desk. Her friendly eyes are looking straight at him. Rob notices everything about her seems neat and controlled. She sits with her back perfectly straight and holds her knees together as she places her hands on her thighs.

""Say, Samantha... I hope I don't find this question odd, but, are you perhaps religious?""

""Yes sir.""

""And uhm, what denomination are you part of?""

""The church of men's holiness.""

""So, does that mean you believe in a god?""

""Well, our church as a whole does. But we believe only men are able to accomplish faith in God. Women can not an will only serve god through serving men.""

Rob swallows his dry throat, he feels he's getting close. Maybe Jimmy's story wasn't a myth after all. Little Samantha doesn't seem worried and is happily answering the personal questions.

""And those ribbons, do they mean something?""

""Yes all women in our church wear them. Black means we renounce our faith in god, which makes us different from other christians, and white means we acknowledge faith in men as a holy entity.""

""All men? Like, do you see... me as a holy entity?""

""Yes sir.""

""Does that mean you believe or do anything I tell you?""

""Yes sir.""

Rob clears his throat again, he takes a few seconds to build up courage. He knows it's a one way road from here on.

""I'd like you to sit on my lap, Samantha.""

Without hesitation, the girl stands up, walks around the desk and sets herself sideways on his lap. Her eyes still have a friendly, trusty look as Rob gazes in them from up close. He feels the warmth of her buttocks beam through his pants, the soft humps massaging his growing cock. He reaches down and brings up his hand under her skirt. Unfazed she feels him exploring between her thighs before he reaches her panties where his fingers trace the line of her slit.

""As of tomorrow, you should start wearing a shorter skirt.""

""Yes sir.""

""And uhm, also leave the underwear at home.""

""OK.""

Rob's cock is now rock hard. He almost can't believe her willingness to follow his commands. His mind starts racing about all the possibilities, all the things he can do to her that his wife won't let him. Where to begin?

""I need you to suck my cock.""

Samantha gets up, turns towards him, gets on her knees and starts to unbuckle his pants. He looks down flustered on how this innocuous and timid looking girl goes straight for his cock. She strokes it with her hand a couple of times to make sure it's hard and pointing upwards. Then she bends down and let it slide into her warm wet mouth.

""Oh my god!""

Rob grabs his desk and chair for support as the she sucks him like an experienced whore. He almost can't believe such a young girl is able to pleasure him so skillfully. Her lips and tongue dance around and put pressure in all the right places. Now and then she looks up at him as if to check if he's happy enough. All she sees is the middle aged man groaning as he's getting the best blowjob of his life. He feels his orgasm coming, in a brief moment he gets the urge to cum all over her pretty face and her neat hair so that it gets all messed up. But he's too late as his cock already bursts in her mouth. Samantha aptly gulps it all up and keeps sucking until nothing else comes out.

""Oh my.. that was amazing.""

""Thank you, sir! Do you need anything else?""

""Uh... n-no I don't think so. You can go now.""

Samantha walks off in short measured steps and leaves Rob alone, catching his breath while his cock is still hanging out of his pants. Finally he collects himself and hides his cock before trying to focus on his work. During the rest of the day, he frantically tries to find a spot in his agenda to have Samantha come and visit his office again. But luck is not with him, he's left to throw glances at her while running from one meeting to another.


**The next day**

Rob is in a great mood the next day. He's running a bit late because he went to the barber before coming into office. He knows Samantha will obey him anyway, but he wanted to look presentable for her. He made sure there were a couple of holes in his agenda for today where she would be able to pleasure him again. He almost can't contain himself while thinking about all the things he wants her to do to him. But all those feelings quickly dissappear when he can't find her anywhere.

""Say Joe, did you see that new intern of yours today?""

""No, I haven't seen her all morning.""

Rob hides himself in his office. He looks through the employee files but he can't find a telephone number for her. Only at lunch time he decides to look at his phone, where he sees a couple of missed messages from Jimmy. Rob's heart sinks, he knows immediately what has happened. Last night he hadn't been able to keep it to himself, boldly he had texted Jimmy about Samantha, and that she was exactly how those cult women were described.

Rob figures Jimmy must have picked her up before she got to the office. He scrolls through the texts, all saying how amazing she is, until he gets to a picture of little Samantha with Jimmy's cock in her mouth. Hastily Rob grabs his coat and takes his car to Jimmy's house. There, nobody is answering the doorbell, so he decides to call him.

""Jim, you have to let me in.""

""Well, I'm not able to get to the door at the moment, hehe, you're gonna have to let yourself in. The backdoor is open.""

Inside, Rob finds his old time pal lying on his couch, naked. His out-of-shape body draped casually on the leather with his arm lifting up one of his legs. At his bottom end is Samantha, her frail body is down on her stomach with her face buried in between Jimmy's ass cheeks. She holds her head a bit sideways, presumably to reach deeper into his asshole, as his limp cock and balls rest on her cheek. Jimmy is sporting a wide grin as he sees Rob enter the room.

""Well, you weren't lying, she really does anything you tell her to. What an angel.""

Rob drops down in a lazy chair, saddened to see his precious little secret being spoiled by Jimmy's filthy mind. Somehow it irked him that she'd been obeying someone else too.

""She's been licking my asshole for over an hour now. At this point it has become like some sort of meditation, you know?""

""Yeah, I guess she's one filthy slut.""

""Indeed. Uh, you wanna use her? Hey Samantha, you can take a break now.""

The girl gets up from between his legs and sits down on the couch, she's only wearing her skirt. Her face looks surprisingly fresh, considering she's been pressing it between Jimmy's legs for that long. Rob looks at her with a mixture of lust and disdain. He eyes her tits, they look young and perky, as she sits up perfectly straigt again with her hands on her thighs. She has the same look in her eyes as yesterday, friendly and full of trust towards both the middle aged men that are taking advantage of her.

""Hello mister. Would you like me to suck your cock again?""

""Uhm... no thank you."" Rob declines, the thought of her tongue circling Jimmy's asshole for over an hour puts him off. Yet his cock is already hard at the prospect of doing anything he wants with this little toy.

""Well in that case,"" Jimmy interrupts, ""you can suck mine, see if it's ready to get hard again.""

Samantha wastes no time and bends down on Jim's crotch, putting in an effort to get his big limp dick in her mouth. Rob walks up towards her and pulls her up by her hips, positioning her ass up in the air in front of him.

""Did you leave your underwear home like I told you to?""

""Hm hnnn.""

He lifts up her skirt to find her bare, hairless pussy and ass. With one hand he brings the zipper of his pants down and pulls out his hard throbbing cock. He points it at her entrance and grabs her by the hips to pull her onto him. There's no time for the foreplay that he had been planning for her this morning. Now he only wants her to make him cum.

""A good little bitch, that is what you are.""

Samantha keeps working undisturbed on Jimmy's cock while her body rocks back and forth by Rob's forceful hands. He starts to move his hips in the same rhythm and let his balls slam against her clit. Her pussy feels so warm, wet and inviting, it's perfect. Too perfect almost. She makes it look easy to take two cocks at the same time. And for some reason Rob is hating her for that.

""Jim, I think she's getting a bit slow, you should set the pace for her.""

""Good idea.""

Jimmy collects Samantha's hair in a tight knot and uses that to push her down deep on his slowly hardening cock. Samantha takes it gracefully into her throat while keeping a serene expression on her face. Rob gets frustrated she hasn't even made a sound yet. He pulls out his wet cock and lifts it up at her other entrance. Without a warning he pushes into her asshole all at once. Finally he hears a muffled groan emerge from the immature body.

""Yeah, it isn't going to be that easy, you little shit.""

Jimmy's eyes widen, he's never seen his buddy like this. But the squirming and moaning body of the teenager in front of him makes him horny as hell.

""Holy shit Rob, you know how to heat this chick up.""

""Yeah, she needs it rough. Put your cock up her throat, Jim.""

Jimmy answers by pushing Samantha's head all the way down on his stiff cock. He feels his cockhead slip into her throat where it twitches at her gag reflex. Rob is now pounding her asshole with all his power, burying his nails in her hips as he pulls her back each time.

""Oh man, I'm gonna cum down her throat.""

""Good, keep her there, I'll cum at the same time.""

He didn't finish his sentence before they both blow their loads. Samantha's already bulging throat is filled up further with warm old man seed while Rob is putting his load as deep as he can in her backside. Her small body shivers with the feeling of all the cum on both sides.

""Oahh, that's a tight little asshole there. But hold it still, there's more to come.""

""You're gonna cum in her again?""

""No, I'm gonna piss in this whore.""

""Oh, nice!""

Jimmy lets Samantha up to get a breather while still holding his cock in her mouth. Her face is far from serene now that she's coughing and gasping for air while she feels her ass fill up with Rob's warm piss.

""Hmm, that's a good idea, you're gonna get my piss too, babe.""

Seconds later, his declining cock starts pouring piss in her worn-out mouth. She quickly reacts and starts to gulp it down, barely keeping up with the forthcoming stream. Fatigued and empty, Rob pulls out of her and sits down again, satisfied he looks on as she is finishing Jimmy's second load. Filled up and spent, Samantha drops down next to the couch, trying hard not to leak anything from her ass. She looks exhausted and uncomfortable and her hair is a mess with her ribbons coming out.

""Hah, you thought you could easily take on two old geezers huh? Well, let me tell you, we're just getting started with you.""

I work at my family business (customer service) and I'm very active on campus. I am in Sauder and I am involved in multiple commerce competitions (some of which I won). I also was an executive for a club last year and now I'm a marketing associate for another commerce club.

I'm doing what I can to add relevant experience to my resume. Would all that be enough even though I have no internship?

6vmeum,1,2017-08-23,What causes inceldom? Xpost from /r/incelswithouthate,BetUrProcrastinating,debateanincel,https://www.reddit.com/r/debateanincel/comments/6vmeum/what_causes_inceldom_xpost_from_rincelswithouthate/,"Hey guys. I decided to start this community to help normies, incels, and chad alike to understand inceldom. Feel free to have debates and discussions, so long as they are reasonable and civil. Any incels who advocate for enslavement of women, worship ER, use the term ""roastie"" etc. are not welcome. Likewise, any normie who non ironically tells incels to shower should take their shit to /r/inceltears or somewhere. This is a place for CIVIL discussion, thank you.

First off, let me say that I identify as an incel. I started this subreddit because I didn't agree with a lot of the stuff that was being posted in /r/incels , (ER worship, roastie name calling, etc.) and I thought the community as a whole really gave a bad name to us incels. In my opinion, if we want people to take us seriously, we can't post things that discredit the rest of our arguments. Most people are going to see that we worship mass murderers in our sub and completely dismiss us as a bunch of loonies, which I know is not the case. Judging by the number of incels who post in /r/inceltears, the popularity of the less vitriolic /r/foreveralone, as well as the fact that this very subreddit was created shows me that a lot of incels are also unsatisfied with the /r/incels sub.

In my opinion, perhaps the most important question related to incels, and the most relevant in trying to solve it, is ""what really CAUSES inceldom?"" It should follow that if we understand what causes someone to be an incel, we can address those causes and help that person stop being an incel. I know some incel hardliners will say that incels are permanently incel, and I agree that this may be the case for some, but at the same time I know that there must be at least a FEW incels out there who can change.
There are many speculated possible reason for inceldom. In general, most self-proclaimed incels think that physical attributes prevent them from having sex/getting into relationships, such as height, race, frame, and of course-face, while normies tend to think that the personalities, attitude, and my favorite, hobbies, of the incels are the root cause. Of course, this is a massive generalization. There are tons of incels who think that mental illness or social incapability are the culprits, and there are some normies who do say that looks are extremely important. I know I'm making generalizations, but my point is that there are many speculated reasons for inceldom, and that they are generally divided into the physical vs. mental. I've also noticed that incels tend to think that they are permanently fucked, and that they have no ability to change their situation, while normies think that incels can overcome their problems and get into relationships if they put in the work. Furthermore, in my discussion I will not be talking about people who have a very readily apparent reason for inceldom. If you are legitimately disfigured, suffer from severe physical/mental handicaps, live in Antarctica, etc. what I say will not really apply to you. I am addressing the people for whom there is a lot of contention surrounding their incel statuses.
So how do we figure out what actually causes inceldom? Is it face, physique, hygiene, mental illness, bad attitude, a lack of confidence, race, height, acne, disfigurement, accent, location, bad luck, something else, or a mix of all of these? I decided to find out straight from the source. I basically went into /r/iama, /r/casualiama, /r/confession, /r/advice, /r/sex, etc. and typed into the sidebar ""virgin"" and then clicked on all of the threads that had stories from people 25+ who were virgins. I scoured what they had written and all of the suggestions in the comments to try and find a common thread. I did this for a LONG time too, as in, I would go through pages and pages reading this kind of content. It was probably not the best use of my time, lol. But in the end, a pattern did somewhat emerge. Most of the people, at least from their own descriptions, were not ugly. Not to say they were all models, but they seemed around average. There didn’t seem to be one race overrepresented, either. I’m going out on a limb and saying that they were probably all relatively in shape, had hobbies and interests, etc. Hell, most of them seemed to have fine personalities also. The vast majority of them had a few things in common, though- low self esteem, social anxiety, and sometimes depression.
This was what I always suspected. Probably, in part, because it resonated deeply with me. I think that my own social anxiety and abysmal social abilities have been the number one thing preventing me from getting into a relationship. I’m not particularly ugly, I’m not a horrible person (at least I hope, lol), I’m not super short, I’m not bland or boring- I just have absolutely no friends and no social ability, lol.

https://mic.com/articles/112062/the-way-most-people-meet-their-significant-others-is-not-what-you-think#.S3MWfyrUJ

I think the above link is very telling. The page details how most people meet their romantic partners. And guess what? 39% met their romantic partners through mutual friends, and 22% more say that they met their’s in a social setting. Not only does a person with very severe social anxiety have to deal with coming off as a complete tool around women, they also have to worry about not even having the chance to meet people in the first place. If you have very few friends and rarely go out to social outings because of your anxiety or inability to interact normally with others, that makes it much, much harder to meet people. Online dating sources CAN work, but they require a good amount of know-how and are based heavily on looks.

Let me explain why I think some of the other attributes are not as important as some may think they are when it comes to getting into a relationship.

Physique- Ugh, sorry normies, lifting and showering isn’t as useful as you may think it is. Yes, being in shape does make you more attractive. But let’s look at the population of America for a second. Something like ⅔ of people are overweight or obese in this country. The majority of people are very sedentary, don’t go to the gym, are not active, and have poor bodies. Yet inceldom only affects like 1% of men. Sure, getting in shape is great, but normies treat it like the key to getting laid. Getting in shape will do nothing for most incels, except those who are severely overweight. Getting shape is good advice to give to normies who want to get laid MORE, but is in general not great for incels. Our problems lie deeper.

Hygiene, poor dress, bad haircut- Once again, same as physique. In some extreme cases this COULD help incels, but the majority of us are average. As in, we have average hygiene, dress fine, and have a fine haircut. Not only is this not great advice for getting laid, it’s also insulting. You guys just assume all of us are filthy neckbeards living in our parents’ basement.

Lack of hobbies/interests- Just plain insulting and untrue. I’m willing to bet the average guy on /r/incels has some interesting hobbies.
Personality and attitude- This is where it gets kind of dicey. I know normies are going to shit themselves saying this is our problem, but I’m kind of skeptical. Here’s what I’ll say. In order to maintain a relationship, having a good personality and attitude is very important. You can’t hide yourself from your partner forever. As for merely getting INTO a relationship or having sex… I really don’t think it’s that important. Think about how many complete douchebags, murderers, psychopaths, and abusers have gotten into relationships. I’m not saying it doesn’t matter, I’m just saying it’s not one of the more important issues.

I think my argument basically boils down to this: You see guys all the time who are assholes, or who lack hobbies, or who have bad haircuts/clothes, or, hell, unattractive/fat get girlfriends. Do you see many super socially anxious or borderline autistic people with GFs? I sure haven’t.

Now, I know at this point incels (and probably some normies) are getting ready to spam their keyboards and call me a fakecel or whatever for saying that social ability is the most important thing. I am still acknowledging that looks are important, guys. Ugly people are going to have an objectively harder time getting laid than attractive people; that much is obvious. But I’m not blaming you, incels. I think a lot of normies forget that incels don’t really have control over their social skills/really bad anxiety or depression. And this is part of the reason normies’ advice is ridiculed.

When I was looking at the posts of older virgins, I noticed they had something else in common Normies LOVE to give advice in the comments. A good portion of it was mostly “hit the gym, dress better, get hobbies, etc.” BS that you see everywhere. I think the reason that normies love to give this advice is because they like the idea of a just world. They like to think that if someone just WORKS ON HIMSELF hard enough, he’ll be able to get out of their wretched pit of despair. And telling people to hit the gym or dress better is very formulaic; if you follow this advice, it will work 100% of the time. People who go to the gym get in better shape. People who buy better fitting clothes dress better. People who get more hobbies have another thing to tack on to their resume, etc. The problem is that normies don’t want to admit that maybe there’s a deeper problem. It is MUCH harder to give advice to try and fix festering social anxiety and inhibition than it is to help someone dress better.

And you could see this in the advice that the normies gave when it came to mental health. While half of the comments that were giving advice told incels to dress better, get hobbies, etc. the other half pointed out the mental problems of the OP. They acknowledged that social anxiety or social inability or whatever was a huge hurdle. But they failed to really give advice. They gave a smug diagnosis of OP’s problems, telling him he had a bad attitude (although he acted more civil than a lot of the people in the comments) and saying he just had to “be confident” and “work on himself” and other mindless drivel like that. This advice is ridiculous. Not because it’s bad, but because it’s so vague. What does “be confident” even mean? How do you do it? How do you simply overcome mental illness? There’s no step by step solution for this. This is why normies love to give the shower-gym-dress spiel. Because they like thinking that the world is fair, and that there’s always a formula to overcome any challenge. For mental illness there is no formula. Hell, there might not even BE a solution. This scares normies, I think.

But for a moment, I’ll go back to the problem of mental illness/lack of confidence/lack of social ability/low self esteem/whatever you want to call it. Can you truly fix these kinds of issues? Normies will say yes, incels will say no. I understand both sides of the argument, and I think the answer lies in the middle. I would say it is POSSIBLE, but the likelihood differs from person to person. Some people may be able to overcome their poor social skills, some may not. It depends on the person and the circumstances. I think it’s a lot like being poor. If you’re born into a poor family in a poor neighborhood, sure it’s possible to become rich. But this is rare, because they have their environment working against them. Bad schools, violence, and an ingrained acceptance of one’s fate are all contributing factors that kind of lock people into poverty. And this is demonstrable. People rarely escape poverty (at least in the USA).

It’s kind of the same for incels. I know it’s not a perfect analogy, but work with me on this one. I’m going to lay out the genesis of an incel. Someone who is ugly-average, odd socially, maybe also has bad acne, is short, is a minority, has a weird voice, or some other foible. They don’t have a lot of friends, get bullied, and lack acceptance. And I think people don’t realize how damaging not being accepted by others can be. Humans are social animals, and to be denied friendship, family, or romantic success can genuinely hurt someone. And yeah, there are incels who DO have friends, but are nonetheless very socially awkward with women, but romantic success is just as important as friendship, IMO. And so they get low self esteem from not having friends/not having a relationship, and this impacts their social anxiety more, and the process continues. And a huge part of a man’s success is how he does with women. If a man is not only rejected, but HUMILIATED by women, that can have a serious effect on his self esteem. And like poverty, this cycle is very hard to break out of. Make not impossible, but quite difficult.

To an extent, when normies talk about “changing your personality” I always get kind of a “pray the gay away” vibe. There are certain mental problems you can fix, and some you can’t. Can autistic people stop being autistic if they try hard? Can schizophrenics stop their mental illness if they just try hard enough? Can depressed people just “change their attitude?” Maybe, maybe not. Best case scenario it’s exceedingly difficult. Worst case scenario, it’s not possible. I’m really curious about this actually. Can someone really cure severe social anxiety and lack of social skills? I have heard of it being done, but mental illness is a very personal thing that varies from person to person. For some it may be possible, for others not so much. My basic point is that the psyche is an immensely complicated thing with many factors. It’s not fair for normies to tell us just to change our personality, especially when the vast majority of them didn’t need to do this.

So far I’ve mainly been talking about social ineptitude, but now I’ll address the other major factor that we incels face: looks. I know I said before that looks may not be the deciding factor in getting a relationship, but they are extremely important nonetheless. The only reason I don’t think that it’s the main hindrance we face is because the majority of incels seem to be around average in terms of looks. The main problem is that a lot of normies pretend like it doesn’t matter at all. Even those of us who aren’t ugly get shit for our looks. I have been teased for how I dress/how I look many times in my life. This is an obvious blow to one’s self esteem, which just makes the problem worse.

And I think from here we get the crux of the incel problem. Incels suffer from social anxiety, being bullied, social rejection, etc. often combined with some relatively unattractive traits, but are mostly somewhat physically average. This toxic combination has caused us to be socially isolated and in many cases scorned by society. This breeds anger and resentment. But our anger is also directed at the hypocrisy of modern society. This is where you come in, normies. There are so many contradictions and delusions perpetrated by normies/society that it drives us crazy. The most prominent one I mentioned before is how normies lie about what makes someone ‘attractive.’ Apparently one of the most important things is personality, so even someone who’s super ugly can find someone. How come so many assholes get gfs, then? How come plenty of nice people (genuinely nice, too, not nice guyTM) never find anyone because they are timid and ugly? If an incel says something even remotely weird or assholish on the internet normies will flock and condescendingly berate the incel saying “this is why you’re single. You just need to improve your attitude” completely ignoring that many psycopaths get laid. Richard Spencer, the fucking WHITE SUPREMACIST had girlfriends (asian ones too, for some reason). Does that mean he has a personality that’s better than a sexually frustrated man in his late 20’s who occasionally vents on the internet?

How come normies try to downplay the importance of looks and height? They’re not as important as social status and charisma, but they are absolutely necessary for any relationship. I remember one instance: I was at my internship the other day, and two girls were talking to each other. One of them said she was hanging out the other day with a guy she thought was annoying. OK no problem, normal conversation. Then the other girl asked if he was cute and she said that he looked fine but was shorter than her. The other girl literally said “ew.” Like, WTF? Some girl literally acted disgusted because a guy was short. I hear this kind of shit constantly about other men, (and myself) and I bet I would hear it even more often if I had any friends. Normies like to pretend that height and looks aren’t important, but ugly, short men are some of the most ridiculed people in the world. Do you know how I know? Go to the sub /r/themasterrace which makes fun of white supremacists/nazis based on their looks. One of the posts had a picture of that dude that punched that chick in the Berkeley rally, and it turns out he’s short. People in the comments were lambasting him for it. This is what society thinks of short men. Normies pretend to have the high ground, saying that plenty of short guys get gfs, but then turn around and gleefully mock a short guy under the guise of him being a white nationalist. Why not just make fun of him for his other glaring flaw, which is, IDK, that he wants a fucking white ethnostate?

The advice normies give is self serving, unhelpful, and contemptuous. Another instance of hypocrisy- normies go on /r/incels or /r/foreveralone picture threads and say that the guys all look around average, but then turn around and act like we’re neckbeards, telling us to improve our hygiene and lose weight. Average looking guys get laid, we look average, so what gives? Normies pretend like Tinder is fair. Tinder is literally the worst shit ever invented if you’re an ugly dude. I had this stupid conversation with this girl on /r/inceltears who was CONVINCED that she could tell if someone was confident by just looking at their pictures… Normies tell us things will get better and that “we’ll find someone eventually.” You guys realize that plenty of people die alone, as virgins, right? Stop trying to assuage us, please. We want the truth. Normies act like we should be happy that when we get older more women will want us. We should be happy that we are plan B? We should be happy that women will only consider to date us when they can no longer get with young, hot guys because their looks have begun to degrade, and they want to settle down with someone “stable” i.e. has money? What happens years later when it becomes obvious that she isn’t attracted to us and acts cold and distant? Normies give us conflicting advice on whether we should try as hard as we can to get laid or take a break from trying and focus on our hobbies and education. They tell us that nobody cares if you’re a virgin, ignoring the fact that something like half of women over a certain age said they wouldn’t date a virgin (sorry don’t have a source off-hand but sure I saw this somewhere) and that one of the go to insults on the internet is calling someone a virgin. It mainly boils down to the fact that normies just can’t accept that some people out there are assholes.

We incels are definitely angry b/c of a lack of romantic/social success, but also because of hypocrisy in society. Here’s a message to all of the normies out there. If you honestly want to help, have some compassion. Incels are going through really painful struggles. Don’t tell us lies; don’t pretend like the world is a fair place.
You being condescending and giving us the most generic advice is not helpful. Think of it like being poor. Sure, telling a poor person to work hard, learn programming, or whatever is solid advice, but it’s downright cruel to insinuate that it’s their fault. The odds were stacked against them. It’s the same for incels. We got dealt a shit hand in terms of relationships and social ability, and while the generic advice isn’t necessarily bad, it’s unhelpful to present it like “follow this advice and you’ll get laid, if you don’t, it’s your own fault.” Stop trying to act like we wanted this shit to happen.
So what now? Are incels permanently fucked? Not necessarily. Hell, I really don’t know. I’m not a psychologist or anything; I’m just some random dude on the internet. I know people in the past have overcome various mental hurdles, so I’m sure it’s possible for at least a few incels to fix their situations. I think most of the advice normies give is good for distracting yourself, but it probably won’t stop you from being incels. Getting a new jacket or becoming slightly more muscular isn’t going to undo years of mental anguish. Getting in shape is good advice period, but don’t do it with the expectation of automatically getting laid afterwards. My main advice would be to stop using /r/incels , /r/foreveralone , etc. Going on those subreddits is only going to make you more angry and bitter. Going to a therapist and going to more clubs (if you’re still in college) are both good pieces of advice. If you disagree or have something to add I would be glad to have a conversation in the comments."

(just a long slow goodbye)",Zero-meia,hearthstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6vms4i/thank_you_hearthstone_just_a_long_slow_goodbye/,"The only monster card game I’d had contact before HS was Yugioh. I’m brazilian and here the cartoon was really popular, I was a kid back there and the real cards were really expensive, so me and my friends used to make some cards from paper. Well, until I got a PS1 and a game called Yu Gi Oh: Forbidden Memories, a hell of a great game. Amused me the opportunity to play a card game virtualy. I remember I had a friend that was starting to work as intern those days and he printed like 100 hundred pages of codes of that game. It was good times.

After that, I didn’t had another video game nor played another virtual card game for a while. I still played some games on my computer though, there was those Nintendo emulators and I played a lot of Zelda. Then, I discovered DotA, my first online  game, I played a lot of the good old DotA in garena. Then came Dota 2. Jesus, I was dragged in and that was kind of worrying. I could spend the whole weekend playing it and it was like just a couple of minutes was gone. I was working and studying back there, and I didn’t had much time to kill, so, I started my calvary trying to stop playing that. It was hard, really hard, and one of the things that helped me there was it: Hearthstone.

So, I don’t remember too well how I first found about it, but I remember reading about it in the official website. I remember that the concept of heroes felt really nice, I haven’t seen that in Yu-gi-oh! I started playing a little before GVG coming out, it was a really simple game. I remember getting my first classic mage cards, then continuing getting other classes cards: Hunter was solid, I liked to play the 2/7 beast, it was strong. Shaman was so good, giving 3 to all minions was really OP. I remember going to the blizzard forum asking if I should build a murloc shaman deck and people answering that I should make a midrange deck instead.

A while after that, GVG came out. So, I watched a tourney and there was Strifecro, he beated everyone with two great decks: Midrange Paladin and Mech Mage. I got Dr. Boom from my first GVG pack, so I thought about making that Mech Mage deck, and I did. The deck was good and I finally got enough courage to play on ranked and I went surprisingly well, climbing till rank 13 or so, a great deal. I started to save gold for Naxxramas ’cause I wanted that juicy Loatheb. I got all the wings and started to fool around with other classes. Druid was interesting with the ramp mechanic, but I didn’t had the good cards people used to play in that class. Paladin was nice, I had oppened one quartermaster and the golden truesilver champion was beautiful. I played a lot of Paladin, including ranked games, and it was sweet. The early game with zombie chow and shielded minibot has really solid, but it still lacked a bit of ‘legendary’ plays, so I saved some dust and crafted for the first time a legendary: Tyrion Fordring.

I was getting better and better and understing more and more of the game and then one month I got really up in the ladder, at rank 2. But it was like hitting a wall, I won a game, I lost a game, and on and on, for hours, everyday, so I just got back to casual. One day, I came home drunk, late at night, and decided to play some hearthstone. I started to play ranked, it was 30th, the last day of the season, I got a row of victories finishing at legend! WOW, first time legend. Felt great.
After that, I’d played almost everyday, accounting every bit of gold I received. Finally crafted the epic druid cards for the combo deck and got legend with that too! I got hyped by BRM, disappointed by TGT, surprised by LOE, renewed by WotOG. All those expansions were wonderful and during all that time I felt like HS was just joy in my life.

Kharazan then came out and for the first in HS I felt like I already knew everything that was going to happen. I predicted which cards would be good, I got legend with Midrange Hunter staring Barnes and Grandma, then, I got bored. I still played every week, not everyday though. MSoG was announced as I got a bit more of interest in the game again, started to play more regularly. The expansion was released, I tried some decks, it was fun at the beggining but just a week or two after, it was like “pirates vs renos” and then it all got SO FUCKING BORING. For the first time I just stopped play the game. I didn’t even open it once for week, I just stopped with no regrets.

Time flied, a lot happened in my life and I heard about Un’goro. You know, after all of that joy HS gave to me I had never bought a expansion nor adventure, the only thing I had bought till there was that humble deal. I felt I was in debt with the game, so I pre-ordered the expansion. No regrets at all! Un’goro was what HS needed: New kind of monsters, new kind of cards, a cool background, cards rotatting out. Everything was great again.

Now, with KotFT, the game is stale once again. I got a lot of cards and I’m currently at rank 3, playing mostly big priest, deck is fun. The druid reign is indeed a piece of shit, I don’t feel like playing standard ladder for a while but don’t get me wrong, this is not what is making me leave. Once again, like happened with Dota2, my routine is asking for less “time killed” and the only thing I can cut is HS. I think this time it will hurt a lot more than it hurted with Dota because all of these cards I have gather with so much effort. It is so hard to let then go, I mean, I will not be saving gold for the next expansion, what will I do if I want to come back??? Well, it won’t have a come back this time. This “druid reign” is just that little mistake your girlfriend would do then you can say you are breaking up with her because of that. Now I have an excuse to quit HS without feeling too bad about it. I’ll play against Lich King and try to get Arthas, but then I’m done. I will probably still watch some streamers as I still do with Dota 2, but that will be it. I will never again hit a fireball at anyones face.

I think this it. I’m sorry about this bad wrote bullshit, as I said, I’m not an english native speaker so I think I may have made some mistakes or made this too boring. I just did this because it has been so long since I’ve been visiting this sub, it feels like you’re my friends sometimes (well, sometimes you are just pricks), so I wanted to let this last open letter here to everyone knows how great this game was for me. I hope everyone of you feel at least a piece of the joy I did with the game. Well met, everyone! Well met, Hearthstone!

TL;DR: I'm just leaving Hearthstone and I think it was great while it lasted.

Edit: I won't be giving my account way."

how soon should I expect to get my first job right out of school? 
I keep hearing that its so hard for a new grad to get a job. but I also know that people with negative experiences tend to be the loudest. so I take what they say but I keep in mind that fact.

what would you suggest I can do while in college to prepare myself? 
were should I look for a job market wise are any specific states better then others? I am in mn right now

I really just want to be able to start my life after school if I have to ill work for free or as a minimum wage engineer to just get the experience if its that hard but I understand how important it is to have experience.

how should I find internships as well should I go door knocking for them? are there any good websites? I apologize if I am blasting questions I really just want to make sure I can prepare properly to perform and not be like those who cant find anything

I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I'm in sales now if that will help anything I have thought about sales engineering but unsure still. I'm really truly interested in mechanical engineering. I am the first in my family to start at a young age and get a degree so my parents cants give advice due to lack of experiences.

I'm an engineering student, and I usually intern over the summer in a business casual setting. I've never had a haircut that I've been super happy with and I'm looking for advice before heading back to school. I'd like something with decent length on top but that's easy to style a bit more professionally when I need to.Maybe something that I can keep basically the same,but have trimmed a little shorter for an office environment.

I've included some pictures of my current hair combed up and down.

This is how I usually style it with some Pomade, though it's usually a bit shorter than it is currently

6von70,0,2017-08-24,On being okay with not knowing,curiousthrowaway2121,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6von70/on_being_okay_with_not_knowing/,"I’ve been having an internal struggle for a few weeks now. I’m currently in my second serious relationship. I’m 35, but I was married in my early 20’s for almost 10 years, got divorced, dated different guys for awhile, and then got serious with my current boyfriend (we have been together a little over 2 years). We just moved in together a couple months ago. Before that, he was doing an internship out of state for a year (we did a long distance relationship), and before that, we were definitely still in the first year “emotional-rollercoaster/honeymoon phase.” So, in a way, we’re getting to know each other all over again now that we live together. 

Here’s where the issue lies: My first relationship began when I was in college. First guy and I basically became adults together. I had never had a boyfriend or had sex before him, and he had been in one relationship and had sex with 2 girls. I knew everything about him, and we were pretty dependent on each other, him more than me. As we got older, I drifted away, spending more time outside of the relationship (never cheating, just trying different hobbies and hanging out with friends more), and he became jealous, needy, and demanding. It was driving us both crazy and eventually led to our divorce. Fast forward to current relationship, in which new guy and I both have much more extensive experience (in life and sexual relationships), and we have a lot of separate friends and interests. He’s had sex with 20 girls. I’ve had sex with 8 guys. Plus there are other people we’ve dated, flirted with, etc. When we first met, we shared bits and pieces of our sexual histories with each other, so he got a lot more of mine than I got of his. And now that we’re living together, the “missing pieces” are kind of driving me crazy. And he is hesitant to share much else, saying he doesn’t even really remember much about some of his experiences and he doesn’t want to upset me or make me jealous.

However, for me, ignorance is not bliss. I am hungry for information. I’m curious, I’m a Facebook stalker, and I remember things. Even though he only told me parts of the stories with some of the girls he’s been with, I basically pieced most of it together using Facebook and details he’s mentioned in passing. I could name at least 12 of the 20 girls he’s slept with, and I probably know how he met them or some specific detail of their relationship. I’m not doing this because I’m crazy and jealous; I’m doing it because it gives me peace of mind. The more I know about his former flings and relationships, the less I worry about them. In particular, I know a lot of details about two specific girls he’s been with because he told me a lot more about them, and they don’t make me jealous at all. One of them is even still pretty good friends with him, and they chat on the phone every couple months (she lives out of state). 

It’s the girls he “doesn’t remember much about” that are making me a little crazy. Some of them are on Facebook with their cute little bikini pics, which sometimes make their way onto his computer. Some are in his phone, and he’s texted them (sometimes a little too intimately) while he’s been with me. I know these things NOT because I’ve purposely snooped, but because when he’s given me access to his phone and computer, some texts and files have been obvious, and I notice things. We’ve discussed it. The texting was a big deal (it was within the first year of our relationship), and he says he’s stopped doing it. The pics on his computer are a recent discovery, and that’s why I’m feeling so anxious lately. I do not care that he has pics of naked/half-naked girls on his computer. I have plenty of dick pics. What bugs me is the mystery; the “not knowing.” I don’t know who these girls are. I don’t know if he had sex with all of them or has recently spoken to them or if they're just random. I told him I noticed the pics (they were in a “recent documents” folder that I was looking in for something else) and that it upset me, mostly because some of the files were created this year. He assured me he is not cheating and he loves me. He explained that yes, he’s saved pics recently of some girls on Facebook (and it’s true that not all the pics were nudes; most were just girls in bikinis or revealing outfits). And I believe him. He can masturbate to whatever he wants. My body is as good as or better than the girls he’s looking at, so I should have nothing to worry about.

But I still feel anxious. I want to know EVERYTHING. All the girls he’s slept with, all the girls he’s fantasized about, all of the pictures on his computer. All of their names and faces and bodies and stories. And I know I’m being crazy. I know that’s not a healthy thing and I need to trust him and give him some space and accept that I can’t know everything about his sexual past and his current fantasies. And if I don’t accept it, I’m probably going to ruin the relationship by becoming the jealous, needy, demanding type of person that I divorced.

So I’m not looking for advice. I just want to share this feeling and see if anyone else can relate. It’s been hard to NOT snoop now that I know there is probably more to see, but I know in the long run I have to be okay with not knowing.

tl;dr: I’m obsessing over my boyfriend’s sexual past and fantasies, but he’s mysterious about it.

6vorxu,2,2017-08-24,Mixed messages - can I get her back?,quick201290,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/6vorxu/mixed_messages_can_i_get_her_back/,"I just want to preface this by saying this is a small thing, but confusing enough for me to ask for opinions.

My ex and I broke up just under two weeks ago, her feelings changed, yet in our 'breakup conversation' she said we're compatible, I tick all the boxes, I'm everything she wants in a boyfriend, and she doesn't think she'll find anyone like me again, and one more thing to add to that, I asked if deep down she still wanted me as her boyfriend, she paused for a bit and said ""don't twist things"", which would make anyone think that deep down, yes she still wants me as her boyfriend, but for whatever reason that's not happening at the moment, yeah that's a confusing way to end things with someone, however, that's not the small confusing thing I'm wanting an opinion on.

The small confusing thing, or things rather is that on the Saturday just gone, so roughly a week after breaking up, she tagged me in a Facebook post, something that was an inside joke between us, to add to that she liked an Instagram post of mine, and to further add to that so did her sister. Like I said it's small, but doing that a week after breaking up is not exactly a normal thing to do, unless there's some sort of regret there, and for her sister to like my post as well, you could imagine how that makes me think; her sister told her that we look really good together, and she likes me (being with her sister), her sister thinks pretty rationally, and I'd say that she'd warn my 'ex' against doing anything that may lead me on, I don't know, I'm confused.

We both stress a lot, and we're currently both on a very stressful 10 week internship, where we would really have much of an opportunity to see each other, which I think is the main reason why things ended, there was nothing negative between us, it just seemed to fizzle out with the stress of study, the internship and work.

I obviously want her back, and I feel like I'm in a fairly rational mind frame at the moment, I'm not an emotional wreck or anything like that, I know there's a lot there between us, and I know when to give up. Any opinions or advice? Normally people advise against getting back together after a breakup, but I truly think our circumstance isn't the common breakup, I was her first boyfriend, kiss, date etc. everything was new for her.

What I'm thinking is that we go out with our mutual group of friends a few times, see how she is, and then go from there. What do you think?

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend tagged me in 'inside joke' Facebook post, liked me Instagram post and so did her sister, a week after breaking up. Says we're compatible, everything she wants in a boyfriend etc. Can I get her back, if so, how?"

There was a manager Peter that was  known to target interns for sex. Already in my first two weeks I had heard of him and had been  warned. On my 4th week at the company we had gone out for a happy hour with a few colleagues and Peter.

Everyone was drinking copious amounts of alcohol that several of the senior people were paying for. Towards the middle of the night Peter started flirting with me, being the slut that I am I flirted back. At some point of the night I decided to go to the restroom when I came out Peter was standing in the corner.

He smiled at me and stopped me from moving past him wrapping an arm across my waist. He then kissed me and took me into a restroom with him. I was too drunk and horny to resist. The bar had several single bathroom stalls that served either men or women. Inside he wasted no time and pushed me to my knees. He unbutton his slacks revealing his fat cock that he promptly pushed into the back of my throat. After roughly fucking my throat he pulled me up and made me face the mirror. He lifted my skirt pulled down my panties and inserted two fingers into my pussy. He commented on my wetness before plunging his fat cock into my pussy. He then proceeded to pound me hard as he fish hooked me and squeezed my breasts hard. Soon after he grabbed my throat has he ejaculated inside of me. I could feel his juices dripping out of me as he exited the stall and slammed the door behind him.

I took a few moments to clean myself up a bit before going out. The fuck had been good but I hadn't cum. When I joined the group at the table I noticed that many had left. I saw Peter laughing and having a shot with someone else I did not recognize. Peter caught my eye and beckoned me with a shot of whatever they were having. I didn't really want to hang out with him anymore but I didn't want to look suspicious so I decided to act naturally and join him and the stranger who turned out to be his friend. The shot was tequila. I was sitting opposite both men. As I sat down I could feel Peter's cum drip out of my pussy.

I kept drinking more although I knew I should have stopped. From time to time I could feel either Peter or his friend rubbing their legs against mine. I would move my leg away each time. Finally I needed to go to the restroom again. this time when I came out of the stall Peter's friend stood in front of me. he said something like ""Peter told me how much fun he had and I would like some too"". I just nodded and let him push me back into the stall.

He wasted no time and took my panties off. He pulled his trousers down helped me sit on the edge of the sink and penetrated me. His cock felt smaller than Peter's but it was really hard and he fucked me deep placing my feet on his shoulders. I came this time as he too nutted in me. Again I took some time to clean off but this time the friend had taken my panties with him. As soon as I came out  Peter and his friend said their goodbyes and left. The group soon dwindled and feeling too drunk to drive I called my now ex to come and get me. By the time he arrived I was the only one from the group left in the bar.

I felt very dirty and tried as best as I could to conceal the fact that I was not wearing any panties and that I had the cum of two guys dripping out of my pussy. I was too tired to shower when we got back  so I just cleaned off and went to bed naked as I normally do. I remember waking in the middle of the night as the pig of my ex  fucked me hard. He too finished in me. "
6vql4a,4,2017-08-24,[Need Advice] I think I just pre-broke up with him? (18F &amp; 19M),c-xfc,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/6vql4a/need_advice_i_think_i_just_prebroke_up_with_him/,"I've been dating my boyfriend long distance for a year and a half now. We've always been long distance, we went to different high schools and go to different colleges so there's actually no point in time where we're in the same town. We met at a statewide internship program thingy. This is, quite honestly speaking, my first ""real"" relationship. 


I was hesitant to get into a relationship at first, given that college was starting soon, but I did anyway. Given that I had my doubts, I've thought pretty often about our relationship and whether or not we should break up--the thing I have no idea when the end date is. He's busy all day because he's in rehearsals as a music major, and I'm busy because I'm a STEM major balancing a job and extracurriculars and all that fun stuff. And we don't know if we'll ever end up in the same city what with grad school and stuff. I had been talking to a friend the other night about our relationship and the fact that we should be thinking about big girl things like internships and study abroad applications and other applications. I guess I was being vague and weird over text because my bf asked me out of nowhere if I was breaking up with him, then he called me, then I got emotional and we made each other cry. We were at a weird standstill for maybe 45 minutes and the decided to sleep on it.


I think I really do care about him a lot. I'm happy when I'm with him and he treats me very well. However, I'm a very anxious person and frankly the fact that he's so good to me worries me. I tell him about my fears about the future, because, let's be real, with less than 2 decades of life experience how do we know where we're going? He tells me we can deal with it when we get there, and that he just wants me to be a part of his life. 


I think I'm scared I don't know if I'm in love with him or just the idea of him, or if I'm scared of being lonely and we're actually not compatible. To be honest, we're friends with very different types of people and are from two entirely different cultural backgrounds, and there's some fundamental personality things where we aren't exactly similar. We're supposed to talk about it again today and I don't know what to say. I suggested taking a break last night, which is a really awful thing to say because I feel like it communicates ""if I don't find someone better I'm going to come back for you,"" which is certainly not the case. I just need some time to figure things out about myself, but he's very sensitive and took everything personally. I'm just at a loss."
6vr8gf,12,2017-08-24,No idea what to do,NanoAggression,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/6vr8gf/no_idea_what_to_do/,"I have to get this off my chest.

Two nights ago I was hurting badly after a whole series of shitty things happened. My partner's friend spewed some awful, dishonest garbage on facebook over a conversation about renting a room. I wasn't even a part of it. I lost a friend by doing literally nothing.

My boss essentially told me that I won't get a job in the department I've been diligently interning full time for. I've been wasting my time chasing yet another job I won't get. In fact, I haven't had a paid job since 2008, they've all been volunteer positions or internships. A quick glance of my resume screams ""pushover"". I have the patience to pursue unpaid internships for years and the technical skills to match, but there never seems to be any money for me. McFuckingDonalds turned me down.

My landlord says I owe money, even though the paper trail and math prove I don't. For months, I've asked her to fix the bathroom plumbing, the black mold, the doors. At one point none of the doors locked (which only changed after WE installed new locks). Someone could have broken in during the four months I was there. So I moved out. I've been moving for two weeks straight. Of course, no one helped me move. Why would they? Everyone I ask is always busy enough to not help, but not busy enough to smoke weed and play GTA all night.

My partner has no car, so I drive her to work. I work with her. I literally spend my life with her (99% of the time it's fun) but sometimes I want space. So when we got in an argument and she stormed out of the house I just fucking lost it. 

It always feels like I can't complain or speak my mind. I always seem to be wrong. I always get my feelings downplayed and dismissed. I always seem like a second thought. Tolerated. 

When I do say anything, I make people extremely uncomfortable, and they're always surprised and defensive. Hence, I'm a massive pushover. When it comes to asserting my needs, I'm a professional at bending over and taking it. People just walk all over me and have no clue how shitty they are to me. 

So there I was, sitting in my room having a panic attack (rare for me), making a noose out of some rope. Even though I could barely see through my tears, I tied the other end to something sturdy and just sat there, telling myself to put the rope around my neck and let it happen. The thing is though, the process took so long that I was too worn out to even lift my body to finish the task. I just sat with numb shaking hands and dissociated. She knocked on my door after some time to ask if I was ok, which scared me back into reality. 

I was so close to ending my life, and now life is so bland again. I can't feel anything. I'm just forcing a smile and faking everything I do. Everyone describes me as intelligent, empathetic, sweet, pragmatic, and mindful. They are traits the American society clearly doesn't value. People wonder how I'm unemployed, but I don't. They never wonder how I'm doing though, and I'm dying.

I'm drowning. Something inside me died, and it hurts so so badly. If I had a button in front of me that ended my life I would push it. "

If you could also name some companies that hire/accept new graduates, I'll be glad.

EDIT (Background): I've mostly coded in C++ till now. Did some python this summer for a SaaS startup. Also did some standard web dev there (MongoDB, NodeJs, the works). Overall I'm a pretty quick learner considering I didn't know anything and started pushing code on my 3rd day during my internship. I won't say I'm very good at DS&amp;A but I'm well above the average and have qualified Google's 2 tech phone screens (they were the easier ones) with some other random couple coding tests. Did a GSoC last summer which involved C++, some libs, and Qt. Made a couple projects (basic Ray Tracer, 2D game with SFML). All this doesn't really count as a ""skill"" but I'm just a fresher. Haven't picked up something to specialize in till now, to be deemed as a skill. My only skill till now would then be, an above average general software engineer, lol"
6vs23h,2,2017-08-24,"My China Internship Scam Poem To Yuri, The Owner Of Gi2c",abuginmybagel,WorkInChina,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkInChina/comments/6vs23h/my_china_internship_scam_poem_to_yuri_the_owner/,"**My China Internship Nightmare**

I wanted to find work in China,
So I went surfing on the internet you see.
In hopes of finding a new job and life,
When I saw the ads from Gi2c.

Call now for free details,
The ad beckoned to me.
What the hell I thought,
The call and info are both free!

So I clicked on the chat line,
And a friendly girl Mary attended to me.
“You’re so lucky” she insisted,
That I stumbled across Gi2C!

She told great stories of others
Who found back door jobs you see
That are only available in China
With companies connected with Gi2c.

But to get my foot in their door,
I’d have to prove myself first as an intern.
And if I didn’t hurry, I ‘d have to stand in line,
To wait months for my turn.

As luck would have it she said,
A huge MNC had only one vacancy.
She urged me to rush her “right now”,
My current photo and CV.

I was so darn excited,
I did exactly as she said,
Then I tossed and turned-trying to sleep,
As I thought of my great future in China ahead.

Wow, to be working so soon in China…
With a huge international MNC…
This would surely be, the very best thing,
That ever happened to me!!!

She called me again to talk some more,
As she read to me a great job description.
It sounds like my dream job for sure,
I didn’t know it would be science fiction.

So I paid my $300 deposit – no problem,
For me it sounded like a very good deal.
Besides she said the deposit was “refundable”
Not one they would ever steal.

Then the truth started to drip out,
When I learned the total cost…
$3,400 more they wanted me to pay,
My temper I completely lost!

Then I learned that another $1,500
I would have to pay for my air fare.
And $1,000 more for 90 days of meals,
Not to mention $500 for daily subway fare.

My own apartment would cost another $1,500
But she said not to worry one bit,
Because I would be earning $60,000 a year,
With the new China job I would get!

She sent me great links of video testimonials,
Of a dozen happy clients of Gi2c from the past.
How the hell was I supposed to know…
These great actors were very well cast?

One even called me on the telephone,
Who told me he now worked with the BBC
For $5,000 dollars a month and only because,
Of the great internship he got from Gi2c.

I took the bait - hook, line and sinker,
I sent in my $3,400 with such great hopes.
But when I arrived in Beijing, I soon met
More than a dozen other angry dopes.

Within two weeks we were all mad as hell,
Only three in our group got what was promised.
The rest of us were just baited and switched,
Frankly I have never been so thoroughly pissed!

A refund I demanded, on a daily basis,
But they just made excuses for me.
The even suggested that I “misunderstood”
Mary’s many promises to me.

The company where they sent me,
Was surely no international MNC,
But a Chinese finance company
That just used and exploited me.

“Marketing Specialist” was my job they said,
But spamming emails in English was my true role.
I was also asked to make copies, coffee, and deliveries.
With each day my anger was growing and taking its toll.

After three weeks I said “Enough is Enough”
I didn’t get an expensive Master degree for this!
I demanded a refund and told Gi2C
My big fat ass they could kiss!

If I didn’t get one I would call in the cops.
And show them this scam operation.
That’s when the Russian boss finally said,
Please calm down, and you’ll get my cooperation.

Without making a scene at their office,
I would have been screwed over for sure.
I finally got my refund , but only because
I threatened to make a big public stir.

Maybe 30% of their interns are happy,
But the other 70% surely are not.
What we were all promised on the phone,
Was not even close to what we got.

So be warned my fellow uni graduates,
Smoke and mirrors is what you’ll get at Gi2c
They sell you a dream of a really great job,
So please learn this costly lesson from me…

Get a real China internship by going direct,
To the HR department of a big International company,
Explain what you want in your email letter and resume,
And you will get a real internship – absolutely FREE!

The HR officer will be truly sincere and honest,
And hide nothing about the internship from you.
They’ll even say if a real job will be waiting,
If you do a good job, when the internship is through.

I now wish you the best in your job hunt,
As I bid all of you farewell.
I truly regret my call to Gi2c,
My first step in a journey through hell.

You probably think I just started wearing it or am a convert right? Wrong. I've been wearing the kiddish pullover headscarfs since preschool, and long sleeves since the 5th grade with dresses up to my knee, and since 8th grade I've been wearing either maxi skirts or abayas or maxi dresses. I don't show a strand of my hair from the front. And I never cared until I started college. I'm not afraid of being 'judged' by non Muslims or anything, but more as in I feel incredibly ugly which makes me feel down these past days.

I feel sooooooooo ugly it's not even funny. And it's not that I'm actually hideous, I do think I have really good looks and am in really good shape, but dam, when I put it on my confidence in my appearance plummets to 1%. At my internship this summer we had a lot of social events for the interns and all the girls were always wearing short dresses or shorts and their hair was done. Same thing when hanging out with non Muslim friends, or even my Muslim friends that are not as strict with their hijab. I feel so plain and a lot of times I feel tempted to wear makeup and to show some hair at the front or back (to show that I'm not bald or have a rats nest) or to wear jeans, and to basically do what a lot of instagram hijabis do(not putting them down personally) justifying in my head that modesty doesn't have to be so strict, but in my heart I truly think that makeup and pants violate the hijab.

Another reason that tempts me to dress up in a way that passes the boundaries (or my personal boundaries) of the hijab is because I'm phsycing myself up for marriage and began having and initiating talks with my parents, and I have no idea how the hell I will catch the eye of a Muslim brother if I dress so modestly.

I apologize if I sound like an annoying insecure college girl. I totally am, just the Islamic version.

Can I hear from any sisters? How do you guys deal with this?

Update: Also, does hijab require us to wear socks? I feel so tempted to wear high heels (you can't rock them with socks) because they compliment a woman's feet like nothing else but I stop myself. If it's not, I'ma hit a Jimmy Choo shoe store right away."

6vte4h,1,2017-08-24,I (20f) am in love for the first time and I am terrified. Please help.,sadinlove123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6vte4h/i_20f_am_in_love_for_the_first_time_and_i_am/,"This summer I met a great guy (23M). Let's call him Jackson. 

Background:
I just got out of a very unhappy 2 yr relationship in late April/early May. Jackson's last relationship was 4yrs long and ended about 1.5 yrs ago (I think they met in high school and he said she just fell out of love with him). I live in northern VA. He lives in NY. We are both in school and met while he was in DC for an internship. The distance between us is a 5 hour bus ride. August 30 will make it officially two months of us dating. 

Ok soooo.... We had our first date back in June and I basically moved into the house he was staying in for the summer immediately after that. I went over for dinner and kinda never left. I think I went to my house 3 times in 6 weeks and that was only to get more clothes. It was like we were newlyweds. I would come home to him every day after work, talk about my day, make dinner together or go out to eat somewhere. It was great. I suppose we moved quickly because we knew we didn't have much time together. We held off on sex for the first couple weeks even though we slept in the same bed every night. We just had a good time enjoying each other's company, snuggling, watching Netflix, exploring DC. Even though we took it kinda slow physically, things moved very quickly emotionally. He said ""I love you"" after only a couple of weeks and the feeling was reciprocated. 

I was surprised when Jackson's brother and his gf of 5 years came to visit that he wanted me to still stay at his house and meet them even though we had only known each other a short time. We all had a great time. He met my mom shortly after that and I met his parents when they came to move him out of the house in DC. I take it as a good sign that we have met each other's families and we all get along very well and like each other. 

We agreed that after he left, we would continue to keep dating. He says he can handle the distance and it won't be an issue. He left about 3 weeks ago and we have continued talking and FaceTiming on a regular basis. I even went to visit him at his parent's house for 5 days and just got back home yesterday. I had a great time and really enjoyed getting to know his family better. They are wonderful people who made me feel much more welcome than my own family ever has. This also adds to the anxiety because losing him means losing these wonderful people as well. And I just don't have many wonderful people in my life. 

While I was visiting, I was laying down with my head in his lap watching tv when it just hit me.... I've never felt like this about anybody before. He is everything I have ever wanted. I thought I loved my ex, but Jackson made me realize that I have never been head over heels IN LOVE before.  I have never felt vulnerable or given anyone the power to hurt me emotionally. I'm usually pretty closed off, but I felt comfortable with him from the beginning and felt comfortable opening up almost immediately. 

So this leads to my issue....  I have low self esteem combined with separation anxiety and abandonment issues. Not a great combination for a long distance relationship. 

I'm not scared of him cheating. I'm scared of him deciding that the effort / emotional strain of long distance will be too much and he just won't want to do it anymore. Or that he will become too busy and lose interest. (He has A LOT going on with very little free time). Or that he'll just decide that I'm not worth waiting for. He's a good looking 23 year old in a city with many beautiful women who would be happy to have him and maybe he will want to explore his options / be free. 

I am so scared of him hurting me that I almost want to end the relationship before it goes any further. I have dealt with depression in the past and can't handle the idea of letting my feelings continue to grow just to be crushed in a few months. I have been feeling a lot better lately but I'm afraid that I would be unable to cope and potentially become very depressed (my mental health has been an uphill battle so I am very protective of myself). After he left DC, I couldn't even get out of bed for two days and had to take off work. I was sad when I had to leave after visiting him, but my emotions were less dramatic which I think is a good sign. 

So I guess my question is... what do I do? I love this man. I want to be with him. How do I cope with my insecurities and constant thoughts of him leaving, despite his reassurances? 

**TL;DR**  summer romance turned serious and I'm now having major anxiety / insecurities about my boyfriend's ability to maintain our relationship long distance despite his reassurances that we will be fine. "

6vtnv9,2,2017-08-24,Is this career field for me?,TheLewtNewt,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6vtnv9/is_this_career_field_for_me/,"Hey everyone, 
I am a dual major in Accounting and Finance and will be a senior this coming semester.  I've heard of actuaries before but just recently started looking into them as a career possibility.

I have a few concerns after doing some research and reading through some posts on the subreddit.  

Firstly I don't have a crazy high gpa.  I'm sitting at a 3.08 right now which seems super low compared to others based on their resumes they have posted.  Secondly I haven't had any internship opportunities as of yet for either of my degrees.  Lastly, how is the job outlook?  Compared to a career field such as accounting I'm not sure how to feel about it.  Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics there is higher job outlook for an actuary than accountants but the number of current actuary jobs is significantly less than those in accounting.  Assuming I meet the requirements to apply for an actuary position is there really a good chance of finding a job compared to say accounting?  I understand there is a much higher barrier to entry for an actuary than a job in accounting but it still seems like a turn off.

That being said, pursuing a career as an actuary interests me but I really don't know if it's for me.

Edit:
Thanks for everyone's feedback.  Seems it would be best to continue my current degree plan.  Thanks for everyone's responses."
6vu3ez,2,2017-08-24,Career Advice Welcome (please),Bezdbefazed,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6vu3ez/career_advice_welcome_please/,"Hey everyone, I'm currently in an MS program to reach my 150 credit hours to be eligible for my CPA. My undergrad career was pretty solid, 3.5 GPA, president of a fraternity I founded a new colony on campus, and a whole resume full of internships with relevant experience.   

After completing my latest internship, I was offered a full time position in the internal audit department of a very large technology company (Fortune 150). It's a small group of people, I want to say there is a total of 20 of us (all of them super friendly and actually fun to work with) that audit the entire company. This gig would include plenty of international travel (which I am 100% okay with), 2 weeks vacation, medical and dental, dollar for dollar 401k up to 3% of my annual salary, and a starting salary of $56,000 (started at 51 but I negotiated myself up). In my time there, I was working directly with the Chief Audit Executive, met much of the C-suite (CEO, CTO, CHRO, CMO) and am on a ""hey I remember your face"" base with many of them which I think is huge for some 21 year old punk out of school.   

I know as an internal auditor I don't need my CPA, but I didn't stick my neck out in school for this long to just not get it. Besides I feel like it would be really nice to have for career advancement in general. My plan is to meet a lot of people in high places in my time working and getting an understanding of the company, then shifting into other roles within such as operations and strategic planning roles. All of this I've already discussed with the Chief Audit Executive who is my direct manager.   

BUT  

Ever since I entered into the accounting program, Big4 has always been my number one goal to get into. One for the experience, and also for the distinct reputation it carries for having worked in one of those organizations.   I'm also a little disheartened by my salary. Granted I know this is my first real gig, but I was really hoping to break 60k (not that a big4 firm would be doing me much better in the location I will be in).   

I'm trying to figure out what is best for me but I'd love to hear some pros and cons any of you could think of. I'd also like to know what other things I should think about that I may not have considered yet.   Thank you all in advance!"

See, I saw an awful movie that all the same had a weird effect on me. The Adam Sandler movie, That's My Boy. It's terrible, don't watch it, but do watch [this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC21keB1yaM)

I just really love the idea of fulfilling a student's dream in that way and making it into something kinda cliched in its hotness, if that makes a lick of sense? 

I'd love someone to talk more deeply about this, and now, onto my usual introduction with all the usual roleplay scenarios listed!

Ahem. I'm Gwen, an Englishwoman, mother and teacher. I'm looking for fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png)

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
6vuohp,2,2017-08-24,Progress report / vent.... moving forward one tiny human step at a time.... which is much too slow.,RuffledPlume,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6vuohp/progress_report_vent_moving_forward_one_tiny/,"Hi guys. I've been thinking &amp; overthinking a lot lately and just thought it was time to get some of it out in the open. First, I want to share a bit of the progress I'm making so far. Nothing big, but it is progress none the less. So, I've been working my new job for about two weeks now and although my anxiety is slowly starting to flair up while at work, I seem to be performing at least a tiny bit above average for a newbie - or so I'm told by my boss and peers. I've made a couple screw-ups since I am still technically in training but they felt a lot more major than actually were. By the way, the job is basically shopping and prepping orders for people who order their groceries online. It's a part time minimum wage gig but it's actually fun at times and at least it gets me out of the house.

Also, I'm going to be attending the first production meeting tomorrow for the movie I'm going to be working on soon. It's an internship position on a real professional film crew so I really want to be stoked about it. This is the type of work I plan on doing professionally and it's a once in a lifetime opportunity that I'm grateful for.

The thing is, I'm a bit concerned about my..... I guess, let's call it my ""emotional state"" lately. I don't know what's going on. I'm sure I'll be fine in a few days or so as is usually the case when I get down on myself or about life for whatever reason. This time just feels a little different somehow. It's like no matter how much personal progress I make, nothing is really changing. I'm starting to doubt my decision to postpone grad school to try to work and save up money. I have over $30,000 in students loans to pay back as is and the pocket change I'm making at my job isn't going to help as much as I thought it would. On top of all that, my NM is literally this close to driving me up the wall.

It's not enough for her that I'm trying my best to stay out of her way, make my own money, pursue my career goals, and try to help out around the house. She won't let up on this new delusion of hers that my brother and I are, for whatever idiotic reason, ""dabbling in the dark arts"" and trying to sabotage her somehow. I mean, little things like her not turning the key in the door the right way (which I was, unfortunately, the one to point out) turned into her trying to convince my other family members that I did something to the locks to lock her out of the house. She's always been uber paranoid but lately, it's getting more and more ridiculous. I can't understand how she can believe the stuff she's accusing us of is true. It's perfectly insane and I'm honestly starting to get worried now. About her, about my brother, me. It's getting hard to tell the difference between when she's purposefully making stuff up to manipulate us all like usual and when she actually believes what she's saying is true.

Also, I had this horribly spot-on dream the other night. I'm a big believer in dreams being God's way of giving us messages and if that's what this dream was, and I feel it might have been - then I absolutely need to find a way to get away from this woman ASAP. I'll be trapped here forever if I don't.

I know I'm not making waves or anything - barely a few tiny ripples. Even so, I really want to be happy about the few good things I have going for myself right now and I just can't seem to. I just feel overloaded with stress and anxiety - not more or less than I'm used to really. It just feels different somehow, I guess. 

I don't know if I'm making any sense. I just needed to vent real quick. I've found that if I don't, I'll just start zoning out in my room and playing out scenarios and imaginary conversations in my head. I mean, I do that anyway - usually when I'm writing and trying to work out plot or character development stuff for a story. I don't know, I guess I'm starting to wonder if it's healthy to be doing this? It's basically like I'll have mini therapy sessions with myself sometimes when I'm alone since I don't have anyone else to talk to. I do pray, of course - a lot. I would just be nice to have human people to talk to every now and then who maybe get what I'm going through. Hense, me posting this here.

Anyway, I could ramble and vent some more but I'll stop now. Life-wise, I'm just in a weird spot right now, I guess. I'm sure it will pass soon. I really wish I could get out of this house somehow."
6vut1x,4,2017-08-24,[M4F] The Mysterious Woman,OdetoVenus,DirtyStoryWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyStoryWriting/comments/6vut1x/m4f_the_mysterious_woman/,"There was something about powerful women that I *loved*.  I wasn’t intimidated by them, like many of my peers.  And I wasn’t a male sub that drooled at the thought of being dominated by them – though I would gladly please a girl I liked as she sat on my face, if it came down to it.  

I was, for my age, doing very well.  Twenty-five, with lean muscles, short copper hair, and hazel eyes that were a stormy mix of grey and grey, flared with amber in the center when my pupils were constricted.  I had no student debt.  I made a fair amount of money as a writer, and had worked several odd jobs – from building marine aquariums, to working in the floral, maintenance, and several other departments of a grocery store, to photography.  I hoped to go to grad school, in the highly selective field of English Literature or the even more selective MFA programs in poetry – but I was making a living already, and I knew I had a decent chance of getting a start in a career in a number of fields.  

My recommendations were outstanding, and though I wasn’t naturally loud, when a group needed a leader I naturally took the role, and did it well.  So although many took me as an introvert, I had in fact won awards for public speaking back in school.

Additionally, I was handy, which was increasingly rare in most men, oddly enough.  I could work on plumbing or electricity, I knew how to fix basic problems on cars and water heaters and HVAC units.  I could fix most things, given time and a reason.

In other words, I had little trouble getting a date, and most of those dates would end positively.  I wasn’t particularly interested in casual sex, though, although I had enough experience to ensure what I did *worked*.  I had been told by multiple women that I’d made them feel things they’d never felt before when I ate them out.  And I’d had others want me to be their constant dom, saying I was what they’d sought, able to tease them in all the right ways.

And of course I was good at just vanilla sex too.

But none of it was satisfying.  Because I didn’t want the girls in my social group.

I wanted a doctor, or a political figure, or a CEO, or CFO, or a ranking officer.  I wanted an architect, a business owner, the head editor of a major magazine.  

I couldn’t explain it – maybe it was the fact they were independent and successful, and they deserved a guy who wasn’t trying to exploit their power, or neg them, or “put them in their place.”

The trouble was – how do you meet these women?

I was mentally bemoaning the situation, dressed in navy dress pants, cordovan shoes, and a button down dress shirt of a light pink shade, walking through the marble lobby of the beautiful new building, sipping coffee, heading for a table and chair so I could pull out my phone and figure out where in the building – which was as confusing to navigate as it was beautiful – the person I was supposed to interview for this profile.  I’d been published in enough prestigious places that doing a multi-page profile for a major publication could net me some serious money; but the people who deserved to have profiles written about them were rarely easy to reach, so even though I’d been told my interview had been confirmed, I hadn’t been able to talk to my interviewee, or get instructions to the meeting place.

In fact, I knew almost nothing about who I would soon meet.  Writing a profile was an in-depth, long process, requiring me to spend a lot of time with my assignment.  Just being given a meeting place – not a name or anything else, was beyond unusual.  I’d asked about that simply been told they wanted my view to go in blind; which was bullshit – I was being stonewalled.  But I wasn't going to turn down a chance to write something high-profile.  I ran my eyes over the listings of who exactly worked in this massive testament to beauty-first architecture.  It was a collection of powerful companies and positions.

I sipped my coffee, and figured out my meeting place was actually only a single floor up, in another sitting area.  Getting there took me through two security checks, and both called to check about my temporary pass.

It seemed excessive, but on the second floor I could see why they didn’t want the general public wondering in.  It was filled with valuable materials, from the flooring, to the paintings, to globes and statues and furniture.  There were live plants, the walls were almost solid glass, and the entire floor was open, with raised daises along the edges of the massive circle.  I thought I recognized noise cancelers around each dais – they had the style of Bang and Olufsen or some other exotic architectural brand, but played no music – I had heard about these devices, meant to prevent people from eavesdropping.  And with the completely open views of the floor, and one trying would be seen.  A place to discuss very sensitive deals then.  I headed to the designated dais for the meeting, taking a seat on a quilted leather chair, pulling out my notepad and Montblanc fountain pen and setting them on the marble coffee table.  

I felt nervous; I’d never felt nervous before an interview before.  Just who was I meeting?

-------------------------------------------

Obviously I think there's a lot of possibilities for this prompt.  My initial idea was to just write a prompt with lovely sex between a young man and a powerful woman.  But then I decided the intern angle was played out.  So I started writing and this came out.  *shrugs*

As long as it's an independent woman who's been very successful, it fits.  I think obviously this prompt implies you're older, although what age could vary wildly – don't feel like you can't play if you're younger – maybe you were a business prodigy!  I'm also willing to change my character's age.  

kinks: oral, anal, clothes, clothed sex, spanking, light d/s, dirty talk, sex outside the bedroom, affection, and more.

limits: heavy pain, gore, scat, watersports.

All kinks negotiable.  Probably not a d/s or spanking element in this one unless you want it."

Also, if there's a better place for this sort of post, please let me know, and I can move it. Anyway, on to the real stuff:

I started a new job on Monday. It's not glamorous, just a manufacturing job on 12 hour shifts, but it'll pay the bills.

It's not the job I thought I'd be getting after college. I have a 4 year degree in a major that has a 99% job placement rate, but I've been mostly jobless since graduation in 2016.

I found an internship last November that I was excited about. My friends were really happy that I was on my feet after the long months since graduation. Unfortunately, this job wasn't a great fit, and I ended up being let go just a month into it. 

All my feelings of inadequacy were made 100x worse because of this, and I basically gave up on success. I couldn't admit to my friends that things ended so poorly for me, so I've kept up the facade of being employed for 8+ months now. With how disappointed in myself I was, I couldn't handle the idea of breaking my bad news to them. (I know this seems selfish, but I don't I like making people worry about or feel sorry for me. I always feel like I need to solve my own problems. It's something I need to work on.)

So anyway, I went through the motions of life and kinda looked for jobs in a really half-assed manner. I fell way out of shape, and stopped enjoying most of my time at home with my parents.

Eventually I find a job I really liked at a company near me and inspiration finally hit, so I went all out into preparing for the interviews to come. Made 4-5 pages of notes and everything. 

The interview goes great and they say they'll get back to me soon. They do, but with no real news. This gets dragged out for another 2.5 months, while I sink back into my routine of going through the motions.

Eventually I decide to apply to the same company (different location) for a job that I'm super overqualified for, which is the one I have now. I take it and decide to just grind it out for a few months to hopefully force my foot in the door and prove my worth.

Today, my 4th day on the job, I get called down to the offices and they tell me that they want to move forward with hiring me to the first position I applied for!!! It's a job that I really, geuinely want to have, and I'm ecstatic about the news! Accepting the manufacturing job was basically me betting on myself to succeed, and I finally feel like that's possible now! It's been a long time since I've been this excited about my career, so I had to find a place to share.

Sorry if the depressing build up wasn't worth the good news reveal, I'm not much of a writer, and this turned out to be a much longer vent than I planned lol

TL;DR: After being largely unemployed for ~15 months, I accepted an ok job, only to be told I'll be able to get a great one that I applied for earlier! I now have tangible long term goals to look forward to! Yay!"

I hoped to go to grad school, in the highly selective field of English Literature or the even more selective MFA programs in poetry – but I was making a living already, and I knew I had a decent chance of getting a start in a career in a number of fields.  

My recommendations were outstanding, and though I wasn’t naturally loud, when a group needed a leader I naturally took the role, and did it well.  So although many took me as an introvert, I had in fact won awards for public speaking back in school.

Additionally, I was handy, which was increasingly rare in most men, oddly enough.  I could work on plumbing or electricity, I knew how to fix basic problems on cars and water heaters and HVAC units.  I could fix most things, given time and a reason.

In other words, I had little trouble getting a date, and most of those dates would end positively.  I wasn’t particularly interested in casual sex, though, although I had enough experience to ensure what I did *worked*.  I had been told by multiple women that I’d made them feel things they’d never felt before when I ate them out.  And I’d had others want me to be their constant dom, saying I was what they’d sought, able to tease them in all the right ways.

And of course I was good at just vanilla sex too.

But none of it was satisfying.  Because I didn’t want the girls in my social group.

I wanted a doctor, or a political figure, or a CEO, or CFO, or a ranking officer.  I wanted an architect, a business owner, the head editor of a major magazine.  

I couldn’t explain it – maybe it was the fact they were independent and successful, and they deserved a guy who wasn’t trying to exploit their power, or neg them, or “put them in their place.”

The trouble was – how do you meet these women?

I was mentally bemoaning the situation, dressed in navy dress pants, cordovan shoes, and a button down dress shirt of a light pink shade, walking through the marble lobby of the beautiful new building, sipping coffee, heading for a table and chair so I could pull out my phone and figure out where in the building – which was as confusing to navigate as it was beautiful – the person I was supposed to interview for this profile.  I’d been published in enough prestigious places that doing a multi-page profile for a major publication could net me some serious money; but the people who deserved to have profiles written about them were rarely easy to reach, so even though I’d been told my interview had been confirmed, I hadn’t been able to talk to my interviewee, or get instructions to the meeting place.

In fact, I knew almost nothing about who I would soon meet.  Writing a profile was an in-depth, long process, requiring me to spend a lot of time with my assignment.  Just being given a meeting place -- not a name or anything else, was beyond unusual.  I’d asked about that simply been told they wanted my view to go in blind; which was bullshit -- I was being stonewalled.  But I wasn't going to turn down a chance to write something high-profile.  I ran my eyes over the listings of who exactly worked in this massive testament to beauty-first architecture.  It was a collection of powerful companies and positions.

I sipped my coffee, and figured out my meeting place was actually only a single floor up, in another sitting area.  Getting there took me through two security checks, and both called to check about my temporary pass.

It seemed excessive, but on the second floor I could see why they didn’t want the general public wondering in.  It was filled with valuable materials, from the flooring, to the paintings, to globes and statues and furniture.  There were live plants, the walls were almost solid glass, and the entire floor was open, with raised daises along the edges of the massive circle.  I thought I recognized noise cancellers around each dais -- they had the style of Bang and Olufsen or some other exotic architectural brand, but played no music -- I had heard about these devices, meant to prevent people from eavesdropping.  And with the completely open views of the floor, and one trying would be seen.  A place to discuss very sensitive deals then.  I headed to the designated dais for the meeting, taking a seat on a quilted leather chair, pulling out my notepad and Montblanc fountain pen and setting them on the marble coffee table.  

I felt nervous; I’d never felt nervous before an interview before.  Just who was I meeting?

-------------------------------------------

Obviously I think there's a lot of possibilities for this prompt.  My initial idea was to just write a prompt with lovely sex between a young man and a powerful woman.  But then I decided the intern angle was played out.  So I started writing and this came out.  *shrugs*

As long as it's an independent woman who's been very successful, it fits.  I think obviously this prompt implies you're older, although what age could vary wildly -- don't feel like you can't play if you're younger -- maybe you were a business prodigy and I'm also willing to change my characters age.

6vvnqe,153,2017-08-24,[Rant] Parents can be really annoying,missketothrowaway,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6vvnqe/rant_parents_can_be_really_annoying/,"Hi everyone,

So I've been doing keto since June 11, and I've lost around 30 pounds. This has been the longest I've sticked to a particular WOE and I have much more energy and motivation, not just in sticking to keto but in all facets of my life. I started keto the second week of my summer research internship in Boston. on August 12, I came home from my 10-week internship (for context, I am 20, turning 21 in less than three weeks. I am entering my senior year of college. I attend out of state so I only see my family during breaks) I have barely seen my parents all summer. The day before leaving for Boston, my mom was complaining about how big my stomach had gotten and that I needed to do something fast. This was upsetting, but I faced the music and took charge of my health...especially since high blood pressure, diabetes, and other wonderful diseases run on my dad's side of the family. My grandmother is over 300 pounds, and can barely move. I'm doing everything in my power to prevent this from happening to me.

 So, you would think that after coming back home, she would be 100% supportive of this WOE, right? Heh...wrong. Although she is glad that I've lost weight, she keeps making snide remarks that ""what you're eating can't possibly be healthy"" while pointing to the ONE meal that I ate frozen food or ""my nutritionist friend said that this diet is bad for your liver and kidneys; she puts her clients on low fat diets and look at how much weight they're losing!!!!111111"" or ""my biologist friend says that your kidneys can shut down if you keep eating like this"" except I've struggled with my weight my entire life and none of those low fat ""eat every two hours"" diets ever worked for me. I would cave in and cheat after the first or second week, or constantly snack and shovel food in my mouth. I had an obsession with food and would think about it all the time. I have always been big, to the point where I was wearing plus sized clothing in middle school. Plus, I've struggled with binge eating, anxiety, and ADHD for a majority of high school and college. Although I do well academically, I stress myself out way too often. However, on keto, everything has changed. I no longer obsess over where I'm getting my next meal: I can eat once or twice a day and feel satiated. I feel more in control, like I can conquer the world. My ADHD has improved. I am actually looking forward to the semester. 

For the first time that I can remember, I can finally fit into size 12-14 shirts and this makes me so happy. Yet it really pisses me off when friends and family constantly pick at me. I understand their concern, but it's come to the point where I don't even want to say anything anymore. Just let me eat my bacon in peace :( plus my dad had to chime in, ""you need to exercise more"" except I've been to the gym every single day this week. what more do you want from me???

Tbh, my parents do this with every aspect of my life, pretty much for as long as I can remember. ""oh you have a 3.5 in nanoengineering? WHY NOT A 4.0?"" ""oh you interned at NASA freshman year? Why weren't you home to watch your brother?"" it's like no matter what I do, they always have to find fault and I AM SICK OF IT.

Sorry for the long winded rant, but it's around shark week and my hormones are in maximum overdrive. Typing this has been rather cathartic. If you guys could help me prove to my mom that this diet won't kill my arteries, I would greatly appreciate it. Any clinical research helps my case immensely.

I took my level one coding class and it went...fine I guess. I learned how to use the ICD-10-CM and assign codes, my main problem was not always getting the right code and being a few numbers off, but I still passed. But I didn't use any Medical Terminology knowledge, and that's what I'm good at, I'm not doing what I'm good at. Where is it in this field, because now I'm being told that it's not really used all that much on the job. Today was my first day of my level 2 coding class, and I was expecting more of the same, just maybe some more complex stuff, but I'd be using the knowledge I gained from the last class. That is NOT the case, and now I have to learn new stuff like CPT, and how to properly do that. Now I have no idea when a coder is on the job, when they have to use ICD-10-CM or CPT. I thought the ICD-10-CM was the only text used on the job. I wasn't expecting the class to be easy, but I wasn't expecting to have to get new books and learn a new coding process in addition to the one I already know. I mean, how much do you have to know on this job? I'm just really scared I can't do this, and after registering and buying my books, I'm out over 700 dollars and I won't get any refund. Some one please tell me this gets easier over time and all I need is practice. Plus, I don't want to take my CPC exam 3 days after Christmas, I wouldn't be able to enjoy my holiday knowing i have an exam a few days later, so when would I be able to take it next? Also, is it a good idea to do an online internship before my CPC? At this point, I don't know what to expect and can only pray I will find this easier over time."

#Mechanics

This will run similar to a traditional game of Werewolf.

Signups will close at 10pm EDT on August 31st. Shortly after, you will receive your PM with role information. Within that message, you will learn how to confirm your role. You will have a little less than 24 hours to do this. You will have until September 1st at 10pm EDT to confirm. The game will begin at approximately 10pm EDT on September 2nd. From that moment, all posts will be locked at 10pm EDT, and the new post will be available as soon as it is ready. This will never take more than two hours.

All players will begin as one of three factions: Administration, Insurrection, or Intern. For the purpose of this game (and often in real life), Administration is Evil. Insurrection is Good. Interns align with the Insurrection by default, but their affiliation can change.

Administration will be divided into UPPER and LOWER sectors. Each will have their own planning sub, and they will be given a full roster of each.  

We will utilize a combined night/day phase. Order of operations denotes that Lynches will happen first. Night time will happen as follows: 

Heads of Internal Affairs -&gt;  Recruiters -&gt; Scouts -&gt; Enforcers -&gt; CEO action  -&gt; Voyeur Results -&gt; Asst Managers 

Night roles will submit first choice and second choice options. If their first option was eliminated during the Lynch, they will perform their action on their second choice. 

Vote results will be shown in full. Roles will be shown upon death. If there is a tie, all involved parties will die. 

**Once dead, players are to be completely removed from the game. They will not be permitted to comment within the game sub.**

The Autumnal Equinox will be triggered when about 40% of the players are left OR on September 23rd (whichever happens first). When the Equinox is triggered, all recruited interns will join their designated side. Those joining the Administration will be added to the Lower Admin sub as Goons. 

This game is estimated to last 2-3 weeks. The hosts hold the right to adjust mechanics in order to ensure this game ends naturally before the end of the month. 

___

#CURRENT JOB OPENINGS AT SOLSTICE INC

##UPPER Administration (Evil) - PRIVATE SUB 1

**These roles will each occur 0-2 times.**

**CEO** - Every night phase, the CEO can choose between Kill, Fire, and Recruit. The same option cannot be chosen for more than two turns in a row. If the CEO dies, another Evil player moves up a notch. Only players in the UPPER Admin sub are eligible to be CEO. As long as there are players in the UPPER Admin sub, there will always be a CEO. 

- Recruit: the CEO himself heads out to find an Intern. If successful, that intern will join the LOWER ADMIN as a goon on the solstice. After the Solstice is triggered, the CEO loses the ability to Recruit. 
- Kill: the Assassin is sent out to kill. The killed player will be removed from the game and added to the ghost sub. 
- Fire: the CEO heads out to fire. Firing can only be targeted towards a player in one of the evil subs. If fired, they transfer to the opposite sub and lose access to the sub they were previously in.

**President** - The person in the Upper Admin sub with the most longevity is the President. They become the CEO if the CEO kicks the bucket. 

**Goon** - If you are in the Upper Admin sub and you are not the CEO or President, you are a goon. 

## Both UPPER and LOWER Administration (Evil) - PRIVATE SUB 1 AND 2

**This role will occur 1 time.**

**Vice President** - Can never become the CEO or Assassin. Will have access to both subs. If the VP dies, the subs lose their communication link and can’t coordinate. 

##LOWER Administration (Evil) - PRIVATE SUB 2

**These roles will each occur 0-2 times.**

**Assassin** - Chooses one person every night. If sent out by the CEO, their target will die. If the assassin is killed, a goon will take their place. 

**Goon** - If you are in the Lower Admin sub and you are not the Assassin, you are a Goon. 

##Insurrection (Good) 

**These roles will each occur 0-2 times.**

**Director** - Leader of the Insurrection. If targeted by an assassin OR lynch, it will take an extra day for him to die. 

**Manager** - LOVES his job. If he’s attacked, he’s going to take down his attacker with him. If he is lynched, he gets to choose one person to die alongside him (they will die the following phase).

**Assistant Manager** Like any organized worker, the assistant manager keeps extensive records. Every four phases, they will be told the number of Administration still alive. This number includes Interns that have pledged themselves to the Admin but have not yet joined their planning sub.

**Recruiter** - Every night, they choose one intern to convert to the Insurrection. After the Solstice is triggered, they lose their ability. 

**Enforcer** - Get 5 kills for the duration of the game. If they kill 3 members of the Insurrection, they will die too. This includes Interns that have pledged themselves to the Insurrection AND Interns that have not yet been recruited. 

**Head of Internal Affairs** - Chooses one player to protect every night. This protection includes ALL actions by the Administration AND the Insurrection (all kills, all recruits). The HoIA can not choose to protect the same person twice in a row. 

**Scout** - Chooses one person to investigate every night. They will learn their role.

**The Manager’s Nephew, Dave** - The Manager looks out for his family, and so Dave can not be lynched. The only way Dave can die is if he is taken out by the Admin. 

##Interns

**(EVERYONE ELSE)**

**Voyeur** - Spies on one person every night. They get to see who (if anyone) their target submitted an action (if they have one) on. They do not get to know what this action is. Voyeurs CAN be recruited. 

**Double Agent** - Is recruited to the team opposite the one that approaches them 

**Rogue** - At the beginning of the game, they get to choose the team they join, regardless of whether or not they are approached by a recruiter at a later date.

**Regular old Intern** - On the Solstice, they will join the team that approached them most recently. If no team approached them, they side with the Insurrection by default.

___

#Win Conditions

The **Administration** wins once they have eliminated all the Insurrection.

The **Insurrection** wins once they have eliminated all the Administration. *This includes interns that have pledged themselves to the Admin but have not yet been added to the evil subs.*

___

#Additional Information

- Game A’s theme is not based on any existing fandom. It is meant to simulate an office environment. 
- If the Upper Admin sub runs empty, a new CEO will not be chosen, and so the Admin will lose the ability to Fire and Recruit.
- You may choose to abstain from a night action for strategic reason. Just mention it in the space provided for notes. 


___

#Rules

1.  Activity: If you fail to vote or submit a night action for 3 days total, you will be removed from the game.
2. If you are editing comments, it should be made clear why you’re editing. If you made an error, use strikethroughs on the information you want removed, but don’t delete it. If you want to add something, put it at the end what you’re adding. **Do not share information, then immediately edit your comment to hide what you said from others. Do not delete comments.**
3. While you may mention (or lie about) receiving PMs from the facilitators, discussing exact wording is prohibited. 
4. Comments in this game should be in English and free of encryption. We ask that players do not try to find workarounds to this.

6vwa7s,3,2017-08-25,[M4F] The Talented Photographer,Brad-a-palooza,DirtyStoryWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyStoryWriting/comments/6vwa7s/m4f_the_talented_photographer/,"**[Prompt Status: Open]**

I had worked with cameras a long time – with considerable success in experimental photography. My work hung in several galleries, and been nominated for several prizes. I did up close examinations of everyday objects, turning them into the landscapes of another world. I even had some pieces pending display in a museum in the coming year. But, unsurprisingly, especially since phone cameras improved and more people turned to instagram for photos they normally would've paid a studio for, as well as the fact that the internet shared amazing photographers’ work for free, even a photographer with as much critical success as I'd had didn't make the money the previous generation had.

But there were alternative ways of earning some extra funds. The skillset for photography transferred perfectly to video; and, of course, I had studied camera work in university as well.  I had simply favored photography, and experimental photography had required the most creative use of the camera, and complete knowledge of the workings.  

So, I soon discovered the best way to a quick paycheck was not my cutting-edge, exploratory, experimental photography; it was being able to render a scene into something sensual – the ability to create sex appeal with camera settings. One of my thesis films had been a video of my at-the-time girlfriend, in soft focus, the lens exploring her neck, her eyelashs, her fingers, her chest – I was praised for seeming loving without seeming exploitative, and even won a Best Of at local festival, in the vignette section.

Surprisingly, the skill I’d shown in that video was exactly what many porno companies needed from their camera guys – someone who could make the dirty action seem extra sensual. A dick deep in the throat could be either an act of dirty, vicious sex in a scene, or it could be the ultimate expression of love; a tight scene of bondage could be abusive, and seem like torture, or it could be a display of trust and mutual satisfaction.  Anal sex scenes could be about bribery and forcing, the sex itself looking painful for the girl, or, with the right camera and prep, it could be a doubly pleasurable experience, lovingly showing the way the tight grip of an ass on a shaft could stimulate and thrill not only the giver, but the receiver.

So, soon, I found myself shooting a few scenes, for places like X-Art, and Met-Art, then for Tushy – and so on.  With each passing scene I shot, as the producers realized how good I was, I received less assistance. First the lighting guys vanished, adding to the profit margin of the studio.  Then they realized the directors they were paying were useless, as I found the best shots, and could tell what would look good on film, and communicate that to the actors.  

I didn’t watch a lot of porn.  Especially when I’d been behind the scenes.  So when I did, I looked at stuff made by people I didn’t know.  And I found the casting couch videos.  They were shot with tripods and go-pros.

I realized I could do the same, with a better camera and more experience, in a more appealing room, and instead of getting paid my cameraman cut, I’d get everything that didn’t go to the actresses.  I knew how to work a phone, get the permits, and all the tricks the stars used to get hard for a scene or cum at the right time.  Plus I had a prestigious real portfolio of non-porn.  Which meant I could probably find models who would *never* go to work for the other studios.  I would have exclusives.

And so, my search began.

______________________

OOC| Hello, I’m Brad.  I'm tall, lean, and fit, with short copper hair and intense hazel eyes.  This is a photoshoot, or casting couch prompt.  I think we have a few options here – since my character is not only a porn cameraman, you may very well come to him for actual photos, be them headshots, or to commemorate something, or because you’re a trophy wife that wants to give a gift to her husband – et cetera.  

You may also be a budding photographer hoping to intern under me.  My character will be at most thirty – 25 would be my default – and have already won awards for photography, and had a piece going up in a museum, making me more prestigious than most classes one could take in photography.  I even had the degrees in photography, and perhaps you’re a fan of one of my serious series, experimental or macro, or documentary.      

Or you could be there because you’re 18 and want to be daring.  Or you need some money to pay for college.

Whatever the choice, I assure you, this will be sexy sexy roleplay.

My kinks are: clothes, clothed sex, oral, anal, cumplay, photography, good writing, seduction, spanking, light d/s, and more.

For one of my classes we were required to write an investigative story and the topic I chose was the lack of financial transparency with the church's financial records.

I didn't have it published in the school paper like the rest of the class for fear of repercussions (both within my family as well as from the church.) I mainly feared familial repercussions because one of the things I used to gather information was a survey on FB that, while objective (as was the rest of the story, because journalism) very clearly outlined that there is no transparency in church records and subjected me to personal attacks from my in-laws and close family members.

Now that I've resigned it seems silly to have passed up an opportunity to be published and get people in a highly Mormon area thinking...but I can't shake the feeling that what I wrote will cost me an internship now. My religious beliefs (agnostic atheist) or religious history should not be a factor in whether or not I get an internship but I can't help but feel like I've taken a risk that's going to come back and bite me in the ass.

Has anyone else had an experience like this or any advice? I know I should just wait to hear back from the guy, as the rest of my submitted writing samples were pretty typical and feel-good, but I'm stressing out about it.

Not sure if anyone would like to read my whole story and such a long post, but I will give it a try anyway. I will tell you about last three-four years of my life. Be advised, this text is fucking long because apparently, I can't describe anything shortly...

Once I finished high school I decided to move away from Poland for studying abroad - moved to Denmark, where my brother already lived. I decided to pursue Chemical and Biotechnical Science degree because I thought it would be the best to actually start lab classes from the beginning, that's what I always wanted to do. It was a tough call because a couple of people from my hometown I made lifetime-friendships with, but I still was certain that this was the best way.

I studied analytical and general chemistry, biology, microbiology, statistics, molecular biology etc. for 1,5 years, from August 2014 until January 2016.  It was all great. I've had classes from Monday to Friday, most of the times from 7 am to 3 pm. I managed to earn some cash and make my living by working part-time in a warehouse on afternoon Friday shifts and morning Sunday shifts. My brother helped me to get the job as well. I managed to save quite some money as for a 19 years old guy. Bought couple of things I always wanted to have - e-book reader, wireless mp3 player, a sweet gaming-PC.

During those 18 months I met a girl, let's call her K. We were friends for some time and then we eventually got together. Here I have to say that I've had some bad experiences with girls already, none of my relationships lasted more than 6 months and that's because I was turned away - two times because a girl has found another guy. K wasn't very emotionally stable, but I believed it might be something real, and got involved for the third time as well. Tl;dr - she left me as well because she has found another guy and despite what she said, she didn't care about me anymore.

That has hurt me as well, but not too much. The saddest part is that at that time I was certain we're going both to the same country (outside of Denmark) for the internship and that's what I focused on (after 1,5 years on Academy we were supposed to find a facility for us to conduct the last 12 months project, on which we graduate). I didn't have much time left and the teachers and student counselor couldn't help me much, even though I was one of the best students in the class and I knew they could at least push some networking. I was pissed, and also at that time I didn't know it would be better to find the internship a little bit later, but a better one. I rushed it. Started one in February 2016.

I've found a place in Germany and started an internship in there. It was basically a village situated next to the Institute. I was alone and I lived alone. I remember that once my parents helped me to move my shit and came back home, I was crying. I would say that was the first moment that I felt my huge efforts to fulfill my biggest ambitions don't mean a thing. The place in Germany was 4/10 I would say. I've been told different things at the interview, did mostly chemical analysis (I was always more a molecular biology person), and didn't have many tasks to do, mostly planning everything myself. It wouldn't be bad if it wasn't a completely new project for me to try and in conclusion I would spend only 3h a day in the lab, and every time I asked my PI what else could I do, he was like ""oh yeah you can try this and that blah blah blah"" - no specific things whatsoever. I was pissed and unhappy again. I could make my living with an intern salary at least.

In March 2016, I met a Polish girl online. We were talking a lot and understood each other instantly, and she made me a happy person again. I am sure she is the one who made me feel like there is still a point of keeping myself motivated, pushing the things I want and working hard for it. We're together from April 2016 until today (got together already after the second date). I love her with my whole heart and I know that she loves me too. It's a relationship worth living for. I managed to work in Germany until June 2016, then I decided it doesn't make sense and I have to run away from this shithole. Tried to ask my teachers for help to find another place as well, but motherfuckers didn't give a damn for the second time. I managed to find a place in the capital of Austria by myself.

I took a short vacation between 10th of June and 10th of July in Poland and started in Vienna. I had many hopes for it because it was a molecular bio lab, working with genetics, PCRs, stuff I always wanted to do. The lab and the work itself were okay I would say 7/10, but overall stay in there was tiring for me too. I remember that I cried the first time I found out the student dorm in there sucks and I'll have to move again. I cried also when I had to spend my birthday in July all by myself. In the period from July 2016 to February 2017, I lived in three different flats in Vienna. From October I had also to find another job because the lab in Vienna barely could cover my food expenses, not mentioning the flat etc. Most of my spared cash flew away for moving between Germany and Austria and for my short vacation. I've worked a single weekend as a kitchen helper but even they were happy with me as hell, I had to resign because I've found a job in a second lab.

From October 2016 until the end of January 2017 my life basically looked like that: 7am-3pm work at internship-lab, then 6pm-9pm work at the second lab. I've mostly done plate seeding for C.elegans and simple stuff like that. They liked my help anyway, and when there were awful things to do like cleaning a centrifuge etc. I never refused, because when I work somewhere and I see a point in this I dedicate myself 100%. In the evenings I talked with my GF via skype, lurked online a bit and then sleep and repeat. Weekends were the only days off during which I mostly slept and sometimes cried because of being lonely again. Every second weekend I traveled to Poland, to my GF, to spend some time with her. Going back to the bus to Vienna, straight from her room, was the most awful feeling I've ever felt in my life.

There were a lot of ups and downs, but I finished my molecular biology project - it wasn't completed 100%, but I didn't care anymore. I just wanted to be done with the fucking Academy. I said goodbye to the people from first and the second lab, I got the highest grade in Denmark and graduated. At that time I wanted to start studying in Poland again, even if it would take some more time to finish up to my Bachelor because I wanted to change my long-distance relationship to a regular one.

My mom wouldn't understand it at all and would always say that I'm doing the worst thing for my career possible. She couldn't get that I've got serious mental issues and I need to take a break because otherwise,  something bad is going to happen, if it didn't already. Eventually, I stopped giving a shit to what she says because she would only realize I am depressed once my half-rotten body would be fished out from a river. That's how deep her denial is.

Anyway, from February 2017 until June 2017 I've been looking for a job in Poland, because I decided to work in a lab and study part-time on top of that. I wasted moving for one weekend to Warsaw, then I saw the boss was bullshitting me from the start because once I got to the lab no one was working in there and PI resigned couple days before. He basically wanted me to revive a dead (due to his mobbing) lab with a Ph.D. that was specialized in completely different area. Came back home and started looking further, then I started to work at a company producing dietary supplements. They desired qualifications out of this world and the work wasn't related to the lab at all. I got a positive response from a Medical University so I quit the supplements company after two weeks.

From July 2017 (didn't have time to take care of my birthday again...), until now, I work at a Medical University. I live with my girlfriend, we found a 6/10 flat, cheap one, but it's quite far to commute for me with a bus and the landlady doesn't give a shit about some of the broken devices or a big mess overall - we didn't realize it until we actually started to clean the place. Current work is not the worst but again, I see a dead lab and not much, if any analysis is going on in there. For the last two months, I've maybe spent one week in the lab. Except that I do bullshit tasks like completing offers for the pipettes, even though basically no one is working on there, taking care of the instruments no one is using etc. I've been reading papers for my future ""tests"", but the PI doesn't seem to bother about the library I collected and he again moves on to some irrelevant bullshit. It bothers me because I can do so many tasks inside of the lab and at least 15 instruments no one is using, but I am busy with secretary job. I think I should move to somewhere else and look up offers, because I want to finish my study in here AND work, and once I get a degree move abroad again, but with my GF this time.

Congratulations, you read the whole thing. Either you are really bored or I am a good writer with a good story. Probably the first one.

**tl;dr I am exhausted of no results of my work and I haven't been happy longer than a week for 3 last years of my life**

I would like to ask Redditors - is my mental health really bad and should I see a therapist? I've been consulting one once and he said that he thinks I really am suffering, but I denied it to myself because I either have different moods each day or simply don't have any cash for psychotherapy. Sometimes I think of suicide but not as I would really do it, because I love my SO and I know I want to fight for a better life, instead of giving up. I also feel like I haven't had a proper rest, even during the times I haven't had a job. I constantly think either how to make my living better right now or if there is something wrong with me, because I am often unhappy even when good things happen to me. I constantly run away from shit jobs because I still believe that I will eventually end up in a proper lab, where there is no one but biology-loving scientists who are excited about research.

Anything you would advise me to do? I could really use an advice from someone who experienced tough career turns as I did and worked it out somehow. Or am I just a whiny bitch that doesn't know what to do?

Please, help me."

I am an Asian college girl who just finished her sophomore year and home for the summer. My hair is light brown with highlights and my skin is flawless. I stand at 5'5 with a set of B cup breasts and a modest ass. My legs are my best asset.

I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now. Since the day I met you I didn't like you at all. You are his stern dad with a mean spirited sense of humor and unnecessarily cruel that you write off as tough love parenting. It's no wonder my boyfriend is so meek and such a nervous wreak.

I spend a lot of time at the house and sleep over pretty often.

Tonight was one of those nights. It's late and everyone had gone to bed. I was extremely horny and wanted to make love to my boyfriend but he was too tired from his internship and work to do anything. I'm sitting by the pool disappointed and burning with frustration.

That's where you come in.

We can do a different start but that's what I had in mind. I hope that you are rough with me and make me into a nice pet.

My kinks are cheating, raceplay, dirty talk, and lingerie.

Limits are scat and gore.

Hope to chat or hear from you. I'm looking for long term stuff so don't be surprise if you send one line and get nothing back."
6vyqtd,95,2017-08-25,How can I (20f) find new friends after isolating myself for two years due to depression?,professorkeenbeans,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6vyqtd/how_can_i_20f_find_new_friends_after_isolating/,"**TL;DR** Formerly depressed college student having trouble finding friends. 


I'm a 20 year old college student. I work 20 hours a week and I do not live on campus. I actually live about 40 minutes from campus which makes it hard to get involved in activities. I had a lot of friends in high school and I previously attended another university where I had a great group of friends but had to leave due to crippling depression. When I came home, I ignored everyone. I refused to respond to texts or phone calls. I completely alienated myself. It's been about two years since then and I'm just realizing that I poured most of my time and attention into my relationship with my (now ex) boyfriend and didn't focus on making friends. I transferred to a new school last spring, but due to working, taking online classes, and the distance I live from campus, I didn't make a single friend. I'm so disappointed. 

Back in May, I broke up with my boyfriend who I think was contributing to my depression. I started an internship and met a lot of great friends who I hope to stay in contact with. I actually had the best summer of my life with them, but unfortunately they are headed back to schools all over the country now so I won't be able to hang out with them. 

I also met a great guy who was here for an internship but is heading back to school 5 hours away. We agreed to continue our relationship long distance, but he is extremely busy with school and an internship. I also don't want to be dependent on someone for entertainment and attention like I was on my ex. I want to be independent and make my own friends. 

Most of my hobbies are things that you can do by yourself (running, reading, crocheting, painting). How can I put myself out there and start making friends considering that I don't spend much time on campus? I also live in a major metropolitan area, so i can go into the city for activities as well. I'm just not sure where to go or what to do. 

Any suggestions are appreciated!

6vyygf,1,2017-08-25,I [21M] think I am being led on by a girl [20F] from Tinder and I don't know what to do,Basiluz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6vyygf/i_21m_think_i_am_being_led_on_by_a_girl_20f_from/,"Firstly, I want to say that I have never dated anyone and I have never been in a relationship, so I am very inexperienced in that regard. I will try to sketch the situation here:

At around the end of June I downloaded Tinder, hoping to get some dates and maybe even a relationship. The first few matches I had didn't lead to anyting, but then I matched with the girl this post is about. We started talking and I found out that we have a lot of common interests and hobbies and we generally have a lot of fun conversations. We are also in very similar situations, she has also never dated anyone and we both still live with our parents. You can say that I really fell for this girl.

After about a week of talking I wanted to ask her out on a date, but that day she went on a vacation with her family for two weeks, so I couldn't ask her. Throughout her vacation we still talked every day. So, when she finally came back I asked her out on a date (to go play mini golf) and she said that she would really like that, but that she doesn't know when she will have time, because she was very busy that week and the two weeks after. She also said that she doesn't know what to tell her parents. This was on the 3rd of August.

So this is where it gets weird. In the two weeks where she was supposedly very busy, it just didn't seem like she was. We still talked every single day, and I always ask her how her day was etc. and most days she was just at home watching movies with her family or playing videogames. She also said that she had to arrange a lot things for her internship that started this week, but as far as I can tell that was nothing more than sending some emails. So this week her internship started, but that is only on Monday till Wednesday, so I thought maybe she has time for our date on Thursday or today, or during the weekend. So this Monday I asked her once again if she had time this week, and she said no because she didn't know how things turned out with her internship. So then I told her that to me it seems that she doesn't want to meet at all. She got annoyed by this and assured me that she really would like to go on a date but that she just doesn't know when she will have time.

I just really don't know what to think about this. To me it seemed that she had plenty of time in the past three weeks to finally meet up, after all it shouldn't have to be more than a couple of hours. And I know that spending time with family is important but does she really have to do that every day? Especially since she just came back from a two week vacation with them. To me it seems that if she really wants to meet me like she says, she would find the time.

There are some other strange things as well. We have been talking for about a month and a half now but she still won't give me her phone number or tell me which city or town she lives in. Also, the first week after we matched we talked throughout the day, but since her vacation she is only online when she is in bed about to go to sleep, so we talk for about half an hour to an hour every day.

So does this sound like I am being led on? I really don't know what to think and I don't want to ask her again because I don't want to sound pushy.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Matched with a girl on Tinder. Three weeks ago I asked her out on a date, she said yes but we still haven't met because she supposedly doesn't have time. But to me it seems that she doesn't want to meet at all."
6vyygv,1,2017-08-25,[M4F] Interview with a Lady,OdetoVenus,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6vyygv/m4f_interview_with_a_lady/,"There was something about powerful women that I *loved*.  I wasn’t intimidated by them, like many of my peers.  And I wasn’t a male sub that drooled at the thought of being dominated by them – though I would gladly please a girl I liked as she sat on my face, if it came down to it.  

I was, for my age, doing very well.  Twenty-five, with lean muscles, short copper hair, and hazel eyes that were a stormy mix of grey and grey, flared with amber in the center when my pupils were constricted.  I had no student debt.  I made a fair amount of money as a writer, and had worked several odd jobs – from building marine aquariums, to working in the floral, maintenance, and several other departments of a grocery store, to photography.  I hoped to go to grad school, in the highly selective field of English Literature or the even more selective MFA programs in poetry – but I was making a living already, and I knew I had a decent chance of getting a start in a career in a number of fields.  

My recommendations were outstanding, and though I wasn’t naturally loud, when a group needed a leader I naturally took the role, and did it well.  So although many took me as an introvert, I had in fact won awards for public speaking back in school.

Additionally, I was handy, which was increasingly rare in most men, oddly enough.  I could work on plumbing or electricity, I knew how to fix basic problems on cars and water heaters and HVAC units.  I could fix most things, given time and a reason.

In other words, I had little trouble getting a date, and most of those dates would end positively.  I wasn’t particularly interested in casual sex, though, although I had enough experience to ensure what I did *worked*.  I had been told by multiple women that I’d made them feel things they’d never felt before when I ate them out.  And I’d had others want me to be their constant dom, saying I was what they’d sought, able to tease them in all the right ways.

And of course I was good at just vanilla sex too.

But none of it was satisfying.  Because I didn’t want the girls in my social group.

I wanted a doctor, or a political figure, or a CEO, or a ranking officer.  I wanted an architect, a business owner, the head editor of a major magazine.  I wanted the heir to the Rothschild fortune, or a Kennedy.

I couldn’t explain it – maybe it was the fact they were independent and successful, and they deserved a guy who wasn’t trying to exploit their power, or neg them, or “put them in their place.”

The trouble was – how do you meet these women?

I was mentally bemoaning the situation, dressed in navy dress pants, cordovan shoes, and a button down dress shirt of a light pink shade, walking through the marble lobby of the beautiful new building, sipping coffee, heading for a table and chair so I could pull out my phone and figure out where in the building – which was as confusing to navigate as it was beautiful – the person I was supposed to interview for this profile.  I’d been published in enough prestigious places that doing a multi-page profile for a major publication could net me some serious money; but the people who deserved to have profiles written about them were rarely easy to reach, so even though I’d been told my interview had been confirmed, I hadn’t been able to talk to my interviewee, or get instructions to the meeting place.

In fact, I knew almost nothing about who I would soon meet.  Writing a profile was an in-depth, long process, requiring me to spend a lot of time with my assignment.  Just being given a meeting place -- not a name or anything else, was beyond unusual.  I’d asked about that simply been told they wanted my view to go in blind; which was bullshit -- I was being stonewalled.  But I wasn't going to turn down a chance to write something high-profile.  I ran my eyes over the listings of who exactly worked in this massive testament to beauty-first architecture.  It was a collection of powerful companies and positions.

I sipped my coffee, and figured out my meeting place was actually only a single floor up, in another sitting area.  Getting there took me through two security checks, and both called to check about my temporary pass.

It seemed excessive, but on the second floor I could see why they didn’t want the general public wondering in.  It was filled with valuable materials, from the flooring, to the paintings, to globes and statues and furniture.  There were live plants, the walls were almost solid glass, and the entire floor was open, with raised daises along the edges of the massive circle.  I thought I recognized noise cancellers around each dais -- they had the style of Bang and Olufsen or some other exotic architectural brand, but played no music -- I had heard about these devices, meant to prevent people from eavesdropping.  And with the completely open views of the floor, and one trying would be seen.  A place to discuss very sensitive deals then.  I headed to the designated dais for the meeting, taking a seat on a quilted leather chair, pulling out my notepad and Montblanc fountain pen and setting them on the marble coffee table.  

I felt nervous; I’d never felt nervous before an interview before.  Just who was I meeting?

6vz3kb,0,2017-08-25,Its been a long road but I can say I'm 10 pounds down,AirlinesAndEconomics,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6vz3kb/its_been_a_long_road_but_i_can_say_im_10_pounds/,"LTL, FTP on mobile so I can't add flair. 

I (23 soon to be 24 in a few weeks female) had an interesting journey to this point. Throughout high school, I weighed between 100-105 and was extremely active as I was a year round long distance runner for track and cross country. I went to my first year of college and was less active and by the end of that first year, I was between 110-115. I would say during this point in time, I looked great, I had curves in all the right places whereas less than that, I looked more like a prepubescent boy (especially at 5'0"") and that just wasn't the look I was going for at the time. This is all good and well, but unfortunately I did not stay that weight and wouldn't be on this group right now if I still was. By the time my third and final year of college was up, I was 135. I was forced to live with my sister and my nephew for a year and a half after that, during which time my weight ballooned up to 155-160. I got accepted into grad school and moved into an apartment where I stayed around the same weight, but I was diagnosed with PCOS during this time and was put on birth control. Around the same time, I moved into a new apartment with a friend and my weight jumped to 165. That was around June of last year, and I knew this couldn't continue. 

Naturally, I did nothing about it aside from go to the gym once a week. As one might guess, I saw no improvement in my weight. At the start of this year, my roommate and I discovered our other gym location had a rock wall, so we would do that from time to time and I especially realized I needed to lose weight because that was a lot of weight to support on just hands and toes. Around May, I began lazily calorie counting, I wasn't consistent, but I started making plans to run a 10k later that year, since I could still do a 5k pretty easily despite being out of practice and our of shape (granted my times are nowhere close to what they once were, but that's okay because I didn't want that kind of stress in my life always worrying about times). With that in mind, I began June with a little more dedication to calorie counting and a renewed interest in going to the gym. It was going pretty well, despite no real weight change, until my week long vacation at the end of June where I did nothing. I was ready to go home and get back to work though, instead I went home and got sick, first with bad food poisoning and then with a nasty cold. My first half of July was spent in my bed or in my bathroom, it was rough, I felt weak for weeks. 

Despite food poisoning, I really didn't lose all that much weight, only 2 pounds. Due to all of this, I stopped going to the gym to train, instead I just worried about work and getting home. As August began, I started to get back on track, counting more calories, reading more, finding recipes that were low in calories, and joining more Reddit groups focused on weight loss. Last week, I met with a dietician, we're going over more in two weeks. I stepped on the scale this morning and I'm 155.4, I haven't seen that number in so long. If I lose 2.1 more pounds, I go from obese to overweight. I didn't think I could do it. Two of my close friend's are marrying each other the first week of November, I'm hoping that by the time that day comes around, I'm able to stand next to them another 10 pounds lighter. I'm hoping that when I get my bridesmaid dress, my seamstress tells me I should have ordered a size down because it's so big. 

I start an amazing internship on Monday, I'm now going to go into it even more confident about myself. Thank you r/loseit for helping me start to get my body back. I still have 40 pounds to go until I'm at a point where I won't be stressing too much about my weight, thanks to you, I now know I can get there. "

It's been awhile since I've studied German, so I'll have to switch back to English here.)

I'll be traveling to Szczecin, Poland near the end of September for an international internship I was selected for.  My plan is to fly into Berlin from Toronto and then take a train or bus to Szczecin.  Since I will be staying for three and a half months, I will likely be arriving in Berlin with three (or at least two) large suitcases and possibly a ski bag, which is as much as I'm allowed to bring on my flight.  I've been trying unsuccessfully to find information on the Deutsche Bahn website with regard to how much luggage I'd be able to bring aboard.  The info I was able to find didn't really answer if I could bring that much with me on the train.  I've tried calling the information numbers provided, but I don't have international calling and could not connect.  I also emailed the provided address two days ago and have received no response.

If anyone familiar with the railway's policies or who could give them a call for me and pass on the info could help me out, that would be greatly appreciated!  Vielen Dank!

Edit: All, it's been a busy weekend or I would have gotten back to you sooner.  It seems the general consensus is that there's no specification on it, but as long as I'm not rude or obtrusive there shouldn't be a problem.  Thank you very much for the responses!"
6vzk0v,2,2017-08-25,[M4F] The Talented Photographer.,Brad-a-palooza,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6vzk0v/m4f_the_talented_photographer/,"**[Prompt Status: Open]**

I had worked with cameras a long time – with considerable success in experimental photography. My work hung in several galleries, and been nominated for several prizes. I did up close examinations of everyday objects, turning them into the landscapes of another world. I even had some pieces pending display in a museum in the coming year. But, unsurprisingly, especially since phone cameras improved and more people turned to instagram for photos they normally would've paid a studio for, as well as the fact that the internet shared amazing photographers’ work for free, even a photographer with as much critical success as I'd had didn't make the money the previous generation had.

But there were alternative ways of earning some extra funds. The skillset for photography transferred perfectly to video; and, of course, I had studied camera work in university as well.  I had simply favored photography, and experimental photography had required the most creative use of the camera, and complete knowledge of the workings.  

So, I soon discovered the best way to a quick paycheck was not my cutting-edge, exploratory, experimental photography; it was being able to render a scene into something sensual – the ability to create sex appeal with camera settings. One of my thesis films had been a video of my at-the-time girlfriend, in soft focus, the lens exploring her neck, her eyelashs, her fingers, her chest – I was praised for seeming loving without seeming exploitative, and even won a Best Of at local festival, in the vignette section.

Surprisingly, the skill I’d shown in that video was exactly what many porno companies needed from their camera guys – someone who could make the dirty action seem extra sensual. A dick deep in the throat could be either an act of dirty, vicious sex in a scene, or it could be the ultimate expression of love; a tight scene of bondage could be abusive, and seem like torture, or it could be a display of trust and mutual satisfaction.  Anal sex scenes could be about bribery and forcing, the sex itself looking painful for the girl, or, with the right camera and prep, it could be a doubly pleasurable experience, lovingly showing the way the tight grip of an ass on a shaft could stimulate and thrill not only the giver, but the receiver.

So, soon, I found myself shooting a few scenes, for places like X-Art, and Met-Art, then for Tushy – and so on.  With each passing scene I shot, as the producers realized how good I was, I received less assistance. First the lighting guys vanished, adding to the profit margin of the studio.  Then they realized the directors they were paying were useless, as I found the best shots, and could tell what would look good on film, and communicate that to the actors.  

I didn’t watch a lot of porn.  Especially when I’d been behind the scenes.  So when I did, I looked at stuff made by people I didn’t know.  And I found the casting couch videos.  They were shot with tripods and go-pros.

I realized I could do the same, with a better camera and more experience, in a more appealing room, and instead of getting paid my cameraman cut, I’d get everything that didn’t go to the actresses.  I knew how to work a phone, get the permits, and all the tricks the stars used to get hard for a scene or cum at the right time.  Plus I had a prestigious real portfolio of non-porn.  Which meant I could probably find models who would *never* go to work for the other studios.  I would have exclusives.

And so, my search began.

OOC| Hello, I’m Brad.  I'm tall, lean, and fit, with short copper hair and intense hazel eyes.  This is a photoshoot, or casting couch prompt.  I think we have a few options here – since my character is not only a porn cameraman, you may very well come to him for actual photos, be them headshots, or to commemorate something, or because you’re a trophy wife that wants to give a gift to her husband – et cetera.  

You may also be a budding photographer hoping to intern under me.  My character will be at most thirty – 25 would be my default – and have already won awards for photography, and had a piece going up in a museum, making me more prestigious than most classes one could take in photography.  I even had the degrees in photography, and perhaps you’re a fan of one of my serious series, experimental or macro, or documentary.      

Or you could be there because you’re 18 and want to be daring.  Or you need some money to pay for college.

Whatever the choice, I assure you, this will be sexy sexy roleplay.

My kinks are: clothes, clothed sex, oral, anal, cumplay, photography, good writing, seduction, spanking, light d/s, and more.

6w05ft,6,2017-08-25,"September 5th Approaching. Long, but please read I really need help.",DacaBackUpPlan,DACA,https://www.reddit.com/r/DACA/comments/6w05ft/september_5th_approaching_long_but_please_read_i/,"Hey guys - Throw away account for personal reasons, however the September 5th deadline for DACA is approaching. Fast. I am afraid like most of the lurkers and posters here and I know that the decision for daca can go either way. I need some help.

A bit of background that will help you guys understand my situation a bit more - 
My family did NOT come here illegally. My dad came on a H1B visa, from a small country in the Middle East, and straightforwardly applied for his work permit, and for a Green Card. He was sponsored by his sisters husband (lets call him satan). During his proccess, Satan convinced my dad to send money to us for us to come to America, us being my mom, my little brother, and myself. Anyways, Satan saw the potential my dad had (he has 3 degrees, one of them being a Master's). And he essentially got jealous of him, my dad's lawyer was also Satan's long time friend and lawyer. So during the paperwork submittal proccess of my dads permanent status, the lawyer screwed with the papers and he ""lost"" the approval documentation for the work permit, and the USCIS lost the papers on their end as well. Even though my dad has all of the communication between the USCIS and him and his new lawyer (he got a new one once he found out) documented.

He filed FOIA requests multiple times and went after the government but each time with each lawyer my dad always got the ""we are looking for your papers"" answer from the government.

Now again - as I stated before neither me or my family came here illegally. We have stamped papers showing us admitted into the country legally, and we have stamped passports (non-American) stating our date of entry. So the legal loophole of ""WAITING"" lasted for years and years and years. When I entered the country I was 8 years old, and my little brother was 4. Neither of us had any idea that we technically had no status (that's what our lawyer calls it), since we didn't enter illegally, our papers for green card/citizenship were lost, and there was no end in sight. We basically didn't find out till 2015 when Obama issued the DACA order that we did not have any status in America. Alot of things started making sense to me at that point, why my parents didn't let me get a job, why I didn't have a license, why applying to college was such a hassle (due to lack of social security number).

So our lawyer advised my dad to file for my brother's and my Daca in 2012. We both got approved, and currently I've had Daca for 5 years, and my brother for 2 years (he's in the renewal proccess right now) and mine expires in 2019.

Daca opened MANY doors for me, I was able to get a license hence I was able to get a job to pay for my college tuition. I worked 80-90hr weeks to save up enough money to fund my first year of school going as a Software Engineering Major. In the first year, I excelled in my classes, and maintained a perfect GPA which resulted in me getting a scholarship which was enough to fund my last 3 years, which freed up enough time for me to work software development internships during school and the summer.

In July of 2016, I had enough experience and knowledge of the industry to where I started my own consulting company. Obtained an LLC from my State, and an article of incorporation. I got a EIN from the IRS, and a Tax ID from my states Tax Collectors office so I could legally do business and paid all my taxes (which if any of you guys own your own company, know how much of a hassle it is. THE GOVERNMENT GREATLY PENALIZES YOU FOR DOING GOOD WTF MAN... anyways)

All the above I stated helped me GREATLY while I had to go through the Daca renewal proccess in 2016. Also for anyone whos debating on filing for DACA through a lawyer or by yourself, GO WITH A LAWYER. IT HELPS. AND IS WORTH THE COST.

In May of 2017, I graduated from school with a degree in Software engineering, and with alot of networking, 3 years worth of internship experience, and my parent's prayers, I landed an amazing job at a Fortune 100 company the very next day after graduation. I have been working at this job for 3 months now, and am the frontrunner for a promotion in May of 2018.

So basically, I am not trying to toot my own horn, but the sky is the limit and I have been capped my my dad's mistake of trusting others, and the ever-lasting enemy: time. 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to fix my status? I literally am not at fault, much like all of you who were brought here at a young age, and are now coping with the consequences of no status. Is there anything my dad can do to fight the government? The lawyers have said there are literally 3 options left for us:

* 1. wait longer for the USCIS to do something about our application which was filed 14 years ago

* 2. hope that something good happens and the government creates a path to citizenship for DACA recipients

* 3. heretically go after the federal government, and sue them for everything imaginable (this will however put my family and myself at risk for deportation, which is expected, so we would be fighting the case from a defensive standpoint. Like ""prove that we are illegal and haven't applied for legal stay, and prove we entered illegally"" we have documentation for everything but in the end, I live in Texas, and this is a risky ass move).

We have exhausted all of our options from consulting with lawyers, family, friends, etc. so please follow Redditors. Tell me something.

My situation is very similar, but if anyone has any advice as per my specific situation that differs from the situation /u/byebux posted about, please do comment here...thanks!

This is my first job ever, and while I have done paid gigs helping out friends and family (like babysitting, petsitting, house sitting, yard work, etc), and have had one internship in the past, I've never worked for a big corporation like Starbucks, and have never had to formally quit any sort of job type thing. I have a hard time saying no a lot of the time, and am now annoyingly the *only* person people will ask to cover their shifts, or that the manager will ask to work extra hours if the store needs it simply because in the beginning I always said yes to those things, thinking it would make them think I was a dependable person. (I now do say no to those things most of the time though...but I still feel I have trouble saying no to that sort of stuff.) So I'm scared if I do something like give my two weeks, only for my manager to be like ""actually, can you not?"" that I'll instantly be like ""oh yea sure, no worries, I can totally stay on for as long as you need me...despite that since I'm giving my official two weeks notice I've now planned my entire near future life around that I'm leaving this job."" Almost our entire team has left in the past three months. Some of these leavings were planned and known about way in advance, others came out of nowhere, but were still known about well in advance, and others were really rough (someone who'd given their two weeks notice basically walking out during their last two weeks and saying they couldn't stand to work their last two weeks, another person leaving with just a few days notice saying they were moving to a different city). My manager is good at staying pretty calm and understanding when talking about this sort of stuff with us, but at the same time also has no problems admitting how much it's making her freak out on the inside or how much it makes her wonder if she's doing something wrong as manager. I don't want to feel like the bad guy who makes her freak out even more, but I just absolutely need to leave this job (look at my post history on this sub if you need to know why lol). I don't think she's really done anything wrong as manager, and I think she's a mostly wonderful manager, it's just that there is one coworker who makes my life hell and causes me a ton of anxiety, and also the amount of duties one person winds up having all at once in an understaffed store is just way too complicated for me, and I'm trying to move on to a less complicated job (I've thought about transferring, but all the stores I want to transfer to all say they're heavily understaffed too, and I don't want to move into another store only for it to feel the same...plus I just don't like the job in general to be honest, so I want to work somewhere else). A few new people have been hired recently, but still if I leave soon after another person who's leaving very soon, I don't think there will be enough coverage at my store at all, and I'm worried about my manager trying to convince me I need to stay. I don't know how I'd handle that or react to that...like what do I say to her in that situation? 

I have reasons for leaving that I feel I can truthfully tell her about, like that I just feel the job is too complicated and I'd like to be in a more low key environment, and that I'd like to be working somewhere closer to home or somewhere that deals with a subject matter I'm actually interested in (depending what job I get of the jobs I'm currently trying to get), and that I felt like I just didn't work well with some coworkers (which she already knows a little). However one place that is the most likely of places I might move on to is a local coffee shop near my house. It's still a coffee shop, but it's a lot less busy and a lot less complicated when it comes to duties, and a lot less strict about things like ""no personal drinking water with you on the floor"" etc compared to how Starbucks is. There are some regulars that live near my neighborhood, and I have seen them at this other coffee shop, and when I mentioned it to my manager just cos I thought it was interesting I saw them outside of work she seemed extremely disappointed that we may have lost really loyal regulars to a different coffee place...so if I get a job there I don't think I'd want to tell her that's where I'm moving to...but I know if I tell her I got a different/better job that she'll ask me where, and I don't want to make something up or lie to her about it. 

Also does anyone know if there are two weeks notice letter templates out there that are specific to Starbucks? How do I go about giving the letter to my manager? I do plan to text her and ask if I can talk to her after work one day or if I can come in on a day off to talk to her about stuff, once I have a next job secured, and when we talk in person to tell her that I'm planning to leave and probably some reasons, or vague reasons why. Do I just then awkwardly hand her this written letter about it, even though we've just discussed it in person? Or do I wait until we've talked about it, and then ask her what specific wording needs to be in an official two weeks notice letter, and then draft a letter later and bring it to her?

Mostly I just want to know if I'm going to be moving to this other coffee shop, should I even tell her? And if so, how do I tell her without it making her angry, or how do I react if it does? I'm very worried if I say I'm quitting (whether I tell her I'm going to a different coffee place or not) that her and other coworkers will start acting even more passive aggressively towards me out of spite, and I'm just scared of that happening...they already treat me that way enough to make me leave."

6w28wv,536,2017-08-25,Thoughts after working at Big 4 for one year,public100accountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6w28wv/thoughts_after_working_at_big_4_for_one_year/,"The purpose of this long list is to share what it’s like to work as a staff in public accounting at the Big 4. My goal is to try to show what it is like as a grunt from a ground-level view. Ask me if you have questions.

To introduce myself, I have worked about a year at EY in their Chicago office. I studied at a large public university in the Midwest.

Disclaimer: The following information represents only my personal feelings and ideas about public accounting at a general level. It is intended as general information and nothing more. Take the advice at your own risk.

1.	**What kind of industry you get to work in heavily depends on which office you choose to work at.** During recruiting, I was sold by the recruiters and other professionals who told me about you get to see all kinds of different industries as an auditor, which is true only to a certain extent. You are often limited to the client base available in your specific office. Going to the PwC Detroit office? Almost guaranteed you will be placed on at least one car manufacturer or automotive supplier as a client. Going to Deloitte’s Houston office? Expect oil and gas clients. KPMG’s D.C and Mclean, VA offices basically own the government sector. In EY’s Chicago office, we own the pharmaceutical, real estate, and healthcare industries in the Chicagoland area. If you accept an offer with the EY Chicago office, there is a good chance that you will be placed on a client in one of these industries. Keep this in mind when recruiting with Big 4 and when thinking about what city you want to work in.


2.	**The audit is the same no matter what client you get.** I say this despite #1 above because it’s the truth. Lots of staff 1’s want to get on large, widely known public companies like Facebook or United Airlines because they think it’s sexy. Fact is that the audit is still the same whether you are auditing United or some tiny manufacturing company. You are still doing walkthroughs and still testing accounts the same way. Yes, bigger companies will be more complex and so you will learn a little more but at the staff level you are not testing any high risk accounts anyways so it really doesn’t matter.


3.	Also, nobody cares who your client is because most people have no clue what public accounting or auditing is.  Coming from personal experience, unless they work in finance/accounting, most people will assume you are either do tax stuff or are some kind of business consultant.


4.	That being said…here is a list of some well-known companies that I know are audited by EY: United Airlines, Grubhub, Whirlpool, Aon, BP, McDonalds, Walmart, Lockheed Martin, Facebook.


5.	If you really care about who audits a particular company, search for the company’s 10-k in the company’s website and look up the auditor’s name.


6.	**Your audit team is the biggest factor that determine your work life balance and happiness.** Having seniors friendly enough to coach you and take the time to teach you different things during the audit is extremely important in your first year. In addition to that, you want to have managers and partners that actually care about the team’s work life balance. It’s important to get with a team that you enjoy working with.


7.	**Your client is the next biggest factor that determines your work life balance and happiness.** Some clients will fight tooth and nail to the last dollar when there is a dispute on the numbers that go into the final audit report. Some clients ignore you when you ask for information or give you the wrong things. Some clients don’t know what they are doing. This is why it is important to get on a client that has a reputation for being effective because the client’s behavior towards the audit team basically determines how easy/difficult the audit will be.


8.	**So how do I get on audit teams with great people and clients that are nice to me?** You don’t have to really try because the good news is that 95% of the audit teams and clients out there are good people to work with. That being said, after you start, make sure to keep your ears open when hearing about clients’ reputations and then ask your scheduler to try to get on the clients with good reputations (the scheduler is the person responsible for booking your time on different client engagements). Also, if you enjoy working with a particular senior or manager, ask to get on their other clients so that you can continue to work for them. 


9.	**Understand that depending on where you go to college often determines which office you go to.** This is because the Big 4 offices will recruit from the schools located near them. So if you study at UIUC, you will be recruited by Big 4 from the Chicago office. Many students will request to work at offices in other states and get it (for example, I know a girl from my school went to the San Francisco office). However, it is not always easy as recruiters often want you to come to their office. When recruiting, make sure to clearly articulate what office you want to work and WHY you want it. At Big 4, New York City, Chicago, LA, and San Francisco are some of the most sought-after offices for obvious reasons (more things to do outside of work, more famous clients, wider variety of client base).


10.	**One of best skills you learn in public accounting is learning how to manage several different projects and managing your time and priorities.** During busy season, you will be responsible for several different accounts and other tasks related to the audit that you have to finish in a short amount of time. This forces you to become organized and budget your time accordingly. This is a great skill to have not only in public accounting but anywhere else you go.


11.	**One of the most difficult parts of public accounting is the steep learning curve.** You have to learn many different things in a very short amount of time. It’s not easy and you will most likely make mistakes, but that is ok in your first year.


12.	**One of the most stressful parts of auditing is waiting for stuff from the client.** It is impossible to finish your work until the client gives you what you need. This can be incredibly stressful because when your senior gives you a deadline, you often cannot meet it solely because the client didn’t get it to you in time. Being late when it’s not your fault is a lot more stressful than you may think. Your senior will generally understand that things get backed up because you are waiting for the client, but it is still one of the most annoying aspects of public accounting.


13.	**One of the most enjoyable aspects is seeing the accounting aspect of auditing.** That’s why we all chose accounting right? It’s really cool to see the accounting principles you learned in school being applied in the real world. Journal entries and the debits/credits are sometimes more complicated and less clear-cut than what you see in the textbook, but the basic principle is the same.


14.	**You also learn a lot about how the company works.** You probably heard this before. Auditing a company is a great way to learn and understand how a company operates. You get to see basically every side of the business, from their manufacturing process to the way they make estimates for accruals and reserves. This is part of the reason why public accounting is great preparation for a career in corporate finance/accounting, and the reason why people want to hire people with Big 4 experience.


15.	**Write down everything.** No seriously. If your senior is giving you instructions for a task or if the client is telling you about how their system works, write it all down. Even if you think it’s useless information write it down!! Carrying a notepad and pen with you should be automatic by nature. There is usually too much information to remember.


16.	**During busy season, you will be the one ordering and picking up dinner.** It is expected that first year staffs do this work. Some people whine about having to do bitch work which is dumb because you should have known this before you started. During college, I did a corporate finance internship and I met one of the company bigwigs who told me that his first job during college was to pick up roadkill on the side of the highway. Everyone starts somewhere. Starting your first job in Big 4 is a privilege.


17.	**Unless you are a genius or some kind of audit superstar, you will have basically no idea what you are doing.** It took me about 9 – 10 months to start to get an idea of what I am doing and why I am doing it. This helps make the work more enjoyable.


18.	**Not knowing what you are doing is normal for your first job.** In my opinion, you are basically useless for the first 6 months to 1 year in any job, depending on how difficult the job is. If you feel awful for not knowing anything, remember that it’s ok and not your fault. What is important is that you make an effort to understand your work and that you maintain a positive attitude towards your work and the team you work with.


19.	**Switching service departments after you join full-time.** Tons of audit staff want to switch to advisory, the holy grail of internal transfers. Since a full-time offer from audit is less competitive to get, a lot of students will accept an audit job to get their foot in the door and then try to transfer to advisory once they are a full-time employee.


20.	**The problem is that it is not easy to switch service lines.** Departments hire enough people every recruiting cycle to fill their exact needs. At the same time, everyone wants to do advisory, meaning there are few slots available and lots of competition.


21.	In my opinion, the only way to transfer to advisory from audit is by one of the following ways:
(a) Your dad/mom is an advisory partner (b) Network aggressively with advisory professionals (c) Be an audit superstar so that an advisory manager notices you and picks you up.


22.	All three methods are very difficult to do (first one is impossible for basically everyone). Being an audit superstar can be doable but the problem with this one is that if you are really good at auditing, the manager/partner from your team will try to keep you on their team because they don’t want to lose you. Moving in general is also a logistics hairball for everyone involved. I know a senior who pulled it off but it took him almost one year to finalize the move because everything had to align properly in order for the move to happen. ONE YEAR


23.	**If you want to do advisory, apply for advisory as a student on campus.** It’s way easier to start in advisory than try to move afterwards. Yes, advisory is more competitive and case interviews can be difficult, but I guarantee you that this is the easier way of getting an advisory position at Big 4.


24.	Also, for those of you who really want to do advisory (i.e. consulting)...just remember that you have so many more options than Big 4 advisory. On the prestige scale, Big 4’s consulting practices are not that well-regarded, with the exception of Deloitte. If you want prestige, apply for consulting positions at the Big 3 consulting firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain). There are also hundreds of boutique consulting firms out there. Don’t limit yourself.


25.	**You do not necessarily travel a lot if you choose audit.** A lot of people think that audit = travel and tax = no travel. This is not true. As an auditor, the amount of travel you do depends heavily on the kinds of clients you get put on. I know people in my start class who travel all the time and others who barely leave the EY office (yes a few audit teams actually work out of the EY office, even during busy season. Very few though). All because of the nature of their clients – some clients are headquartered in Iowa and some clients have their corporate office in downtown Chicago. 


26.	**Finish your CPA exam before you start working.** If you have talked to people in public accounting, you probably heard about this already. Not only because it’s impossible to study while working (especially during busy season), but also because public accounting is the easiest and cheapest way to get your license. Big 4 pays for your study materials (Becker is like $4,000 out-of-pocket…), they give you a bonus ($5,000 at EY) if you pass, and you automatically qualify for the work experience requirement (all you need to do is wait one year). If you add in the exam fees that EY reimburses back to you, the company is basically giving you $10,000 just to pass your CPA exam. That’s a hefty amount of money. I imagine it’s similar at the other Big 4.


27.	**You need the CPA when you leave public accounting.** The CPA license is important not because you need it to get promoted to manager (most people are going to leave public accounting before they are manager anyways) but because it gives you serious marketing power when you do leave public accounting. Most companies want (and expect) people to have their CPA license, especially if you are coming from public accounting. If you leave public accounting for something completely unrelated to finance/accounting, you don’t need the license, however.


28.	**Differences between public and private client audits.** Public company audits are generally considered more difficult and busy seasons more intense than private mainly because public companies are subject to more government regulations. On top of your typical audit procedures, you have to test internal controls, which adds a boatload of work. Private company audits are a little easier because you don’t have this extra work and so their busy seasons take up less time. Public audits are more difficult but you learn a lot more about SOX and internal controls, which is useful if you decide to work at a public company in the future. Some people like the balls to wall nature of public clients while others enjoy the more relaxed atmosphere at private clients.

29.    **Take care of your health**. There are going to be long nights where are you sitting and staring at an excel file for hours. You are also under a lot of pressure during busy season. Try to eat healthy and get good sleep during the week. Pack lunch because eating out several days in a row makes you feel like crap. Go running or weightlifting in the morning or at night after work. No job is worth sacrificing your health.

30. **Put things into perspective**. Don't let the stress get to you. I remember being stressed out missing deadlines and not getting things done when I wanted to. Looking back, I realize how all unimportant it is in the grand scheme of things. No really. 5 years from now no one is going to give a shit about whether the 2017 audited accounts payable balance should have been $125 million or $130 million or whatever. Also, your job is to audit a company's financial statements. You aren't looking for fraud (surprise!), you aren't saving lives, you aren't protecting national security, etc. Unless you are actually doing something truly meaningful with your career, don't stress over the excel file you are staring at. I'm not saying public accounting is not meaningful (the stock market cannot operate without us), I just want people not to lose focus over what is important (your health and your happiness).  

&amp;nbsp;  

A few additional points that came up after my initial post:

(31) **You get to work with your peers**. This is one thing that some young people like about Big 4. The people you work with day-to-day are all around your age. Your boss (the senior) is usually only a few years older than you. It can be easier to relate to and work with people like you. This usually isn't the case outside of public accounting. Unless you work for a tech company or a startup, the average age of the company's employees will often be +35. When I did my corporate finance internship, my boss was in his 40s and most of the other people around me were in similar age, had kids, or were married. I personally did not mind working with older people, but a lot of people fresh out of college find it more enjoyable to work with peers. Big 4 gives you this opportunity for sure.


(32) **An additional comment about advisory**. I think my comments above make advisory at Big 4 look like it's not that cool and difficult to get. To be clear, it's definitely a great job that you can get if you make a serious effort, especially if you go to a target school and have good academics. The Big 4 brand is well-recognized so you are an elite regardless of what service line you are in. My point is that you there are other great consulting brands out there that can give you similar or better work experience. I remember seeing so many people during college trying to do Big 4 advisory and I just couldn't help wonder why they were so focused on only Big 4.


(33) **So how difficult is it really to transfer from audit to advisory?**. It really depends on the circumstances and the factors in your situation. Whether spots are available when you request the transfer. How long you have worked at the firm. Whether you are an above-average performer. Again, my original point wasn't to suggest that transferring is impossible. It's just relatively more difficult and I want people to have the correct expectations when they think ""oh I'll get in the door with audit and then transfer after working one year"". My personal opinion is that it is still easier to get into advisory as a student applying for full-time positions rather than trying to move after you are an employee. 


(34) **When is the best time to leave?** This question is asked by everyone at every stage of their time at Big 4 (yes even staff 1s). In my opinion, I think it depends on what you want to do after public accounting. If you want to go on the controller/CFO track, it's probably better to stay until senior or manager. If you want to do corporate finance/FP&amp;A/corporate accounting, I think it's good enough to have 2-3 years. It is generally considered that more time at Big 4 is better. However, don't stay too long so that you feel pigeonholed as an accountant if you want to do something different afterwards. Everyone will have their own opinions about this question, which you should keep in mind if you decide to solicit advice from the people around you. Also be careful when getting career advice from the higher ups. It's in the company's best interest that you stay so they will usually tell you to stay. YOU know what's best for YOU."
6w2d0l,1,2017-08-25,28 M4F - Pick an option...,iamincontrol69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6w2d0l/28_m4f_pick_an_option/,"Hey DPP, A couple of different options here. I'm interested in finding someone who wants to play longterm with a few casual messages a day. I'm always keen to see where a partner will take these prompts so feel free to lead the way with whatever floats your boat!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Option 1**


Your phone buzzes in your hand as you walk through the busy office. The young new intern trying to make her way in the world as my latest secretary.


You unlock the phone and read my message


*""How does it feel to be walking through the halls with your panties filled with that thick load of sticky warm cum""*

You can feel your face burn red as you read the message, each step you take reminds you of the sticky mess in your underwear.


It was only 10mins ago that you were in my office, bent over my desk with your mascara running down your cheeks as you quietly whimpered and begged for me to fill your tight little pussy.


Instead I slowly pulled my cock from you and began to fill the soft underwear caught around your young thighs.


I didn't say many words as I groaned deeply as I stroked my thick load into the material before pulling them up, a feeling you weren't familiar with as I pulled your skirt back down over your tight little ass.


You did as expected, turning and dropping to your knees wrapping your lips around me to clean up the mess you'd made just like I'd insisted in our previous encounter.


*buzz buzz* another message


*""My little slut. Walking the office with drenched panties. Next time it'll be that perfect little ass""*


**Option 2**


You suddenly wake up. You panic. Where are you? What's happening? What's that smell? Alcohol?


And then the fear really sets in as you slowly begin to wake up properly you realise your small wrists are pinned down and there's a heavy weight on top of you, pressing you face down into the couch.


You scream for me to get off, your small frame thrashes under me. Suddenly I have both your small wrists pinned above you in one big rough hand.


The stench of alcohol strong as you feel my other rough hand slip under your skirt, pushing it up as my fingers slide between your thighs and roughly run along your underwear.


Shit... You must have drifted off.


But you trusted me... But you realise you were wrong as you squeal at my touch. 


**Option 3**


I've been watching you for the better part of a few months now. 

The gorgeous girl next door who suddenly seems to be developing into one hell of a woman. Heck, you must be at least a good 10 years younger than me but I can't help but look at every inch of your body.


People joke about the classic ""Girl next door"" look but I swear to god you were it. Tits that I could only dream about what they must look like when not covered up by one of your running tops or that perfect little ass I just want to sink my face into.


If I didn't know better I'd think you were a tease too, you've often caught me off guard with a chirpy ""hello"" that drips with sugar as you bounce down the driveway.


Then again, there are times where I feel like i've caught you blushing when I've been able to bring myself to saying a friendly hello back and asking about your day.


Today I decided I was going to take my chance. My wife was away for the weekend and it was going to be now or never. You had just come back from a run, it's crazy hot and the beads of sweat grab my attention as the drip down your firm cleavage.


""Hey, looks pretty hot today"" I say, looking up from my gardening as you catch your breath.


My big broad shouldered frame standing up as you turn to reply. You feel small as you have to look up at my big frame towering over you.


""Hey, I was thinking... days like this you know you're more than welcome to come over and use my pool right? Great way to cool off"""
6w32fj,12,2017-08-25,Game IX.A - Solstice: Rules and Roles,SOLSTICE_PHX,hogwartswerewolvesA,https://www.reddit.com/r/hogwartswerewolvesA/comments/6w32fj/game_ixa_solstice_rules_and_roles/,"#ALL AVAILABLE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILLED

In September, there will be two games running simultaneously:

* Game A: Solstice - hosted by /u/chamberthecartridge and /u/elbowsss

#Mechanics

This will run similar to a traditional game of Werewolf.

Signups will close at 10pm EDT on August 31st. Shortly after, you will receive your PM with role information. Within that message, you will learn how to confirm your role. You will have a little less than 24 hours to do this. You will have until September 1st at 10pm EDT to confirm. The game will begin at approximately 10pm EDT on September 2nd. From that moment, all posts will be locked at 10pm EDT, and the new post will be available as soon as it is ready. This will never take more than two hours.

All players will begin as one of three factions: Administration, Insurrection, or Intern. For the purpose of this game (and often in real life), Administration is Evil. Insurrection is Good. Interns align with the Insurrection by default, but their affiliation can change.

Administration will be divided into UPPER and LOWER sectors. Each will have their own planning sub, and they will be given a full roster of each.  

We will utilize a combined night/day phase. Order of operations denotes that Lynches will happen first. Night time will happen as follows: 

Heads of Internal Affairs -&gt;  Recruiters -&gt; Scouts -&gt; Enforcers -&gt; CEO action  -&gt; Voyeur Results -&gt; Asst Managers 

Night roles will submit first choice and second choice options. If their first option was eliminated during the Lynch, they will perform their action on their second choice. 

Vote results will be shown in full. Roles will be shown upon death. If there is a tie, all involved parties will die. 

**Once dead, players are to be completely removed from the game. They will not be permitted to comment within the game sub.**

The Autumnal Equinox will be triggered when about 40% of the players are left OR on September 23rd (whichever happens first). When the Equinox is triggered, all recruited interns will join their designated side. Those joining the Administration will be added to the Lower Admin sub as Goons. 

This game is estimated to last 2-3 weeks. The hosts hold the right to adjust mechanics in order to ensure this game ends naturally before the end of the month. 

___

#CURRENT JOB OPENINGS AT SOLSTICE INC

##UPPER Administration (Evil) - PRIVATE SUB 1

**These roles will each occur 0-2 times.**

**CEO** - Every night phase, the CEO can choose between Kill, Fire, and Recruit. The same option cannot be chosen for more than two turns in a row. If the CEO dies, another Evil player moves up a notch. Only players in the UPPER Admin sub are eligible to be CEO. As long as there are players in the UPPER Admin sub, there will always be a CEO. 

- Recruit: the CEO himself heads out to find an Intern. If successful, that intern will join the LOWER ADMIN as a goon on the solstice. After the Solstice is triggered, the CEO loses the ability to Recruit. 
- Kill: the Assassin is sent out to kill. The killed player will be removed from the game and added to the ghost sub. 
- Fire: the CEO heads out to fire. Firing can only be targeted towards a player in one of the evil subs. If fired, they transfer to the opposite sub and lose access to the sub they were previously in.

**President** - The person in the Upper Admin sub with the most longevity is the President. They become the CEO if the CEO kicks the bucket. 

**Goon** - If you are in the Upper Admin sub and you are not the CEO or President, you are a goon. 

## Both UPPER and LOWER Administration (Evil) - PRIVATE SUB 1 AND 2

**This role will occur 1 time.**

**Vice President** - Can never become the CEO or Assassin. Will have access to both subs. If the VP dies, the subs lose their communication link and can’t coordinate. 

##LOWER Administration (Evil) - PRIVATE SUB 2

**These roles will each occur 0-2 times.**

**Assassin** - Chooses one person every night. If sent out by the CEO, their target will die. If the assassin is killed, a goon will take their place. 

**Goon** - If you are in the Lower Admin sub and you are not the Assassin, you are a Goon. 

##Insurrection (Good) 

**These roles will each occur 0-2 times.**

**Director** - Leader of the Insurrection. If targeted by an assassin OR lynch, it will take an extra day for him to die. 

**Manager** - LOVES his job. If he’s attacked, he’s going to take down his attacker with him. If he is lynched, he gets to choose one person to die alongside him (they will die the following phase).

**Assistant Manager** Like any organized worker, the assistant manager keeps extensive records. Every four phases, they will be told the number of Administration still alive. This number includes Interns that have pledged themselves to the Admin but have not yet joined their planning sub.

**Recruiter** - Every night, they choose one intern to convert to the Insurrection. After the Solstice is triggered, they lose their ability. 

**Enforcer** - Get 5 kills for the duration of the game. If they kill 3 members of the Insurrection, they will die too. This includes Interns that have pledged themselves to the Insurrection AND Interns that have not yet been recruited. 

**Head of Internal Affairs** - Chooses one player to protect every night. This protection includes ALL actions by the Administration AND the Insurrection (all kills, all recruits). The HoIA can not choose to protect the same person twice in a row. 

**Scout** - Chooses one person to investigate every night. They will learn their role.

**The Manager’s Nephew, Dave** - The Manager looks out for his family, and so Dave can not be lynched. The only way Dave can die is if he is taken out by the Admin. 

##Interns

**(EVERYONE ELSE)**

**Voyeur** - Spies on one person every night. They get to see who (if anyone) their target submitted an action (if they have one) on. They do not get to know what this action is. Voyeurs CAN be recruited. 

**Double Agent** - Is recruited to the team opposite the one that approaches them 

**Rogue** - At the beginning of the game, they get to choose the team they join, regardless of whether or not they are approached by a recruiter at a later date.

**Regular old Intern** - On the Solstice, they will join the team that approached them most recently. If no team approached them, they side with the Insurrection by default.

___

#Win Conditions

The **Administration** wins once they have eliminated all the Insurrection.

The **Insurrection** wins once they have eliminated all the Administration. *This includes interns that have pledged themselves to the Admin but have not yet been added to the evil subs.*

___

#Additional Information

- Game A’s theme is not based on any existing fandom. It is meant to simulate an office environment. 
- If the Upper Admin sub runs empty, a new CEO will not be chosen, and so the Admin will lose the ability to Fire and Recruit.
- You may choose to abstain from a night action for strategic reason. Just mention it in the space provided for notes. 


___

#Rules

1.  Activity: If you fail to vote or submit a night action for 3 days total, you will be removed from the game.
2. If you are editing comments, it should be made clear why you’re editing. If you made an error, use strikethroughs on the information you want removed, but don’t delete it. If you want to add something, put it at the end what you’re adding. **Do not share information, then immediately edit your comment to hide what you said from others. Do not delete comments.**
3. While you may mention (or lie about) receiving PMs from the facilitators, discussing exact wording is prohibited. 
4. Comments in this game should be in English and free of encryption. We ask that players do not try to find workarounds to this.

6w37ne,2,2017-08-25,[M4F] - Interview with a Lady,OdetoVenus,DirtyStoryWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyStoryWriting/comments/6w37ne/m4f_interview_with_a_lady/,"There was something about powerful women that I *loved*.  I wasn’t intimidated by them, like many of my peers.  And I wasn’t a male sub that drooled at the thought of being dominated by them – though I would gladly please a girl I liked as she sat on my face, if it came down to it.  

I was, for my age, doing very well.  Twenty-five, with lean muscles, short copper hair, and hazel eyes that were a stormy mix of grey and grey, flared with amber in the center when my pupils were constricted.  I had no student debt.  I made a fair amount of money as a writer, and had worked several odd jobs – from building marine aquariums, to working in the floral, maintenance, and several other departments of a grocery store, to photography.  I hoped to go to grad school, in the highly selective field of English Literature or the even more selective MFA programs in poetry – but I was making a living already, and I knew I had a decent chance of getting a start in a career in a number of fields.  

My recommendations were outstanding, and though I wasn’t naturally loud, when a group needed a leader I naturally took the role, and did it well.  So although many took me as an introvert, I had in fact won awards for public speaking back in school.

Additionally, I was handy, which was increasingly rare in most men, oddly enough.  I could work on plumbing or electricity, I knew how to fix basic problems on cars and water heaters and HVAC units.  I could fix most things, given time and a reason.

In other words, I had little trouble getting a date, and most of those dates would end positively.  I wasn’t particularly interested in casual sex, though, although I had enough experience to ensure what I did *worked*.  I had been told by multiple women that I’d made them feel things they’d never felt before when I ate them out.  And I’d had others want me to be their constant dom, saying I was what they’d sought, able to tease them in all the right ways.

And of course I was good at just vanilla sex too.

But none of it was satisfying.  Because I didn’t want the girls in my social group.

I wanted a doctor, or a political figure, or a CEO, or a ranking officer.  I wanted an architect, a business owner, the head editor of a major magazine.  I wanted the heir to the Rothschild fortune, or a Kennedy.

I couldn’t explain it – maybe it was the fact they were independent and successful, and they deserved a guy who wasn’t trying to exploit their power, or neg them, or “put them in their place.”

The trouble was – how do you meet these women?

I was mentally bemoaning the situation, dressed in navy dress pants, cordovan shoes, and a button down dress shirt of a light pink shade, walking through the marble lobby of the beautiful new building, sipping coffee, heading for a table and chair so I could pull out my phone and figure out where in the building – which was as confusing to navigate as it was beautiful – the person I was supposed to interview for this profile.  I’d been published in enough prestigious places that doing a multi-page profile for a major publication could net me some serious money; but the people who deserved to have profiles written about them were rarely easy to reach, so even though I’d been told my interview had been confirmed, I hadn’t been able to talk to my interviewee, or get instructions to the meeting place.

In fact, I knew almost nothing about who I would soon meet.  Writing a profile was an in-depth, long process, requiring me to spend a lot of time with my assignment.  Just being given a meeting place -- not a name or anything else, was beyond unusual.  I’d asked about that simply been told they wanted my view to go in blind; which was bullshit -- I was being stonewalled.  But I wasn't going to turn down a chance to write something high-profile.  I ran my eyes over the listings of who exactly worked in this massive testament to beauty-first architecture.  It was a collection of powerful companies and positions.

I sipped my coffee, and figured out my meeting place was actually only a single floor up, in another sitting area.  Getting there took me through two security checks, and both called to check about my temporary pass.

It seemed excessive, but on the second floor I could see why they didn’t want the general public wondering in.  It was filled with valuable materials, from the flooring, to the paintings, to globes and statues and furniture.  There were live plants, the walls were almost solid glass, and the entire floor was open, with raised daises along the edges of the massive circle.  I thought I recognized noise cancellers around each dais -- they had the style of Bang and Olufsen or some other exotic architectural brand, but played no music -- I had heard about these devices, meant to prevent people from eavesdropping.  And with the completely open views of the floor, and one trying would be seen.  A place to discuss very sensitive deals then.  I headed to the designated dais for the meeting, taking a seat on a quilted leather chair, pulling out my notepad and Montblanc fountain pen and setting them on the marble coffee table.  

I felt nervous; I’d never felt nervous before an interview before.  Just who was I meeting?

OOC| Intern / boss is played out.  Let's enjoy the fresh new dynamic!

As long as your character is a woman who's been very successful, it fits.  age could vary wildly -- don't feel like you can't play if you're younger -- maybe you were a business prodigy and I'm also willing to change my character's age.  

kinks: romance, clothes, clothed sex, mild voyeur, mild exhibition, stripteasing, oral, anal, spanking, light d/s, dirty talk, sex outside the bedroom, affection, and more.

limits: heavy pain, gore, scat, watersports.

All kinks are of course negotiable."
6w39as,3,2017-08-25,Need a (probably long) break,pudeet,Petioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petioles/comments/6w39as/need_a_probably_long_break/,"Hey petioles,


Getting ready for bed on my first day sober in over 50 days. I'm only 19 years old and have smoked weed easily 75% of days in the last four years. I've spent $10,000+ on weed (lucky enough to have made more than that through playing a video game, but still that's way too much). This summer after my freshmen year of college I spent $2,000 alone on weed. I killed an ounce in 3 days, 33 grams in 4, and can smoke a half g wax pen in 2 days. In other words -- especially for a guy my age -- my usage is ridiculously excessive. Yet to me, it feels normal. 


Just reading that paragraph makes me say WTF, and I expect some of you may find those numbers hard to believe. Even more shocking however is that, to an extent, I've gotten away with it. I had an OK internship this summer, made Deans List both semesters, fucked 3 new girls in college and have earned over $50,000 playing a video game in the past 2.5 years. Ok, enough ego-stroking. 


What the fuck am I doing? If I can do all that blazing constantly, imagine where I'd be without the lethargy, lack of confidence and time sink that is weed. Additionally, despite those accomplishments, and incase it isn't obvious based on my level of weed usage -- I'm not reaching my full potential. I can think of countless missed romantic, academic and financial opportunities that have resulted from my weed usage.


In 10 or so days I begin my sophmore year of college. There is shit I want to do. I want to fuck hotter girls, girls I'm too nervous to talk to high, girls I'm not witty enough to talk to after being up till 1am blazing and then waking and baking. I don't want an OK internship. I want a fucking good one that I'll enjoy and will advance my career. For that though, I must study and work hard in addition to just doing my schoolwork. 


Its fucked because I dont know sober life. I've taken one 55 day break and two 30 day breaks in the past four years. The 55 day break was when I was injured, so I couldnt really experience life sober. I'm both proud that I was able to do these things with this addiction partially controlling my life as well as frustrated that I let my usage get to this point.


Moral of the story: I'm not sure what its gonna take to get me to get my head out of my ass, realize my potential and take a long sober look at life. I do know however, that unless I take a break -- unless I take the risk of feeling like shit and dealing with pressure from friends and really mostly myself -- it will only get worse and harder.


I hope this post in combination with some other recent events in my life will allow me to realize how lucky I am to not be in a much worse position due to my addiction. Ultimately though, I hope and -- if I want to see what I'm capable of -- NEED to face my addiction head on and take a very long break from weed until I better understand my existence and have more fully realized my potential as young man.


Realistically, that probably means 3-6 months. And as scary as it is to think of going back and not having a release, not having a welcome back session with my homies, having to either flake on or resell the weed I've agreed to buy tomorrow -- I WANT TODAY TO BE DAY 1 of those months. If I can do it, I have no doubt I will fucl hotter girls, get the internship I want and just as importantly: stand up to an addiction that has controlled me for the entirety of my life as a young adult."
6w4fef,1,2017-08-26,"M4F- reluctance, shock, confusion - when a naive lady meets a male pornstar...",veryyoungveryhung,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6w4fef/m4f_reluctance_shock_confusion_when_a_naive_lady/,"As the title suggests, both scenes involve a naïve, well behaved or at least very professional young lady suddenly realising that she is meeting a male pornstar.

I love the contrast between the two characters backgrounds, the difference between how they both think and act. Especially though I love the change in thoughts that go through her head, from shock and potentially disgust (or something similar) to eventually intrigue and more...


**Interview with a pornstar**

I roleplay as a fictitious male pornstar now going into more legitimate films. In this rp your character would either be a little shy and possibly nervous about meeting a man with that sort of a background or she would be entirely unaware of my previous employment (I could be going into legitimate acting and you are interviewing me regarding a new movie I am in).

Gradually, as the interview progresses you start asking me about my previous roles and experience, not quite realising what you are getting yourself into!


**Don’t talk to the neighbours!**

We've lived next door to you for a while and for as long as anyone can remember, we've butted heads with your parents. We were too loud, throwing parties two or three nights per week, music blaring, people shouting and likely plenty of drugs. They've called the cops on us a few times, but it seems we're pretty sweet with them too - if only your parents knew how and why! Naturally your parents have told you to stay away from us. You couldn't really figure out why, after all we seem really nice and always wave and say hello. We don't look strange - quite the opposite in fact, we're rather attractive; my wife a pretty and athletic brunette in her early twenties and me a tall, muscular guy in his early thirties. But being a good girl, you did as you were told. Keeping it to just a friendly smile and nod whenever you passed us.

So when your parents start to get really strict (whether it's over your grades/getting a job/your behaviour etc) and you want to get rebellious, there's an obvious place to go. I mean we're only next door, we seem like the kind of people to listen!

I mean, how are you to know that we're pornstars?

**A pornstar in the office!**

The office is generally very boring. People here don't hate Mondays because of the stress their job gives them. They hate Mondays because it's the start of another work week of mind melting monotony. Dull, tedious work that seems to transcend the very concept of time. 

But this week there's something new. Something different. A new starter who seems somewhat mysterious. He's tall, around 6'2 and while he's only averagely attractive with his blonde hair and beard, he's built like someone who would look more happy swinging an axe around on a battlefield somewhere. Broad shoulders, muscular arms and chest fill out his plain work shirt to the point of it stretching. While his plain black trousers must have been specially made to fit round thighs that more resemble tree trunks than legs. 

There's talk going around too, spreading through the air like a virus without a host. 

*'Former prisoner, 'once killed a guy'.*

*'Don't be silly, we don't hire ex cons. No, I reckon he's a failed sports star'*

*'Janine says he was in a couple of films'*

*'I've not seen him in anything! Are you sure?'*

*'That's because he was in porn. Hung like a gifted horse apparently!'*

*'No way! Bullshit!'*

*'why not send in the intern. Find out the truth!'*

The girls snigger before approaching you. You've not worked here long but all the time you've been dying to be brought into the circle of trust. It wasn't hard for them to get you to agree to do his induction...

((So I'm trying to set up a rather awkward interaction between my character, a former male pornstar who has taken to working in an office to try to get a real job. And your character, an innocent, naive intern who has very little sexual experience and would certainly never have watched porn))


**Celeb possibility!**

You're filming a new TV show/movie but you're co star is completely is completely unfamiliar to you.  Which is strange, because he seems to confident in front of the cameras and he says he's been in dozens of films before..

6w4ic5,4,2017-08-26,My first adventure!,cadaverco,motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/6w4ic5/my_first_adventure/,"[First off, pics of the bike](https://imgur.com/a/zwCL1) 

#TL;DR Rode my bike for several hours, hung out with my friend and we worked on my bike for the first time. Went for my first night ride where I topped out my bike and bought an oil pan from walmart that I transported home by tieing it to my backpack with some rope. Met a super chill clerk at a gas station who had the same bike as me and now owns the bike I plan on buying. Rode home with my oil pan and am now super high on life.

Today started with me riding my bike around 45 minutes to a college that I used to work at. I stopped by the IT department and showed my colleagues my bike, hung out with them and whatnot.

As it turns out they were actually interviewing students that did the same program that I did in order to determine who would essentially take my place at the internship.

But I digress, back to the ride. I rode back towards my house around 30 minutes or so, then took some back roads that were nothing but wide open roads for miles. Probably spent another 30 minutes riding down backroads. 

Then I came to an interstate that I recognized. I knew that interstate was just huge wide open straight roads and since there are tons of amish people and buggies there is a buggy lane thats great for passing moms in minivans.

I rode that for about 5 miles or so until I came upon a town near my house that's home to the gym I work out at. I got a quick workout in and hopped back on the bike.

There just happens to be a Honda shop near where the gym is at so I stopped by there as well and picked up some chain lube. 

Since it's a sport bike (albeit a small sport bike) there's legit nowhere to put anything that isn't the size of a pair of shorts so I ended up just putting the can of chain wax in my pocket.

Rode home, dropped it off and chilled at my house for a little bit.

A friend of mine stopped by and we swapped out my air filter and adjusted my idle speed. Idle was way too high and I had been meaning to fix it but didn't realize that it would be as easy as it was.

Got that squared away and took it for a test ride of around 5 minutes to make sure it worked. I was about to just take my helmet but I remembered, ATGATT. Put on my jacket, gloves, boots and jeans.

Bike ran great! Idled back low where it was supposed to and worked like a champ. We were planning on changing the oil but I realized last minute that I didn't have an oil drain pan so that idea got scratched. Working on the bike for the first time made me really feel a closer connection to the machine that I ride.

We ate some pizza and he went home. I chilled for a little bit longer but then decided it was time for a night ride.

I rode around for a little bit but it's quickly becoming September and I got cold.

Shit was the bomb but I was cold so I came back home and got compression pants and inserts for my jacket to keep warmer. Then I got my backpack, found some rope in my garage and set off to go to Walmart with them. 

On my way there I topped my bike out at like 95 which was fun as hell but was cold af even with the inserts and shit. I got to Walmart and picked up my oil pan. Payed for it at self check out and had the lady running it help me tie it to my backpack with the rope. 

After leaving walmart I stopped by marathon right across the street to get gas. The clerk inside immediately asked me what bike it was. I told him it was a ninja 250 and he showed me his old ninja 250 that he traded for an R6. Then he showed me his r6. So badass, and I was already considering the R6 as my next bike.

I added him on snap and bought like 5 bucks worth of gas. (250cc for the win!) Rode home with an oil pan tied to my backpack and topped out again after going around a wide sweeping bend on at 70. 

Got home, untied the oil pan and am planning on changing the oil tomorrow. 

I apologize for the wall of text but today was so much fun and I just felt like sharing it with some fellow motorcycle enthusiasts. "
6w4mq4,14,2017-08-26,Has anyone else had issues with John Hopkin's?,zambamboz,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/6w4mq4/has_anyone_else_had_issues_with_john_hopkins/,"When I was starting the process to get approved for T I went to John Hopkin's in Baltimore because they apparently had good trans resources/trans health doctors.

First appointment I had with them was basically a general health check up which went fine but during the examination when they usually just sit you back and feel up your organs for any abnormalities, the doctor and her intern literally lifted my shirt to look at my bare chest and pulled down my pants to look at my pubic area all without my permission. Having high anxiety I literally sat back and took it. I felt like a medical anomaly the entire time.

After that we got the 2nd appointment set up and when the time came me and my oh, so supportive mother went in and waited to be called. We were called and they basically took us both in separate rooms and interviewed the both of us. They asked me a LOT of invasive questions that have nothing to do with being trans. Like tons of in depth questions about sex/sexual situations. This was over 2 yrs ago but the most vivid in my mind were ""When did you start masturbating and how?"" and ""Have you ever thought about or have had sexual relations with animals?"". Apparently they asked my mother the same types of questions only asking in a more ""gossipy"" manner (like ""have you ever noticed your child doing 'X"" or ""do you know if your child 'Y"").

Afterwards they let us return to one another and brought us into another room together to ask me more questions with the head doctor there. The one I could remember the most during that ""interview"" was something along the lines of ""Do you have a male role model?"". Bless my mum for being there with me because that entire situation had me shaken up and I couldn't really answer anymore questions and she was able to help me along.

After all this bs they put me through, they basically said ""No we can't start you on T because you have a general anxiety disorder that we want you to see our therapists about"" which no shit, I take medicine for that. I know this already and have known this for years before going to JH's.

We left with me basically in tears and again, bless my mum for being there for me because I'm sure I would've just shut down had she not been there with me.

A few months later I found a new doctor and they started me on T during the 1st appointment I had with them (Chase Brexton. I HIGHLY recommend them).

TL;DR: John Hopkin's is shit and made me jump though hoops and treated me like a medical oddity just to let me know they wouldn't start me on HRT. Fuck John Hopkin's."

Hello, my SO and I have been in a relationship for...well next week it will be our 2 year anniversary. We have been long distance on and off as I study in Germany and do a lot of internships all over the place. I'm currently finishing one up in USA and will be coming back home on Monday. 

For the last 2 weeks my SO has known that I will come back soon, but I havent given him a date since I had to finish something up here. 
So actually 2 weeks ago I was telling how I would go back home within the next 3 weeks tops. 
And he just mentiones ""Just so you know I'll busy on Sunday so don't complain for not giving an exact date"". It was totally fine with me, he said he has a bautizm in the day, and at night he is going to a Fashion Exhibit. He is all into fashion, so this isn't something new.

What is new is that he didnt invite me and actually told me not to complain 'cuz was gonna be busy. 
You see, since we began dating he was eager to take me to all this fashion shows and stuff.

So I asked, ""why? I can't come?""
No, said my SO. ""It is an exclusive event, per invitation"", he claimed.
I was like hmm Ooook.

Next thing I'm browsing FB and see this anouncement for the Fashion Show, urging people to go and invite friends...the add said you have to email to get reserve your place. And so I did. Whithin minutes my place was confirmed, and my trust a little broken. Why did he lie to me to begin with?

Fast forward to last weeks Skype, and I ask him about the show. I tell him again that I want to, to what he replied that he got the exclusive invite and can't just simply ask for another seat like if he deserved everything.
I tell him that's bullshit, and that I already have my entry ticket. To what he laughs and says yeaaah sure.
I insist I do, and he keeps brushing it off. 
At this pont is pretty obvios that he is hiding somethig. 
I flat out ask him why he doesn't want me to come, and he says it is not that, it's simply that he cannot get a second invite and because he will be in business mode handing out his fashion photography business cards.
I get internally mad I just say, ""yeah ok w/e, I already got my ticket so see you there"" and just laughed and brushed it off again.

I NEED ADVICE. How do I proceed here? I need your perspective dear redditors.

I see this data:
Fact: He doesn't want me to be there -&gt; why?
why? -&gt; he answers with an invalid excuse -&gt; he is hiding something.  -what?
I don't know and this worries me.
OR he just doesn't want me distracting him from presenting himself as photographer. In which case he can just tell me that, and not come up with a bullshot ""invitation only"" excuse when I got a ticked in 30 sec. of typing an email.

Now, as said I come back on Monday.  But the show is on Sunday. So I will miss it even though I do have a ticket
SO NEED ADVICE: How do I proceed or confront him?? My question is how to confront hom in a non overreacting way.

Also, should I change my flight for tomorrow saturday so I can show up there as a surprise and see whats up,? I feel this is very stalkerish and goes beyond the border of "" trust is so broken I have to semi spy on you"" even though I did tell him multiple times I have a ticket and ""see you there"".???

Tldr: Im coming back home on Monday. SO is attending an event on Sunday. He doesn't want me to be there and makes excuses such as ""its an exclusive event, invite only, cant get one for you sorry"". I got a ticket by myself in 30 sec. I tell him I have a ticket, he brushes it off. Do I show up uninvited on Sunday or how do I confront him today or tomorrow saturday about what is he hiding.

6w5ist,24,2017-08-26,"23M4M - The Dog's Pet (Femboy, Bestiality and all sorts of good stuff that definitely won't result in some random dude taking the time to downvote me)",yoursissygf,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6w5ist/23m4m_the_dogs_pet_femboy_bestiality_and_all/,"*Sarcasm aside, I'm mostly into two aspects of this particular fantasy:*

1. *The slutty-moan worthy attraction of primal fucking.*

2. *The fun power-reversal dynamics of being owned by an animal.*

3. ... *Fuck it, knots are pretty hot too...*

*Anyway, without further dallying, the prompt:*

---

No one at work knows who I am. Not really. To them, I'm just the skinny, introverted, effette intern who does the photocopying and makes sure a pot of coffee's always on the boil. Most of them assume that I'm gay - I'm bi, actually, but my history of hetero behaviour is so minute I don't care to correct them - but if they knew who my current boyfriend was... Well, I wouldn't have a job anymore, that much is certain.

Now, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. 

To be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.

I first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.

You, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.

However, your owner was far from concerned. ""Happens all the time,"" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. ""Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.""

Needless to say, I was far from impressed.

Twelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.

I revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.

Come the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. ""Come on, man,"" he pleaded. ""It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you."" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.

No such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...

About a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. 

I strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.

I keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.

I don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.

And with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.

I've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.

I find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. 

The mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.

Our eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...

---

*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*

*I'm also open to incorporating a third, human character (male or female) that gets off on my living situation, with possible blackmail involved. That said, I'd prefer the story's focus stay with myself and my canine lover.*

*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*

*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*

*Edit: Please try and be creative, or at the very least informative in your reply. One-liners are... Less than ideal.*"
6w6whz,1,2017-08-26,Feeling alone with my mindset plenty of friends,McMckenna,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6w6whz/feeling_alone_with_my_mindset_plenty_of_friends/,"İ can't tell if i don't have common sense or others don't. İ take the least biased approach i can to everything but my family seems to not. For example i was smoking around my cousins around the same age of 17 and my aunt got mad at me. However the adults ALWAYS smoke around them with no thought. İ also wish i was able to do what i wish my goals and hobbies aren't the same as most turkish kids. İ use drugs i may or may not have sold drugs heavily interested in crypto currency looking at ways to set up passive income etc. When i tell these goals to my dad he has this look of sadness and I'm tired of it why can't he be happy that i actually enjoy something being a kid who went through severe depression last year. They try to protect me too much but don't realize that it may lead to me continuing the behaviors later in life when they're not around like when I'm in college which is most likely not something I'm going to and haven't told them as it'd put them in distress. 
    
My brother seems to hate me now as we argue over the smallest things. He gets mad when i try to hug him or tickle him 70 percent of the time but when anyoe else does he's fine with it. İ think this might be because of the stress i put my family through this year. Like i said i may or may not have sold drugs and consumed and that made my dad extremely stressed. İ can see where he's coming from legally but he has to realize weed isn't a big deal legally in the states most ill get is a ticket but he also has a moral view on it that I'm poisoning everyone else which simply isn't true if i do it or do not they will get what they want in a city filled with dealers. 

   İ also made a lot of bad choices this year i only went to school 44 percent of the year failed as a result but that was from my depression and stress there was so much happening. İ smoked more than daily just to run away from that feeling and lost sense of self. My dad told us he had cancer after him and me got in a huge argument and my brother and mom started bawling but i couldn't bring myself to cry i held back the tears bc i felt that he was using it as a way to stop me from consuming drugs and heed to his will on his last years. The stress obviously made him look worse overtime but i couldn't realize. İ never wanted to be home no one would talk to each other and i always felt like shooting myself in the head.

   Fast forward to now we came to Turkey for the summer visiting family. He seems a lot healthier but still hasn't quit smoking. İ was very content at first but as time passed everyone showed there true colors (i showed mine from the beginning as its important). Now its more distant i find myself talking to everyone less and i get this feeling that my brother wishes our one year older cousin was his brother and not his shithead failing classes no goals in life excuse of a brother (don't view myself that way just the way i think he sees me). İm slipping back into depression and i hate it. 

   İ just got news that the school i was trying to transfer to won't accept me and i most certainly can't stay in this speaclized high school filled with butt fuck teachers but don't want to go to another traditional school. The one i was to go to was great you go to internships 2 or three times out of your school days that you choose and i thought it'd help me broaden my horizons. İ want to fix everything but i know i can't so i just really really want my own place and to be able to do my own thing without judgement. İ have nothing wrong with someone saying thats a bad idea but i can't stand when they say you will never do that. My dad didn't want me working at luna park just bc theres a lot of smokers there. İve always complied when i was smaller and they always made many promises to me most of which were never fulfilled maybe thats why i value freedom so much. Sorry for the unorganized vent/rant i just need a community who might understand me to talk to"
6w765k,1,2017-08-26,I [26F] have absolutely no interest in being with my first boyfriend [?M] but I still have strong mixed emotions about him. It's stressing me out.,worldexploded,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6w765k/i_26f_have_absolutely_no_interest_in_being_with/,"So I've been out of my first relationship for about 5 years now. I'm currently seeing someone who I love tremendously and practically worships me.


It took me a while to get over the break up. He broke it off. A lot of factors lead to it. I had to leave my university, come home and go to community college. I didn't have a car, a job or a healthy relationship with my family. I clung to him because he was the only one who made me feel like I was worthy. However, It was also an interracial relationship. He still lived at home and his parents probably didn't care too much about the black girl taking all of his time.


He and his mom were VERY close he would tell her everything about our relationship. His family were very wishy washy with their opinions of me. One day they liked me, the next week they didn't. I get I was a little shit who didn't have any real world experience but even now I can't see what I did to offend them so much.


After joining the military, getting my bachelor's, recently upgrading my car in cash, moving to a new city and snagging an internship I still harbor a lot of hurt feelings. He tried to get back together with me twice and of course I said no. So I should be over this by now, right?


Recently my mom mentioned that she found out he's getting married soon. My mom tends to be really petty but I don't understand the point of her telling me that. Maybe she assumed I was secure in my current relationship and just wanted to talk shit with me but it just brought him back into my mind which I didn't want.


The girl he is engaged to is white. I'm sure she's a nice person and I could care less about him getting married but I feel like if she were another person of color it wouldn't bother me so much. Maybe it's confirming that the break up really did happen because of my ethnicity and his family thought I wasn't good enough for him

**tl;dr**: First boyfriend is getting married soon. I really don't care and have made big strides in my life but I still have a lot of hurt feelings about how our relationship ended even though I turned him down twice. I think it's because he broke up with me because of my ethnicity and his family ends up accepting a white girl. How do I get over this time in my life?"
6w7l5v,1,2017-08-26,"Me [23M] and my girlfriend [21F] of 1.5 years are fighting over my potential career, and I feel stuck",Karbairusa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6w7l5v/me_23m_and_my_girlfriend_21f_of_15_years_are/,"I'm wanting to pursue a career in zoology, biology, ecology, or forest ranger type stuff. I love the outside, I love animals and I feel at home in nature. I'm not *sure* exactly what I want, but I'm in the ballpark you know? I have no experience at all, I'm starting fresh. I currently have 1 year left until I reach my Associates of Science.





However, I do know that it's what makes you unique that sets you apart from other candidates. I don't want to show up to an interview with just a BS or BA and have either 2 years of ""bland"" experience, or no experience at all. My point of view is that I should do something unique: like travel to another country for an internship doing anything applicable to my field. I feel that it's smart to have experience, experience that's like ""hey, look at this guy, he's done X!"". Living in Illinois, I don't see myself finding anything really unique here that will give me a good advantage. I live in the middle of nowhere, closest major city would be St Louis, MO. 

I'm under the assumption that unless I find something really lucky, I'll have to be at least a state away, possible even more. My girlfriend is not keen on that-she tells me that she doesn't want me to leave. She says that if I leave, we won't last long distance and we would just break up in the end. She says in the future, she doesn't want to live more than a few hours from her family. Her mother tells her that ""we didn't put you through school for you to just up and leave for him"". My family and I never had a good relationship. My parents were abusive, the whole nine yards. My grandparents are another story, only people I feel really close to and value. Her family is all that and a bag of chips (no, really, they are great folks and I feel at home with them!). I understand how her family feels, but I greatly disagree.



My whole viewpoint is that I'm not going to screw myself over for my girlfriend. I love her, but we aren't married and have only been dating for a year and a half. She isn't willing to be in a position to where I'm getting a job offer states away, much less an internship. She thinks visiting other states is okay, but wants to stay here. She is pursuing a career in IT/coding. I told her that she can get a job anywhere, because honestly she can. People always need IT/computer jobs, my type of job isn't really common, especially for anything over 40k/yr. 

She says that she would rather we break up now than wait until the time to where I have an internship/""real"" job offer. To me, this makes absolutely zero sense. If I was a parent, I would raise my child to let them *fly* away. To spread their wings, do their own thing and prosper as individuals. I understand how my girlfriend feels, but from my viewpoint if she **does** leave and come with me, she isn't really losing much. She will have a place to come home to, no problem finding a job. If I leave, I don't really have a place to come back to. I'll be stuck where I'm going.


I just feel that If I bend over now, I'll end up choosing another job that will make me less happy, just because I don't want to lose my girlfriend. I told her I'll try to find something close, but if I get a good offer, I'm going to have to leave, with or without her. I feel hateful for saying that, but logically I shouldn't turn down a good offer because my girlfriend doesn't want to leave her family. I want to live my own dreams, I don't want to be 40 with two kids, working a job I hate. I'll end up resenting her for shoehorning me into that choice. It will probably end in a divorce, all over something that I don't see as a big deal.


How do I handle this? This is the first relationship I've had where things feel solid, and I don't want to lose it. I also don't want to give up on my passion because my girlfriend is afraid to be apart from her family. I feel that I have to get this experience in the next few years while I can. I have to prepare for my life and make sure that I get a good job so I can provide for myself and my family. If I stay here, I'm potentially limiting myself to making far less. She is a very absent on ""drive"", although I hate to say it. She didn't have a job until she met me, I ended up getting her a job. I've changed her life for the better in so many ways, she is finally taking control and doing things by herself (paying bills, getting her own vehicle, etc) that she wasn't doing before. I'm certain that she is afraid to leave because her parent's have held her hand her whole life. 

Any advice is appreciated, I just feel I'm really, really stuck.

See, I saw an awful movie that all the same had a weird effect on me. The Adam Sandler movie, That's My Boy. It's terrible, don't watch it, but do watch [this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC21keB1yaM)

I just really love the idea of fulfilling a student's dream in that way and making it into something kinda cliched in its hotness, if that makes a lick of sense? 

I'd love someone to talk more deeply about this, and now, onto my usual introduction with all the usual roleplay scenarios listed!

Ahem. I'm Gwen, an Englishwoman, mother and teacher. I'm looking for fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png)

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
6w8l2j,0,2017-08-26,Am I forced to suffer alone for the next 6 months?,Zimpala,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/6w8l2j/am_i_forced_to_suffer_alone_for_the_next_6_months/,"I moved to a small town for work in February after graduating from school in December 2016. It's not tiny, but it's not big either. The closest ""big cities"" are at least 1.5 hours away in every direction. I'm a city girl that is now living in a rural town where everyone is older, hunts, works in manufacturing, rides motorcycles, and are just very blue collar. The downtown scene is trash and the locals just aren't my type. I'm in a rotation program at work, meaning that I will only be in this location for a year, and after that I will spend 10 months in Chicago, which is super comforting and has me excited because I know that I'll thrive there. I have a ton of friends in Chicago already, it's a big city, and I know that I'll have a blast while I'm there. But I have to make it through this first.

I was dating a guy for a while before I graduated and continued into an LDR. He works at my university, which is a few hours away, so we didn't get to see each other much. He was also emotionally abusive, and didn't like when I went out with new people my age here, especially if there were guys involved, so I never took time to meet anyone my own age (everyone my age is also in a rotation program of sorts, and they move around even more frequently than me). It's sad to realize that one of the biggest reasons that I stayed with him was so that I wouldn't have to be alone for a long time. I wouldn't be feeling like this if we broke up in November or December, because I could cope with the remaining time and fight through the lonely feeling.

So here I am, 6 months into this year long rotation. I have no friends around me, I just broke up with my boyfriend, summer is about to end, and work leaves me with no energy to want to do anything but come home and rest. At this point I just have my friends from my university, but we've all graduated and live in completely different places now. I'm an only child and my parents are 1500 miles away. I've done internships and study abroads and I know from experience how much it sucks to put so much time and energy into people you will never see again. Everyone at work is older/has kids/are workaholics, etc. so we have zero in common regarding hobbies and things we enjoy doing.

How should I go about these next 6 months without feeling so lonely? In school I always had friends that I could do something with if I decided that I wanted to see someone. I could also at least talk to my boyfriend. I spent this entire Saturday thinking about how lonely I'm going to get. How lonely I am now. I was supposed to visit my boyfriend at my school for the long weekend, but now I feel like I can never go back because of him.

I will be free from this place February 2018, but it's still so far away and it's going to get cold soon, which will make me even more lonely because I hate the cold. What should I do? It's too late for me to look for and make a ""best friend"" here and even if I do I'm going to move 3 states away and never see them again. I have two cats already, but they're not people. I also have my therapist to talk to, but I only see him biweekly. How should I ride this out? What do people with no friends do in the months leading up to moving?"

6w9oy0,35,2017-08-26,"Mandela Theory: ME's are intentional residue or signs of history alterations. Nelson Mandela was their first Major experiment with it, and Happy @ CERN proves it.",VeganDog,Retconned,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6w9oy0/mandela_theory_mes_are_intentional_residue_or/,"This came to me while driving around work. First, I need to share some links and information, and then I'll bring it all together. 

*The Evidence*

1. Happy @ CERN [[LINK]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6du36a/happy_at_cern_missed_symbolssigns_have_other/) - TL;DR? At first glance looks like a typical silly ""science is fun!"" advertisement, but go to 2:31. There's some key things you need to notice here. Physicist John Ellis during the chorus, at 2:31, has signs hanging from his neck that translate to Nelson Mandela. In the background is a puzzle piece. He covers his face and uncovers it. Later at 3:25 you see 4664 as the score, this is an ME where people remember Nelson Mandela's prison number being this rather than 46664 which it ""actually"" is. Finally, this was made in 2014, when according to google trend data, no matter what you search, nothing comes up relating to the Mandela Effect until almost a year later.

2. CERN's LHC was first turned to maximum 10 April 2015. Based on Google Trend data, Mandela Effect related things start appear a few months later around August/September.

3. I cannot for the life of me find the thread, please link it if you know where it is, but a couple months back someone posted about how many of CERN Scientist names (and other physicists) are related to Mandela Effects. Sally Field is a good example of this. Her brother works at CERN, and she has three ME's about her. We're not talking a handful, we're talking dozens upon dozens. Jeremy Bernstein is another example, who was cited by the ""CERN Whistleblower"" and believed to be referenced in the Berenst(e/a)in bears. 

4. People have been seeing people ""reprogram"" or ""receive updates"" in real time. [[LINK]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6tev9t/i_saw_the_matrix_reprogram_in_real_time/) This happened to me as well immediately after I read this thread. I asked my SO what a frown was. She pulled her lips down from the sides. When I informed her it was a scowl and had nothing to do with smiling, her face was strong shock and disbelief. Then out of nowhere her face went blank and she said, ""I think it's both."" There was no look of thinking or questioning, just shock and then, ""It's both, but we don't use the real definition really."" With absolutely certainty. 

5. People frequently report odd behavior from people when talking about the Mandela effect. There's tons of threads on this, and people here can vouch. People will ignore you or become hostile, they won't even so much as entertain ""Yeah, that's weird."" People in the main sub will vehemently argue the oddest explanations for things, and people's post history will suddenly shift from normal multi-sub posting to obsessive anti-Mandela effect posting, suggesting shills. 

6. Not quite evidence, but more and more people, scientists included, are leaning towards we are living in some sort of simulation. Just... With how perfect everything is. Like how the distance and size of the sun and moon make something so unlikely as a total eclipse happen on a planet with intelligent life. How we've had literally thousands of close calls with Nuclear weapon technology yet something always seems to stop it, no matter how unlikely (All failsafes failed, but the last two wires were crossed wrong, saving a several state wide area. Or (IIRC) a system that said Americans sent a nuclear weapon attack to Russia, and the person in charge just so happened to decide not to immediately retaliate, preventing what would have been definite Nuclear war.)

**The Hypothesis**

So what do I think this means? 

CERN figured we're in a simulation. That means our entire reality can be edited. They figured out a way (LHC? Microblack holes? Quantum/Dwave Computer? All of the above?) to alter history. One of their first experiments, or first major ones, with it was with Nelson Mandela. In our original reality he had died in the 90's, and their goal was to have him die at a later date for some reason. Maybe we don't remember what the original timeline was like with his earlier passing, so we can't think of why? However, if he had never died in the 90's, we'd never know. They'd never know they did an experiment, they're too entangled with it to be aware a changed happened now because it's so definitively in their mind. 

So here's where #1, ""Happy @ CERN"" comes in. Again, this was all done in 2014, before any Mandela Effect related content was discussed esp as that. To tell themselves they changed history, they needed to leave signs somewhere easy for them to find to let them know they were successful. This explains John Ellis' weird behavior in the video. They had to drown the video out with symbolism about Nelson Mandela to try and make sure they had some way of notifying themselves things changed that survived the shift, OR they edited this part of the past as well to give them a more obvious sign something was changed. Of course they'd have a different reasoning for doing it, maybe now it was ""young interns"" who got him to do some wacky stuff ""relating to things they found on the Internet"", but eventually they or someone else, would put 2 and 2 together. 

**Anyway, these are the signs**: The lyrics of the song start out with, ""*It might seem crazy what I am about to say...*"" and here we see the score in the video game start out at 5000. Not much happens between here until we see John Ellis at 2:31. The ""2:31"" is almost like 1-2-3 or 3-2-1, so that stands out, (**EDIT** 2:31 may symbolize a break in flow, like in the flow of time being interrupted and shifted around OR that Nelson Mandela's death was shifted to occur later) and IIRC in numerology these numbers are significant. This happens right at the *bridge* of the song, meaning they went from one area to another, one reality or timeline to another. The puzzle piece lets them know there's something to be solved. The ""Bond#1 (Barry Nelson)"" and ""Mandela"" can translate to ""Bury Nelson Mandela"" meaning he used to be dead, the signs hanging from his neck indicate he was hanged, which many people had called for. The piece of paper going in front of his face was ""Now you see it, now you don't!"" or something of that nature. **During this part, the song repeats, ""Bring me down, can't nothing, bring me down!""**

At 3:20, one of the only times you can read labels clearly on their machines is in here. They contain several stickers which say ""ME 1/1/XX"" XX being different numbers. Right after this is when we see the 4664 score. ""4664"" *was* his prison number and was supposed to alert them of another sign, except it (maybe unintentionally) changed to 46664, although CERNs logo has 666 in it, or many feel so anyway, so that could be their doing as well as many people report remembering it being 4664. Some of these are murky, but there's definitely clear Nelson Mandela references for no explainable reason. 

Anyway, **MOVING ON**. This makes me think... What if the ME's are the residue? ME discussion started up only a few months after they turned the LHC on to full. What if they make history alterations, and they use ME's to signal to them that they changed something? That would be why so many appear to reference scientists, especially CERN ones. They may not remember them (being too entangled in the process?), but... Some of us do. They rely on our self reports to make sure they did something recently and that it was a success. However, they can't let it go too out of hand. They need to make sure we just are in our tiny corner looking nuts. So that's why people, some hired shills, maybe some manipulated somehow (those who are more easily affected by their updates?), will obsessively deny the Mandela effect or go great lengths to not give it any validation or humor it even slightly. 

Idk, I think it explains that weird video at least, but I'd be happy to hear other explanations or additions.

I cried and let out the pent up stress and anxiety I've been feeling about my upcoming internship and the effects it'll have on my life. Laid on the couch for a couple hours. Started thinking about all the stuff I'm excited for and that helped. 

I also talked to my Daddy, and I realized I haven't been communicating well and that's been a major issue too. My collar came in the mail and we got to discuss our dynamic more which was fun and comforting. The collar felt natural to be wearing, which I really loved, just like with the diapers. 

My package of Rearz Spoiled is still buried in the back of my closet, but I put a pull-up on tonight and was filled with that soothing sensation I first had and I'm just way way more positive. 

I've got a couple samples from Wearingclouds that I just ordered and I'm excited to try something new and allow myself the joy from that. Anyone else loathe 2-tapes versus single? The singles feel way more comfy to me, but maybe I haven't explored enough. 

Anyways, thank you all for your affirmations and positive feedback. I'm really really grateful to have come across a community of like-minded people who are so welcoming and supportive :) "
6waikh,5,2017-08-27,[Relationships] My boyfriend (24M) of 4 years keeps pushing for an open relationship....and I (24F) don't think I could handle it.,aspensgrove,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6waikh/relationships_my_boyfriend_24m_of_4_years_keeps/," Hi there, long-time lurker and first-time poster...apologies for formatting, I'm on my phone! :(

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years. We started dating in college, but after graduation I got a job near my hometown (in the US) and he went home to Europe to study and pursue a couple internships.

We've now been ""long-distance"" for two years....which sucks. A lot. For both of us. While in college we had joked around and talked seriously about threesomes. Nothing ever happened, but we were both open to it.  We talked openly about who else at the school we were each attracted to, we discussed who we would want to join us, and we both admitted being attracted to a mutual friend (F). Then, senior year, he went on a school trip with aid friend and the rest of their choir. I had weird vibes from him the whole time they were gone, and he really pulled away in terms of communication. I contacted her because I was a little suspicious, and she admitted that he had been acting strange and she felt uncomfortable. He finally admitted to me that he had been obsessing over her during the trip and that he felt very ""tempted"". That shattered me, and I've honestly been trying to trust him again ever since. I know they did nothing physically (my other friend would have told me), but I feel like he was becoming emotionally attracted to her during the trip.

Fast-forward to a year ago, and we were doing OK with long-distance, although it's hard as hell. I consider it completely worthwhile because I love him so much. He has reassured me that he loves me too, and we talk frequently about the difficulties of what we're doing and how we can improve. But a year ago he brought up the idea of an open relationship...and I admit, I freaked out. Whereas before senior year I was excited to talk to him about who I found attractive and hear who he desired, now it felt like a knife in the gut to hear that he wanted to sleep with other people. We eventually had a pretty levelheaded convo and I told him that I didn't think I could do it.

We've talked about it a few more times since that, and it is making me feel so guilty that I can't just get over myself and say yes to him. But I don't see the point. We live 5,000 miles apart and only get to see each other every other month -- if we sleep with other people, what is there left to set our relationship apart as ""special""? He markets the open relationship as something that would make him happy and fulfill a sexual need for him (which I get, because I need sex too!) and I want to make him happy! But I ALSO want our relationship to be special and maintain intimacy.

He's specifically mentioned that there are a couple of friends in his life that he's ""vey attracted to"", and i worry that if i don't accept any open relationship right now, he'll just go ahead and cheat on me in the future. He has already mentioned that he's worried he will feel ""tempted"" again in the future by one of these people.

I just don't think our relationship is healthy enough to ""open up"" right now. I think that if he needs to sleep with other people that badly, we should just break up. 

What do you think, /r/relationships?

TLDR; my boyfriend wants an open relationship. Neither of us has ever slept with anyone else, and I'm worried that he would fall in love with one of the girls he slept with and leave me because we live 5,000 miles apart...

6waokh,10,2017-08-27,[long] Possible channeling encounter I had in May about the nature of humans and reality.,I_am_Mandelaed,Soulnexus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/6waokh/long_possible_channeling_encounter_i_had_in_may/,"Ok, so this is really long, and the reason so many mundane pop-culture references is because my understanding of this was coming from trying to puzzle out reality via fiction from a very young age. Apparently that was important, pathways to it were ingrained that way, or so it was suggested to me. 

When I was a small kid I would assume that the world of fiction, at least the fiction that was beyond my grasp of ""how did they create all those details"" was the world of another reality that someone just caught a glimpse of and recorded.  I am not sure how I came to this conclusion, because it's definitely not something people would talk to me about, but I do recall when I was 7 or 8 I would try to visualize and pull people out of those books, out of those layers of reality to hang out with me.

When I was 10 I learned about astral travel from...wait for it...a [Mysteries of the Unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4zBYh2PUyk) book.  Because of course I did. So before that point I had no knowledge of any of that.

Ok, a few things before all of this:

I originally sent this to a friend of mine I have known since 1999, a very good friend of mine who is familiar with the media I am referring to, and familiar with most of the events outlined in the first addendum *(note, there are two other addendums to this in the original e-mail, but I've left them out here.  They are a timeline of events related to this, and a series of dreams)*. But of course, like every other human, we put into our consumption of every bit of media through filters caused by our experience. I do not know that consumption of the same media that I did that caused this will not work for anyone else, or possibly even make sense to anyone else because it is filtered through my own experience.

Both of us are atheists (I have been since my little stint in a bizarrely creationist-leaning Catholic school in 1st grade...churches would give me panic attacks after that year).  He is a touch more superstitious than I am, but we both kind of have a bit of a “what does it hurt if it works” kind of mild superstition.  We are both cynical and sarcastic as hell though, both in our late 30s. 

I also use a lot of “says” in this ramble to keep it short.  The communication was not really like that at all, it would be mostly me connecting dots in my brain with flashes of memory, and having affirmative or negative responses. But “says” is easier to communicate than writing a paragraph about each memory and how it affected my understanding of the subject.

This is really long and I have no way to tl;dr it really.  Sorry!  If you don’t read it all, that’s totally OK.  Reading a 5000+ word, barely coherent jumble from some stranger on the internet is a bit much.

**The Message to my friend.**

Lately, certain synchronicities have been happening that make me think about choices I made that altered my day to day life significantly.  Seemingly arbitrary choices that in light of the event that happened on Saturday seem more important than that. Parallel to this I have been studying alternate realities and parallel universes for the graphic novel I have been struggling with since the idea first came to me.

Particularly what happened, is that starting in the beginning of March, every time I am in one area of my closet, this elaborate musical tone that includes an insane amount of notes, the understanding that I couldn’t hear all that was going on, and what sounded like “dee florflorian dee florflorian la middit dee da vennen dee da ta” (but I somehow know it’s spelled DiFlorFlorian). It was something I had heard before and couldn’t place it, and for some reason I would promptly forget it until I was in that area of the closet. It got stronger and involved more senses every time I heard it.

The last time I heard it (and when I say hear, it is mostly in my head), and once I found myself humming along, I remembered where I originally heard it, and it was when I was a very young child (I was maybe 4 at the very oldest), during this bizarre event where I got up really early, just the first light in the sky, and went into this kind of trance in the bathroom.  I heard the “Di FlorFlorian” thing, plus a mourning dove + the organ/flute whatever part of Grand Funk Railroad’s “Closer to Home” ([if you are not familiar, it’s this](https://youtu.be/g8MYsii4DZY?t=5m3s) ).  Simultaneously.

So I was watching Journey to the Center of the Earth, thinking about how nonsensical it is, when the DiFlorFlorian song comes into my head. Along with sensations of smell, taste, a tingling that was neither hot nor cold, but somehow soft and I could feel it inside.  Everything blanked out and became chimerical color-wise.

The conversation was entirely in my head.  If it could even be called a conversation. It was mostly multiple rapid flashes of memories.  One theme that kept happening was flashes of a Diana Wynne Jones book, but not the words, the way I pictured certain scenes that involved talking to “gods” who were only gods because humans claimed they were, whenever it was about talking to the being.. Another was Breath of the Wild whenever the topic was my understanding of perceptual reality, and another was this instance where I got a My Little Pony when I was 6 and was building caves for it out of blankets.

I asked for a name.  It was the DiFlorFlorian song, but richer, which I was given the understanding that the entirety of it was every sound the being had uttered and heard in its lives, but not in a linear order of all at once, more like a fractal of chunks of importance distilled into one note apiece. And it contained my voice as if I were singing as well, (no Closer to Home or mourning dove sounds though)  But it also contained all the visual and physical feelings I had encountered earlier. The flashing chimerical blue/green color that took the span of the song.  The name of this being was the entire physical history of this being, but compressed into a time span that I could comprehend as “name” and a one line biography, even if I could not comprehend all the details. I was also told music is important.

The reason the DiFlorFlorian was repeated is because the being opted for trying again with the same life in a slightly different physical reality. It is in different notes, lightly, than the first one. This is important later.

I asked if I could call the being DiFlorFlorian, and it was OK with this because it “held my understanding” and would change as I understood more.

I asked if the being was male or female, and it responded that neither was exactly appropriate or accurate, but female was closest to my understanding, so female pronouns were OK, given her social role and structure. 

I asked if there was any reason I was singled out, if I was special in some way, and she said no, not beyond the way all life is special, I was just assigned to her because we share some of her previous particles and it was my time.  It is apparently hard for them to speak to humans, as they have to remember what time and 3 dimensions are like, and hard for us to speak to them because we need to have an understanding of reality  that allows us to be able to actually understand them. There is a kind of junction between three planes that are not planes because they are not 2D objects crossing each other but rather 3D objects our perceptual reality, our physical reality and our universe. And apparently something clicks in our collection of consciousness particles that are only kind of us, eventually, that makes it easier.   And they are assigned others who share some of their consciousness because it makes it a tad bit easier as well. 

Beyond here the “conversation” was mostly more me asking questions, flashes of memories or other references that I understand appearing in my head, me asking another question and receiving an affirmative response indicating “your understanding is close to how it is”, a negative response, or the kind of baffling “not as you understand it” and “to the best of your understanding”, so exact words, phrases, etc, will be pretty limited to my understanding of those terms and phrases, even if I am kind of wrong.

I asked her what her job was, and I received a series of memory flashes.  My Kindergarten Aide, asking me if I know how to read.  My Grandmother showing me how to sew. Mister Rogers teaching me kindness through the tv. My mom before she was an asshole, playing weasels and birds in the front yard with me.  My babysitter Heather, showing me how to roller skate, and my conceptual idea of steward, along with some fictional characters, and my ideas of benevolent mentors, and My Little Pony. There was also a perception of atonement, or regret, but not towards me, but like she fucked up along the line and was in the position she was in to kind of keep others from fucking up. Almost like a benevolent extradimensional scared straight program?

Are you some kind of teacher of the young? Affirmative response. Then I get the explanation about the sharing of particles of consciousness and the stage I am at, which is recognizing that the perceptual realities can all exist within the same physical reality. And multiple physical realities can reside in one universe.  And you can move through them, but it is painful (exponentially so the larger you go) while in what she termed “hydrocarbon stage” but I have been referring to as meat bodies. Perceptual realities you move through easily, and are the cause of people actually changing and actually most human misunderstandings.  You straddle them constantly, swim through them freely. Physical reality is a little harder to move through. I understand this because I had dreams about it on Feb 24th (see second addendum at the end) and was compelled to draw pictures of it about a week later:http://imgur.com/I1YSEhg, which coincided with first hearing the DiFlorFlorian song in my closet. My understanding gained here, while not perfectly accurate, was close enough to allow the conversation to take place and this stage to happen. My brain flashes a book I recently read twice in a row. I have been re-reading a lot of books I read when I was younger with an entirely new perception lately, this is where my understanding of the nature of perceptual reality is coming from. Your reality changes second by second. Physical reality is tied to evolution somehow, as far as I could understand it.

I asked if I am the first one at this stage, and my mind was filled with beings from all throughout history, including parts of myself so of course not.

I ask if it is the first stage of something.  It is made clear that it is not linear, at all, and that DiFlorFlorian is just the steward of this aspect, the beginnings of understanding that one facet of reality.  If it had been some other stage, like knowing how to manipulate that reality without being fully aware of it she would not be who I was talking to necessarily, if really anyone.. She can not tell me what those stages are because she can not tell me things I do not understand, beyond one that she says that I understand to a degree but can’t define, that I think might have to do with religion that happened later in the conversation.

I ask if perceptual reality skews amongst individuals is what causes the “Mandela Effect”, and she kind of almost laughed. Of course it is, but not the way people are trying to make it out to be, since physical and perceptual are vastly different.

I asked why did she talk to me or others who reached this phase, and the answer was kind of a surprising “because after this you chose what to do with your consciousness”, which I must admit was never a thing that occurred to me.  Apparently after you die you have a multitude of choices,  You can go back and try again in basically what amounts to a parallel timeline you just came from, you can split your consciousness and merge it with other newly “sparked” humans in utero, you can reincarnate with the same particles of consciousness and try again that way in your own physical reality, you can completely dissolve it and let it disperse (you do always leave a little behind when you die though).  You can even just abandon the corporeal form and become a being like her (which she did not recommend, because as a being with not a super full consciousness, you’re basically a low-level intern with no way to get out of it, once you’re done with a physical phase, you’re kind of done, so make the most of it.  Before you realize the nature of reality, they just make that decision for you.)

I ask how many people had come before me?  Millions.  She was one of them at one time, and I had flashes of her life, slower this time, but still too fast to grasp any details beyond the longer phase where she redid the same thing twice, with slightly different outcomes. 

I asked if they were all from Earth. Of course not. And they did not necessarily look like us, but were mostly hydrocarbon based.  We looked the way we did because that is what Earth would grow. (They do not interfere with the physical process, much like they stop interfering at the point that I am at with my consciousness. Life starts out, and it makes choices as it is gathering consciousness and matter, becoming more and more complicated, until it becomes self-aware.  And then aware of how time passes.  And then aware that it can plan for the future, and it just kind of snowballs.

What is the point of Earth?  The answer I got was incubator, but not an incubator.  An incubator for hydrocarbon phase, which would give rise to the next phase, but more shaped like a bell curve or a muscle than like an incubator in our lives. Everything is bell curves.


What is the end goal of life? One universal consciousness before the universe expires, because it will cause the universe to not expire.

Were you human? Sometimes.  Are you an angel, or what I would understand as an angel? No, we are you, just with more understanding and past phases.

Does God exist? “Not as you understand it” but then a flash of a few friends of mine confirmed that at least some of them understand it and they are actually at some of these indeterminable stages as well, more than me, or even less than me.  Flashes of fake pious people were in there as well too (along with as admonishment of my mom’s voice telling me not to be petty one time from when I was 11 or 12 and complaining about my aunt, which was kind of funny). I asked if I could ever make it to this stage, and the answer was “not with your current understanding.”, but If I could have reached that stage before the one I am at I might be religious. Every time she says this I flash back to the Diana Wynne Jones book.

I ask her why I keep seeing/being referenced to that Diana Wynne Jones book.  Because it was the end spark that caused the understanding that made it possible for us to communicate, and my understanding of how people make gods out of larger amalgam beings with more understanding.

I asked her why I keep seeing this one part of Breath of the Wild.  Because it was what sparked my understanding of how perceptual reality can exist within the same physical reality. 

I asked her why I kept seeing My Little Pony, because that exact mindset, if I could get there, was what was best for communicating. 

I asked if these things would be gateways for other people to talk to her, and she said no, not unless they came to the same understanding using their own experiences in the same ways, which was unlikely.

I asked if all religions were, in a sense, correct, and the response was yes, to the understanding of the adherents, in a way. It will get them further in the chain, and build their consciousness if used properly.

At this point I kind of started losing the train of the conversation, but this was the general gist of the nature of the universe and life:

Consciousness was born the same time as matter. It was not created by any beings (that they know of, but given the fractal nature of everything, it is possible), it just is, it’s just an inherent part of a universe.  Matter has to stabilize so that hydrocarbons can form that consciousness can adhere to, growing and growing. Life evolves on planets, as it is best suited, and nobody interferes with that cycle because it is best for consciousness to kind of coalesce its own physical reality.  Even if that means there is delays because species with potential die out, etc. It is all part of the process of making sure that the consciousness develops the necessary problem solving skills. Beings like DiFlorFlorian are not even the end result, they are smaller pockets than planet-size ones (who are also not the end result), and are considered what we would understand to be second class citizens, teenagers, etc.  Basically babysitters just kind of helping us along once we are complete enough to make the actual choice of what to do with our particles of consciousness. (Like Thetans, was something I asked, and I got a laugh and a “partially as you personally understand them, but not exactly”. It seems Scientologists hit on a half-truth that they didn’t fully understand and neither do I, but it’s not ancient beings in a volcano, it’s just particles of consciousness from much much different perceptual realities than some people, and they can be merged into beings with care).  We are basically quantum beings that kind of straddle multiple universes, and by we, I mean all of consciousness in this universe is part of a fragmented whole that is simultaneously reproducing itself and growing, and being put back together fractally, So there are large chunks that were put together first, then smaller chunks, and those smaller chunks are in charge of putting together (well, more correctly monitoring those chunks putting themselves together)  even smaller chunks until eventually everything just comes together as one.  When beings die, the consciousness is usually dispersed, but it is sometimes retained, especially in the case of humans, although some animals (which is kind of how humans came to be) will also cycle wholesale if it is deemed necessary.  This, and occasionally negating dangerous reality warpers by dispersing their consciousness (but sometimes it falls on all of us and makes us worse, in addition to the consciousness that already was added by being influenced by them, this part wa really complicated and was basically an animation with a series of arrows I can’t replicate),  is the only thing they do before you recognize at least this one facet of how it works.

As for reality/perceptual reality.  One of the ways to increase your own consciousnesses is through perceptual reality.  People you are drawn to, soulmates, etc, overlap with your perceptual reality the most, and it helps expand both of your consciousness particles.  Growing that is actually important to growing the consciousness, because, much like matter loves other matter, consciousness loves other consciousness. It is apparently very important to positively influence those around you, because you all grow from the enrichment.  It actually should be the dominant reason why anyone does anything. She told me it eventually is the dominant reason after more people reach other stages.  The issue with how I perceive other humans right now is that many of them are at the “warping reality, but not understanding how they do it or why” stage (I highlighted it up there in blue again), and the religious stage, which are not steps below where I am, but rather just arbitrary parallel stages.  Everyone is trying to force their reality and understanding on everyone else, and that is causing most of the troubles of the world, because you end up with particles from other realities that are much further away on the scale than yours and are more painful to try to drag yourself to reach (as per the weird 2/25 dream).  I ask her why they don’t stop it, and the response was a rather perplexing invitation to examine my perception of Santa Claus. And that these things are hard to understand in the lifetime of a hydrocarbon stage, but as a whole they will make sense one day.  And that all of this is happening across multiple physical realities and universes because we are ultimately quantum beings (or rather the particles are), it’s just that my focus seems to be this universe (“you” can exist in multiple universes as long as the same cloud of particles is adhered together to a certain degree in that universe.  It is apparently kind of rare to be completely, but there is often some overlap.  The particles that create you, however, are always present in all multiple universes), this physical reality (this is more common, but it’s more common to just have a lot of overlap, you can opt to mingle there afterwards, once those particles are free if you would like, and the further you get on the grid of infinite physical realities, the less likely it is.  So much for Nazi versions of Excalibur (this is a reference to a 1989 X-Men spin-off story line called the Cross-Time Caper where the characters exist vastly different in other realities), and this kind of shifting path of perpetual realities, all within the constraints of time that I have to live with for now because I am made of meat. You can not cross universes, sadly. Because there is already another physical being there shepherding the same consciousness particles you have to the same end goal.

We are mere children.  Just beyond toddlers even.  We know our numbers to 10, we know our ABC’s and we know that square pegs don’t fit into round holes, but that’s about it. We get through the Hydrocarbon stage where we are all selfish and time-conscious and self-important (apparently to exist in hydrocarbon is to basically be an aggressive asshole because you know you will lose, but you don’t actually know what you are losing).  Eventually we collectively scrabble together enough larger pockets of consciousness that understands that a lot of things humans think matter actually don’t to reach the silica stage where we are creating our own bodies and optimizing ourselves to outlive the hydrocarbons (and at that stage some people will stagnate, because they will want to be physical forever), and eventually just an amalgamation of particles, not needing 3 dimensions at all.  It’s what you do with your physical time, though, that dictates how much consciousness you cross over with when you choose to.  You can collect this for as long as you would like, if you are even you at that point and you haven’t decided to seed all the beings elsewhere, or split yourself.  Apparently you eventually know what the right choice is and what is best for the universe after doing it a few times. You are allowed to fuck up, and even expected to.


Ultimately, what the desired outcome for the planet, and planets in general to become one entity.  We are NOWHERE near there. What happens there is a kind of planet-wide hivemind, which might not be possible in hydrocarbon form?  I am not sure and there was no confirmation either way. Maybe that means it’s not possible if we collectively deem it not possible because that is our reality.

I finally asked if it was OK to tell other people, and she said yes, but do not expect them to understand you coming from your perceptual reality, based on your own (baby) understanding (flashes to about a billion examples of kid logic I have employed over the years), using words they may have different understandings for in their own perceptual reality.  And to always be cognizant that trying to force people into your own perceptual reality is very painful for them, and does not help grow the consciousness, or share it.  That the graphic novel I have been working on, much like that Diana Wynne Jones book I read, that causes people to reach their own understanding was far preferable than a lecture.  Unless people are understanding of the perceptual realities, they have to swim over to them themselves. 

I asked if the graphic novel would have a big impact when I was done, and she said not really, but it will impact a handful, and moving anyone to a next stage was a benefit to humanity.

So I asked if it was important to impact those around you, and yes it is. So I was like “I have to go and pay attention to my friends, because I have been neglecting them stuck inside my own head for months” and she responded that yes, and that that balance of self-reflection and interaction was desperately important if I wanted to stay together long enough to see the changes I actually want to see on this planet. With a rueful almost apology of “oh yeah, I forgot, your perception of time.  You will eventually be able to call me at will if you can hold my name and the sensations that go along with it in your head at once”.  And then a flash of the My Little Pony incident again.

While this was going on: I watched most of Journey to the Center of the Earth.  I got in the car, and Boyfriend and I  put on a Smiths album, and I tried to pay attention to it, but all this shit was happening and I was trying to scrawl things down (we were absolutely operating in entirely different realities there for a minute), we got to the restaurant, I greeted my friends and actually ate a half a plate of food before I had to say goodbye to DiFlorFlorian. 

I have caught glimpses and moments between then and now, a weird nearly out of body experiences, but nothing like I did that one night.  I am almost too afraid.

Edit: forgot to finish a sentence in the intro.  Sheesh.

6wbq2e,448,2017-08-27,Conservative minority woman in tech: how will this Goolag-esque cultural bullshit affect me at work?,Direndra,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6wbq2e/conservative_minority_woman_in_tech_how_will_this/,"Throwaway: 

First, just wanted to say thanks: this sub + my BF got me back into gaming (Civ, Skyrim, &amp; FF XIII lined up),

and then also ask:

I'm a brown WIT and I'm finishing my CS degree soon, but I'm also right libertarian and outspoken and support equity of opportunity.

My whole life I was bullied but only by groups of girls who claim to stand against bullying and I already do not like the pushiness about WIT meetings. I just don't care and don't want to go. I like to code by myself at home but when I decline they think I am scared to go. The way girls bully other girls (at least for me) was like Mean Girls, so you can imagine trying to deal with mean girls bullshit at work while working in a live server so I am trying to see if I can prevent any of that.

**Do you think continual refusal to go to WIT meetings would negatively affect me at work when I am their magical unicorn?**

Eventually I want to have kids and these people have made it so annoying to be a WIT because they make WIT in general look like such banshees that now I am concerned when I need actual feminist things it could cause problems.

**Do you think my future team will think badly of me when I announce (eventually) I need maternity leave? Will they think I am trying to be a free loader?** To be clear I would trade evenly if I needed to trade call months or anything. My BF's career has flexible hours and he is fine doing the majority of taking-PTO-childcare so it's not like I am going to constantly call out to stay home with kids either. 

Nursing takes small breaks throughout the day so I hate that I have to worry about looking like an SJW if I have to tell a manager about that. 

EDIT: I mean pumping not taking my baby to work!! You have to get the milk out during the day for the baby for later because my body was built to stay home with a kid so milk is gonna be there when a baby would normally be hungry. I could stay later so it's not like I would be working less but it is annoying to have to take breaks. I've seen that orgs have things about how to accommodate that but it's still a woman-only-inconvenience that I could see SJWs milking so it makes me concerned it would come off that way. 

***Do you think they will be MORE, the same, or less harsh to me about saying ""offensive things"" if I am a minority woman?*** I have to ask since they seem to pick who to bother arbitrarily.

I kind of put all my eggs into the school/coding basket so these might be simple questions I don't know because I've never had a ""real job"" before. 

**Do you think anyone in the IT department or elsewhere would assume I'm an SJW if I am a minority woman in tech but otherwise seem normal enough?**

-------

My BF and I want to buy a house a few years after I get a job and then have a baby a little after that so I really don't want to risk losing a job over accidentally saying something offensive. I have had trans friends and would not misgender someone at least lol. I'll also be a jr. admin and I'm paranoid of fucking something up in prod so that also makes me more nervous of not getting sacked. 

It's VERY annoying to me these girls think they are helping me not experience microaggressions but really their bullying is just making me scared I'll get fired and have trouble making mortgage payments and buying diapers. They seriously just need to go away and stop bullying.  

**I don't give a shit about ""microaggressions."" I just want to have a house, husband,  baby, programming career, and home server.** 

----- 

Also I do want to say that the only prejudice I experienced in tech was a manager introducing me to his manager, after saying the first names of the other interns, said my first name AND ethnic last name.

So basically the only prejudice I experienced was a manager trying to brown nose that he hired a minority woman even though I was the most qualified out of the interns on paper so did not need such treatment. 

Sorry but, IT middle managers are the enablers of HR....... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
6wbsg3,2,2017-08-27,25 F with a strange mentor-mentee relationship scenario with 34 M,compositionscale,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6wbsg3/25_f_with_a_strange_mentormentee_relationship/,"Hey reddit,

I am currently in this very strange kind of ""mentor-mentee"" relationship with a 34 M, where our roles flip around a lot such that I cannot identify who exactly is the mentor and mentee.
We met because we worked on the same team at work about 3 months back.

At that time, he was the senior of the team, and I was a doing my internship on the team. At the end of my month working there, the senior came up to me and asked me to help edit his essay he was working on for program applications. I was surprised to hear him ask me, a lowly intern for help. I assumed the reason he asked me was because we are both from the same ethnic minority background so he felt ""connected"" somehow. He is an immigrant with English as 2nd language. I empathized with his scenario as an immigrant because I had grown up with immigrant parents, so I worked with him to edit his essay. I spent almost 12 hours discussing with him and helping him edit it. I was the ""mentor"" in the relationship here.

Another reason I felt like I had to help him at that time was because the next location I was going to work at, this guy had a close relationship with the boss there. I was planning on asking the boss at the new location for letter of recommendation for my own applications to programs. He gave me a lot of advice on how to impress this new boss so I can get a strong letter. He kind of coached me for several hours (around 3-5 hours), checked in with me during the whole time I worked there, and even tried to mentioned my name to the boss that I was good. He was ""mentor"" during this stage.

Now he has reached the stage with program interviews. He asked me to review/edit his answers to his interview questions. Furthermore, he even asked me to edit his thank you emails to his interviewers...

I'm really kind of overwhelmed with the amount of help he is seeking from me now. Almost every step, he is asking for me help, I think this is because he is insecure about his language abilities. But it's also very taxing on me too. I feel like he is kinda of taking me for granted. Since I helped him a lot previously, he kind of ""expects"" me to help him, sometimes with a time crunch of a few hours. He randomly emailed me something at night yesterday close to midnight and expected me to edit it the night of and return it to him before next morning. Yesterday, I got insomnia because I was helping him edit late into the night. He does not know about this, but I'm hoping he will feel kind of guilty about it if I mentioned to him.

I don't have the heart to reject him because he had helped me before too, and I had looked up to him as a mentor before too. I don't know how to the draw the line in this situation. I want to help him with stuff but I don't want him to be overly dependent on me, which I definitely feel is starting to go on. I don't want to hurt his feeling either because he trusts me a lot. But I want to make it clear it's not easy for me to help him and its taxing on me too. I don't know how to phrase it. Also, I would like to avoid any late night editing to avoid any insomnia again. How do I send this message?

*""Hey, in the future, can you send me messages earlier in the day, i had some severe insomnia yesterday night after simulating my brain too much through editing at midnight. "" Would this be too passive -aggressive? What should I say? How do I deal with this scenario?!*

I apologize for any grammar mistakes on here, I'm extremely groggy from the insomnia right now.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: In a mentor-mentee relationship with a person where the role of mentor flips around depending on who is asking for help at the moment. Currently I am the playing the role of mentor, and he is too overly dependent on me and taking me for granted, which I dislike. Yesterday he asked me to edit his writing late at night, and I developed severe insomnia from thinking late at night. I don't want this to continue, but how do I relay this message to him with hurting his feelings or seeming like I'm a jerk? "

Hi, in a couple of months (9) I will be moving to KC to complete my internship. I currently live in Buffalo, NY. I am looking for housing in Westport, Midtown, and any other area where the hipster stay (please recommend some areas). I have a car so I am not necessarily looking for a place that is near the hospital I will be interning at. I have heard mix reviews about KC, for example I had someone tell me that after 10pm the city gets quiet. I’ve also heard that KC is not a walkable place or bike friendly. I do plan on visiting KC in December and seeing it for myself, but I was just wondering if any of those statements were true. I’m also what most consider a “hipster,” I don’t really like to title but for the sake of this post I’ll embrace it. I was wondering if Midtown and Westport were the only hipster friendly parts of KC. Lastly, how is the dating scene in KC?

The options I came up with are: 

1. Get a very low entry level job related to neuroscience/genetics  and work up from there

2. Get a job in my field while working on projects/self-study of the subject to place on my resume

3. Go back to school for a second bachelors while working for parents

Of course if these options seem like a bad idea, then please guide me towards a better solution. Thanks!

6wddg5,124,2017-08-27,[MF] How I seduced my MILF neighbor,baz952,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6wddg5/mf_how_i_seduced_my_milf_neighbor/,"We moved to my current neighborhood when I was 14. Around two years after we moved in after I turned 16 my neighbors (I'll call them the browns) moved in across the street from us. I didn't think much of it or cared until Mrs. Brown  came up to me one day while I was cutting the grass. She instantly caught my attention, perfect blonde hair in a pony tail, tight Nike yoga pants, and a tight Nike tank top showing the perfect amount of cleavage. She introduced herself and from that day I had a crush on Mr. Brown. 

Over the years our families had dinners and fires together, i would mow there lawn in the summers, i helped coach there kids pe-wee football team so our families where very close. I left for college when I was 18 and came back home full time now (22, Mrs. Brown 45) my last semester of my senior year to do a internship in the area. It was lonely back home since all my friends are gone at school and my parents travel a lot for there company. So one day when I came home from my internship Mrs. Brown was also outside we chatted for a few minutes about my internship and she asked my plans and I said nothing tonight I'm home alone, and for some reason I said feel free to stop by! Since she was also home alone. 

And sure enough around 7:30 the doorbell rings and Mrs. Brown is at my door. We sat in the family room and chatted and she left around 10. The next day she friended me on Facebook and started messaging me about random life stuff. For the next few weeks she'd come over nights my family and her husband was out of town and we'd just chat about whatever. I didn't really think anything of it at first besides some nice company to pass the time and obviously something nice to look at. During one of these times I convinced her to get Snapchat and this is when things started to change.

One night I sent a snap of myself in bed (no shirt on) saying something dumb to a bunch of people. I didn't even realize I sent it to Mrs. Brown, until I got a snap back of her also in bed with the covers all the way up to her face saying "" ooooh la la"" followed by a bunch of heart emojis. I sat there super nervous and I didn't know what to say. Somehow I felt comfortable enough with our friendship that I sent one back me again no shirt saying you like what you see? And I got a snap back of the emoji with the winky face and tongue sticking out. I sent one back again a little ballsie saying not fair for me ;). And I got one back of her now with the covers pulled down exposing her chest about halfway. 

The next day our conversation via messenger was much more  flirtatious. We both were asking questions about our sexlives and it made me extremely turned on all day. The next night she came over and things got interesting. We where talking like normal when I put my hand on her leg. She out her hand on top my mine and I looked at her and kissed her. She was taken back at first but then went right in. We ended up fucking on my couch and I came on her chest. 

That night and the next day we didn't message or Snapchat at all. I was kind of nervous that I ruined our friendship or worse that I would cause a divorce. That night I got a message from her just saying come over. I thought I was a dead man, I walked across the street she opened the door and we went to her family room. She sat next to me, looked at me and then took off her top and we went at it. I felt weird fucking her in her family room with pictures of her and her husband and kids all around. 

After I confronted her and brought this up. She told me that her husband and her are swingers which put me at a little bit of ezee. However she said that she told her husband she met a young stud her new boy toy and her husband approved. However she said that it probably is best he doesn't find out it's me. 

From that day forward we sneak around and fuck. We have done it in pretty much every room in her house. There bedroom, family room, basement, kitchen, shower, garage. We have even done it in her car and mine. She send me pictures and videos of herself swinging with other guys that I think is super hot.

She has a fantasy of getting DP'd and we are currently trying to plan that. "

Like no matter what I do it just seems to get harder and harder. I sit in bed for an hour watching YouTube videos before I get out. 

Going to the gym use to be easy but now it is impossible to go and when I do go I just can't put my all into it. 

Even making meals and cleaning up has become an impossible chore. 

When I get yelled at i don't fight back but rather retreat into a safe space because I just lost the will to fight back. 

My depression is all external. I recently graduated and cannot get a job to save my life. I did what I was told were all the right things: went to school for a STEM field, got involved on engineering projects, earned a decent gpa, got a leadership position on an engineering club, and even held a summer internship. 

I remember my parents telling me to not join a frat because they will amount to nothing. When in reality the frat guys not only have a ton of fun getting wasted at parties and having sex with tons of girls in their prime, they also walk into some of the best jobs out there because they have connections. 

I'm 27 now as I took extra time to switch into what I thought was a difficult but lucrative field because ""we need more engineers."" It was all a lie. 

It's too late for me to try another field only to land back in my parents basement because it too is flooded. I don't want to start my career at 30 only to find everyone else has settled down and married. I don't want to be that beta who man's up and marries a slut. I don't want to be alone either. 

I want to be happy and hopeful but it is hard given the circumstance. Most of my friends moved on. 

How do I become happy? How do I get through this hell? How do I get my energy and will power back? How do I gain hope when everything turns out to be a disappointing lie?

Edit: I tried talking to my parents about it and they tell me to just snap out of it and be thankful for what I have. I can't just snap out of it and pretend everything is chipper when I am so behind everyone else. "

Dietrich Müller. - Vanguard.

**Age:**

31.

**Physical appearance:**

Dietrich stands at an average 6’1”, with an average facial structure. He is the face in the background in the metro, the stranger. He is of average looks, not attractive nor ugly. Due to rigorous and sturdy exercise regimens, he is covered with lean muscle, but is not very physically imposing due to his lanky stature. Sandy blonde hair, which is already starting to thin out and even grayen a bit due to genes on his father’s side. Eyes are greyish, with a blue undertone only noticeable at close range.
 
Currently trying to grow a mustache, but is failing.
 
Work clothes: Grey dress pants, white/beige shirt with black tie. Leather briefcase, brown leather shoes.
Casual clothes: Denim trousers, shirt in white/beige/blue. Same shoes as work clothes.
Costume: 
Essentially [this](http://www.goclecd.fr/wp-content/uploads/rendition1.img-1-768x811.png), except visor is completely opaque. Has a go-pro camera attached to his helmet so that he may analyse his skirmishes to better himself in the future. The vest is a stab-vest, CSPBA. 
 
**Mentality:**

Dietrich is a very structured person. He wakes up at 6 AM, eats breakfast. It includes 2 sandwiches (tuna, lettuce, no cheese), one cup of earl grey (1.5 tablespoons of milk). He does this whilst reading the news on his chosen newspaper, everyday. He then exercises for 45 minutes, which includes a jog and weight training. He then showers, cold. He walks to the metro station and takes the tube to the local hospital, where he works as a general practitioner. Between 8.30 AM and 6.30 PM
 
On tuesdays, thursdays and saturdays he goes to the gym between 7 PM and 10.30 PM.
 
Dietrich heavily leans on habits and a rigid schedule in order to be effective. He is highly competitive, and when he did not own his own practice his greatest joy was getting a bigger bonus than the other son of a bitch sitting next to him.
He is capable of designing and performing a plan efficiently and fast. He will not lose motivation or lose interest until his project is done, whatever it is. This is his greatest strength. This is his greatest weakness. A sufficiently keen observer may notice and use this to his advantage - Dietrich is highly predictable in his manners, doctrines and lifestyle.
Dietrich is a person that always feels like his time is wasted if he’s not working on something productive. If that is a laying out a puzzle or going through paperwork, it does not matter, but he must always work. 
 
He has the vague ambition to attract a mate.

**Backstory:**

Dietrich was born to a German immigrant family, and due to his above average intelligence he breezed through elementary- and high school. When he finally reached college, it was quite the shock to him that he actually had to *work* and *focus* in order to gain good grades.
He flunked out of college after half a year, deciding it wasn’t really his thing. Instead, on a whim, he joined the army. After boot camp, he applied for a position as a field surgeon and underwent the appropriate training. Because he was liked by the recruiter and showed natural talent for the occupation, he was allowed to bypass the minimum 1 year of medical internship.
 He was stationed with a brigade (or whatever is correct in this sense) in the Middle East, which was tasked with protecting the flow of oil in spite of the quarantine. His primary duties was assisting the head Surgeon with maintaining the health of the brigade, etc. He went on four tours, between those he studied on colleges in order to get a legal doctors license. 
During his last tour, when they were moving their HQ into a newly occupied compound, their convoy was ambushed. After an IED detonated the first vehicle in the convoy, a sand manipulating cape started tearing the doors of the vehicles open and ripped the men out of their vehicles. Tearing them limb from limb with his powers, all the while screaming in his native tongue (probably about how his god is great or something like that). Dietrich triggers seeing this immense brutality and uses his power and his opponents momentary distraction (due to him triggering), to put a bullet in his head. However, he was still injured himself rather gravely, and was honorably discharged due to him being psychologically unfit for service after the event. 
 
The army, as they promised to do when he first applied, hooked him up with work at a hospital, namely Ashton’s own [GENERIC_HOSPITAL_NAME]. 
 
As to cope with depression and the loss of meaning his life suddenly had, as he is unfit for service, he has set up a rigorous schedule for himself so that he may never be unoccupied, always be productive, as to simulate the one he had during his service and add some kind of meaning to his life.
 
**Resources:**

A medium flat in a relatively nice area, downtown.
 
A yearly income of $150,000, after tax. He has twice the amount of that in the bank stored, collecting interest. 
 
A slightly run-down cottage in the Ashen woods. He spends his holidays there, mostly working on the cottage itself, reading or canoeing when he is there. Inherited from his father.
 
He does not own a motor vehicle but would not have any trouble attaining one if he would need to, as he has a license.
 
Contacts in the military, which grants him limited influence within associated spheres. Ability to prescribe medicine if needed, although he needs to be conservative with abusing this privilege in order to not get his license revoked.
 
**Alignment:**

Dietrich understands that order and a strict following of the law is needed for a society to flourish - it’s a part of his personality, to be honest. He is a vigilante hero, but is considering joining the PRT after he has conversed with both capes inside and outside of it, in order to get a real perspective on it. He is knew to the scene and understands that his knowledge is very limited.
 
Shortly: understands the purpose of the law, also understands its limitations and that is sometimes need to be broken in order to be uphold.
 
**Equipment/Weaponry:**

1x straight baton.

1x taser, 1 spare charge.

1x runners backpack, light weight.

1x combat knife, useful from everything from cutting through rope to stabbing hoodlums.

1x burner phone.

1x smaller medical kit, including but not limited to: bandages, morphine and sterilizing alcohol.

3x flares, affixed to pants.

1x 500 ml water bottle.

1x flashlight.

1x lighter.

1x permanent marker.

1x notepad with pen.

1x Lehigh 3/8-in x 50-ft White Twisted Nylon Rope. Rope is handy. 

10x plastic cuffs.

1x gas mask strapped to leg, 3 filters. (about 90 minutes of breathing time in non-corrosive vapours).

1x Remington Model 870 pump-action shotgun, loaded with beanbag shells or 12-gauge, depends on context. Slung around shoulder.

1x Smith &amp; Wesson, model 29, for that Dirty Harry feel. Chambers .44 Magnum cartridges, for emergencies only. 
Strapped to back, concealed by backpack. 

12x .44 Magnum cartridges, six loaded in the model 29.

6x 12-gauge shotgun shells

6x bean-bag shotgun shells

2x L83A1 smoke grenades, strapped to belt.

2x M84 stun grenades, strapped to belt.

2x XM58 grenade (tear gas) strapped to belt.
 
 
**Specializations:**

He works as a doctor, and while he does not currently work as a field surgeon, he once did. He might be rusty and not quite as efficient as he was earlier in life, but he is capable of administering emergency medical care many times better than a civilian would be, especially if he actually has access to medical supplies.
 
Dietrich always has a topic he is currently very interested in. It is currently geology, and he is proficient with scratch kits and other methods of identifying different types of rocks.
 
He is quite adept at laying puzzles, and always has one in the progress of being completed at home. 
Speaks German (Family is German), English and can converse in French in a casual setting, but is improving as he is taking courses at Ashton university.
 
In the real world, he might only be a man. In the world of Microsoft Excel he is a warlock capable of complex, eldritch mathematical transmutations. Mere mortals gaze in awe at his arcane knowledge. 
**Power:**

Shortly said, his power is force fields. He has a range of 20 meters where inside that range he can manifest and move his fields, and he can keep up 5 at the very most. He can shape them into geometric shapes, or just create a ‘wall’. It glows vaguely blue, and seems to have the qualities of glass. The shield shatters if someone breaks through it, and it grows cracks before doing so, a good indicator on how damaged every force field is.
 
The force fields can take punches, kicks, etc. from baseline humans, and the same from a low-tier brute. If that brute uses a sledgehammer or axe, he could break through but it largely depends on the brute. A baseline human with a sledgehammer can probably with enough dedication and strength break through, but will take time. The force fields will take 9mm and not shatter, but under heavy volleys, like 3 1911s being unloaded at the same time in a coordinated attempt or a sub-machine gun unloading its whole magazine, it will shatter. Each shield can take exactly 1 5.56x45 (NATO, American rifle standard) round until it shatters.
 
The force fields does not let through liquids or solids, but gasses, like air, is let through. The shield does not stop heat. ‘Gasses’ with big particles is let through, but not the particles themselves, things like smoke is not allowed through. Light is let through, which means that lasers just bypass the fields. The force fields lead electricity very well, and lightning bolts don’t break through, but have to be grounded into something and/or evaded by standing far away, in order not to get melted.
 
In example, a flame thrower will prove relatively effective against his fields, but can the effects can be avoided entirely if appropriate measures are taken. A flame thrower spews flammable liquid on fire, the liquid will not break through, and will just continue to burn, sticking to the fields as though it was a normal wall. However, the heat is still transmitted between both sides of the fields - this means that if an appropriate distance  between force field and person is  not exercised, you will still get burns of varying intensity depending on the distance - this may result in death.
 
The damage upon a field is cumulative, meaning that damage does not have to exceed a certain threshold in order to affect the shield. Eventually the shield will break, even if you’re just slamming a baton into it.
 
Dietrich can move these fields upto 20 km per hours in any direction, and may selectively turn ‘off’ them for himself and whatever he’s carrying, allowing him walk and hit through them. The time it takes to manifest a field varies on the size, a disk the diameter of a plate takes an instant, a wall 4 meters wide and 3 meters tall takes a few seconds, but once up they are up they can be maintained until they are either dismissed or shattered. If they are shattered a cooldown of 15 seconds will commence, until then the maximum number of shields maintained is reduced by one.
 
**Versatility:**

Dietrich is not the most creative person on Earth Kaf, but he is very thorough. He spend much of his free time contemplating and experimenting, well aware that his power is not very offensive related and relatively weak compared to other local capes. Thus, he must compensate by thinking of new and effective uses of his power. 
 
He has realized that he has a very crude TK ability, by enveloping an object in a force-field he can move it. This takes concentrated effort, but can be useful in some, limited cases. 
 
He has also come up various ways to improve his mobility with his force fields. One way is to generate a field under his feet and ‘levitate’ with it, scaling buildings with ease. Another one is to generate a field under his feet, which takes less time and can be used mid-combat. This can be used to walk on ‘air’, making it possible to evade strikes before unavoidable, or whack his opponents from above to enhance damage done.
 
New uses may be innovated later in his career.
 
**Example:**

Vanguard is facing off against three thugs, all armed with melee weapons (bats, batons and knives.).

Approaching them, he is pelted with bricks thrown by his opponents. To this he flicks his hand, and glowing disks are conjured between him and the flying objects. They clatter to the ground as they connect, and Vanguard quickly dismisses the disks.

He takes a couple of long and fast strides towards the nearest ruffian and aims his baton for his lower jaw. As he does this, he conjures a small disk behind the back of the thug, which he presses onto his back, putting him off-balance. This, in conjoined with a perfectly coordinated strike, wipes the thug straight off his feet.

After this, two things happen. The ruffian closest to his downed comrade charges for Vanguard, and Vanguard himself conjures an additional disk - this one right in front of the other ruffians face. The momentum of the thug’s body meets a rigid barrier, which all results in a broken nose, copious amount of pain and him being disabled for the time being.

The last opponent sees all this and whacks out with his baseball at Vanguard. The hit connects - bruising Vanguard’s lower left torso and paining him badly. Vanguard backs a few steps, all the while gesturing with his off-hand. After a few seconds a shimmering sphere is formed around him, giving him a few breaths of recovery.

The thug, however, is not resting. Filled with fervor fueled by rage and most likely ample amounts of drugs, he does not stop his barrage of strikes. Hitting the forcefield time after time, cracks eventually appears. What he does not notice, however, is the field behind him moving towards his back, intending to press him flat as a pancake as a mean to detain him. When he reaches backwards with his bat for his next swing, he realizes that he hit some kind of resistance - flicking his gaze backwards, he is met by the faintly glowing blue barrier. It is too late, and he is pressed between the two fields. One taser later, he is lying convulsing on the ground.

His primary duties was assisting the head Surgeon with maintaining the health of the brigade, etc. He went on four tours, between those he studied on colleges in order to get a legal doctors license. 
During his last tour, when they were moving their HQ into a newly occupied compound, their convoy was ambushed. After an IED detonated the first vehicle in the convoy, a sand manipulating cape started tearing the doors of the vehicles open and ripped the men out of their vehicles. Tearing them limb from limb with his powers, all the while screaming in his native tongue (probably about how his god is great or something like that). Dietrich triggers seeing this immense brutality and uses his power and his opponents momentary distraction (due to him triggering), to put a bullet in his head. However, he was still injured himself rather gravely, and was honorably discharged due to him being psychologically unfit for service after the event. 
 
The army, as they promised to do when he first applied, hooked him up with work at a hospital, namely Ashton’s own [GENERIC_HOSPITAL_NAME]. 
 
As to cope with depression and the loss of meaning his life suddenly had, as he is unfit for service, he has set up a rigorous schedule for himself so that he may never be unoccupied, always be productive, as to simulate the one he had during his service and add some kind of meaning to his life.
 
**Resources:**

A medium flat in a relatively nice area, downtown.
 
A yearly income of $150,000, after tax. He has twice the amount of that in the bank stored, collecting interest. 
 
A slightly run-down cottage in the Ashen woods. He spends his holidays there, mostly working on the cottage itself, reading or canoeing when he is there. Inherited from his father.
 
He does not own a motor vehicle but would not have any trouble attaining one if he would need to, as he has a license.
 
Contacts in the military, which grants him limited influence within associated spheres. Ability to prescribe medicine if needed, although he needs to be conservative with abusing this privilege in order to not get his license revoked.
 
**Alignment:**

Dietrich understands that order and a strict following of the law is needed for a society to flourish - it’s a part of his personality, to be honest. He is a vigilante hero, but is considering joining the PRT after he has conversed with both capes inside and outside of it, in order to get a real perspective on it. He is knew to the scene and understands that his knowledge is very limited.
 
Shortly: understands the purpose of the law, also understands its limitations and that is sometimes need to be broken in order to be uphold.
 
**Equipment/Weaponry:**

1x straight baton.

1x taser, 1 spare charge.

1x runners backpack, light weight.

1x combat knife, useful from everything from cutting through rope to stabbing hoodlums.

1x burner phone.

1x smaller medical kit, including but not limited to: bandages, morphine and sterilizing alcohol.

3x flares, affixed to pants.

1x 500 ml water bottle.

1x flashlight.

1x lighter.

1x permanent marker.

1x notepad with pen.

1x Lehigh 3/8-in x 50-ft White Twisted Nylon Rope. Rope is handy. 

10x plastic cuffs.

1x gas mask strapped to leg, 3 filters. (about 90 minutes of breathing time in non-corrosive vapours).

1x Remington Model 870 pump-action shotgun, loaded with beanbag shells or 12-gauge, depends on context. Slung around shoulder.

1x Smith &amp; Wesson, model 29, for that Dirty Harry feel. Chambers .44 Magnum cartridges, for emergencies only. 
Strapped to back, concealed by backpack. 

12x .44 Magnum cartridges, six loaded in the model 29.

6x 12-gauge shotgun shells

6x bean-bag shotgun shells

2x L83A1 smoke grenades, strapped to belt.

2x M84 stun grenades, strapped to belt.

2x XM58 grenade (tear gas) strapped to belt.
 
 
**Specializations:**

He works as a doctor, and while he does not currently work as a field surgeon, he once did. He might be rusty and not quite as efficient as he was earlier in life, but he is capable of administering emergency medical care many times better than a civilian would be, especially if he actually has access to medical supplies.
 
Dietrich always has a topic he is currently very interested in. It is currently geology, and he is proficient with scratch kits and other methods of identifying different types of rocks.
 
He is quite adept at laying puzzles, and always has one in the progress of being completed at home. 
Speaks German (Family is German), English and can converse in French in a casual setting, but is improving as he is taking courses at Ashton university.
 
In the real world, he might only be a man. In the world of Microsoft Excel he is a warlock capable of complex, eldritch mathematical transmutations. Mere mortals gaze in awe at his arcane knowledge. 

**Power:**

Shortly said, his power is force fields. He has a range of 20 meters where inside that range he can manifest and move his fields, and he can keep up 5 at the very most. He can shape them into geometric shapes, or just create a ‘wall’. It glows vaguely blue, and seems to have the qualities of glass. The shield shatters if someone breaks through it, and it grows cracks before doing so, a good indicator on how damaged every force field is.
 
The force fields can take punches, kicks, etc. from baseline humans, and the same from a low-tier brute. If that brute uses a sledgehammer or axe, he could break through but it largely depends on the brute. A baseline human with a sledgehammer can probably with enough dedication and strength break through, but will take time. The force fields will take 9mm and not shatter, but under heavy volleys, like 3 1911s being unloaded at the same time in a coordinated attempt or a sub-machine gun unloading its whole magazine, it will shatter. Each shield can take exactly 1 5.56x45 (NATO, American rifle standard) round until it shatters.
 
The force fields does not let through liquids or solids, but gasses, like air, is let through. The shield does not stop heat. ‘Gasses’ with big particles is let through, but not the particles themselves, things like smoke is not allowed through. Light is let through, which means that lasers just bypass the fields. The force fields lead electricity very well, and lightning bolts don’t break through, but have to be grounded into something and/or evaded by standing far away, in order not to get melted.
 
In example, a flame thrower will prove relatively effective against his fields, but can the effects can be avoided entirely if appropriate measures are taken. A flame thrower spews flammable liquid on fire, the liquid will not break through, and will just continue to burn, sticking to the fields as though it was a normal wall. However, the heat is still transmitted between both sides of the fields - this means that if an appropriate distance  between force field and person is  not exercised, you will still get burns of varying intensity depending on the distance - this may result in death.
 
The damage upon a field is cumulative, meaning that damage does not have to exceed a certain threshold in order to affect the shield. Eventually the shield will break, even if you’re just slamming a baton into it.
 
The maximum weight one field can carry by itself is 400 lbs, or about 180 kilograms for normal people. 

Dietrich has 25 m^2 he can distribute towards height and width - a perfect square utilizing all of the available space would be 5 by 5 meters wide.

Dietrich can move these fields upto 20 km per hours in any direction, and may selectively turn ‘off’ them for himself and whatever he’s carrying, allowing him walk and hit through them. The time it takes to manifest a field varies on the size, a disk the diameter of a plate takes an instant, a wall 4 meters wide and 3 meters tall takes a few seconds, but once up they are up they can be maintained until they are either dismissed or shattered. If they are shattered a cooldown of 15 seconds will commence, until then the maximum number of shields maintained is reduced by one.
 
Dietrich cannot manifest these fields inside objects, even inanimate ones. He can't do a narwhal and just cut through steel slabs like butter, nor can he do the same to humans. 

**Versatility:**

Dietrich is not the most creative person on Earth Kaf, but he is very thorough. He spend much of his free time contemplating and experimenting, well aware that his power is not very offensive related and relatively weak compared to other local capes. Thus, he must compensate by thinking of new and effective uses of his power. 
 
He has realized that he has a very crude TK ability, by enveloping an object in a force-field he can move it. This takes concentrated effort, but can be useful in some, limited cases. 
 
He has also come up various ways to improve his mobility with his force fields. One way is to generate a field under his feet and ‘levitate’ with it, scaling buildings with ease. Another one is to generate a field under his feet, which takes less time and can be used mid-combat. This can be used to walk on ‘air’, making it possible to evade strikes before unavoidable, or whack his opponents from above to enhance damage done.
 
New uses may be innovated later in his career.
 
**Example:**

Vanguard is facing off against three thugs, all armed with melee weapons (bats, batons and knives.).

Approaching them, he is pelted with bricks thrown by his opponents. To this he flicks his hand, and glowing disks are conjured between him and the flying objects. They clatter to the ground as they connect, and Vanguard quickly dismisses the disks.

He takes a couple of long and fast strides towards the nearest ruffian and aims his baton for his lower jaw. As he does this, he conjures a small disk behind the back of the thug, which he presses onto his back, putting him off-balance. This, in conjoined with a perfectly coordinated strike, wipes the thug straight off his feet.

After this, two things happen. The ruffian closest to his downed comrade charges for Vanguard, and Vanguard himself conjures an additional disk - this one right in front of the other ruffians face. The momentum of the thug’s body meets a rigid barrier, which all results in a broken nose, copious amount of pain and him being disabled for the time being.

The last opponent sees all this and whacks out with his baseball at Vanguard. The hit connects - bruising Vanguard’s lower left torso and paining him badly. Vanguard backs a few steps, all the while gesturing with his off-hand. After a few seconds a shimmering sphere is formed around him, giving him a few breaths of recovery.

The thug, however, is not resting. Filled with fervor fueled by rage and most likely ample amounts of drugs, he does not stop his barrage of strikes. Hitting the forcefield time after time, cracks eventually appears. What he does not notice, however, is the field behind him moving towards his back, intending to press him flat as a pancake as a mean to detain him. When he reaches backwards with his bat for his next swing, he realizes that he hit some kind of resistance - flicking his gaze backwards, he is met by the faintly glowing blue barrier. It is too late, and he is pressed between the two fields. One taser later, he is lying convulsing on the ground."
6wealm,2,2017-08-27,Need some help with moving on.,userstuckinthepast,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6wealm/need_some_help_with_moving_on/,"Last year I was doing an internship at a company for 3 months. Over there I met a girl who was my team mate. As a result of being in the same team, we ended up spending a lot of time together. Apart from work both of us use to go out together for lunch, movies, sometimes shopping etc. Though it was more like we were friends, rather than a sort of romantic relationship. On the other hand we grew very close during that time. Somewhere along the line I began to really like her, though she had a boyfriend then. Once the internship ended we never did meet, on the other hand we did chat a few times, quite a lot at the start and now maybe twice or thrice a month and I believe we still are quite close.

Fast forward one year, I still really like her, and because of the time I spent with her, I end up comparing anyone else I meet with her and feel like the she was perfect. I'm scared that I'll never be able to meet or experience anything like the moments I spent with her. I keep thinking about her and it gets me depressed. Whenever I see pics of her with someone else I get jealous. I know a romantic relationship with her is impossible (we'll probably never meet again, but I still keep hoping miraculously we do) but I'm not able to accept that and this is destroying me mentally.

If I could get rid of all my romantic feelings for her and think of her merely as a friend that would be the prefect outcome.

I do realize that people have been through similar situations before and the most common advice given is to end all contact with her...but I mentally I'm not able to do that. The best thing would be for me to block her on all social media but I really don't want to destroy our current relationship..I'm probably speaking in circles now.

Any suggestion or a different perspective about my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. "

**[BACKSTORY]**

There's a lot to this story, but I'll just make it short and sweet as I'm sure people don't want to read a huge wall of text. My girlfriend is traveling overseas so study abroad, creating a six hour time zone difference. I won't be able to see her until right after Christmas. Just thinking about that right now kills me. Thinking about how fall is under a month away, and then i have to completely go through the whole season of fall without her.

We live 300 miles away from each other during the school year. That's not really too bad, as I know some people on this sub who live halfway around the world from one another. We just had a visit that was cut short two weeks ago. It was supposed to end the 20th, but on the 13th she wanted to break up because she felt weird in this relationship and she had a gut feeling that this wasn't what she wanted. I told her that it's because she has a lot going on in her life with the studying abroad program, the Disney internship application and a few other things were making her life very stressful. I could go on about this breakup, but that's a whole 'nother story. My parents ended up flying to a nearby airport and helped me drove back. I could drive if I stayed one night to let me emotions simmer down, but they wanted me home ASAP. Keep this in mind, as this left them a little upset with her. 

We got back together 4-5 days ago, going to take things slow. But things look like they are already going back to normal. Funnily enough, she told me that she broke up because of the bubbling stress in her life. She also claimed ""the spark wasn't there anymore when we kissed."" But that's expected, because the honeymoon of the relationship is long gone after 7 months of being together. 

So cue to today, back to saying I love you and everything. She now doesn't want to go study abroad, and has a panic attack over it. I'm really scared for her and want her to be happy. She was happy about how I was going to visit her halfway between her exchanges, but now I won’t be able to because of a speeding ticket that I’m going to have to pay and the bad taste left in my parent's mouth. I commute to school, so, I have to respect them as they do feed me and put a roof over my head. It’s a pretty new car, too. Only have to pay for gas. So I have to respect them, and they will totally not let me go visit her after that last episode happened. 

The most I've gone without seeing her is almost three months. Now it's going to be four and half, with a time difference a six hour time difference. I'll be taking 16 credits and be working 15-20 hours a week, so my schedule is going to be quite packed. That's good, because time will be going by a lot faster now. I know that'll help me in the long run, as I looked at our message history and look at photos we've sent each other three or four months ago. I'm shocked that it was that long ago, felt like it was just last month! 

**[THE QUESTIONS]**

So, does anyone have any advice on how to survive these next four months? Couples who don't see each other for long periods of time, how do you manage? How do you guys deal with time zones and conflicting schedules? I know that our schedules could line up and things could work out very well, but, that may not happen. I'm preparing for the worst. Any help is really appreciated; I've already read some pretty good tips from similar posts. I got a gym membership, bought an expansion to an MMO that'll be out mid-late September, and already got a lot of big plans with friends. I’m going to a couple concerts, and will be doing a few mini day-trips. What I'm more concerned about is how to keep the health of our relationship still in tip-top shape when we are so far apart. Cute things you guys do in your LDR that could help ours out. Just anything would be much appreciated.

---

**[WP] Scientists have finally decrypted Whale songs, and are able to listen in on long distance conversations. After a few weeks of listening in, all research is quickly classified, and NASA starts silent, hurried plans to reach Sirius, even reaching out to other space agencies for help.**

---

The President of the United States of America sat in front of Dr. Maxwell Cameron. Most men would pay good money for such audience, but not Maxwell. He had trouble even picking up his eyes from the creases of his thumbs folded on top of each other in front of him. Some of his coworkers remarked upon how it looked like he was praying, but that was the furthest thing from the truth they could get. Maxwell was not a man of religion. He only believed in science.

For ten years, Maxwell had worked on deciphering whale songs. Most had called it a nutjob’s fantasy. This hadn’t been helped by the fact that in moments of human interaction, Dr. Cameron refused to look up and would always sullenly stare at his hands. If his work was truly a nutjob’s fantasy, then he was the nutjob.

But when his work had begun producing results, people who had admonished him to his face had publically declared that they had always believed in him. Within a single month, he had gone from lunatic to genius, obsessive child to steadfast pioneer. The whales were much more intelligent than anyone ever believed them to be and their songs, a message only Dr. Cameron could truly understand.

Science magazine, Nature magazine, every big publication picked up his story. Most websites and newspapers had some form of clickbait around it. You won’t believe what the whales are singing about this week!

Though for all their talk of whale songs, few truly tuned in. Not like Dr. Cameron. Which is why he had finally accepted the President’s invitation for dinner.

“Dr. Cameron,” The President said in between bites of steak. They made sure not to include fish, though Dr. Cameron wouldn’t have minded. “Your work is amazing. I’ve been told that your mind is a once in a generation type of brain. Well, unless you ask the Japanese fishermen,” he remarked with a chuckle. “Then you’re work is economic warfare.”

“Thank you.” Dr. Cameron shook his head and inspected his hands. Observation: his right thumb held a slight tremble. Conclusion: he was more nervous than usual. “About the funding I requested.”

“Of course,” The President said. “You wanted a dedicated facility and staff. Your proposal is quite expensive. You’ve already proved that whales are sentient, what else do you hope to accomplish?”

“The whales are singing a message,” Dr. Cameron said. “I want to decipher it.”

“And what would deciphering it do?”

If Dr. Cameron were to tell the truth, he would tell the President that the whales didn’t sing to communicate. They sang lullabies for a single name that came up with every song—Big Blue. And that they were terrified of whatever Big Blue was. Whales refused to sing anything else, even with harpoon ships behind them and reinforced barbed steel stuck inside them. They lived and died singing the same lullaby.

But that wouldn’t have gotten him funding. So Maxwell Cameron did the hardest thing he had ever done in his life.

“They make observations,” he lied to the President of the United States. “Observations about the various countries they travel around.”

The President perked up. “What kind of observations?”

“I don’t know. That’s why I want the funding.”

---

Big Blue was a name known only to Dr. Cameron and his immediate staff, though only Dr. Cameron dared to admit what it was—a God. At least the whale equivalent of a God. And unlike the Human God, this one demanded second-to-second attention lest it… 

This was something not Dr. Cameron dared to share. After all, there was an entire species of mammals dedicated to making sure that the thing never awoke.

“Dr. Cameron,” Dr. Lisa Lyza said and pointed to her monitor. “Look at this.”

The other scientists glanced over. Dr. Lyza was the only one Dr. Cameron would talk to directly. The rest had to e-mail him their discoveries. Though Dr. Lyza was also the only one willing to stay up nights with Dr. Cameron deciphering whale communications. The jealous ones whispered stories of Dr. Cameron and Dr. Lyza and those late night research sessions. The less spiteful ones, like their intern Steve, admitted that those two were just in a completely different league than them.

“What do you think this means?” Dr. Lyza said. Exactly three hours ago, the whale songs had increased in volume. The whales were practically screaming now.

Dr. Cameron stared at the data and then his hands. Observation: A small twitch in his middle knuckle. Conclusion: for the first time, the answer wasn’t readily apparent.

“I can’t think of any scientific reason for this. Could it be random?” he asked.

“It’s getting louder across all our sensors,” Dr. Lyza said, scratching her head. “But especially off the coast of Japan.”

Dr. Cameron’s other knuckles joined in the middle knuckle’s tic.

“Are you guys serious?” Steve, the intern, said.

Both looked up at him, though Dr. Cameron immediately looked away.

Steve raised a single brow as a smile spread across his lips. “You guys really don’t know. Let me just savor this moment a little bit.”

“Steve,” Dr. Lyza warned.

“Fine, fine. It was all over the news today. You know, CNN, Fox, MSNBC”—he looked over to the two scientists but they only returned him blank stares—“all over Reddit? The Guardian?” 

Still more blank stares.

“The mass whaling,” he said. “It was organized by Japanese fishermen in protest of literally us. It was the single biggest decline of whale population in a single day since a meteor wiped out the dinosaurs. If whales existed back then of course.”

Dr. Lyza’s jaw fell. She looked back toward the data. “It’s changing again. I’ve never seen this song before.” She looked to Steve for more answers.

Unfortunately, anything outside of the front page of Reddit was also outside of Steve’s expertise. He looked back with a shrug. 

Only Dr. Cameron recognized this new song. His hands shook uncontrollably as he translated the song for the rest of his team.

“Ten. Nine. Eight…”

The children of S’mokane village huddled around a small fire on Island Eight to listen to the Storyteller. The fire alit her sunken eyes and veiny cheeks. She could no longer even stand straight. The village had no use for those who could no longer forage or fish, except for her, the Storyteller. Because she knew ancient truths that had long since been lost with the Floods, back before the era of Never-ending Rain.

“Island Ten,” she told the children, “used to be the peak of Earth’s greatest mountain. We called it Everest. It was like a hand reaching into the sky, grasping even the storm clouds.”

“I’ve been to Island Ten,” one of children interjected. “It’s not that tall.”

The Storyteller pressed her lips into a thin smile. “That’s because the water has reached it. It doesn’t *seem* tall.”

“My mom says that you’re lying,” the same child said. “She says there has never been an era before the Never-ending Rain, that the sky was never blue and that there was always water everywhere.”

“That’s because your mom was born after the Floods. She simply can’t remember.”

“Were people really able to fly back then? Like birds?” another child asked.

The Storyteller chuckled and nodded. “We had great iron birds to take us.”

All the children loved hearing stories of the time before the Never-ending Rain (they called that time the Era of Sunlight), though only one child cared for her favorite story. Klyde raised his hand and the Storyteller looked toward him.

“You never told us what happened to Dr. Cameron,” Klyde said.

The Storyteller opened her mouth to respond, but instead found a fit of coughing. That happened to her quite a lot recently. “Dr. Cameron,” she finally said, a tinge of sadness in her voice. “I’m not sure what happened to him. When we evacuated, he chose to go his own way.”

“To figure out a way to put Big Blue back to sleep and bring us back to the Era of Sunlight?”

Some of the other kids sneered at the mention of that era. At first, it was annoying that these kids refused to believe in such a time, but The Storyteller understood. There was no evidence that such a time existed. All they had now was the Era of Never-ending Rain.

“Yes,” The Storyteller said.

“Do you think he will?” Kylde asked.

The Storyteller smiled as wide as her lips would let her. Of anyone on this planet, only she had ever truly known Dr. Cameron. After all, those rumors of their late night research sessions had been mostly true. Dr. Cameron was a man of absolute certainty. Though he couldn’t look people in the eye, when he was fixated on something, he would spend even a decade on it when the rest of the world told him it was a nutjob’s fantasy.

“Yes,” The Storyteller, Lisa Lyza, told the children. “He’ll put Big Blue back to sleep and return us the sun.”

So here is the context first. We met in Feb. 2016 during our semester of studies abroad, and we decided to stay together after that. We both returned to our homelands and decided for a few months to do a long distance relationship. We met every 2 or 3 weeks, and everytime it was amazing.

In January, I moved to her country (which I don't know the language) for a year-long internship. I just live 3 hours away from her now, so we can see each other every weekend.
Since then, it's been a real downfall (by my fault for most of it). Last Feb. she expressed me that she wants some more time for herself, that she expects me to meet people and get new friends. Tbh, I didn't do the necessary to get 'friends', and basically I was 'waiting' for her (at her place or mine) to go out and do something.
We didn't talk about it until the month of June, even though I didn't change my attitude before that. This time she had really hard words. I realized (probably too late I admit) that I needed to change to keep our relationship on a good path.

From mid-June until the end of August I have a summer break, so we decided that I move to her place for a few weeks (from mid-June until end of July). Unfortunately this has got our relationship worse.
First, she has insomnia, and this since many years. One night she exploded, cried, and I was here trying to comfort her (as usual). I decided to put my alarm 45 mins later that day so she can sleep a bit more, and I'm not super late at my language class (she agreed with this compromise). 2 days after she threw at me that I could have turned off my alarm, that I don't care about her sleeping problems...
She added that I should think more about what I do or say, because in her opinion, she has to think for me. Part of it is true (see 1st paragraph) but I decided to change my attitude, and she even told me that we were on a good way. 
She brought up this argument a few times again, and most of the time she mentions the fact that I should have changed my attitude earlier, and that I didn't listen to her at all since January.

Today, she texted me that she thinks I don't love her. She thinks I'm not concerned by any of her needs, that I don't listen to her at all, that I didn't realize we are falling apart, that ""she is totally miserable next to me"", and that ""maybe I like her though"". This totally breaks me, because I really think I'm showing her love, giving her attention etc...

I really tried to change since June, but she doesn't seem satisfied at all, and she often brings up this argument. 
I feel that this is getting a bit too dramatic and exaggerated, because I think I'm not the cause to all the problems she has, and that I admitted more than one time my mistakes.

I'm not sure what to do more to show I love her (because I really do) and how to handle our relationship from now on. I'll be returning to her country on Friday (I'm in my hometown atm) so I'm gonna see her again very soon. Not sure how to handle that either, as I feel she's gonna bring up the same argument again. 

What do you think I should do from now on so our relationship gets better?

tl;dr: moved to gf's country, relationship gets worse first by my fault (realized very late that she needed more space) so admitted mistake and trying to fix it since June; she brings up the argument too often imo; today she texts me she thinks I don't love her, don't listen to her and not concerned at all by her problems.

I started out as an Intern and just trying to grasp out how the company works, I was not able to finish my college degree due to some personal problems and at that point I was so lucky to be an intern since by the time I got in, it was a time in UAE that it is really hard to find a job. I accept the fact that what they are providing to me is below to what should be my salary or what the uae labor law says but it's fine cause it's just an internship but I need to renew my visa every 3 months, and had to pay for all the fees my self wherein that's where all my ""salary"" went to.. was not able to save anything since my salary was really really low. After 6 months and 2 exits, they officially included me as an employee of the company. Since they are really underman in terms of the department I am working. Our manager needs to have a 6 months leave due to personal reasons, and her leave got accepted. Her job was left to me, wherein there is a deadline for everything and most of the clients she was handling is all screwed at the moment. There is 2 months left for me to apply all 50 clients or else their money will be gone for good. By the way, since I became a regular i got an increase, but literally a shitty increase. My salary now is $800 something per month and the manager I replaced  who I received all of her job was having a salary of $5400. And the other thing is I did a good job and every client was saying that I was way better than the one I replaced, cause I was really helpful and been updating all of them all the time. I did not get the title manager but i got all of her responsibilities. I did not even received a single increase even after what  I've done for them... Seriously, I already lost all motivation to work hard for them.. That's why I am posting this here cause I already gave up on giving a shit on them.

Even checking out the most basic of online manuals, beginners blogs, videos hasn't been helping out and I'm at a loss at what to do, since I didnt expect to be working on this given my qualifications lean more toward other IT fields as opposed to back end web development. 

There are no superiors who I can ask questions to, I was instructed to simply find out and research on my own how to complete this.

For today, I've been tasked with at the very least knowing how to save, delete, edit and update user passwords, names, contact numbers etc., but even connecting to mongodb has proven difficult to me, let alone using php to manipulate data in it.

Later on I will be required to also design the site and login view itself, but I have experience with html and css, so I think I can handle the decorating, its simply that I have no idea where to start with this system that I understand is supposed to be easy, but that I lack any skills to handle.

This being said, what should I do? Im planning on rushing through codecademy's php cours, but that likely wont help much with the mongodb portion of this.

I know I can probably try and find out myself how to do this by googling it, but I feel that I dont even know what I need to key into the search engine given that what I have looked for so far has been of limited use.

To make it up for that, I immersed myself into learning Java and even made a Tic Tac Toe program because I knew the appeal was my last shot. Guess what? I failed the appeal too, you probably need God-like stats to get through it. The disappointment hit hard; I never thought their interview would be that stringent. 

Anyway I'm considering taking SUSS part-time [Information and Communication Technology degree](http://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/programme-details/Pages/BSc-Information-and-Communication-Technology.aspx) in Jan 2018, while learning CS/programming online (from freecodecamp, edX and other sites). There will only be two night classes per week. I'll have a lot of free time for self-learning, and eventually find work. That way I can gain working experience quicker; however, can I get hired in relevant fields without a degree in the first place?

A friend has been dissuading me and told me to wait one year for the next intake because of the academic rigour and marketability of full-time CS degree. He has made some valid points, and now I'm wavering. 

I'm not sure what I should do. To wait 5 months, or one year. To spend 11k, or 28k. To potentially finish in 2 years, or spend a definite 3 1/3 years with the final year on internship.

6wkjvv,242,2017-08-28,[spoilers] A theory about Foggy Nelson post-Defenders,dmreif,Defenders,https://www.reddit.com/r/Defenders/comments/6wkjvv/spoilers_a_theory_about_foggy_nelson_postdefenders/,"I just had a gut feeling this morning when thinking about how *The Defenders* sets up *Daredevil* season 3 to be an adaptation of the *Born Again* storyline, and I think there will be some changes: namely, that some of the stuff that happened to Matt in the original story will instead happen to Foggy.

I mean, this is what I'm getting at: in the original story, Wilson Fisk destroys Matt’s life by messing with his finances, firebombing his apartment, and getting him disbarred by bribing a cop to give perjured testimony against him, among other things. 

For the MCU, I think they could do a twist on things and have all that stuff happen to Foggy. I say that because of two things: 

The first is Matt's visit to Fisk in prison in ""The Man in the Box"". We know from the dialogue that Fisk isn't just angry at Matt, he's angry at Nelson &amp; Murdock as a whole (Matt, Karen and Foggy) for putting him away:

&gt;**Wilson Fisk**: Ask my lawyer. He'll deny it. Ask the guards, they'll deny it! Ask the inmates here. They'll cut their tongues out before they talk! But I have something to say to you: When I finally get out of this cage, I will dismantle the lives of the two amateurs THAT PUT ME IN HERE!! You, Mr. Murdock, and Franklin Percy Nelson! The two of you took the laurels. You'll both take the blame. I'll chop both the heads off that snake, and I'll spend more than $6 on postage to bring you down!

This tells me that Fisk is also going to be retaliating against Karen and Foggy.  That's not much of a surprise: it's no coincidence that his empire went to shit the moment Nelson &amp; Murdock showed up. First there was them getting to Karen before Fisk's people could, which resulted in Union Allied being exposed. Attempting to bribe Karen into silence kickstarted the chain of events that led to James Wesley's death. Then there was the matter of hiring the firm to the defend Healy (which resulted in Matt learning Fisk's name). Then Nelson &amp; Murdock was the legal counsel opposing Fisk on the tenement case, related to the Hand's use of Fisk to acquire Elena Cardenas' building for the purpose of constructing Midland Circle and accessing the dragon bones.  And lastly, Nelson &amp; Murdock were the ones who helped arrange the plea deal for Hoffman. 

And on a related note to the above, *Daredevil* season 2 did see Fisk starting his retaliation against Nelson &amp; Murdock. Fisk had to have known from his connections that the firm was defending Frank Castle. While it's clear that Fisk needed to use Frank to dispose of Dutton without drawing attention to himself, that wasn't the main reason Fisk had Frank sabotage his trial. No, Fisk's ulterior motive for sabotaging Frank Castle's trial was to hurt Nelson &amp; Murdock.

But anyways, back to Foggy. Why do I think that Fisk will hurt Foggy by doing things like mess with his finances and get him disbarred with perjured testimony? Well, it ties in with the ending of *The Defenders*. Foggy can't be taking Matt's ""death"" too well. Especially since he blames himself for it. I say that as a fact because it was Foggy who brought Matt's Daredevil suit to the precinct right before Matt broke out with Luke and Jessica to go rescue Danny. And Matt was a very big part of Foggy's life, because Foggy stuck with him tooth and nail through law school, through their internships at Landman &amp; Zack, and the first go of Nelson &amp; Murdock. And now he's gone, leaving this big hole in his life. As a result, I think Foggy will be going on a big downward spiral: excessive drinking, burying himself under a mountain of work (like he had tried to get Matt to do), and breaking up with Marci. 

In the comics, when Fisk tore Matt's life apart, it didn't hit Matt right away that Fisk was targeting him: he just thought he hit a string of bad luck, as most of his sufferings were subtly engineered problems concerning his taxes, his career and his friends. It was Fisk blowing up his apartment that cued Matt in that he was being targeted.

With season 3 of *Daredevil*, Foggy could easily undergo this same cycle. Matt's ""death"" and the fallout would be a great time for Fisk to start moving against Foggy: subtly engineering sabotage of Foggy's life in such a way that everyone will think Foggy is falling off the wagon in light of Matt's ""death"".

However, there are a few issues in my mind.  First, it's a P&amp;C job which isn't my preferred route due to the fact that it seems like I will have to take much more exams that route.  Is this a valid concern?  So far I have three exams passed and was planning on taking MLC in October but that won't help my if I go this route.  

Secondly, the pay seems to be on the lower end from what I can see for people with three exams.  It will be lower 60 thousands in a large city, which seems low to me.  And from what I can tell raises seem hard to come by, other than exam based raises, is this the norm?  

I guess those are my two main concerns, the fact that it's P&amp;C and the pay.  Would you say that I should accept the job anyway?  The offer will expire before I really have time to test out the job market, so it's pretty much a one or the other kind of situation. Is it worth the risk to search for another job?

However, before I applied I felt really worried - I have been a psychiatric patient for seven years now, and I wasn't sure what type of attitudes the other students would have towards their future patients. 
Turns out, I was right to feel concerned. There was a lot of ableism, and most had a general lack of knowledge. (Knowing that depression is related to your serotonin levels is something I just assume everyone knows, to give one of many examples). People were using slurs, and one student even turned to me and called another student 'such a f*cking psycho'. 
So, I guess I have two major questions:
1) I assume it gets better, but for how long will it be like this?
2) Is there anything I can do? 

I have decided to avoid any hazing activities for now (we haze all new students with humiliating games and challenges here) but I already feel nauseous knowing I have to go back tomorrow. I don't think I'd feel comfortable disclosing my mental illnesses either, as they are stigmatized and/or a little too private to disclose to just about anyone (PTSD, DD-NOS, aspergers syndrome).

I am on here to ask several questions about practicing Pharmacy in the States. I graduated in Eastern Europe ( in the European Union) .  I currently have several months of working experience  in Ireland because in the European Union Pharmacist have freedom of movement whereby one  Pharmacist who graduated in one European country can have his degree immediately recognized in another European country without additional examination procedures, however I had 2 months of practical training in Ireland; my English is fluent. 

Anyways I have a great time working in an Irish community pharmacy it is a great experience and there seems to be a lot of work for pharmacist in Ireland; how does work opportunity hold up for pharmacist in the states?'

in The Irish Community pharmacy we have a very strong relationship with our patients, and some of the patients we know very well , all of their problems and in fact I have a cancer patient who I am dealing with and I am great support to him. Do these type of relationships exist in American Community pharmacies?
How is the job market for Independent Pharmacies in the States?. I prefer to work in Community pharmacies as opposed to Hospital, it is way more enjoyable for me. I never worked in Hospitals.

We make a lot of Blister packs in Ireland in Community pharmacies. Do they prepare these in the United States? It is a guided dosage form with a slot for morning, then noon and finally evening and the certain medications are taken at certain times, the statins usually at night, as well as sedating antidepressants and sleeping tablets, and the daily dosages such as aspirin, ramipril etc in the morning. 
In the Irish community pharmacy we hold all of the Controlled drugs in the safe, Controlled drugs in Ireland would be considered drugs such as  Oxycontin , Oxcycontin extended release formulation, Ritalin, Concerta, Temazepam and when such drugs are dispensed we have a book in which we record each and every transaction.
We also dispense Methadone in Irish Pharmacies. Sadly there are a lot of addicts in Ireland and Suboxone is not used in Ireland instead Methadone is dispensed in certain pharmacies. We do not have Adderall in Ireland but we have Tyvanse- which is the Irish equivalent of Vyvanse. We also use Guanfancine for ADHD in kids and it is prescribed frequently as well as Strattera. All of them are considered controlled drugs and they are held in the safe.

In Ireland all of the medication is labelled and the label has to by law contain the dosing and usage instructions as well as a portion were it states keep away from kids. We prepare the labels on the computer system when we dispense the medication. Ireland uses paper prescriptions and we dont use E-scripts also we have several different government schemes whereby different prices can be applied to medications. 

We use different types of dispensing softwares in Ireland which I doubt they use in the United States. 

I have several months of experience working in community and retail and I will continue to work in Ireland but possibly later on I will go to the states( do not know when but next year or even later on )  and take the FPGEE and NAPLEX. I am very young, 25 years old. I also have experience of working in Eastern European Pharmacies( Hungary). 
In Eastern Europe the dispensing software is less complicated and there are no labels on medications. 

I have worked in private pharmacies in Ireland as well as for chains such as Boots. I was wondering how would all of this experience transfer over to the states? How long would it take for me to do the internship in America?
Can somebody explain how pharmacy is like in the states also some rules and regulations in regards to Controlled drugs?
In Ireland for example for Xanax or Zolpidem to be dispensed it has to be hand written by the MD and the amounts and everything.
We have repeatable prescriptions in Ireland up to 6 months. Zolpidem and Xanax can be repeated but only if the prescription is hand written if not impossible, however Oxycontin is never repeatable.!!!
DOes the US have similiar laws?

I hope you are nice and horny! I have a new roleplay i'd love to play out with you all where I get fucked by a male pornstar. there is just something about those hunks I just love, I would pay good money to just see Kieran Lee's dick in the flesh.

Id love to play a scene where I am a cute young intern who is new to working for Brazzers the worlds best pornsite! I was only on my second day there, id spent the morning watching you film a scene and helping out the director and running errands while you did your magic for the camera. Whatever scene you like a threesum, fucking a milf, massage, shower, cuckold scene you name it. I had been asked to deliver you some coffee to your dressing room after you finished up. i was so nervous but so excited as i knocked on your door holding coffee for one of the most sexually attractive men on the planet....

That is the basic set up, but feel free to add to it in anyway, we can flesh out the characters more if you like. There are so many way we can do it just let me at your big famous cock!

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

Anyone who sends a hot gif or pic of who they want me to play as or to include in the scene wins bonus points

Look forward to playing"

10 on OPT visas. I am on a visa from Canada myself. I detest working in retail, telecom and big banks because of all the H-1Bs who barely speak English. Some know their stuff. most don't.

It's not the visa so much as it is the age. Back when I was 20 in my first internship, I was rocking DHTML, ASP and then moved on to various J2EE projects with Ext-JS. I wrote a bunch of cutting edge stuff. Built an mq mobile application. Wrote mobile pages for the blackberry.

Now with a TON of new stuff like iOS, android, big data, AWS, backbone, Spark, nosql dbs, notebooks, new scripting languages everyday I feel old.

I feel like the chicken that lays eggs for a few months and when it doesn't, recruiters and middle managers send us to the slaughterhouse - ie. get a walmart greeting job.

Right now I work in a hot space - hadoop, spark, hbase, mongodb, kafka, scala, javascript, Machine learning and know my comp sci. fundamentals realy well. I can learn iOS programming in 2 weeks. But nothing excites me anymore. AT the end of the day it all seems like gluing one interface and the data / encoding it accepts to another.

While I am a well paid professional in NYC, I fear that if I don't move into some excel and powerpoint role as a senior manager in ""big time consulting"", I will be sent to the career abattoir well before I hit 45 because of my age. What do you IT guys do to feel alive and be kept alive?"
6wmmen,12,2017-08-28,"My story with the ""CEO of the other company""",asdlpg,badpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/badpeoplestories/comments/6wmmen/my_story_with_the_ceo_of_the_other_company/,"Back in 2006, I worked for a company for one year. To understand my position there: In the company's hirarchy, I was pretty much right on the bottom and had something like an internship in the US but, as I said, I was in the hirarchy even under the interns. I had to do everything but mostly classic office work. The company I was working for was going through a tough time: The founder died one year prior to my employment and the new CEO, the son of the decedent one, had little authority and was known to be ""weak"". He also retained a construction company to renovate the building. The company's CEO got his own room for the time he was working there. This CEO attracted my attention because he simply said stuff to me like ""Hey! You! Why are you walking so demotivatet! Did it rain for five days straight or what? You should walk with energy and motivation"" or he asked my coworkers how I was doing and what mistakes I have made. I thought that he was weird but after all, it wasn't my problem what he was doing: he is not a coworker, he is a guy from a different company that happened to operate where I was working.

On one day, my back then boss (the new CEO but not to confuse you, I will just tell him boss) told me to throw away old prospects from thirty years ago. There were around 50-100 boxes full of obsolete prospects and flyers and because my boss wasn't there, I asked the groundskeeper where to throw them away. After all, he is the one who is responsible for the garbage and who knows where I can throw away all this stuff. He told me to bring it to the first floor and to simply throw it on the ground.

While bringing all the boxes to the first floor, the CEO of a building firm (he was there with his people to renovate the building our company was at and had no authority to give me any orders) asked me what I was doing and after I told him, he became really upset and told me that I am no longer allowed to bring the boxes to the first floor but had to bring it to the second floor and to carefully staple every box. I told him that I cannot follow his orders because the janitor is the one who is responsible for this and that he should talk to him if it bothers his work. I knew that it wasn't disturbing him because he didn't even have access to that part of the first floor. He told me then that he doesn't care what my boss told me to do or what the janitor said, he wants me to stop working - period.

So I went to the groundskeeper and told him what happened and assured that I am allowed to bring the boxes to the first floor and not to the second one and that I can simply throw them on the ground. I carried on with the work and after I was half way done, a coworker asked me to help him with a purchase order. While I was in office, the CEO of the other company came in, furios as hell, starting to shout at me, insulting me and threatened me that ""Bad things are going to happen"" and that I immediately had to clean up the mess I made on the first floor. I told him, again, that I got an order from my boss and that only he was allowed to give me orders and that the person responsible for the waste was the groundskeeper and that there is no legal way that obliges me to do anything he says to me. I told him this with a calm voice, I did not shout at him, I did not threaten him and he just freaked out, left the door and told me that this was the mistake that will ruin my life. If you are asking yourself how he knew what was going on on the first floor: He managed to get to that room he was not allowed to get in by breaking the door.

I carried on and threw the boxes on the floor until I was done. The next day, the CEO of the other Company went to my boss and told him some bs of how disrespectful I was. My boss told me that he won't accept any of this and told me that, as soon as he's back from his business trip, he will fire me (He didn't fire me on the place because he had to leave to the airport). I went to a psychiatrist and he gave me an attestation that I was sick and the company had to pay me my full wage for three months while I was at home, doing nothing + 4 weeks of full paid vacation. After those four months, I wrote a letter to the CEO of the other company, where I thanked him for the four months of vacation.

Just think about it: This man, who ran his own busssiness and had enough things to do, who had nothing to do with me, the little worker who had nothing to say, who had no access to that room, broke in and did everything he could to stop me. I have no idea why he did this and why he wasted so much energy on trying to harm me but I am glad that he failed. And by the way: He did not manage to ruin my life."
6wnd6c,0,2017-08-28,My [21F] brother [26M] is having a midlife crisis,throwaway34533t,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6wnd6c/my_21f_brother_26m_is_having_a_midlife_crisis/,"Ok so my brother is having a midlife crisis and just depressed because he ""made all the wrong choices in life.""

I don't think he did. At least they weren't things that were obviously wrong like getting DUI or slacking off in school. His mistakes in his words were:

1. Not being a super social or outgoing guy
2. Not working in construction or logistics while going to school
3. Having ever majored in engineering
4. Not being decisive about what he wanted to do

None of these were bad choices.

He graduated in May but did not have any luck.  While I see him on the computer a lot and he only went to one networking event, I know he spends a good portion of his time applying and preparing for interviews because he always seems to have an interview every week. A few places seemed promising but he still fell short. 

His resume isn't bad, he has held an internship, a 3.0, and was a captain of the robotics team for two years. It was a major recovery considering the fact he dropped out of school for a year due to depression and was on all sorts of anti- depressants. 

Of course everyone talks about networking and it's not what you know but who you know. He's convinced that had he made more friends and stayed in touch one of them would have a job for him. I reminded him that his internship, which he found on LinkedIn, payed more than most people i know, even those in engineering.

Initially the source of his depression came from living with mean roommates who bullied him for what I think is aspergers as well as trouble making friends at a school that was out of state. That on top of a very difficult major. 

While a lot of people struggle to break into industry I think being 26 on top of it is what makes it worse. He sees people on Facebook getting promotions and engaged with their long time fiancees. 

Hes had girlfriends before and I don't think he is a virgin. He's a good looking white guy who has muscles. This is coming from a few friends of mine. He started going to the gym a couple years ago. His social skills improved as well as he isn't so awkward and blunt anymore. These same blogs also call ""older women"" (late 20s) ""post-wall carusal riders."" 

A friend of his caught his most recent girlfriend on tinder and he broke up with her. I know a friend of mine, one of those engaged people, try to resolve things with a cheater. 

I don't know I mean he just isn't the same and I'm afraid it will become a vicious cycle where he will perform poorly on interviews because he looks depressed but hes depressed because he doesn't have a job. 

**Tldr**: brother is depressed that he made what he thinks were the wrong choices and doesn't think he can recover.

6wnu92,13,2017-08-28,Moving in with boyfriend,TheLongDayHasCome,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6wnu92/moving_in_with_boyfriend/,"I'm 22 and he's 26.

We've been going out for 6 months and have started discussing living together at the 1 year mark. Then, we will be moving up the country for him to do an internship (because of my freelance web design business, I am not geographically restricted and am free to move. I also don't have any real ties here - I've left my home country to escape a rather difficult homophobic family situation).

So, if everything works out, in March 2018 my boyfriend and I plan on living together. I think a year might be a little early but it's important that we do it because, in August next year, we want to move back to his home country and live happily together there. It's pretty far away so it's a major move, and I'd feel more comfortable having tested living together here first.

So, in March, my boyfriend and I will be living together and it might be the start of living together forever after.

At 22, and only a year escaped from a very damaging home life, it makes me pause. I want to live with him, and it could be very fun. We've lived together on holiday for a couple of weeks and we both miss that. And, on a cynical note, it also makes logistic sense because we will be cutting costs in half.

So we have 6 months. What things should I try and do to make the most of my final few months of independence? Especially since a year ago I was in an 8 year long terrible family situation and have never really had much freedom to do new things?

Also, when we do move in together, what should we expect? In terms of challenges etc? We both want this to work, we both have discussed marriage in 3 years, we have a good feeling about this relationship and we don't want to break it.

So any and all advice would be greatly greatly appreciated. Thank you."

6woh8g,7,2017-08-28,Should I work to pay debt or change careers?,anotherspark,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6woh8g/should_i_work_to_pay_debt_or_change_careers/,"Prior to today, I was working 2 restaurant jobs. One was as a server at a breakfast place and the other is as a server's assistant at a steakhouse. Today, I got fired from the breakfast place, because I expressed my discontent at how the restaurant was run (it was stressing me out to the point where I puked sometimes after shifts). I had a desire to escape from the restaurant industry for the longest time. I currently have ~$40000 in student loan debt. My original plan was to work both of these 2 jobs, be able to pay off everything in about 2 years, and then study to get IT certifications and get a career there.

I pay $550 in rent every month plus utilities and internet. My current job is enough to cover that, but will in no way help me pay off my student debt in a reasonable amount of time. However, right now, I should have more time to be able to study for certifications,  get my foot in the door, and be done with restaurants for good. I just don't know if this is the right move or if it is even that simple. Also I'm not even sure if IT is the right career path for me. I planned to get a career there based on the fact that I can educate myself (to not accumulate even more debt) and that it suits my personality (I work hard and am very analytical). Really, the fact is that I made about $800 a week working 60-70 hours in these 2 restaurant jobs, and it's been mentally and physically straining. If there is any job that I can do that pays that much while I can have a proper sleep schedule, I would do it. But with my major (Kinesiology) and the fact that my resume would be littered with restaurant experience (and an internship at a fitness facility), I don't know how feasible that would be. Should I look for another breakfast place where I can hopefully enjoy myself and stick to my original plan, or what other options would I have based on what I'm working with?"

It was a goal of mine to pass the ICND2 before the school semester really took off and I'm am thrilled to finally get it over with. Studying for this thing has been one hell of an experience.

       Kevin Wallace Videos-THESE WERE CLUTCH. 2x CCIE Wallace isn't mentioned enough on this sub and I don't get it. I learned the most from his ICND2 video set BY FAR! I loved his detailed explanations. If you have room to add a source to your study regiment I would strongly recommend it.
      Odom's book- I used his cert guide to fill the gaps in areas I am not comfortable with. He was just too boring to be a primary source IMO.

**Other source used:**

Chris Bryant's Udemy course- the fact that this course was only 10-15 bucks is insane! The mobile app was awesome because I could just download a couple of videos and listen to them while working out etc.


My question is where would you recommend I go from here? I got two more years of college and I'm interested in the Cyber security field. Maybe I go the Security + route? Is that a good start?

I have no problems living with random roommates, but as a girl barely into her 20's with no car I'm scared about ending up in an unsafe situation with someone on CList. I have no savings, and I don't understand a lot of basic stuff like how to make payments on my student loans or how taxes work.

6wr0v7,1,2017-08-29,"M4F - when a naive, professional young lady meets a (former) male pornstar...",veryyoungveryhung,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6wr0v7/m4f_when_a_naive_professional_young_lady_meets_a/,"As the title suggests, both scenes involve a naïve, well behaved or at least very professional young lady suddenly realising that she is meeting a male pornstar.

I love the contrast between the two characters backgrounds, the difference between how they both think and act. Especially though I love the change in thoughts that go through her head, from shock and potentially disgust (or something similar) to eventually intrigue and more...


**Interview with a pornstar**

I roleplay as a fictitious male pornstar now going into more legitimate films. In this rp your character would either be a little shy and possibly nervous about meeting a man with that sort of a background or she would be entirely unaware of my previous employment (I could be going into legitimate acting and you are interviewing me regarding a new movie I am in).

Gradually, as the interview progresses you start asking me about my previous roles and experience, not quite realising what you are getting yourself into!


**Don’t talk to the neighbours!**

We've lived next door to you for a while and for as long as anyone can remember, we've butted heads with your parents. We were too loud, throwing parties two or three nights per week, music blaring, people shouting and likely plenty of drugs. They've called the cops on us a few times, but it seems we're pretty sweet with them too - if only your parents knew how and why! Naturally your parents have told you to stay away from us. You couldn't really figure out why, after all we seem really nice and always wave and say hello. We don't look strange - quite the opposite in fact, we're rather attractive; my wife a pretty and athletic brunette in her early twenties and me a tall, muscular guy in his early thirties. But being a good girl, you did as you were told. Keeping it to just a friendly smile and nod whenever you passed us.

So when your parents start to get really strict (whether it's over your grades/getting a job/your behaviour etc) and you want to get rebellious, there's an obvious place to go. I mean we're only next door, we seem like the kind of people to listen!

I mean, how are you to know that we're pornstars?

**A pornstar in the office!**

The office is generally very boring. People here don't hate Mondays because of the stress their job gives them. They hate Mondays because it's the start of another work week of mind melting monotony. Dull, tedious work that seems to transcend the very concept of time. 

But this week there's something new. Something different. A new starter who seems somewhat mysterious. He's tall, around 6'2 and while he's only averagely attractive with his blonde hair and beard, he's built like someone who would look more happy swinging an axe around on a battlefield somewhere. Broad shoulders, muscular arms and chest fill out his plain work shirt to the point of it stretching. While his plain black trousers must have been specially made to fit round thighs that more resemble tree trunks than legs. 

There's talk going around too, spreading through the air like a virus without a host. 

*'Former prisoner, 'once killed a guy'.*

*'Don't be silly, we don't hire ex cons. No, I reckon he's a failed sports star'*

*'Janine says he was in a couple of films'*

*'I've not seen him in anything! Are you sure?'*

*'That's because he was in porn. Hung like a gifted horse apparently!'*

*'No way! Bullshit!'*

*'why not send in the intern. Find out the truth!'*

The girls snigger before approaching you. You've not worked here long but all the time you've been dying to be brought into the circle of trust. It wasn't hard for them to get you to agree to do his induction...

((So I'm trying to set up a rather awkward interaction between my character, a former male pornstar who has taken to working in an office to try to get a real job. And your character, an innocent, naive intern who has very little sexual experience and would certainly never have watched porn))


**Celeb possibility!**

You're filming a new TV show/movie but you're co star is completely is completely unfamiliar to you.  Which is strange, because he seems to confident in front of the cameras and he says he's been in dozens of films before..

I've been to the Cyber booth at both CIET and CLC but, as I was completing my branch preferences for accessions this week, lo and behold they now require cadets to have an interview and be ""Cyber Qualified"". 

Even though I've signed an ADSO for Cyber because I wish to be in the branch so badly, Brigade has still given me grief for attempting to place it as #1 w/o an interview.

This new way of gate-keeping for the Cyber branch is absolutely new to me, as it was never mentioned at any of the recruiting booths at CST; at least when I went.

I completed an internship (World Class Cyber OPFOR ""WCCO"") at Fort Belvoir last summer with 1st I/O Command, 2nd Battalion, I'm a Computer Engineering major with a 3.62 GPA and a 280 PT score, I have experience with Computer Forensics, Distributed Client/Server Programming, Embedded Systems and their design, Android Application Development, Data Communications, Network Defense, the list goes on.

I'm posting all of this to you guys in the hopes that I can grab the attention of someone out there who may have a POC that can conduct one of these ""Cyber Interviews"". I have attempted to contact my sponsors from my recent internship, as well as network through my SMI to find more information.

If you guys could please help me out, that would be amazing. I don't want the only reason I couldn't get my dream branch, a branch I'd sign an ADSO for, be because I didn't get some last minute interview."

But I'm still very nervous. Like everyone's telling me the date is approaching, I should be excited, and I was happy with it at first, but then there's all these little tasks: Do some last minute shopping. I can't be at work for as long. I have to close my bank account. Test pack my bag to see if everything fits. Let's go celebrate this new chapter in your life. Apartment hunting. 

Just these little things that are bringing it home for me, like...holy shit. I'm really fucking leaving, dude. After 7 years since I graduated high school, finished my bachelor's degree, and just felt like I wasted 2 years after graduation on pointless internship after pointless internship, pressure to get a job, etc. 

This is finally going to happen. 

And there's a whole bunch of doubts that I have, and just anxieties. What if I fuck up? What if it's disappointing? What if I'm really not ready or competent? 

I just want to embrace the tears and cry my eyes out, so I can be at some form of peace, but I can barely feel. It's not quite registering. I know everyone around me is excited, but like...I want some space to just actually cry my face off on someone's shoulder and be like, ""No, I'm genuinely scared, and I know this is an awesome thing that's happening and I worked to get here, but just let me be scared and afraid for now"".

So yeah. Aside from the positive things I feel, my hopes and dreams, etc. I admit it: I'm scared. I want to cry. I still have this lingering feeling that I'm not good enough."

You should be able to have a bunch of NPC's show up in your apartment to simulate a 'party' when you have other players in there.

Having more workers walk around the bunker would be nice. Even having someone in a golf cart chillin would be interesting.

As odd as it may sound, more NPC's doing shit. Specifically in player owned areas, because I understand if it's too much on the system to add shit like this to the main overworld.

These things would help make the game world feel more alive. That's one thing GTA always had over other 'open world games', that it *just felt alive*. And a lot of these DLC addons kinda don't feel as alive as I wish they did.

I am hoping this sub can help.

Here is the story:

Four years ago I had just gotten out of a long term relationship and was doing an internship at a local restaurant/brewery (hospitality major). The General Manager, let’s call him Josh, was a great guy and I always thought to myself “That’s the kind of guy I want to end up with.” He was very handsome, funny, was very positive and well known in the community. He was also dating this really great girl and they got engaged the summer I was working there. They were everyone’s “relationship goals” because they just seemed like such an awesome couple. I also want to mention here that Josh is ten years older than me, so I never thought I could actually be with him, just wanted someone like him.

Flash forward a year or so when I have a real job out of college and a great new boyfriend, we will call him Will. Also at this point, Josh is married and took a new job. 

Will and I met/were set up by being in our mutual best friends’ wedding. I really wasn’t looking for a boyfriend at the time, but I went out on a limb and reached out to him after we met. He is a super funny guy, had a great job, values his family, we are into the same nerd things together, etc!

At this time Josh and I both end up joining a non-profit board around the same time and through planning some events together I would give him so much shit because his spelling, grammar and punctuation was just TERRIBLE. I am not a stickler about this or anything, but it was just so bad when he was drafting newsletters or invitations. Well, the new job he took is a lot of sales so he asked for my help with his social media pages-again, because his writing was terrible. We would meet to talk about the marketing plan every few months or so over lunch and just catch up and such.

Two years ago we sat down to meet and I asked how his wife was. He said something like, “She’s good…we’re not together anymore though” and I seriously freaked out! At this point they had only been married for about a year and a half. I asked him what happened and he just said that they both had issues they needed to work out and it just wasn’t working. I still remember being so rattled by this for the rest of the day and when I told mutual friends they were also so surprised-again, this was a couple that so many people liked!

So anyway, now about a year ago, Josh is selling his house and looking for a place to live and OF COURSE ends up in my apartment building on my recommendation. We don’t see each other every day or anything, but we do start to notice each other’s’ schedules and such. During this time Josh starts hating his job and starts asking me for help looking for a new gig and with his resume and cover letters.

Eventually we get to a point where Josh is telling me about how he kind of wants to take off on a cross country road trip with the money he made from selling his house and just go find himself. I encourage him and tell him about some resources to look into. I think this is the point where things started to change…we started texting more often, started sitting next to each other in meetings and just overall seeing each other around town and at events more...and texting. A lot. 

At an event earlier this summer Josh meets one of Will and I’s mutual friends and I joke with him about how Josh was always my relationship goals guy and that if I wasn’t with Will I would totally want to be with him. My friend then tells me that I should be with Josh instead of Will. And I can’t stop thinking about that.

I know I’m not explaining this great, but my relationship with Will is really good. Again, we have a lot of mutual friends that we love hanging out with, we always have a good time doing anything and he is always open to doing anything, I get along with his family-his sister’s even asked me to be in their weddings, he has a good job-everything should be great. The problem is that I’ve started this emotional affair with Josh and I don’t want to let it go, but I also don’t know if I should pursue it and lose Will who I am suspicious may be considering proposing to me soon.

Texting is really the devil here because it’s evolved to us texting every day. We text about pop culture, jokes, articles, books, mutual friends, etc. I knew I was in deep shit after I had joined him for a walk with his dog and during the exchange of texts saying thanks for coming it ended with him sending the blowing a kiss emoji. Fuck. 

I feel like I keep telling myself that Josh is 10 years older and it just wouldn’t work. There’s too much life difference that he’s already experienced, different friend gaps… and maybe he’s not mature enough to be with women his own age. I do not know exactly what happened with his ex-wife, but I do know he regrets proposing to her because he did so because he thought he should not because he wanted to. In his words- “It looked good on paper so it should have been fine, I thought.” I am also still helping Josh apply for new jobs, some out of the state. When I’m doing this I am half hoping that he will get the job so I can move on from him and also hoping he doesn’t so we can keep doing whatever we’re doing. 

I’ve only told one person about this, my older brother, and he thinks that I need to figure out what it is that I’m getting satisfaction from in Josh and maybe that it’s something I’m just missing from Will that I could get if I just figured it out. 

When I’m with Will it’s great, but I’m also constantly telling myself “This is good.” When I’m alone, I’m fantasizing about being with Josh. When I’m with Josh I have butterflies in my stomach.

Reddit, please help!

TL;DR: I (25/F) am having an emotional affair with a (36/M) while dating a (26/M). Not sure what to do. 
 
Edit: For the record, it does bother me that Josh knows I'm dating Will and he still does what he does."

6wvb2t,1,2017-08-29,"I am a 21 year-old American, who has contract negotiations that will allow me to move from an intern to full-time position at a Danish company...",mphall17,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6wvb2t/i_am_a_21_yearold_american_who_has_contract/,"So here's the scoop, I am ecstatic about this company I am working for here in the United States that is based out of Copenhagen. I went above and beyond, exceeding both personal and contractual obligations/goals working 40 hours a week for 11 weeks. As an intern, I took a compromised salary for $500 per/month which is well below minimum wage here in the US. After taxes, I'm looking at around $1000 dollars of compensation for my work this summer. However, as I proved my worth I was stoked to be given the opportunity to be hired on as a ""full-time"" employee while I finish my senior year at my university. It came to my attention that those who are making an income under the minimum wage in Denmark are compensated by the government (to a certain degree? I know nothing about this). I'm hoping someone can explain this to me and how I can use this as a point in negotiation as an American who doesn't receive these benefits. 

As a tech start-up, everyone in the company takes a lower rate of pay to invest in the future of the company... and I am excited to be on the ground-floor of something I am both passionate about and feel will be successful. I am not going into the negotiation trying to nickel &amp; dime for every ounce of my work, I am open to the idea of accepting the pay-cut for a company I see the vision for and am happy with. However, I do feel like I am an asset to the team. And with growth now expediting in the US, I am an essential part of the team. Here lies the dilemma:

What is the most fair way to go about expressing my ""all-in"" attitude for this company while still negotiating for a higher (or fair) rate of pay? What price is fair to ask for given the circumstances of the laws in place in Denmark compared to the heavily taxed income in the US (not to say Denmark doesn't have extremely high taxes, more so pointing out the programs they have in place to reimburse them)? Finally, if anyone has any other advice for a young dude's first contract negotiation it would be extremely helpful. 

Thanks :)"

This might be word vomit-y. It started last Wednesday when our neighbor reported us and had our car towed. We bought an old minivan because our Ford can't fit three car seats in it and were just parking it there for one day until the in laws came up to take away the old Lincoln that they left on our drive. People park in our street all the time. The HOA agreement says you can do that if you really need to (if you have family staying over for the weekend etc.) as long as you are reasonable and don't make a habit of it. There's a fucking Toyota constantly parked opposite our driveway that makes it tricky for me to reverse out but I've never complained and it's never been towed away. I just deal. Our minivan wasn't even impeding anyone like that. But our next door neighbor is one of those insufferable people who goes around measuring the residents' grass to report them. She could have come round and warned me first but no, she just has it hauled away at 7am instead. Older son couldn't go to school that day, it was his second week and he was just starting to get used to it. When we got the car back the A/C wasn't working so every time I drive in it with the kids anywhere I'm freaking out that they might overheat. 

Then, worst of all, my husband lost his job on Thursday due to cuts and they gave him one month's severance. He's worked for them for years and gone above and beyond for them; increased their revenue by thousands a month and reorganized their convoluted database but they think an intern will be able to do his job. He has made the job a lot easier with all the work he did. Worked himself out of a job it seems. One month's severance though. fuck. On Friday our mortgage company took out a full month's payment when they are supposed to only take half every two weeks to make it more manageable so after all our bills come out in the next few days we could be left with nothing until I get paid on the 7th. 

Weekend was uneventful but then today I went to Walmart to get older son an after school treat and some lowlife swiped my phone right out of my backpack at the checkout. I let my two year old play his peppa pig game for a while, then he handed it back to me in exchange for some chocolate and I (I'm 95% sure) put it in my backpack right away. I noticed I didn't have it when I got back to the car and I went straight back to the checkout. Cashier shrugged and pointed to CS. I went over there and they shrugged and pointed to the check out. Not five minutes could have passed since I paid for the groceries and they acted like looking at the footage for me just to see what happened (I wasn't expecting them to help me any more than that) was asking for the impossible. Anyway husband (who's out of state at a job interview, so wish he was here to help with this) told me to use the find my phone app so I've been tracking the phone online and it's been going all over town to different housing estates and shops. The thief got on the interstate at one point and last it was working it was showing that it's in a parking lot or in a small field on the north side of town for a few hours but now it's saying the phone cannot be reached. Police said they will check it out when they have the time but obviously that's not going to be a priority, I'm sure hundreds of people report stolen phones everyday. I honestly mostly want my pictures and videos back. I took the best photo ever of my kids all together last week and hadn't uploaded it to the computer yet or sent a hard copy to my parents which is what I was going to do tomorrow. I'm not very good at taking pictures and it was so perfect I was delighted with it :( and now it's likely gone forever. I wish I could drive to where it is and look around but I've got no GPS now and don't know the area. Feel so powerless. "

Would love feedback/support.,MsBerg,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6wvz17/a_ridiculous_situation_that_happened_today_would/,"I am 28/f and I have not lived with my Nmom in almost 5 years. She still, however, constantly tries to force a relationship with me even though it is very clearly non-existent. Our phone conversations last maybe five minutes and it’s mostly me giving one-worded answers about extremely mundane day-to-day stuff. Same goes for texting. I do not elaborate on any details of my life with her anymore. Also, I am almost never the one to reach out to her. It is always the other way around. 


Lately, she has been calling me or texting me almost every day. She goes through these phases. Over the summer, when I wasn’t incredibly busy, I obliged and responded to her pointless texts just to keep her happy. Now, I am finishing my final year of my Bachelor’s degree and I am also doing a Dietetic Internship. I am busy all day and exhausted at night, but still have homework and chores to do. Basically, I am an independent adult trying to live my life.


Today, I received a text from her around 7 AM telling me that she “ate eggs for breakfast and hopefully that will keep her full until lunch.” I was getting ready to head out the door to my internship and didn’t feel a need to respond. I was fully immersed in work all day and didn’t even text my boyfriend until 5 PM when I left. She texted me again around 5:15 PM as I was getting on the highway. My drive is 35 minutes and I figured I would respond when I got home. 


Well, she didn’t give me any time. As I pulled onto my street, she calls me. I ignored it. She calls me again. At this point I’m getting frustrated. I just wanted to get in the house, eat dinner, and relax before having a conversation with anyone. By the time I got into my apartment, I had both my sister and my boyfriend texting me saying that my mom texted them to see if they could get me to respond to her. I was furious. 


I immediately sent her a text saying: “I literally just walked in the door. I’ve had a long and busy day today. Please do not text [boyfriend’s name] or [sister’s name] to get in touch with me because I haven’t talked to you today. It’s barely been 24 hours since we last talked. I am an adult trying to live my life, and I don’t always have the time or desire to text.”


Her response: “A quick text to say hi would have been fine Ashley. You do not live in the best area and I worry.”


My response: “Again, I am an adult who is living her own life. I do not have any obligation to text you. At all. There is absolutely no need to text every single day. Not just to say “hi,” not anything. I am busy and sometimes I just do not feel like talking.”


Her response: “Alright. When you want to talk you can call or text me.”


She also sent a text to my boyfriend apologizing for bothering him and explaining “her side” of things. He showed me the text and it basically was her playing the victim. It is truly appalling to me. The whole situation is just ridiculous.


What do you all make of this? Did I do the right thing standing up for myself in this way? Should I have done something different?


TL;DR: My mom can’t stand when I don’t answer her every time she calls or texts (which is a lot) and I finally stood up for myself today.

I can’t seem to wrap my head around making money doing things I like. I don’t know how to do it. I don’t know how to get my name out there. I hate myself for being so insecure. 
I want to make friends. I don’t know how to do that.

I want to surround myself with successful people, but everybody I meet is just... miserable, or not motivated to do whatever they want to do.

Plenty of kinks come from that. Cheating is thrilling, especially when there's the danger of getting caught. Public sex really gets my motor running, and not semi-public, I want an audience. But it's got to have that I-fucking-want-you-right-now quality to it. I want that primal, urgent, unstoppable lust.

As you may have guessed, these are the rantings of an unfulfilled married man. Everyone wants what they can't have, and for me right now that's passion. So instead I fantasize about meeting the intern in that dark hallway behind the break room, or hate-fucking the bitchy supervisor who loves to show off her tight little body. There comes a point where that's not enough anymore, though.

What I'm looking for: An online friend with benefits. I want to talk about every dirty little thing under the sun. I want to tease you until you can't help but sneak away to the bathroom. I want to swap dirty pictures and audio and video (if you're game for that). But you can't have the benefits without the friend. Bitch about your boss and then we can fantasize about what it would be like to fuck in his office and make a mess of the place. I'll complain about my lack of sleep and you can tell me how you would make me look forward to waking up in the morning.

This is maybe starting to sound more like an online relationship, but that's not really it. I'm just hoping for something casual and fun to take our minds off reality.

Who I'm looking for: If any of this sounds good, then it's probably you. Being married as well gets you bonus points (all the better to commiserate with). Being over 22 would be nice, but exceptions can be made. I don't care about race or body type, as long as you have that passion. Also, please understand that I may disappear for a day or two because of personal and professional responsibilities, and I'll extend you the same courtesy.

So hit me up and let's get to know each other. I'm good with reddit or google or kik, whichever you prefer.

6wwrv1,4,2017-08-30,"I think that I may have a problem, and it scares me. I have no knowledge of resources or how to get help.",throwaway5101592,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6wwrv1/i_think_that_i_may_have_a_problem_and_it_scares/,"I never thought that I would even be questioning if I had a problem with alcohol or not. I never saw my parents have more than 1 or 2 drinks at a time, and they only drank once or twice a week. I never saw them drunk. I rarely drank before I turned 21, and didn't even like the taste that much, and maybe only drank 2 or 3 times a month. I did have a tendency to binge drink at parties, but after becoming violently ill at a party (my roommates debated on whether to take me to the hospital or not) that left me sick in bed for two days after, I stopped binge drinking. Last year when I was in graduate school I rehauled my diet and started exercising and cut alcohol out entirely, and lost 50 pounds. I looked good, felt good, and all was well. Then an eating disorder (bulimia) that I had battled since I was 15 popped back up, and my weight started yo-yoing. 

This summer, after I graduated from grad school, was hell. I was working an unpaid internship, I had stopped purging after an episode of throwing up blood but was still binge eating, was dealing with a diagnosed anxiety disorder that my medication didn't seem to help, was taking more and more of my prescribed Ativan to try to quell the anxiety attacks, stopped exercising and started laying around and sleeping most of my days, stopped seeing friends, and then I re-discovered alcohol. I grabbed a bottle of wine at the store and just intended on having a glass or two with dinner after a day where my anxiety and (probable) depression were particularly bad. But when I drank it, I felt better than I had in weeks- I felt almost happy. I finished the bottle and got very drunk (super low tolerance at this point). The next day I bought beer, and again only intended to have one but ended up drinking the whole pack in one sitting. It's been happening 4ish times a week for several weeks, no more than a couple months. I thought I had it under control- I wasn't totally blacking out, I only did a few stupid things (text people that I was lonely and upset, I think I may have hit myself or something on the legs or run into something because my legs were black and blue the next day). I also noticed that I wasn't going to the same stores to buy alcohol, and had a few that I rotated between so it didn't look like I was drinking so much, which did tip off some alarm bells. This weekend was a binge-fest, with a whole bottle of wine and two six-packs of beers on each of the weekend days, and I decided I needed a break. However, today I was having a bad mental health day, and I actually found myself craving the alcohol, like I needed to get drunk and forget about how bad I felt. I spent all evening pacing my apartment, actually made it halfway to the market to buy beer before turning back. I ate three ice pops to try to make my cravings go away. I didn't drink tonight, but I wanted to- I still want to. This scared me- it really, really scared me. I think I'm developing a problem with alcohol, if not already into a problem. I don't know what to do, who to turn to. I know that alcoholics and those with alcohol problems come from all genders, races, and walks of life, but I sure didn't picture myself among them. I told my parents that I think I ""drink too much"" and was cutting down, but that belittles it. I'm afraid that they would make me come home to better monitor me- I'm about to start my first job, a job that I am very proud to have gotten. I haven't reached the ""bottom"" that I've heard about so much, but I'm really afraid of how quickly my drinking has progressed. I went from drinking nothing back in April to being a pretty damn heavy drinker in August. The weight has piled back on due to the food, alcohol, and lack of exercise, which has given me even more self-loathing and has made the drinking/eating even worse.

Again, I have no clue of what to do or who to turn to, and any advice would be appreciated. I didn't drink tonight, even though I desperately wanted to, and I really am proud of that. "

I am a former military brat (father and everyone in my family have served in the Air Force) who has health issues: half of a heart, scoliosis, depression and anxiety, A.D.D. and a speech impediment, survived breast cancer, had 20 surgeries and endured four deaths. From my life, boys told me I was ugly and would not want to date girls like me who have my health issues or from the military or abusive life style (my parents abuse me and my sister and everyone in my small school knew that). Fast forward to my junior year of high school (I’m currently a senior in college now at Grand Canyon University who will be graduating in April 2018! Go ‘lopes!) where I first fell for a tall (6’5”) senior boy who was trying to go to the Air Force. We met at a summer camp and started talking after we got back. Everything seemed to be okay. He would always come up to me and speak to me; we would always hang out. I was the one who initiated us hanging out. He came to my church party, even though he did not know anyone there. He hung out with only me that night. Then a couple of days later, he invited me to what I thought was a yogurt date. It was not a date. It was the two of us at first, then his friends came and took him, and he made me walk home by myself because the yogurt shop was two minutes from my house. Then after that, I tried to ask him to prom, but he refused to go. Then after that, he invited me to come to his house to meet his family and celebrate that he got accepted to Arizona State’s ROTC program for the Air Force. After that, he stopped talking with me, stopped all physical contacts with me and started pursuing my best friend. Then one day after his graduation, he left without saying goodbye to me, and I had to find out everything like him not liking me from the start and how he was pursuing my friends from one my best friends. It took me two years to get over him, and on Valentine’s Day two years ago, he hits me up saying he is sorry for hurting me and wants to take me to dinner to my favorite restaurant. So I take up his offer for dinner (I mean I am a foodie. I never turn down free food and he knew that) and when we were at dinner, he told me how his best friends hated me and tried to persuade him to go to my best friends and how he dropped out of ASU and the ROTC program. They also told him not to go and apologize to me and how it would make me have feelings for him again. I said that would not happen because he hurt me and I would not wish to take him back in that aspect, but I am willing to be friends again. After that, we went our separate ways. Then one day he mentions his girlfriend now doesn’t like me and how we cannot be friends anymore. Later after eight months, I found out she broke up with him because he kept liking all my Instagram posts and how he tried to comfort me when I did not get accepted into the internship I applied. Fast forward again to eight months ago. I finally got accepted into the Disneyland College Program Internship, and when he found out I was moving, he tried to help me out, but I did not want his help because I was stubborn and wanted to do it myself. Then when I got there, he kept telling me how he was going to try to visit me. Well he did not, and he called me one day asking if he could visit me, but I had to drive ten hours to get him. I did not and cut all ties with him because it was exhausting. Then I started living my life. Then a month ago, before I left, I met someone through a friend. At first, I thought he did not like me, which happens all the time when I meet someone I thought was cute. Then somehow he got my contact number, and we started talking. Then one day he asked me out on a date. We went on our date, and it was okay. He is an awkward army guy. On our date, he took me to dinner, and we went bowling which is something my family is against because the family thing is if you go bowling, you and that person will get married because that was what happened to everyone in my family. After the date, he told me that he was excited that I said yes and how he was nervous. He also stated that he wanted to ask if we could wager during our bowling match: If I win, I will slap him for being late because of car troubles, but if he wins, he will kiss me. He had won the match, so we had kissed twice. After that, we started talking more, but all my friends were telling me to end it with him and how I was stupid for doing this and how I am leaving in a week. So I called it off, but he said that he still wanted to see me before I left and how he will miss me. So I saw him the day before I had to go with some other friends of ours because we all were trying to get together for my last day in California. Throughout that day, he was acting distant and rude towards me, but later that night saying he wished he would have held my hand, put his arms around my waist and kissed me and when he dropped me off how it left weird and nostalgic because he kissed me in front of my apartment. Then he started telling me how he when we first kissed, after I left, he began doing the Carlton dance and had the pleasure of being my first kiss and how he will visit me in Arizona. Then we had started talking again when I got home. He was more flirty than before. Then after his birthday that is when everything changed, he did not seem as flirty as he was. When I asked him if we could make this work and he said that we could not because of distance and if we met up again in the future and we both were single we could start things up again, but that is kind of where I lost my temper and blew up on him. I told him that I’ve been doing distance with my family because every person in my family is in the military. I told him all my best friends are no longer in AZ with me and I do a distance with them. I asked him what he would do if he got stationed somewhere since he is in the army and how that was a cowardly, sorry ass excuse to tell someone with the military lifestyle. Then he replied saying to calm down because I was the first to call things off, how he cried when I broke things off, how he was still willing to see me and how he cried when he could not see his family when he had to go to basic training and how I was overreacting from him now being flirty with me anymore. Then he said that we were friends and how he wanted my ex to stop liking all my photos are Instagram because even though I unfollowed him, he still followed me. Now, that guy I met in California will not return my calls, texts, snap chats but still is friends with me on Facebook, but I noticed he now is being flirty with one of our other friends. I am mad at myself for losing my temper and losing a chance at a second chance with him, but also for getting in the same situation again as I did with my ex. Sorry for the long post and for some parts that probably do not make any sense, but I am at the point where I do not know what to do anymore?"

NOTE: This drama took place at Columbia University, so a ton of the references may fly over your head if you're [retarded](http://www.evergreen.edu/). (What the fuck is ""Shakespeare 1.4/158?"")

**TL; DR:**

Michael goes to bar and drinks coconut water. Sits with two girls. Falls in love with one because she reads David Foster Wallace and looks like Emma Watson. When she leaves, he follows her and tells her he'll wait til dawn at the library steps to meet her. Listens to DFW. Pees in bottle. She doesn’t show. Dude sends 3,500 word essay to Bwog. Slapfights over rape culture and *Anna Karenina* break out in the comments. Then not-Emma shows up in comments. Dude hangs out at steps again later that week. She doesn't show again.

**The Essay**

Putting it here, all of it, for posterity.

&gt; Dear Bwog,

&gt; I need your guys’ help in trying to find the girl I fell in love with (last night at 1020)

&gt; Yes, I’m serious. Yes, I said love. I also know that you laughed at the (last night at 1020) bit in the subject, but I can tell you with all my heart, that doesn’t matter. You can’t control where it happens.

&gt; I swear to God, all of this happened.

&gt; All I know about her is that her name is Kristine.


&gt; If you want to see why you should help me let me tell you the story:

&gt; I met her at the start of the night, around let’s say twelve. I think it’s more romantic if we say it was midnight. By some almost alchemical serendipity a booth had completely opened up and no one was filling it, so I pounced. I looked frantically around for someone to ask to sit so I wouldn’t be kicked out. The two people immediately to my left (I was facing the back of the bar) were facing the bar so I said excuse me loudly and they both turned around. I asked them if they’d sit with me to help me keep from losing the booth. They obliged me with what I genuinely think seemed to be a genuine, empathetic obligingness. I have a very acute sense of awareness about this, since I’m always worried that a girl might be thinking I’m creeping and wishing I’d leave. It’s my one real fear apart from like, you know, death etc..

&gt; But like I said they both seemed to really want to be sitting there, and we started talking. They noticed I was drinking a coconut water (hard to miss in it’s bright, baby-blue bottle). I told them I wasn’t drinking. I told them that I wasn’t here with friends. I told them I’d come here for the same reason I go to the gym. I came here because I’d been stowed away in my room the other fourteen hours of the day, addicted to the internet like everybody else, and not getting nearly enough sunlight or, of course, actual in-person socialization. That’s why I’d come to 1020. To sit ”around” people for an hour or two. I don’t know why this is considered as weird as it is, but let’s be real, it still is (considered weird). People think people at bars alone are drunkards or else creeps and rapists. It’s not fair to people who just want to people watch for an hour to feel less alone. But anyway, like, I digress.

&gt; So like I said I told them the truth, that I was here alone and I really appreciated them helping me save the booth, and they really did seem to smile genuinely at that, and that felt good. We talked about the usual things for a while. The one on the right was named Kristine, and so was the one on the left. This felt somehow serendipitous to me, as I am particularly bad with names. We talked about this, which led to a talk about social conventions and neuroses thereof, which led to a talk about J.D. Salinger and David Foster Wallace for fuck’s sake (sorry). She speaks French.

&gt; Pretty soon after that we’d gotten into a conversation about modern celebrity worship and general cultural decay etc. When Kristine (on the right) says of Kristine (on the left), “People always say she looks like Emma Watson.”

&gt; Now let me tell you a quick little aside here, because it’s important. When I was about eleven my father brought home a book for me from a business trip to England. He said all the kids there loved it. Within five pages I knew why. Ever since, I’ve been a Potterhead. Not in a like, unhealthy way or anything, I just really love the books. Fastforwarding a bit because this is a long story, I’ve had an imaginary little celebrity crush on Hermione Granger since I was around 12.

&gt; So when Kristine (on the right) said that about, I was looking down. When she said it I looked up at Kristine (on the left). Something happened right then that’s never happened in my life before. It was like the way a tiny pebble dropped into perfectly still water will make these beautifully subtle little ripples. It was like that, from her forehead out across her face, and then almost just sort of generally around her facial/headular area, almost like a (yes) an aural glow; A, dare I say it, a halo. It’s just as simple as that. In under half a second she went from being a beautiful girl to the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen. I genuinely mean that. For the 18 hours since I last saw her face I have been wracking my brain for a girl whose face I loved more. I haven’t been able to do that. She has this gorgeous, like, alabaster skin that looks as soft/gently-touchable as a bar of soap. I immediately transposed an image of Audrey Hepburn’s face onto Emma Watson’s and created a minds-eye’s average. Kristine’s face was a perfect match.

&gt; I realized immediately that something big was happening. It felt like my chest and stomach suddenly got really hot; almost like the seat of a car-cushion warmer when you crank the dial suddenly. I swear to God, I swear, the first thought that floated through my head was Shakespeare 1.4/158. I’m serious.

&gt; When this happened I got a sort of somnolescent jaw-drop face for half a second, then immediately sat back against the cushion at my back, taking a deep breath. Kristine did not see this, but Kristine (on the right) did, and got this weird smile. All I said was “something big just happened inside me just [sic] now.” She gave me this, like, tiniest of smiles that made me believe she understood. For the rest of the night, it seemed like she was encouraging Kristine to dip her toe into feeling the same way. I hoped she would, because since the ripple-in-the-pond thing I hadn’t been able to look at her hair without wanting to touch it badly.

&gt; So I tried to play it cool, which I didn’t really manage. Like I did externally, because I only said a tenth of what I felt, but even that tenth was enough to be a little freaky. Engrossing, I know it because they stayed and listened, but still, like, a lot. I could see that face on Kristine’s face for a while.

&gt; After a while we went out because they needed to use the A.T.M. and I needed to buy another coconut water. While I was standing in the back of the small little convenience store, trying to find one in the fridges there, I could have sworn I heard overheard a snippet of their conversation up at the front of the room. I know it’s wrong to eves-drop, but I could have sworn I heard them say “more profound and philosophical conversation than…”). I could have sworn I heard it, and I was jubilant because I felt the same way. She was so fucking smart. It made my gut feel very strange.

&gt; As we walked back towards the bar Kristine (on the right) mentioned that their friends had arrived. I said great, ”mind if I join you guys?” and was kind of thrown off when they didn’t answer immediately, I admit. I looked at Kristine and could have sworn I saw some kind of vague discomfort flash across the face, at least the side that I could see.

&gt; When we got back in, they went to the bar to get their beers and I told them I’d be standing in the back, by the big couch-type-thing. I stood there for a while and watched them get their beers and then walk back toward the pool table and stop there, watching the game. Ok, I thought, they’ll come back over eventually. I noticed that they’d started talking to two guys. They were bother very tall and had thicker arms than me. The one in the grey sweater talking to Kristine was crew-cutted, blonde, and of formidable size. I started to feel nervous, angsty, I admit it. Finally, after I’d say ten minutes, I walked over. The bar was still very crowded and the only way I could get over to them was to go around the crowd via the bathroom-side of the room. I did this and walked up to their group to the Kristines’ backs (the two new guys’ backs facing the pool table). I said “Hey.” and got no response. I said it a little louder and Kristine looked back ever so slightly, making the littlest of contact out the sides of her eyes, and just sort of nodded her head. I felt my stomach plummet and my back stiffen. I immediately turned, suppressing a cringe, and said out loud “I am so embarrassed, I’m going home.” I think that I saw Kristine (on the right) overhear me.

&gt; Now a lot of things happened over the next half-hour or so. I’ll try to keep it short, because I know we’re running long. I sat at the other end of the bar with two very kind girls who listened to me tell them the story I’ve just told you. They seemed genuinely moved. So much so that when one of them had to go to the bathroom and I realized I did too, I went back there with her and tried (subtly) to point out Kristine to her, as she’d been dying to know. I finally managed too. I was done before her so I headed back first. She got back about five minutes later and told me that the Kristine’s looked engrossed in conversation, she couldn’t tell what about. I sat with them for a few minutes, moping out loud to their condolences. Then I said “fuck, I really want to go back over there.” I wanted to so badly. But I couldn’t bear the thought of freaking Kristine out by “clinging” or “creeping”, the two most shameful things a man can be. I felt torn.

&gt; I finally relented, under their enthusiastic stream of encouragement, and got up to make my way to the back of the bar as best I could, having to navigate a tetris-game of bodies along the bar to get there. I met her near the back, heading the other way (i.e. out), and my heart began to sink. We made eye contact, at which I bowed my head sadly and stood aside to let them by. Kristine(on the right) was leading and as she pulled Kristine past I said “Hey,” and they stopped and she looked back and I just looked her in the eye and said “I’m really glad I met you” and then let her go. I stood there for a minute or so. Then I turned around and looked at her boyfriend-type-guy, the one in the grey sweater. I don’t know what came over me but I looked him straight in the eye and said loudly, just shy of argumentatively, “Listen, man. I’m the guy who just fell in love with your girlfriend over there in that booth. It hurts like fuck that you exist but even so, I’m still happy in a way as long as she’s happy. So what I’m telling you now is, do not fuck that up. She is fucking perfect.” And he looked like he’d got hit on the head sort of and by the time he came to I was already walking the other way.

&gt; I sat back down with the girls (the ones in the front). And watched Kristine andKristine (on the right) stand out by the payphones in front of the bar, facing the window, Kristine on the left, and Kristine (on the right) on the right. They were talking animatedly about something. This went on for five minutes or so. After that the two guys passed and joined them. They, too, were talking about something animatedly. This went on for about eight minutes over which I noticed that the two groups, Kristine (on the right) on the right and Kristine on the left, and Kristine’s guy on the left, talking to Kristine with his back turned towards me, and Kristine (on the right)’s guy on the right talking to Kristine (on the right) with his back facing me too.

&gt; Got that? So like I said they were drifting apart, the two pairs. And like I said, after about eight minutes the two guys left and the two girls stayed. The two girls talked animatedly for another minute or so, and then started to walk away.

&gt; The two girls and I, who had been watching this all unfold through the window, saw Kristine and Kristine (on the right) look back inside for like one second at which I stood up and I could tell they saw me, and I could see that Kristine (on the right) had smiled. I sat back down as they walked away. I hung my head in front of the two girls. Then I said I loved her. I said it, almost muttered it, more to myself than to the two girls. I realized what I said and said it again properly.

&gt; Something you should know, I have never said that word. I have never said it because I had never felt it ‘till tonight, like not even to my parents. I know that sounds fucked up, but it’s true and I’ll tell you why. The test that I’ve come up with to judge whether it’s love is to ask yourself whether if the amount you feel, like the feeling you are testing, turned out to be the best it gets, true true love, the top of the pile, cream of the crop 100% pure good-stuff. The rapidly, violently habit-forming kind of druggy love. That is what I think of it as, and I have never felt that, until tonight.

&gt; I stood up, grabbed my coat, and told the girls that I was going after her. I ran out the door. Kristine and Kristine (on the right) were about twenty yards away, walking with Kristine on the left and Kristine (on the right) on the right. I asked them to wait up. I jogged up to them. I said “Kristine can I talk to you for a minute.” She said Okay and Kristine (on the right) said they were going to the Heights. I asked if I could walk with them. Kristine dropped back and we walked maybe ten feet behind Kristine (on the right). I think she may have been pretending not to overhear us, as I was saying most of the stuff I’m about to say pretty loud.

&gt; I told her that I knew this was a lot, maybe too much to take in. I told her I knew that and felt the same way in my way. But I told her that I also felt like maybe, possibly, was just this infinitesmal little possibility that this really is what we think it is but can’t say out loud because it’s crazy and would sound insane. I told her that if she didn’t believe that, she was being arrogant. I told you we had talked about David Foster Wallace, so I told her to think of fish, and water, and about the fact that the most obvious realities around us, the ones that we automatically believe, are often totally wrong, and even more problematically, hardest to see when they are wrong. I told her that I understood that even though every experience she’d had so far has led her to the conclusion that what I am suggesting is impossible in the “real” world, that no one lives in a romcom, that I’m just being crazy, I told her to think about whether she really was 100%, absolutely certain. I asked her to think about Fish and Water.

&gt; By now we’d reached 111th and Broadway on the Duane Reade side and we stopped for a minute because I said that I was going to the steps. They were going to the Heights. I asked her, Kristine, directly if she wanted to go to the steps.Kristine (on the right) looked at her and Kristine said she maybe wanted to go to the steps. Kristine (on the right) said they were going to the Heights. I asked Kristine if she’d come meet me later if I waited. She said maybe. I said I’d wait until sunrise. They walked towards 1020 and I walked to the steps.

&gt; When I got there, I took out my ipod, put on the twenty-minute audiobook I have on there called “This is Water” by David Foster Wallace, and spent the next five hours or so contemplatively pacing, or sitting. This became slightly problematic when I needed to pee, as I couldn’t leave the steps in case she came, but fortunately I’d brought along my empty watter-bottle from before so I peed in that twice during the night. As I paced back and forth on the step in front of Alma Mater, I thought about fish, and water, and about how every time I’d asked a girl to take a chance, to try to take a leap of faith across that mental block that the real world is exactly as it seems, every single time, they hadn’t showed. I’d waited on this step or some version a hundred times before. But I’d never waited past when I wanted to stop waiting.

&gt; Tonight I did. I waited the whole night, walking twenty-paces back and forth between a sign who’s blank back was turned to me and an empty (believe me, I checked) packet of Marlboro lights laying on the ground. It was twenty steps precisely, I counted many times. I was soon able to walk, turn, walk turn, with my eyes closed, so I would get into this like sort of trance, just walking and thinking about fish and water. Trying with all my heart to believe, genuinely believe, that she was going to show up. Over the course of the night I had a few pleasant distractions. People passing by; two public safety officers, a few bands of ID-less freshman, wanted to know why I was walking back and forth. When I told them I was waiting for a girl they always wanted to know why and so I told them. They all said it was amazing, they all said they were on my side. Something funny happened about halfway through. I mentioned up above that I stayed past wanting to, and that’s true. My hands were numb and I was shivering terribly. But I stayed, not because I wanted to but because I realized that if she did show up (and by this point I’d convinced myself she’d show up right at dawn), I couldn’t bear the thought of disappointing her by being gone.

&gt; She never came. Around 6:30 I walked home. This morning was awful. I was very sad, but thankfully I slept all day. This afternoon I thought a lot. I thought about serendipity and hope and delusion, but most of all about work. About how people always say it takes work, doesn’t just happen. So that is why I am crazy enough right now to ask you guys to put this up, so that she might see it.

&gt; And make no mistake, I know that this is crazy. I know that what I’m talking about is crazy, and that I’m crazy for going on this manic, pie-in-the-sky romance rave about it. I know that it’s selfish to say this. It’s selfish because to believe in the kind of serendipity I’m talking about, that movies can happen in real-life essentially, is to be deeply self-involved in it’s own tiny little way. But it also is what made me stand out there all night shivering and not feeling my hands while the sky slowly lightened.

&gt; So, to the Bwog Staff, is there any way that you could put this up in the hopes that she might see it?

&gt; And, to Kristine, I will be sitting on the step in front of Alma at noon on Tuesday. If you see this, and if you change your mind, you’ll know where to find me. And just fair warning, if you do show, we’re doing a dramatic Notebook in the rain style first kiss. I’m not kidding around. Don’t come if you’re not up for that. I’ll be sad but understand if you don’t. Still, I hope you do.

**The Comments**

Homeboy himself shows up:

&gt; My name isn't Robert and hers isn't Kristine. Mine is Michael. I will be waiting on the steps at noon though, just like I said. I'm not asking for the world here, just whether you'd like to go for a walk with me. -Michael

Homeboy defends himself:

&gt; This'll be my last comment here and I want to keep it brief because (a) 3500 words seems plenty self-indulgent enough, and (b) it feels unforgivably narcissistic to even be here, reading the comments. But, there are a few points that seem to've come up a lot that I'd like to (briefly) address:

&gt; (1) For those of you offended by the creepiness, I'm sorry and I'm not. I was trying to push buttons, I admit it, and even though the responses seem polarized, both kinds seem very strong, which makes me happy.

&gt; (2) Re my mental health/people worrying; please don't! I wrote this mostly to write it, and I really don't want you to worry.

&gt; (3) Re the bad grammar; I know, and I'm very sorry. I should have proofed this after writing it fast and furious, but I didn't. I counted seven on the one reread I did, but there're probably more. Again, sorry.

&gt; (4) Re the DFW (RIP) obsessiveness; your accusations are warranted. It's not really my fault though, I just read IJ for the first time this semester.

&gt; (5) Re last paragraph and creepiness thereof; I totally agree. Adding that was the minor edit referred to in the title. I immediately regretted it after sending. Trying to be funny, but I guess the joke fell flat. Oh well, no one bats .1.

&gt; (6) Re Tuesday/if I'm serious. Yes, totally! I'm currently reckoning odds of her showing up around the 20-30% mark, which is pretty good! If she doesn't that's ok (again, hope that relaxes you mental-health worriers). If that's what happens I'm going to eat a strong brownie, get on my train home and break out Anna K. I'm going to be just fine. If she does shoe, I'm probably going to kiss her and then ask her to go for a walk.

&gt; Okay, that covers it! Thanks again for reading guys. Hope you all have a great Thanksgiving. -Michael

But one commenter, CC'13, is not amused. I can't link to individual comments, but ctrl+F will lead you to the threads:

&gt; Congratulations for perpetuating the rape culture at Columbia, where girls who obviously aren't interested in guys are subjected to entire theses written by these creeps who can't take a fucking hint. All of you who think this is ""cute"": you sicken me.

and this (this one actually starts a long argument worthy of TrollX, I strongly encourage you to ctrl+F it):

&gt; The fact that ANYONE would ever think this is ""cute"" is proof that we live in a rape culture. A man experiences what he calls ""love at first sight"" and writes a fucking thesis about a girl he barely knows that showed little to no interest in him, waits for her in the cold for five hours, and we tell him that it's romantic? Give me a fucking break. If I were that poor girl I'd be terrified of running into him for the rest of my days at Columbia because this creep clearly doesn't know how to take even the largest of hints.

Then **the girl shows up in the comments.** Shut up ye of little faith, this is definitely her.

&gt; Hi Michael,

&gt; I think I might be Kristine. But, I can’t be sure.

&gt; I could ask you this directly (as it seems that you sent me a Facebook message and friend request the other day), but I thought I might offer my own contribution now that Bwog is involved and there is a potential stake out at Low. Hopefully you can confirm if I am or am not Kristine.

&gt; I met a Michael this past Friday at 1020. You were bad with names- you asked me mine three times. We talked about DFW. You recited Hamlet’s soliloquy. I speak French. You were drinking coconut water. We talked about celebrities, social media, and archiving Tweets. You told me that this was the craziest day of your life because you had somehow ended up talking to me (actually a wonderful line). You asked for my phone number as we set to part ways, but then I left with my formidably sized, blond, crew cut boyfriend (who was wearing a shirt and tie, not a sweater). 

&gt; And that is where the similarities stop.

&gt; On one hand I would like to believe that I (maybe) was the source of inspiration for some details of a creative writing piece. Another part of me wants to think that I am in no way involved in this- that you went to 1020 on Saturday and this fantastical, neurotic scenario did in fact unfold as you have described. And, finally, I see this as possibly being a composite piece- with lamentations about that Friday night of things left unsaid, actions undone and unfulfilled desires all elaborately interposed with past rejections and fictitious events.

&gt; Of course, no one ever expects the author to reveal his true motivations. However, it would be nice to have my status as Kristine confirmed (my roommates have already taken to calling me “Kristine on the right”). If I am indeed Kristine then I am flattered to have served as a source of inspiration for this piece.

&gt; Lastly, I am not available at noon tomorrow (I have my internship from 9-6). This makes me unavailable for any dramatic Hollywood kiss reenactments (also, still have that boyfriend, who is a wonderful conversationalist himself), walks in the park, coffee dates, book readings, kite flying, bike riding, mud wrestling, etc. So, please, don’t commit to another block of hours on the steps. And, please, don’t pee in any more coconut water bottles.

Other gems from the comments:

&gt; I couldn't help but marvel about how insensitive people can be. [...] Has ""Romeo and Juliette"", ""The Great Gatsby"" or ""Anna Karenina"" taught you nothing?

&gt;&gt; I think these have taught us that when a guy becomes overly obsessed with what he sees as his transcendent and timeless love for you, you GETDAFUQAWAY before the body count starts racking up

**Dénouement**

Two days later, Robert or Michael or whatever he's calling himself shows up on the steps of Alma. [Yes, really](http://bwog.com/2012/11/20/love-story-on-the-low-steps/). There are even pics as proof! She doesn't show up, and he tears the rose up and leaves the petals at the base of the statue. Tells a bystander he'll be fine, and that he's gonna eat a hash brownie, read ""Anna Karenina,"" and catch the train home. *Spoiler alert: Mentioning Anna Karenina and trains in the same sentence is concerning.*"
6wzfkr,4,2017-08-30,I'm gonna try to get her back and I needed to tell someone.,fightingback3,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6wzfkr/im_gonna_try_to_get_her_back_and_i_needed_to_tell/,"My[25M] situation :
 
 - Was in a 11 year relationship that was great for a long time, but the last moments were pretty messy. Didn't give her[25F] enough attention, she didn't talk to me, so we distanced from each other. 
 - Recently (-1mo) she sat down with me and told me the typical sentence ""I love you, I'm not in love with you"". We broke up on the spot,  and she went with someone that she developed feelings for, even though she insisted ""it was not about him, it was about her"". 
 - I took it very hard. I'm currently not at home because of an internship, she came with me to support me because it was gonna be a very rough patch (very intense job) and when she left I took it all in. My work was shit, I couldn't hold my tongue, I said dumb shit to her that I regret.
 - I took the decision to block her to stop myself from saying things I'd regret any longer. 
 - She's coming back to the Airbnb I'm staying at on Sept. 8 (in 9 days) and we're leaving back home the day after. 

And yeah, as the title says, I've decided to get her back. This is probably a shit decision, but it's one I'm truly feeling good about. I know her, I know she's as conflicted about this as I am, and I think we deserve a shot at this again. Which is why, on September 9, after we get back to OUR place, the place we've been living in for the last 2 years, I'm gonna get her to sit down, and have a long conversation about why I think our relationship could start again and she could get her feelings back, slowly but surely. 

I'm also ready to react to what happens next :

 - If she says yes, I know it's not gonna suddenly save our relationship. We're gonna start slow, just as two roommates, go on dates, try to do this all over again. Of course, I'll ask her to break it up with him, though. I'm not gonna jump her, we're probably gonna sleep on separate bedrooms, etc. Nice and slow. And we're gonna make sure we work on the things we didn't like about our relationship when it ended.

 - If she says no, I'm gonna ask her to go live at her friend's place. Initiate no contact for a while, let her live her life and probably go back to join her new lover. 

The things I want and need to do during these 9 days before she appears back : 

 - Get my shit together. I need to be SURE of what I want and what I say and I need to be convincing. This is probably gonna be the most important talk of my 20s and I am NOT failing it. Make a list of the things I didn't like about us, and the things I think I was doing wrong, and how I think we can change it. Show her something new, not a depressed zombie stuck in our previous life. 

 - Get my life together. Life is gonna keep going. If she definitely leaves me, I need to be ready to take it. If she stays, I need to be ready to be a better man with her. Any way, I need to learn to live for myself again. Go out with my colleagues, have fun. Take up a new hobby. Get my mind off things. Heal my mind.

So this is it, Reddit. I'm doing what every guide says not to do. I'm gonna try to get her back, but not before trying to become a better man. 

Shit, I'm so nervous. "

So far I've been working by making changes and additions to Lenet and the person in charge of me (I'm an intern) told me not to use pooling layers because it would reduce the accuracy of the network.

After many iterations of the network, I managed to get an euclidean loss of 1.7 at best. Today I've tried reintegrating the pooling layers from Lenet as a test and my loss has actually improved to 1.6. [Here's the network architecture](https://i.imgur.com/yGLadVE.png).

Do you have any idea as to why that may be? I had in mind from cs231 (I think) that pooling layers did not affect the ability of the network to locate something on the image, but I can't remember why nor do I understand why I actually achieve a better loss this way."
6x0itg,118,2017-08-30,[Update] My dad punched me in the face earlier tonight,Tawny_Harpy,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6x0itg/update_my_dad_punched_me_in_the_face_earlier/,"Hey everybody, 

So Sunday evening my dad punched me in the face after I asked him to talk to my older brothers about cleaning the upstairs bathroom, as my nephew had peed all over the floor and toilet and my niece's bath stuff was everywhere and I was constantly kicking it or knocking it over. 

I left that night to go sleep at my best friend's with my dog. Then I moved to a motel room with my dog Monday evening. I took my dog back to the house Tuesday morning, and I decided leaving him there would be best for him. It was less stressful for him than being in a motel room with me. I'm not worried about him hurting my dog. 

My mom has been texting saying it's okay for me to come home, but I'm in the motel room until Thursday. Friends have been buying me food and keeping me company via text, FaceTime, or visiting. They know how my depression is. 

My face is a sore reminder, my nose still hurts and I have light bruising under my right eye, and I don't feel like I'm ready to go home. Since Monday my mom showed me texts saying my dad is worried about me and has been asking when I'll come home. She also said that my dad wants to have a family meeting, which adds to me not wanting to go home since I know it'll just be us standing there while he blames me for everything that happened. He won't apologize. 

Isn't it funny how it's always our fault? All of my friends say I need to just move out, but I can't hold down a job with my school schedule. I'm busy six days a week. I've tried getting jobs but often even my weekends are eaten up with my internship and homework. I frequently get three hours of sleep before having to be up really early. 

I don't feel like I'm ready to go home, but I'm also out of options after Thursday morning. I skipped class today (major bad idea but by the time I woke up, was good to drive, and would have been ready I wouldn't have been to class until it was halfway over due to traffic) because I woke up and just felt awful. Not like sick awful but depressed awful. 

I just want something to change but I know nothing ever will. I read all the stories on here of people getting out, finding SOs to help them, finding a friend's family to help them, all of this stuff but then I look at my own life and realize I don't have miracles like everybody else. Everything I have, I've had to fight for. I know if I stop doing stuff around the house, become the ungrateful bitch they want me to be, it'll get worse. I think they've also realized that if they kick me out, I'm not completely on my own so their plan to make me suffer through homelessness didn't work. 

I've also realized how little my family cares about me, and also how selfish they are. I let my brothers use my car constantly, especially if my oldest brother needs stuff for his baby girl. I leave the last whatever of somebody's favorite food is so they'll have something to enjoy at the end of the day. I don't use the washing machine or dryer until it's absolutely necessary so it's open for my family to use. I stay in my room because I know they don't like having me around. I babysit all the time. 

But I think I'm done doing that kind of stuff. They say I never ask for anything, I just demand stuff all the time. Usually by the time I'm angry and upset and ""demanding"" stuff, it's because I've already asked so many times before and nothing was done. Nothing changed. So I get angry and upset and then punched in the face. 

My mom told me she's in therapy because she's hit her breaking point. She isn't the one who needs therapy, it's my dad. I don't even think that would help though. He has no desire to be a better person because he thinks he's already a fantastic person. He isn't and he never will be. 

You don't hurt the people you love. So why do people who say they love me keep hurting me? "

- The program offers afternoon classes for working professional as I plan to have a full-time job while attending school part-time.

- No GRE tests since I'm from a UC and have more than 3.0 GPA.

- Located in my hometown.

About Me:

- 3.3 GPA, one internship in telecom industry, no research experience.

- My internship offers me a position to work with them after graduation, but the company is out of state and I want to pursue a master's right after my bachelor's degree so I have not given them answer yet.

My questions are:
- Is the MSEE program at SJSU ABET accredited?

- What are the best specialization in term of job aspect?

- How important is the Statement of Purpose? Is there any guideline for engineering program?

- Did you find the program helpful in your career advancement? I know the research aspect is not great, but I've never done researched as an undergrad.

- I'm also debating between MSEE and MS Comp E since I like programming (but have very little experience). Would it be difficult to switch if I get admitted?

We're in the position where our university students need InDesign (and Illustrator and PS), but just for the semester (4 months). However, there's no way to get a monthly student subscription for Adobe CC, and our IT department has not been helpful. 

We're also moving away from designing a new computer lab with 20 work stations to a more collaborative space with 7-8 computers to facilitate teamwork. We want students to be able to bring their laptops and tablets to class.

I've suggested Scribus, but the other faculty are resistant because InDesign is the industry standard, and our students are in internships and getting jobs that use InDesign.

I think that if we could speak to the team, we might possibly move to Scribus.

Any help would be appreciated."
6x0wpd,3,2017-08-30,I hate accounting classes and have little interest in staying in accounting long term. Is there any hope I could pass the CPA?,accstudenthrowaway,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6x0wpd/i_hate_accounting_classes_and_have_little/,"I am currently a senior accounting major. I have already accepted an audit position beginning next fall. I chose to major in accounting because I did not know what I wanted to do, but wanted something stable and lucrative. I am someone who really enjoys school and learning, but have definitely enjoyed my accounting courses the least of any class I have taken in college. Sometimes they are a bit boring but manageable, but at other times (about 75%) they are so boring it feels like torture. I have had many doubts about this career path, but have managed decent grades and did well at my internship so I have stuck with it and accepted a job offer.

I did my internship in audit and it was fine. I am comfortable with doing audit for a few years but am quite sure I don’t want to be a career auditor. At this point I am interested in becoming a market research/product analyst, or a pursuing similar careers in marketing analytics. I know I can make it through my classes and work in audit for a few years before moving on, the issue is that I am not sure if I will be able to pass the CPA.

I find accounting class material to be incredibly boring, and have a lot of difficulty focusing and motivating myself to study– to the point where I had an ADHD evaluation last semester. Turns out I don’t have ADHD; I am just really bored by accounting! I have made it through my classes fine, but I am really unsure about being able to make it through the CPA. I always do terribly and start spacing out when doing Becker and Wiley CPA practice questions. I am a fairly smart person, and am regularly quite motivated and a hard worker, but really struggle to stay focused and motivated in accounting. 

The company that I have accepted a position at expects that everyone has their CPA or is working towards it, so it seems like I won’t be able to escape the CPA while I am working there. 

Has anyone disliked accounting and really struggled with staying motivated, but been able to pass the CPA exam? Any other advice or input is appreciated.

TLDR; I am a student who strongly dislikes accounting and has trouble staying focused and motivated in acc classes– particularly when doing CPA practice questions. I have accepted a job an as auditor, which I plan to use as a stepping stone to gain experience before moving on to another career. The department I have accepted a job with expects me to become a CPA, but I am concerned about this because of my lack of motivation and concentration. "

Because I'm only going into the second year of computer science, I didn't think anything would come of the internship other than experience. However, I guess they really liked me, enough to the point where they want to hire me as a technical support engineer, with a very likely chance to be hired on a full blown software engineer (making around 70k starting) within a year. The thing is, I'm also building a (rather extensive) web application for my parents right now that's taking about 10-15 hours a week from me. I can do school, and my parent's program, or this job offer, and my parents program, but I can't do all three. I just wouldn't have time. So I'm thinking then of stopping school and taking the job offer. I mean, I would save a lot of money on school, but that also means I wouldn't get my degree. I just really don't know what to do.

Edit: The job I was offered normally requires a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field, if that's any help.

Edit2: If I did take this job, it would allow my spouse to go back to school and get her masters, something she really wants."

6x1tap,9,2017-08-30,It's Not Like it Used to be,ponderwander,AirBnB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/6x1tap/its_not_like_it_used_to_be/,"I began hosting on Airbnb around 2010 until 2013. SO and I rented out a mud room in my 1 br apartment for a low price and had 5 star reviews. We spent lots of time responding to messages from our prospective guests. Since it was our home we liked having some say in who stayed with us, not just allowing anyone with money to book. Our house was clean, cute and we did the best we could to be approachable hosts. When we traveled we had similar interactions with our hosts and enjoyed using Airbnb. We also made enough money to cover rent and expenses since I was doing a full time unpaid internship and I didn't have extra time to work more hours, which basically got me through grad school. All in all it was a good experience. Then we took a nice long break, moved a couple of times, and bought a house. 

Fast forward to now in a new city and we can hardly book our room, an *actual room* for more than $25/night, which is unreasonably (why even bother?!) cheap, IMO. In order to have a good ranking in the searches we need to turn on instant book and smart price (whatever it's called) which changes the cost based on an algorithm. Since this is our home and we aren't interested in allowing any rando with an Airbnb profile stay here, we don't want to turn on the instant booking. We want to have at least a small say in who will be sharing space with us. Now, we are pretty equal opportunity-- a biracial lesbian couple. We are not afraid of diversity so while I understand that Airbnb is trying to prevent discrimination it really disadvantages hosts who are renting a room vs. someone who owns 5 vacation properties and doesn't care much who stays there since they will barely interact with them. 

We traveled a bit this summer and found that the selection of Airbnb's was... lacking. Prices have all skyrocketed to near-hotel levels. One place we stayed in was so jankorific that it literally had a wrench on the sink where the cold water lever should have been. I had to turn the cold water on *with a wrench.* In addition, the bed was propped up on one side because the frame was broken. When my SO, a small woman climbed in bed whatever it was propped on fell over. It also just seemed dingy and dark and I was constantly scared a large roach was going to scurry from a corner somewhere. And this place, though in Miami proper was not exactly in a great neighborhood. And it was still almost $100/night. Obviously, we were super eager to get the hell out of there. 

Later on that same trip we checked into another place in the Keys and it was the most broke-down pathetic apartment. The host was working in a bait shop downstairs (super classy!) and in order to access the apartment we had to walk up some dark stairs that were coated in algae from the window a/c units dripping. The apartment itself was incredibly shitty and filthy. Dead bugs, grime and dirt, mildew. It was disgusting. Upon check in we were required to sign a document that said the unit was clean and in good working condition... And it was almost $150 a night for that dump. We called Airbnb and noped out of there as soon as she left with her stupid form. 

We also stayed in a cute little motel through Airbnb. I mention this because it was an actual motel, not someone's house. It was basically a bunch of small bungalows with a business name and everything. Definitely not in the spirit of Airbnb at all and clearly a business using the Airbnb platform to boost their occupancy. It was fine as far as the stay goes, except the water reaked of sulphur and stunk up the whole room. We tried to keep the bathroom door closed to minimize it but as soon as someone took a shower it reaked like boiled eggs all over again. Also $150/night. 

I dunno, y'all. I'm feeling like my run with Airbnb is coming to an end. We have had such a shit time as guests lately where the prices are so damn high and the quality of the place is just astroundingly bad, and as hosts we basically can't get any bookings despite having 40 5 star reviews for our other property and from times we have stayed as guests. 

Previously when we hosted and someone would try and book they would send a nice message introducing themselves and giving us some details about who would be coming, what they were coming for and expressing excitement about our place/staying with us. Just yesterday I got a booking request and the message literally said ""moving transition"" with no other details. They were booking for two people and couldn't even be bothered to introduce the second person. I dunno. It just seems like things have changed on this platform and not for the better. I thought it filled a nice niche and I'm sad to see it get watered down with bad listings and non-communicative guests. 

Anyone else have similar experiences?"

I am having so much trouble with this and my personal statement it's incredible. I don't have a final paragraph just yet but would like some solid feedback on how to tie it all in. 




Here's a rewrite - any thoughts?

During my high school years, financial crisis uprooted my life. It began with constant disconnection of our utilities and resulted in the foreclosure of our home. The sting of embarrassment my sister and I felt while using a Jack in the Box restroom sink to wash up before school still lingers. However, I will never forget the tears that streamed down my mother’s face as we exited our driveway for the last time. My heart ached as I witnessed the falling of my hero but during our struggles, I loved her even more.  I admired her strength and resilience during these times and I love her for passing these qualities on to me.

This was the first time I had lost the place I called home, but in that moment I was able to empathize with my mother and her journey in the United States.  My mother was born just two weeks after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. Ten years later she, her seven siblings, and their young parents fled their home in Cuba to arrive as refugees in the United States. My family left everyone they loved and were unable to see them for decades, many of whom they never saw again. 

For as long as I can remember, Christmas has been an exceptionally joyous time for my family to come together. However, for my usually playful and loving grandfather (whom I call Papi), it is a somber time. He would go to bed early and interact us in limited amounts. If he showed signs of his normal self, telling hilarious jokes and stories, his eyes told of an inner sadness. When I was twelve years old, I asked my mother why Papi was such a Grinch during the holidays. She explained to me that his mother passed away on Christmas several years after moving to the United States. Papi never got the chance to say goodbye to his mother, nor go to her funeral. I never again thought of my grandfather as a Christmas Grinch again. 
 
Growing up as the child of a Cuban immigrant in California, I felt different amongst my peers. Most of my friends in high school had family in Mexico or the Philippines and often spent time visiting with their relatives. Unfortunately, my family could not.  It was important for my family to embrace American life without losing who we were. and I felt special because of my heritage. I was the friend that could dance salsa like no one else and would amaze them with the powers of a tiny cup of Cuban coffee. 

My family brought over a defining characteristic of our culture to the United States; the expectation of women to be the caretakers of the family and the home. At family gatherings, I faced a similar theme in conversations with my elders. I must have heard my grandmother ask me a hundred times in Spanish, “Mimita, when will you get married and bring more grandbabies to the family?” I knew how important family in America was to us. However, losing my home in high school and witnessing the strife of the women around me showed me what I wanted to do with my life. I knew it was up to me to get an education, establish a career for myself, and break the mold set before me. 

In college, I paid for almost everything with either grant or loan money through financial aid, yet I still worked part-time to make ends meet. I assumed that this was the case for most of the people around me, but quickly learned that I was mistaken. I discovered that many parents set up college funds for their children and helped prep them years in advance for college. I couldn’t help but feel envious of those with such privileges. Until then, most of the people in my proximity had only ever aspired to community college, if that. No one I knew graduated from high school and went on to study at a university. Without academic role models or guidance, most of my journey to law school has been filled with giant leaps of faith, guided mostly by my own initiative and desire to succeed. 

One of the first experiences that helped establish myself academically was an internship program my college offered in Washington, D.C. I arrived on Capitol Hill feeling like an underdog. I saw how in a lot of ways,  my background made me different than the people around me. I was the only intern in our group who came from a state school and found myself having to catch up in order to stand out amongst my peers. I spent my free time scouring through material from the Library of Congress, attending as many hearings as I could, and eagerly seeking mentorship opportunities from the legislative staff. They were some of the smartest people I had ever met until that point. Within a few weeks, I became one of the head interns, tasked with leading the others in our intern duties and working on key material for the Senators. 

With this internship experience, I realized my potential both as a student and as a leader. When I returned back to school, I was invigorated to develop this potential and help others do the same. I was initially unaware how important it was to speak up in the classroom and take on positions of leadership, especially as a woman. Because of this, I committed myself to helping guide others on their way through the education system as well. It became my goal to maximize opportunities for myself as well as those around me.

I went on to found the United Nations Association of America chapter at my school, and it was an opportunity to bring a diverse group of students together under one cause. I recruited many students like me, many of whom had little guidance on their academic journeys but wanted to make a difference. As I was developing my own leadership skills, I eagerly helped my club members obtain officer positions and internships. Today, these same students that joined our chapter are now in student government positions, leaders of our chapter with a national presence, and working on Capitol Hill. 

I am a first-generation American, first-generation college graduate, and the first woman in my family with the opportunity to pursue an education and a career instead of motherhood at an early age. I dream of adding other firsts to this list; first lawyer, first to run for public office, and first to start a non-profit organization. I will serve as a role model for my eight nieces and nephews, countless cousins, and my future children on their own paths to success. I will inspire the women in my family now and in future generations to embrace education and take on leadership roles. While I hold many firsts within my family, I will see to it that I am not the last to achieve my dreams.

6x1xiv,77,2017-08-30,Is this something an affectionate straight guy would do? Am I understandably confused?,confusedbigspoon,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6x1xiv/is_this_something_an_affectionate_straight_guy/,"My best friend, who I'll call Peyton(straight) and I(gay) are both 24 year old guys, and have been friends for 13 years. We grew up together, shared a large group of friends, several clubs, and generally spent as much time together as possible the last two years of high school. When I came out to him junior year, our friendship became extremely close as he was the first one to know. We would have long talks about anything and everything hours into the night when we hung out, ""jokingly"" spooned all night when we shared a bed for several nights on a choir trip and always told each other ""I love you"". We even kissed briefly when drunk and masturbated together one time. Being young and dumb, I of course fell into the trap of developing some strong feelings, which he actually found out about, but it was something we were able to work through and remain as close as ever. Leaving for university was really hard, but we both worked to stay in touch through skype, holidays, and two summer camping visits around his school, every visit being as good as the last as if no time had passed at all. He started dating a girl his sophomore year and, surprisingly, I was nothing but happy for him. I had finally gotten past my feelings and found a way to love him deeply in a platonic way.

This, bros, is where my confusion begins. A week ago I flew out to visit Peyton (he now works near his old university) for the long weekend. He lives in a one bedroom apartment with his gf, who is away for the summer doing an internship, so we agreed we would just share the bed which is nothing unusual for us. So I arrive, get settled in, and we go out for dinner and a couple drinks. We talk and catch up about everything, it had been about 9 months since our last meeting, and everything is fantastic. After two beers we decide to call it a night since he has to work a half day in the morning before he can take the weekend off, and head back to his place. In bed, both in shirts and boxers, we say goodnight and then he turns and backs into me as little spoon. I wrap my arm around him and we go to sleep; nice and a bit unexpected but nothing too out of the ordinary for us.

The second day we spend hanging out at a local lake and we go out drinking that night, hit up a couple bars, share a couple pitchers, dance and play billiards, and end up decently drunk. An old roommate of his comes out and we all end up going to my friends place to smoke weed and hang out. A few hours later, we're all starting to sober up and, being after 4 am, my friend's old roommate heads home and we decide to go to bed. Peyton takes off his shirt and pants, climbs into bed and turns off the light. I decided to follow suit with taking off my shirt and so we're both in bed in just our boxers. I face him to say goodnight and, just after we do, he pulls me toward him in an almost aggressive way. Our legs intertwined and crotches almost touching, he wrapped his arms around me and put his face against my neck. We both pulled ourselves together and get as much body contact as possible; I could feel he had an erection when it brushed against my leg and he made no effort to hide it. After a few minutes of embrace and the exchange of ""I love you""s, we fell asleep with our faces inches apart and cuddled the whole night. When I woke up after sunrise he had turned around to be little spoon and was holding my arm under his armpit and my hand tight to his chest. When he woke up he said good morning and got up to make breakfast like any other day. We enjoyed another afternoon hanging out around campus, he showed me around where he worked and we decided to go out again since it was my last night in town.

We went to dinner and a beer, then to a bourbon bar to get something nice and toast to our time hanging out over the weekend. His old roommate called and asked if we wanted to come over for a movie, so we decide to go for it and head over there. Peyton and I shared a blanket on one couch while his old roommate sat in another chair. After a few minutes, we end up holding hands under the blanket and snuggle up to each other with my other hand on the middle of his thigh. We stay like this for the whole movie, and leave for bed as soon as it ends. When we get back to his place we're both sober and tired, so we go right to bed. He gets in with his shirt and boxers, I'm in boxers and shorts with no shirt. We lay down and say goodnight, and I place my head on a tiny part of his arm. He says ""come here"" and just kind of slides me over so my head and upper body are on his chest with my arms around him and I swear his heart is pounding. We both let out contented sighs as he lightly strokes my hair, and eventually I fall asleep like this. The next day he drove me to the airport and we share a hug that must have been over a minute long, say our I love you's, and promise to see each other soon and keep in touch more when we're apart.

Ok....so am I crazy for overthinking this? Is this something a completely straight guy would do with an openly gay guy he feels very close to? My friend, besides the occasional joke about being a ""tiny bit bisexual"" is straight and has been dating the same girl for 5 years, and I have long since accepted that nothing would happen between us. After everything this weekend, though, I can't help questioning everything I've come to terms with. Ive been playing the stupidly dangerous game of imagining how perfect life would be together...waking up at night, feeling my heart drop when he's not next to me and now I can't stop wondering about the chance he's feeling the same thing. But, given his parents religious background and his lifetime identifying as straight, I believe he would have a hard time admitting to having these feelings even if he was. Is this something that we could ever talk about honestly? Have any of you had a similar experience? Any insight or advice you can provide would be amazing. Thanks bros.                                                                                                                            EDIT: alright thank you all for clearing some big things up. I will definitely bring it up at some point in the future in person (definitely not at a distance), since it sounds like most agree at least a little something weird is up. But for now I know I've got to push it to the back of my mind, be a good friend, and wait to see how his current relationship develops (I know from him that things definitely aren't perfect between them, so hey...who knows). Hoping I can make another edit with good news some months or years down the road, thanks again guys!"

I am a Tunisan citizen/ senior computer science student. I was 'selected' for a 14 month internship with the multinational Electrolux in Stockholm. But I only have 13 months of validity in my passeport.

1-According to the company HR: Swedish law requires work permit applicants to have validity for the full duration of their contact

2-According to Tunisan law: I am not allowed to renew my passport as long as it is valid for more than 1 year.

This a wonderful opportunity for me and I am so anxious not to lose it. If anyone has an idea on Swedish law or could suggest a workaround solution or a helpful source. I hope you would help.

Thank you very much!

edit: I thought of outsmarting this by 'losing' the passeport or having my baby brother 'accidentally' shred some of it. But the renewal in those cases takes up to 6 months. And the company cannot wait for me for that long :'( "
6x2b70,3,2017-08-30,I [24F] don't know how to deal with my mom [58F] and her occasionally explosive behaviour anymore.,burokorikami,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6x2b70/i_24f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_mom_58f_and/,"My mom is a very hard-working person who has always set a great example for me for things such as being independent and pursuing post-secondary education. She grew up in a country which was very poor at the time and and I guess that because of this, she developed an intense hatred of anybody considered ""lazy"" by her standards: people who did not go to college, people who have jobs which require little to no education, people who live with their parents after high school, and so on.

Normally she is very kind to everybody, and her colleagues, her friends, and even strangers probably think she is a great person. However behind these peoples' backs, if they aren't up to her standards she won't hesitate to talk about how terrible they are, just during conversation at home. I already hate listening to this, because it's really rude and none of her business. But the worst part is how she slowly, over the years, developed a hatred of my gang of high school friends. It started off not so bad--she would complain about them, but would not get -too- angry if I hung out with them maybe once per two or three weeks during high school.

Well, since we all graduated from high school, my friends have all stayed in the city we grew up in. Some worked in grocery stores or cafes and others went to college, but ended up dropping out. I went to a university in another part of the country, and while it was very difficult at times, leading to a couple of failed courses, I pulled through and am going to graduate very soon. Due to the fact that my program had internships, and that I already had family in the same part of the country as my university, I could only visit my hometown once every year or two.

Right now is one of those times where I finally can visit my hometown! Everything was great... until today, when I brought up how I want to see my high school friends tonight. My mom basically unleashed Hell itself and spam texted me about how all my friends are lazy pieces of trash because she has seen them around the town working at grocery stores, etc. I stopped responding because she started writing about how she wasted her entire life here in this country, she wasted $150,000 on my tuition fees, and how she hopes she dies. So then she started texting my dad about thirty times about how she was about to come home from work at her lunch break to shout at me (she changed her mind) and how she wants to cut contact with me. A few hours after all this, after I told my dad to stop responding, she proceeded to text me again about how if I continue to keep in touch with these friends, they will ruin my entire life. According to her, they are the reason I failed some courses in university (which they aren't, I just suffered from motivation issues at that time) and she also said that she has now given up on me because of all of this.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore, because my friends are all very nice people. Sure they weren't the most studious people in high school but they didn't get into trouble either, and I really felt accepted around them. I've cried numerous times in the past over how I rarely got to hang out with them in high school due to my mom restricting that. I feel like because I never really could hang out with people in high school (and even earlier), I now suffer some anxieties over talking to people and feeling like I don't have many friends. 

The worst part about all of this is that if I never bring up these friends, my mom will continue to be an extremely happy (sometimes too happy) person who loves to spend time with my dad and I, cook all of my favourite homemade meals, and go shopping with me and all that. If I don't bring up touchy subjects with her, everything is completely fine in the house. But now that I brought up my friends, it is 100% certain that she will come home from work in a few hours and act cold towards me, probably flare up a few times and shout at me about how I and my friends are all useless, and after that, she will probably ignore me for the rest of the night until tomorrow. At that point she will either still be cold or start to warm up, and once she warms up and forgets about the point, everything is fine... until I bring up my friends again. Note that this has happened numerous times in the past already, but she has never gotten **this** angry before.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to deal with a person like her, not only tonight but in the future. My dad is a meek person like me and tries to diffuse the situation each time she blows up, but he never has much success. Cutting her out of my life seems tempting because I really don't like hearing about how judgemental she is about practically everybody, and of course the scathing hate towards my friends. I will be done university in a few months and I guess after that point I am free to do what I want, but I don't know if I still want to keep someone like her in my life after everything she has done.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Mom hates ""lazy"" people which includes high school friends I wanted to see tonight. She blew up and started degrading my friends and I. Though this only happens occasionally, I am sick of it. Looking for help from anybody who has maybe been in this situation or knows how to deal with people like her."

I would probably be making a little over 40k, which is awesome for where I am living, but I'm not so sure about SF and its surrounding areas. I'd be in the market for a Treasure Island room for its price if it really came down to it.

I realize that I should take chances and not worry too much about where I'll be right NOW, but SF scares the fuck out of me. I can't help but think if I'm not stabbed by a drug jolted maniac, I'll die in an earthquake or civil unrest, or foreign bombing, the place is a death trap despite having a great skyline and surrounding nature areas.

It was the best decision i ever made in my existence. It was a rural place where you would spend some time working the land ( growing vegetables, fruits etc) and it had alot of nice facilities like pool, ping-pong table, movies  room where you could spend time with the interns or nurses. There were only 20 people there with me ( and double that in staff ) and the almost 2 months i spent there i learned so many life lessons and got a good part of my confidence back.

I got back to the real world exactly 1 month ago, and i, sometimes with a bit of struggle, am mantaining the routine i set-up for me : Wake up early, run a few miles in the local park, read alot and write. Im going to writing classes that i am really loving and its helping me so much in concreticizing the plan i had in the begining of the year of writing a book. My family said they will suport me for 1 or 2 years so im persuing what i think is the best for me right now. 

The thing is, i started being depressed in 2008, because of the rejection of one girl that i was crazy in love with. That happens to everybody but i just coudnt seem to let this feeling go away. I literally waited for like 4 years seeing this girl everyday ( in school and in my house, she lived literally next door ) creating a abnormal amount of negative feelings like jelousy inside me. This is with me for the last 9 years and as we are really close to each other we tried to make things work out for us a few times, but i always fuck it up because of the obcessive nature of what i feel. When i was hospitalized i could finally compreend why i got so atached to her and this image of us together ( my only family was only my mother for my entire life, when i was 13 i started having huge fights with my mother and breaking a door or window became a routine, and the more i lost contact with my mother, more lonely i felt. I pushed that feeling from my mother to this girl )

I think i probably wrote to much, but the thing is, im working on getting better and things are working out really well, but every time i walk arround my city i constantly am looking arround to see if she is there ( a mix of worry and hope ), that happens when i drive too : if i see her car i start sweating and trembling and it really isnt a good thing to happen in the middle of trafic.

And the more i get worried about this the more obcessed i think i become, i caught me today CHEKING HER 9 YEARS AGO TWEETS for somereason.

I just wanted to be free of this, but it oddly feels a part of me.

The other thing its really hard to handle if my innability to cry. I dont know why i developed this but started like 4 years ago. It was killing me before i got hospitalized as i was really in a bad state and wanted to cry all the time - but physically coudnt, my body would always incounciently stop it -. After i got out of the hospital it doesnt bother me that much because instead of every 10 minutes i just feel the need to cry like one time a day. but it still hurts

TD;LR - biggest progress i had in 10 years, but still worried about some things, just had to take this out of my chest."

I literally watched him several times focus on one unit while I was able to finish three. This same behavior can be applied to so many other things. 

I try to make suggestions, I form them in the way of questions, ""Hey man, don't you think it would be faster to do it like this?"" and he says something to try and be funny and brush it off. I can't tell him directly that he's doing something wrong as I have no authority to do that.

6x3jb0,2,2017-08-30,My firm's method to write documents and certificates is archaic and I want to innovate... but how?,landsurveyor123,Surveying,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surveying/comments/6x3jb0/my_firms_method_to_write_documents_and/,"First of all, English isn't my first language so I'm sorry if sometimes my wording is a bit off.


--------------------------------------------------------------


Alright, so I'm a soon-to-be certified Land Surveyor (3 weeks till my swearing-in ceremony!) and I've been working in a small firm in a small town for more than a year (I've had three internships beforehand). We currently have 4 full-time employees, so it's a *really* small office. 


Right now, our method to write documents/certificates is to **dictate** the content through a cassette recorder. Yes, you heard it. A cassette recorder. My boss has been doing it for 20 years+, and never bothered to change his formula. Fine, he's now really good at it... but I'm not. It's frustrating to use, awkward, and whenever I have to write difficult and complex sentences, I type it on Word *anyway*.


His pattern is simple : He takes an older document similar to the one we're currently doing (So he will take a survey that has been done close to the job we're doing, or a survey with many similarities), then reads/speaks the content and changes the words/sentences so that it represents the current information. Documents are about 10 pages long, and we change about 50% of the content. 


Afterwards, he gives the cassette to the part-time secretary, and she opens the .docx document that has been used as an example, and changes the words/sentences by listening to the cassette through a pair of headphones. 


She then prints the document, and either I or my boss will correct everything. After that, she proceeds with the corrections, then she prints the final version. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------


So yeah, I'm stuck with this. This archaic, confusing, awkward, inefficient, waste of time, you name it... method. 

I find it particularly hard to dictate what I want to say, because we're always using an ""older document"", which happens to ALWAYS be slightly different. I get mixed up with a bunch of different thoughts in my head, and the moment I try to write a generic law-ish sentence, I get confused. It's also really hard to write difficult and complex sentences, because there's no visual at all. Like I said earlier, I end up writing the actual sentences on Word before I dictate them *anyway*. Finally, the moment I have to write something that isn't on the older document (the example), I need to waste time trying to find a document that has that specific sentence I'm looking for, OR I make it up myself, which is annoying. Professionals take a tremendous amount of time to write perfect sentences for a reason : Once it's done, they can re-use the sentences over and over again.



So yeah... I have a couple questions for you guys.


* Should I wait a little bit more before I tell my boss about this issue? 

* In the meantime, is it worth it to think about a semi-automated method on Microsoft Word that could implement forms, to which I have to fill words instead of sentences? I have heard of [TheFormTool](http://www.theformtool.com/), and it looks really interesting and easy to use. I'm not sure if I could manage to do *everything* I want with that app, but it's still a good start. My goal would be to set up a BUNCH of different scenarios through many ""perfect sentences"" in order to automatize the document writing as much as possible.

6x3lh8,8,2017-08-30,My firm's method to write documents and certificates is archaic and I want to innovate... but how?,landsurveyor123,LawFirm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/6x3lh8/my_firms_method_to_write_documents_and/,"First of all, English isn't my first language so I'm sorry if sometimes my wording is a bit off.

Secondly, this isn't really the right subreddit to post this, as I'm a Land Surveyor. We deal with legal documents (deeds) a lot, and our method to write documents is kind of similar to how notaries write their documents. 


Still, you guys might be able to help me!

--------------------------------------------------------------


Alright, so I'm a soon-to-be certified Land Surveyor (3 weeks till my swearing-in ceremony!) and I've been working in a small firm in a small town for more than a year (I've had three internships beforehand). We currently have 4 full-time employees, so it's a *really* small office. 


Right now, our method to write documents/certificates is to **dictate** the content through a cassette recorder. Yes, you heard it. A cassette recorder. My boss has been doing it for 20 years+, and never bothered to change his formula. Fine, he's now really good at it... but I'm not. It's frustrating to use, awkward, and whenever I have to write difficult and complex sentences, I type it on Word *anyway*.


His pattern is simple : He takes an older document similar to the one we're currently doing (So he will take a survey that has been done close to the job we're doing, or a survey with many similarities), then reads/speaks the content and changes the words/sentences so that it represents the current information. Documents are about 10 pages long, and we change about 50% of the content. 


Afterwards, he gives the cassette to the part-time secretary, and she opens the .docx document that has been used as an example, and changes the words/sentences by listening to the cassette through a pair of headphones. 


She then prints the document, and either I or my boss will correct everything. After that, she proceeds with the corrections, then she prints the final version. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------


So yeah, I'm stuck with this. This archaic, confusing, awkward, inefficient, waste of time, you name it... method. 

I find it particularly hard to dictate what I want to say, because we're always using an ""older document"", which happens to ALWAYS be slightly different. I get mixed up with a bunch of different thoughts in my head, and the moment I try to write a generic law-ish sentence, I get confused. It's also really hard to write difficult and complex sentences, because there's no visual at all. Like I said earlier, I end up writing the actual sentences on Word before I dictate them *anyway*. Finally, the moment I have to write something that isn't on the older document (the example), I need to waste time trying to find a document that has that specific sentence I'm looking for, OR I make it up myself, which is annoying. Professionals take a tremendous amount of time to write perfect sentences for a reason : Once it's done, they can re-use the sentences over and over again.



So yeah... I have a couple questions for you guys.


* Should I wait a little bit more before I tell my boss about this issue? 

* In the meantime, is it worth it to think about a semi-automated method on Microsoft Word that could implement forms, to which I have to fill words instead of sentences? I have heard of [TheFormTool](http://www.theformtool.com/), and it looks really interesting and easy to use. I'm not sure if I could manage to do *everything* I want with that app, but it's still a good start. My goal would be to set up a BUNCH of different scenarios through many ""perfect sentences"" in order to automatize the document writing as much as possible. 

* Do you guys know any other programs to achieve this?

* If I end up doing this... it will be unpaid overtime. Is it worth it? My boss will probably never consider paying me for doing something like this, so it has to be seen as a long-time project which I will use once I start doing my own documents (with my own signature). If it works really well, perhaps he'll use it, who knows!"

I can say I have witnessed, first hand, the awesome program that Lehman offers. The computer science program is amazing. The teachers really care and really want you to learn. They’re absolutely amazing and the chair, Prof. Murphy, is an wonderful person and wants the students of the CS program to excel. They encourage you and lead you in the right path. I’m about to graduate from Lehman with a degree in computer science and although I’ve had those late nights, I loved the challenge and I can honestly say I learned ALOT. Thanks to my major, I’ve networked and made a lot of friends and bonded with a lot of professors. Thanks to them I became a better person and programmer/IT. If you really want to learn and practice, Lehman has a club called NSBE. I guarantee you will land a job or internship after attending Lehman and joining that club. I’ve had friends who been offered jobs at Goldman Sachs, Google, Apple, Chase and many more. Trust me you won’t regret it if you attend Lehman. Wish you luck!"

Could anyone offer their thoughts? If you think I have a chance at PhD programs, what are some schools in the range that I’d be competitive for?

&amp;nbsp;  

Some information about me:  
 
3.7 double major in neuroscience and psychology from a top 35 US college.   

Courses:  
3 semesters of calculus through multivariable  
1 semester of linear algebra  
1 semester of psychology statistics  
2 semesters of grad level data analysis/statistics courses in MATLAB and SAS  
Introduction to biostatistics and statistical computing as part of my internship at Columbia SPH  
First few courses of the Coursera JHU data science track  

GRE:  
Not taken yet, but certain I can get over 160 for verbal and quant. Practice tests suggest around 164 for quant.  

&amp;nbsp;

First worked in wet lab and prepared data spreadsheets, but didn’t really do analysis. Also did a wet lab NIH internship. Finally decided wet lab wasn’t for me and then did an internship at Columbia SPH, which involved taking courses and working on a project with an epi professor. I didn’t have (and still don’t have) a strong math background, but I took multivariable and linear algebra in my last year of undergrad so I could apply to biostatistics programs. I now work in a clinical neuroscience lab doing neuroimaging analysis with a mix of MATLAB and R.  


At Columbia I fell in love with public health and the environment of the programs there and I’m sure I want to study biostatistics. I think I’ll be able to write a good personal statement about my journey and goals, but I’m not really sure if I should be aiming for MS or PhD programs. "

Worried.,Jackolamd,ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/6x4wzu/incoming_bcoe_freshman_ee_and_friend_in_also_at/,"Hey there, all. I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm excited to finally get a taste of the college experience, and I was especially drawn to UCR by the amazing financial aid and the intimacy of the engineering programs, though I've run into a couple issues with my friend who is a 3rd year here. He expressed a number of concerns about BCOE, particularly with my major, and is genuinely freaking me out.

He told me that it'll be ""near impossible"" for me to find internships for EE, even with good grades, since there's no opportunities in the surrounding area, and everything further out is ""dominated by UCLA and UCI."" He also said that there's not a lot of research for EE, and gave me some pretty strong opinions about the quality of the classes and professors. 

I then suggested switching to ChemE, since I was originally interested in it, and he said that ""there's nothing but enviromental work"" and went on an incoherent rant about Computer Science. What he seemed very dead-set on was telling me that I would regret all this and how I should go to a CC and transfer somewhere. I get that he's probably angry about not finding work or doing poorly in classes, or not going to his dream school, but he's really soured my hopes a bit. 

Could any engineering students/grads in here tell me about their experiences in EE or ChemE, mainly EE, and how internships, research, and job outlooks are looking for them? I'd like to get some opinions from people who aren't completely bitter. I know talk like this shouldn't get to me, but I can't help it. "
6x4yj8,4,2017-08-31,Looking for Advice Regarding Academic References for PhD Clinical Psych.,cakingbaking,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/6x4yj8/looking_for_advice_regarding_academic_references/,"Alright, a brief summary of my CV: So I am planning to apply to clinical psychology programs (child clinical, if the school offers the option) in Canada this Fall. I have a 92% cumulative average over the last two years and I am taking my GRE at the end of September. From my studying so far, I feel very confident in my ability to do well. I fast-tracked a bit and did my undergraduate thesis in my third year, and I have worked in two professor's labs over the course of my undergrad (and am starting work in a third that's a bit more in line with my ultimate career interests). In addition, I have a fair amount of volunteer experience - I completed an undergrad practicum in psychology at a nonprofit community development organization that focuses on helping kids and families who are deemed at risk and have been hired on there for this summer, I am a peer counsellor and in a supervisory position at my university's peer support centre, and I do a mentorship program with a girl with a disability to explore potential areas of career interest.

I know grad programs are very competitive and there are a bunch of factors that are out of my control, but I outline this to point out that I'm not exactly taking a shot in the dark here. However, I am starting to get concerned about acquiring academic references. 

As I'm sure you all know, most schools require 2-3 academic references. I have one reference from my thesis supervisor, so that's 1/3. Here is where it starts to get trickier. 

I had one professor in mind where I worked in her lab for a year. I ended up doing my thesis with somebody else who had research interests a little more in line with mine, and she seemed perfectly fine with that - I left her lab on very good terms, she said I was a great student and that it was a pleasure to have me in the lab. I attended lab meetings with her and worked on a few different things, but my biggest responsibility was acting as an RA for one of her PhD students, with whom I worked very closely for the entire year. I asked this professor for a reference, and she said that she'd ""be delighted to, but she doesn't think she knows me well enough... probably because I didn't do my thesis with her.""

I find that a bit odd considering everybody needs 3 references, and you can't have 3 thesis supervisors, but alright. So she tells me what she can do is have the PhD student write it (who is currently doing her internship, and will have completed it at the end of this academic year) and she can endorse/cosign it. Personally, I'm great with that, but I am worried it won't look as professional to admissions committees. I'm not entirely sure what constitutes an academic reference and if that would suffice - but I did work with this girl quite closely, and she knows me and my work ethic very well. In fact, in talking to her she actually offered to do this for me without me even asking her. Plus the prof would still cosign it. Perhaps that's an invalid concern (I hope it is), but I really don't know.

So that is option 1 for my next 2 references. I have 3 other *possible* options, but I am not too certain about any of them and now I'm starting to get nervous:

- One professor I haven't worked in a lab with, but she's known me for four years (both inside and outside of an academic context - I met her before I started my undergrad doing theatre). I have taken one class with her (a third-year research methods class as prep for doing your thesis) and I am taking a second this semester. She has helped me with academic advising over the years and the last time we met (last week) she said she thinks I'd be a very strong candidate.

-I have two other options - one is a prof with whom I've worked in a lab for about a year, but I am unsure if she would be willing. She initially sought me out and expressed interest in having me be her thesis student (I already had a supervisor), but was thrilled when I asked if she was looking for RAs. Since then, I feel like her enthusiasm for me has died down quite a bit - could just be that she's hard to read, could be due to the fact that she has a huge lab with a lot of students. I feel as though I have done everything in the lab that has been asked of me to the best of my ability at this point, but I might be missing something.

-Finally, I have one prof with whom I am going to begin working this year. Her research interests are in line more with what I'd like to end up doing, but I won't have known her for very long. However, people have their thesis supervisor write them a letter after only having known them a few months all the time, don't they? If I explain my situation and offer to take on a lot of responsibility, is this a viable option? She would probably be my last resort, though.

It should be noted that I have one really strong professional reference (who knows my ability to work well with kids, for those child clinical programs), and one really strong volunteer reference (who has seen me in a peer counselling context). I am planning on using those for my social work applications (gotta have your plan B), but I am unsure how ""looked down"" upon those would be for psych grad school. Some of the programs say you can use a professional reference in place of an academic one, but I don't know how much they really mean that. Those all say they still prefer academic.

So therein lies my dilemma. I truly have no idea what the optimal course of action would be here. I am not sure who to ask, and in what order. I am also not sure if the one offer my prof made me would be a good idea. Any guidance would be much appreciated."

6x5hyz,4,2017-08-31,"Depressed, Poor, Lonely. Lost my job. Then police sent me to the hospital. I can't pay for the bills.",TheShredderHawk,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6x5hyz/depressed_poor_lonely_lost_my_job_then_police/,"So this is kind of a long story, so I'll try to keep it concise. Sorry in advance for the novel. 

I've been dealing with depressive episodes the past couple of years, nothing too serious. They mostly lasted a couple weeks and then everything would start to feel normal again. Last year I slowly started creeping into a major depressive episode that ""came to a head"" in April, then again in June, and now again in August. 

The entire time I've been trying really hard to find ways of coping/healing myself by signing up with a new doctor. Additionally reading articles, trying to eat better, exercise regularly, try to sleep better, hang out with friends more frequently, and the whole time aggressively trying to search for a counselor. I don't really believe in taking a pill for things, not that I'm 100% against medication.. but all the research (and confirmed by every single doctor I've talked to) is that medication is a ""chemical imbalance to correct my existing chemical imbalance and hope it balances the right way. If it doesn't, try again and hope the side affects aren't too bad"". I also have a complete disgust and distrust for big pharma. 

After not getting any traction with counselors and feeling uncomfortable with the medication recommendations by my doctor I just kept trying to stay optimistic and focused on finding a counselor. I even disclosed to my employer what I was going through and they assured me everything would be ok ""half of the office deals with depression, we know what you're going through"". 

Then a few weeks later, after my grandpa dies, they fire me out of no where. I started as an intern, transitioned to full time employee, but still paid like shit.. they tell me ""my skills aren't good enough"". They gave me these skills. No feedback, no coaching, no ""dude, we really need you to do X,Y,Z or we're going to have to let you go"". The more I think about it I think they used me to pick up slack as they completed a few big projects for the company. 

The day I get fired, I was already feeling like complete shit, but trying to power through it and put a smile on my face. In the conversation where they fire me, I just let them talk. When they're done I tell them I think this is bullshit, they set horrible expectations, and I disagree with their decision - but they've already made it, so fuck it, bye. 

When I get to my car, already completely crushed, I know this depression is only going to get worse. I think to myself ""what resources do I have that I have not tried yet?"". Thinking my situation might be like when someone calls their ISP trying to get tech support, if they escalate to a manager, shit usually gets done. So I call the suicide hotline thinking they might expedite scheduling with certain counselors, have resources I haven't thought of, help me find ways to pay for all this now that I'm unemployed.. I don't know, anything, I'll give it a shot. 

The complete fucking idiot on the other end of the phone just panders to me, and asks me loaded questions. Big moments of time in between repeating back my answer to me (incorrectly) so I know he's not listening/sucks at taking notes. At one point he asks me if I have a plan to kill myself. I said I don't but then he asks ""but if you're going to do it how would you do it?""... This loaded question got me really frustrated and I hypothetically said ""well I could do anything, I could go jump off this building"". Big. Fucking. Mistake. 

After he keeps me on the phone for a few more minutes not giving me anything. I ask him - ""what can you offer me to help? This conversation is going no where"". He recommends I call another phone number for mobile crisis unit. I tell him I can google on my own. Eventually I tell him ""you're not helping me, you're wasting my time, thanks but no thanks"" and hang up. I'm thinking it's just a phone call, if I'm a little rude whats the worst that can happen. He calls the cops and tells them I was standing on top of a parking garage ready to jump. Not true, I never left my car while on the phone.

I go home to lay down, take a nap, smoke a bowl, something to help me shift mental gears into how I'm going to fix my job so that I can eventually begin to fix everything else again. 

The police show up. I answer the door and walk outside. I don't want them going inside and seeing my weed, which I didn't smoke. After a few minutes of them also asking loaded questions they ask me if I know what a 24 hour hold is. After they tell me the process for a 24 hour hold they tell me ""You don't really have a choice, we can tackle you and taze you, or you can come with us and take you to the hospital."" 

I try to refuse, but they insist so I cooperate. I go to the hospital. They take my vitals and a blood sample. I'm not under the influence of anything. The nurse then explains the situation, much differently than the police. ""Well it's more like a 48 hour hold"". Then the social worker comes in ""Well it's more like a 72 hour hold"". They keep me in a glass room with security watching me. Eventually transfer me to a mental hospital where I'm kept for almost a complete 72 hours. The police never let me grab my phone, my wallet, anything. No one has a clue where I am, what happened to me, anything. 

After being stuck in the hospital I'm released after I give the same answer to 3 staff members, 3 nurses, 2 social workers, a psychiatrist, and an office administrator. The same story I wrote above. They tell me there is no such thing as a 24 hour hold, those don't exist in this state. We've told the police not to phrase it like this/change they way they deal with these situations. Especially after I cooperated, wasn't on drugs, and was having a bad day trying to figure out what to do next. 

Then I get hit with 2 separate bills. First one from the hospital for the first night of $1700. And the second from a doctor that doesn't work for the hospital but works there on the weekends but bills through a separate company out of state for $695. 

I call the hospital, I tell them I have no job and no insurance. I can't pay for any of this. They tell me to a.) set up a payment plan b.) register for Medicare and they can probably take care of part of the bill. I tell them because I was taken against my will by the police I don't think I should be responsible for any of this. They create a case and tell me they'll call me back. I'm still waiting. 

I call the number for the second bill, they don't give a shit, they tell me the same thing the first hospital did. After I tell them it was the police's decision, not mine, I ask if I could get the police to pay for it. ""Maybe"".  

I call the police department and get forwarded to the risk management office and then to department of police oversight. I file a damage claim form explaining my situation. I'm still waiting to hear back. 

At this point I'm so frustrated, I'm poor, I can't seem to even find a job that remotely seems like something I can do without wanting to blow my fucking brains out just from the work. I don't know what to do. I can't depend on my family (I moved away from them because of their behavior/actions). Over the course of the past several years most of my friends moved away after school or for work. The counselors I have met with are complete fucking idiots that don't listen. (i.e. ""I dont believe in God"" - ""Well let me tell you this bible passage"". ""I think I should update my linkedin profile"" - ""yeah do the link-uh-sis.. thing""). 

If anyone actually gets to this point in this post and has any ideas I'm open. I'm just stuck and frozen. I don't know where to begin. I can't even find motivation to do anything. This post is the first thing I've had energy to do in weeks. The more I try to fix my problems the worse they all become. Please help. At this point, I really am getting tired of existing. "

In the meantime I started personal securities investing once I'd left the firm.

I don't exactly have a lot of money to play with, but the money I am playing with is all disposable income, so no issues there. 

I want to do some pretty thorough research before committing to a stock. My first purchase was INTC at $36.42/share. I think semiconductors are solid, and I think INTC have solid financials and a stable dividend. The price I purchased at was a little high, but it's my first purchase, lessons learned. 

I intend to work on a buy and hold strategy. Equity only, no short positions, no options. I want to pick good companies that I believe will be solid for the foreseeable future. To anyone here who operates under a similar strategy and has found success, what do you look for in a company? What ratios do you value most? What are you actually doing to decide that X company is undervalued?

my university asked every scholar to do 50 days of internship program in order to get some topic to write about. and i just finished my 50 days of it. i learn a lot of stuff since i got accepted for that internship especially about intellectual property, infringement, patent protection, and copyright.

6x8t8y,37,2017-08-31,Season 8 Predictions/Wish List,gryffstark,freefolk,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/6x8t8y/season_8_predictionswish_list/,"I've been lurking on r/freefolk since episode 6 was leaked. Currently experiencing intense GoT withdrawals and wanted to share some of my thoughts on what is to come in season 8. 

I have only read the first book of ASOIAF, but I've watched GoT at least four times and picked up a lot of what happens in the books. So, here are some random thoughts that have been floating around in my head about the end of the show. It's a combination of actual predictions and wish list items. Would love to read other people's thoughts on these points. (TL;DRs at the end of each section)

1) Jonerys: like many of you have pointed out on this sub, the Benioff and Weiss are definitely just trying to create anxiety among fans about this relationship. It's happening, incest and all. I think the revelation of AeJon's heritage will serve as a massive identity crisis for both - Jon brooding over not actually being Ned Stark's son and Dany unsure how to proceed with this new threat to her reign. However, both will come to terms with it because there is very little point to building up their romance only to have it crash and burn. 
In terms of specific scenes that I hope get included (*cough*are you reading this D&amp;D?*cough*): EPICWINTERFELLSEX. Everybody has been freaking out about whether we will see a good Jon and Dany scene again, and of course we will! They're going to have this huge tension between them about AeJon's parentage and that can only mean one thing: make-up sex. Ok, but in all seriousness, I think it would be really nice for them to have a scene early on where Jon bends the knee to Dany as Aegon Targaryen (he already did it as Jon Snow). In return, Dany will talk about how all she ever wanted back in the red-door days was a family, and now that she has one she will bend the knee to the rightful Targaryen heir. The conclusion will be them swearing fealty to each other, because they are equals and they both believe in the other person so strongly. Perhaps this leads into a wedding scene, but it doesn't need to. The point is, they are in this thing together. 

While many people are predicting that one or both of them will die, I tend to agree that they will both end up alive. GRRM has proven himself to be a true fantasy lover, even as he subverts the genre. And the core tenant of fantasy is that good triumphs over evil. In order to subvert that, GRRM set up a lot of characters to look like the ultimate ""good"" (Robb, Ned, Bobby B) and others to look like the ultimate ""evil"" (Joff, Ramsey, Jaime, Cersei) - until he killed them off or complicated their characters enough to make it a less pure division between the two. That doesn't mean that good will not ultimately win, it just means that the final victory over evil will be bittersweet (*HBO intern*): the evil guys had to be a little evil good than we were used to, and the good guys turned out to be working in shades of gray in order to survive. Jon and Dany are the main heroes of the story, and they will live to see spring. If Dany dies in childbirth, it would be a cheap way to send out the strongest woman on the show. 

**TL;DR**: Jon and Dany stay together, they both live (although one of them may temporarily die), and they rule the seven kingdoms together (don't @ me with the ""iF YoU tHiNk ThIs hAs a HaPpY eNdIng"" foolishness). 

2) Structure of Season 8: First 4 episodes will be about defeating NK. If they spend less than that on the life/death conflict that has been looming over our heads for seven seasons, then it will feel very anticlimactic. The last two episodes will be devoted to defeating Euron and Cersei. 

**TL;DR**: Don't be so fookin' lazy. It's 3 sentences.

3) Euron/Theon: Theon, while often a frustrating character, has potentially the best arc of the series. He goes from being this arrogant, disloyal twat, to completely losing his identity altogether and becoming Reek, and now he is slowly regaining his identity and reaching for redemption. He will rescue Yara, although I would like for him to be captured by Euron in the process and take Yara's place. Euron will torture him, but instead of losing himself, Theon will have a stronger sense of who he is. I hope Theon is the one to kill Euron. I know that Euron is this ultra big baddie in the books, but in the show he's just not a villain that I think merits a faceoff with a main character. Besides, Theon killing his uncle (especially to save a Stark...maybe Bran?) would be an exceptional way to end his arc. That said, Theon does not make it out of S8 alive.

**TL;DR**: Theon gets redeemed by saving Yara, possibly kills Euron, and dies in S8. 

4) Azor Ahai: Anyone else hope that this prophecy is a big lie? First of all, I do not trust the Lord of Light one bit and (put on your tinfoil hats) I think LoL is somehow connected to the NK. I mean, Mel convinced Dany to invite Jon to Dragonstone because the LoL wanted her to bring together Ice and Fire. Which, yes, we're all grateful for (#EBS) but that alliance really sealed the deal on the NK getting his icy hands on a dragon. I would really like a S8 reveal that the AA prophecy is either made up or else extremely deceiving. Even if it is not, I do not think AA reborn will be as obvious as Dany or Jon.

**TL;DR**: In the immortal words of Sandor Clegane, the Lord of Light sounds like a cunt and we shouldn't trust him.

5) Sansa and Podrick. YES THAT IS RIGHT, I'M SAYING IT. Listen, if you irrationally hate Sansa Stark and regularly post things like ""I hope that bitch dies,"" etc, then this one is not for you. This is also supported by exactly 0 evidence in books or show, but I want it to happen! Sansa is going to end up Wardeness of the North because AeJon will be King and Bran and Arya really aren't interested in ruling. And we all want the Stark line to continue, right? RIGHT. So Sansa should marry Podrick because he's a Payne and will likely take the higher title in marriage. Pod would get to keep hanging with Brienne and be a stay-at-home dad while Sansa runs shit. Plus, Sansa has had really bad experiences with sex, and well...Pod has a magic dick. It's a match made in heaven.

6) Third shocking moment: So for those of you who don't know what I'm referencing, D&amp;D said that GRRM told them about three more shocking moments that he had planned for the books. One was Shireen being burned alive, one was Hodor's origin story, and the third....will be at the very end of the series. I'm a big fan of the Jaime as Valonqaar (sp?) theory, and I'm proposing this as the final shocking moment. Jaime and Cersei aren't just brother and sister, they are twins. As Cersei says to Ned in the show, they have been together since they were in the womb. It would be extremely poetic, therefore, that they should also die together. Jaime mentions to Bronn in S5 that he just wants to die in Cersei's arms. Even though he leaves her, Jaime still loves Cersei - he just can't tolerate her insanity any more. Jaime will go North and fight for the living, and at the very end when KL is being sacked, he will find her in a murderous rage and kill her to stop her from blowing things up (again). But either she somehow harms him before he kills her, or he kills himself after killing Cersei, because Jaime will not make it out alive.

I know that diehard Thrones fans such as ourselves would not be entirely shocked by this (although having it play out on screen would be pretty insane), but I think general audiences would be completely shocked by it. Besides that, a scene doesn't have to be surprising to be shocking - I think we all saw the Shireen situation coming, but it was still jawdropping.

**TL;DR**: Jaime is the Valonqaar. 

7) Magic being gone from the world. I've seen several people make comments about this being part of the bittersweet ending, and I think it would definitely harken back to GRRM's Tolkien roots. The Children of the Forest are already gone, the Giants are extinct, the White Walkers will (hopefully) be eradicated, and we already have one dragon dead. It seems like there is a balance between fire/ice, and if the White Walkers are to be truly defeated, then the dragons have to go (*sob*). This might also mean that Bran does not live past season 8, unless he can somehow un-3ER himself. 

8) Death predictions: Jorah, Grey Worm, Tormund (although he's not dead yet), Beric, the Mountain, Cersei, Jaime, Bran, Theon, Euron, Mel, the dragons, Ghost (I'm sorry!). I think the Hound might die and Beric resurrect him - all I want is for the Hound to live on a farm and eat some chickens and not be bothered. 

Things I have no idea about but would love to hear others' theories on:
1. How Dany's pregnancy will fit into the last season (I hope they don't bench her for the final bit just because she's pregnant)
2. What Arya and Sansa's storylines will be (gods I hope there's no more silly drama between these two) ; How/if Cleganebowl will actually happen 
3. Will Edmure Tully ever be rescued from the dungeons at the Twins? Not going to lie, I kind of liked the part of the fake leaks where Jaime goes and gets him. But if all the Freys are dead, has anyone been feeding him?

Thanks, y'all, it's been lovely. "
6x95kc,1,2017-08-31,Should I take out a 10k private student loan and where from?,Kurama-Kyubi,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/6x95kc/should_i_take_out_a_10k_private_student_loan_and/,"I am currently enrolled at Seattle University. I have accrued about 10k in student loans thus far. I am in my junior year of the computer science and engineering program. I have a mentor and a very promising future (an internship set yup for summer 2k18 and a secured job with starting salart $110k from said mentor in 2k19 post completiong of my BSCS).

However, I come from a poor family, no help or anyone around. Been supporting myself since 14 years of age... and there inlies my dilemna. 

My financial aid was to cover all of my tuition but $2500/qtr.
So I saved up money (working under the table jobs, so as to keep the highest level of need for state funding) to cover that portion, $7500, working my ass off while paying rent /bills living alone.

Yesterday - I received my award letter, which is about $6,000 less than the previous year... I then notice that I have not received the WA state need grant. After reaching out to the financial aid office, they said it is dolled out ona  first come first serve basis, and I must have been overlooked, but at this time there is no more WA state need grant funding...

So at this point in time, I am wondering what my best option would be... taking into consideration that there isn't much of another option than taking out a personal loan for the remainder, I guess I am asking what are the best places for student loans?

Or does anyone else have any other suggestions?

Perhaps someone else has gone through this same scenario with fruitful news from the financial aid office?

Any help is greatly appreciated

6x96ih,5,2017-08-31,Should I give up on the hospital dream?,chippsndipps,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/6x96ih/should_i_give_up_on_the_hospital_dream/,"Ok friends, I come seeking advice and maybe a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.  A year ago I tried my best to find a CF in an adult setting, but had very little luck and took a school based position.  I recently quit that position after earning my CCC's to try to get a job back with the adults, because I truly left my heart with that population.  Honestly I'd LOVE to jump into traveling therapy right now, but because my only adult experiences have been in internships (and they were fantastic internships, don't get me wrong) I figured I should have at least a year of independent experience under my belt before I jump into that world.  One of my internships was in the acute rehab setting of a hospital and I fell in LOVE.  I felt like it finally clicked and I had found my true passion.  Alas though, because after job hunting for 3 months I have come to realize that there are basically no hospital jobs - let alone acute rehab ones.  I had my sights set on Seattle, Portland, or Denver and have had ZERO luck with hospitals or SNFs.  Does anyone have any words of wisdom?  I'm debating what to do now - just take a random SNF job in some rural area to get my year of experience?  I'd really really like to stay in a metro area and wanted an area with good hiking, but I feel like the feedback from job hunting I'm getting is, ""beggars can't be choosers"".  What have been your experiences with job hunting in the hospitals?  Are there really that few jobs to go around - especially in the big cities?  I just feel like I would have better chance in finding a mentor in a hospital than a SNF so I keep pushing myself to keep trying to find a hospital, although I'm not completed opposed to a SNF.  I'd love any advice, comments, similar breakdowns, etc.  Please and thank you!"

6x9hro,1,2017-08-31,Toxic Depression and feeling angry and bitter,summerfellxx,mental,https://www.reddit.com/r/mental/comments/6x9hro/toxic_depression_and_feeling_angry_and_bitter/,"I had a toxic family upbringing. Till now I feel so angry at cousins..at ppl who had mum &amp; dad with them. I hate being with these ppl cause I'm angry that I couldn't be raised like them. I feel like I don’t fit in. I was alone. How can I let this go? People always think it's a joke...

I feel so old…and so scared. I just turned 21. Age gives me terror. I feel so old, compared to many college students I’m very sure who are younger. In my country our education system is a little different. We have secondary school and we can take a diploma or A level path. Short story I took the diploma path, it was three years in a course I hated. I’m a VERY creative and linguistic person, but for some reason I could not do interior design…the modelling part. It was so strange. Any module to do with theory or theoretical thinking, I excelled. Anything to do with DOING, especially constructing models and all that, or a biiiig project, triggered a huge panic attack in me. I don’t know what was wrong with me. All I was obsessed about was I needed to get good grades, because I didn’t enjoy the process at all. I would procrastinate till the last minute because I was so OBSESSED with needing things to be the best. Now..waiting for uni....and AGAIN worrying in choice or course.

In school..I’m very sure my anxiety and myself and my depression played a big part in my lacklustre work…but the lecturers…I wish they knew. I did tell some of them but they brushed it off.

I was depressed. Extremely, extremely depressed. Suicical every day. I would walk into that studio just fantasing about different ways to end myself. The lecturers did not help much. I’ve alwayd had low self-esteem and the fact that I couldn’t get over my fear of doing  work because of my fear of not being the best, the fact that I knew my lecturers thought I wasn’t good, crushed me. Outside that place, I was a Media EXCO in my CCA, a leadership role. I was artistic. My club was the Ambassadorial Team, a very respected club in school I managed to be in. So why, WHY couldn’t I perform in school? I remember my lecturer found that out, and he asked bluntly “Why are you an ambassador?” Me: ” What do you mean?” He: “I mean I’m just curious….why would they choose you?”

A little part in me sank that day.

There were many comments. “No wonder that other lecturers think you’re….”

“Don’t you feel embarrassed about your work?”

“You can’t use this as an excuse.”

My younger sister was suffering from anorexia at that time. I lugged my bag to that to the hospital. My family was broken and I was broken and alone. I was so depressed, so frightened of….mistakes. Failure. On my final year I did an internship, supposed to be three months. I had no self confidence at all. One night I fought witwith my family…..it was bad. I took to self harm and swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills…..crying myself to sleep and wanting things to end. It didn’t.  I woke up from a  call from a lecturer. I was late to work. For the first time ever. I had always made sure I was early.

But Work.

It had been the last thing on my mind.

Numbly, I just told her I wasn’t feeling well. Not ‘I took sleeping pills’ ‘I wanted to kill myself last night’.

Because the workplace….because my teachers….they wouldn’t understand.

I lost myself. Few weeks later, that same lecturer pays me a visit for lunch, over lunch I find out I am fired.

Inside, I want  laugh. It’s a numb, hollow laugh.

I got back. Ashamed every day. Other lectures saw me but they couldn’t care less. No whys from me.  You must understand. Our department is small. Very small. We call our lecturers by first names. Its hardly professional. I was given another chance to work in school. I was given a boss that didn’t scream at me or people. I was given a  boss who knew I was just a student, a diploma, not a degree student, a 19 year old trying to figure things out. It's all just too hard. Can't....stop these painful thoughts.all the words...from parents and teachers alike.....stabs me. Why amy I like this...what's wrong with me...I can't get over it like normal students people...words"
