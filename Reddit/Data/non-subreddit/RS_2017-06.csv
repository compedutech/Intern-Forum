6ej1c3,0,2017-05-31,Should I [40/M] continue to help my ex [28/F] financially? 6+ years thrown away like trash,alreadythrownawayx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ej1c3/should_i_40m_continue_to_help_my_ex_28f/,"I don’t give a truck.  Or should I?  Fake names and slightly adjusted ages and locations. So my ex and I met back in 2010 online.  Whirlwind romance, we both fell in love quickly, and were at the end of our shitty first marriages, both already separated, both with two children.  Held out for three years long-distance, where I spent probably $10k on plane tickets, but never regretted it.  She was my everything. During this time, I moved from Florida to Maryland for a great job making good money, and she was in California. She didn’t work during the vast majority of this time, but her boys were young and needed taking care of. With my encouragement, she started college.  I consider myself a decently smart person, but can recognize when someone is smarter than me.  And she is.  Extremely intelligent.  She got student loans and grants, so it’s not like I “put her through college” in that sense. But during this long-distance period, I probably deposited around $20k into her bank account to help give her a beter quality of life.  Like a lot of pretty girls, she loves shopping and spends a shit ton on makeup. But it made her happy, which made me happy. :) In early 2014, I gave up my kickass job to take a $30k/yr pay cut and move out there to be together.  We never even tried fighting her ex to be able to move with the kids.  Talked about it, but it never happened.  Best of times and worst of times.  We’re both passionate people.  We were either totally in love or at each other’s throats.  She was always very jealous.  Didn’t want me communicating with any other women, even about work stuff.  My stupid boss there sent an email to like twenty people, including me, with naked women in it, and I got kicked out for it.  Hated for me to go out with guy friends.  That level of jealousy.  But I dealt with it because I wanted to make her happy and secure in us, and relationships are compromise.


Fast forward to last fall.  She’s a senior at a large university, and KILLING it.  4.0 GPA. Nailed the LSAT.  Applying to law schools that are practically begging her to accept their scholarship offers.  I wanted to go back east where I could make more money, she didn’t.  I relented.  She accepted an offer from a large, well-known school, about 7 hours from where we lived.  All this time, it’s me taking care of the kids while she has a heavy workload.  Not mine biologically, but they’ve called me dad for years, and that made me happy.  I love them.  During this year, she had an unpaid internship at a courthouse.  Guys hitting on her all day, and she loved it.  I accept that will happen when you’re with a woman that is beautiful (and DAMN, is she beautiful), but I just always wanted her to gun them down, so to speak.  I wanted my attention to be what she really wanted. Changed her mind about all the jealousy stuff.  It’s now ok to have friends of the opposite sex.  It’s now ok to go out with people who encourage you to cheat.  For her, anyway.  Accused me of being mentally abusive and trying to isolate her because I didn’t like this awful friend, and yeah, I did take awhile to warm up to her having a relationship with her ex-husband’s mom (side note, that was my stupidity, that really is a good lady).  Yet it was with my repeated encouragement that she reconciled with both her father and her brother, and I’m very glad she did.  
Early this year, the fighting became more frequent.  I took to drinking large amounts of beer to cope.  And I would leave and drive my truck around.  Feel free to call me stupid, I do already know, though.   Eventually I ran into some boulders on the side of the road and bent my frame.  The fight that time was about this classmate of hers who had been constantly texting her and turning the conversation sexual.  She was also on POF exchanging sexual messages with other guys.  Sent me screenshots.  She refused to tell this guy to stop and that she wasn’t interested because she didn’t want to be “uncomfortable” at school or the courthouse, where he also interned. I told her I had enough of that shit and I was leaving.  She begged me to stay, and I did.  I turned down an offer to move back East for more money than I ever made to do so.  Enter my friend and co-worker.  Let’s call him “Lying Manipulative Douche,” or “LMD” for short.   I was grooming him to take my position when I moved onto my next project.  He was nie enough to lend me a spare vehicle of his.  Great guy, right?  I started confiding in him, telling him all our problems.  Always agreed with me that I was being treated horribly by her.


April, she dumped me by text while I was at work.  Said I didn’t even remotely care about her because I disagreed with how she handled something and said I thought the other person was right.  Said I made her life worse, not better.  Told me that when I “inevitably felt like talking about it” she didn’t care, she was done.  Blocked my number. I also found out she’d been referring to me as her “ex-husband” at work for like the entire year.  So I went off the deep end.  Drinking binge.  Did coke.  Gambled away a few grand.   Spent two nights in a hotel, and then after I did go home, I went into my daughter’s room and didn’t come out (save to go to the bathroom) for literally four days.  So of course I lost my job.   She’s dropping the kids off with her ex or his mom every chance she gets so she can go party it up with her friends and enjoy being single.  She’s back on POF.  Tinder, too.  Later I find new lingerie in our closet that had been worn.  I was devastated.  Told me what she did (while living in the house that I paid for) was none of my business.  
 

Still driving LMD’s vehicle, and using it to make some side money moving while searching for a new job.  Give him some money for it, and to his credit, he’d been very patient about it before I did.  Landed a new job in the Upper Midwest.  Told her.  She didn’t care.  We’d had sex a couple of times during this period, but other than that didn’t talk much.  I started talking to other women online.  Sexted with a few of them.  What’s good for the goose, right?  Not really.  I felt awful, honestly.  But I was trying to pump myself up and feel like someone would want me.  Told LMD about it.  Embellished the hell out of it.  Told him I’d slept with two girls already, and that I was moving on, I’d be fine.  Truth was I haven’t even kissed another woman in over six years.  Meanwhile suicidal thoughts are brewing and getting stronger.  I eventually told him I was lying about having actually fucked other women.  He said he understood. Said that I couldn’t be blamed, because she was a slut.  All girls that are on Tinder are sluts, he told me.


Moving day.  She didn’t want me to leave. Told me we could go to counseling and start over where she was going to law school.  We embraced and kissed for roughly thirty years before I hit the road.  There were two decorative momentos of our lives together.  I took one (which is till on my shelf here, sigh), she kept the other.  Had a rough three days behind the wheel to get here.  Los of stewing over all she’d done, lots of crying.  She asked me to come back several times.  If money wasn’t an object, I would’ve in a heartbeat.  But I was piling up debt, and needed to work.  I told her she could try to get into a law school up here, and we’d work it out here.  I’d realized I’d left the garage door opener in LMD’s vehicle, and gave her his contact info.  Asked her to keep all convos that were between us confidential. His response was “Of course. Bros before hoes.”


Friday the 19th.  She graduated.  I told her that when the title to my truck got there in the mail, she could sell it to an old friend of mine who said he’d give $1500 for it (just for ranch use) and keep the money.  She sent me pics of her and the kids at her graduation.  A pic of the underside of her mortarboard with my first initial on it in nail polish, to honor me for the place I had in her getting her degree.  A link to that Celine Dion song “I’m Everything I Am Because You Loved Me.”  Yeah.  I fucking bawled my eyes out.   Called LMD the next day.     He made some comments that led me to believe he’d been talking to her about more than garage door openers.  I asked him if that was true.  He said no, he saw her for literally twenty seconds.  I found that out to be a lie.  I asked the ex about it, and she said it was my fault.  He’d told her I’d had sex with other women.  Showed her a screenshot I’d sent him of me sexting with another girl.  Told her (a complete lie) that I’d been fucking other women as long as he’d known me.  Didn’t bother to mention that I later told him I hadn’t been with anyone else.  So now they’re a thing, I guess.  A relationship built on an utter lie.  I told her all this, and she refuses to believe it.  In my opinion, she’s always been really prideful, and as I mentioned earlier, very intelligent.  I don’t think she can accept that she got played and manipulated so easily by a scumbag like that.  She’d rather believe he’s a white knight and I was just awful (for allegedly doing what she had already done).


Last Thursday. Nothing in my fucked-up head but images of them together.  My “friend” and “bro.”  The love of my life, that I did everything for, and gave everything to.   I drank a lot of beer, got in the tub, got a fresh razor blade out of a new pack, and flayed my forearm (which has her name tattooed on it) open to tendon level.  Water in the tub was dark red.  I was bleeding like crazy.  And I was ready to die.  I emailed her a picture of it, and thought she’d see it after I was dead.  Yeah, that was really shitty of me.  She immediately responded back and said she was calling the police and my mother.  I tried to get in my car and run, woozy from loss of blood.  The police were behind me in less than two minutes.  I surrendered.  Taken to the hospital, sewn up and thrown in the nuthouse.  They let me out yesterday.  Trying to put the pieces back together.  Lost the job I moved here for while in the hospital.  So yeah, obviously I’m one fucked up individual.  Side note real quick: I’m committed to not drinking anymore.  At least for a long time.  I need sobriety.  There’s no problem that alcohol or drugs can’t make worse.  My last dilemma is this.  Do I send her the key to the truck?  Or do I immediately get on sps.com and change my address and deal with it myself?  I realize I made a commitment to her, but that was before I found out she’d been fucking LMD, who was supposed to be my friend.  I halfway feel like telling her to get him to pay her rent.  I know she can’t afford it on her own, the child support she gets from her first husband wouldn’t even cover it, and I’d be willing to bet money she hasn’t done a damn thing to change her spending habits.  I’m honesty leaning towards letting her have it.  Not because it gives me some moral high ground, but because of the kids.  They’re still my boys.  :(   They won’t be calling LMD their dad anytime soon.  She told me my 2nd grader came home crying because they told him to bring to school any parents who’d served in the military for their Memorial Day program.  That was me.  I’m his dad.  But I’m a world away now.  She said LMD already says he loves her and wants to marry her.  Yup.  After a whole two weeks.  Hasn’t even met the kids.


Do I let her have the money for my truck, or do I let her deal with paying rent herself? It’s the last month she was going to stay there, anyway.  She could always move out and just be in cramped quarters with other family.  Or fuck, convince LMD to let them move in if the guy he stays with allows it. Not like it’s a secret; an old co-worker already told me that he’s there running his mouth about how he got my job and one of the perks is fucking my ex.  She wouldn’t be on the street. What Would Reddit Do?

TL;DR – She really fucked me over and pissed all over the memory of what was the greatest thing to ever happen to me.  Continue to be there for her, or nah?

I recently got my B.A. in Graphic design and recently got a paid design internship.
I almost made the worst decision of my life of getting my master's in TV/Film production. after reading into a lot of reddit posts, I just learned that web design/CS,UI, UX, interactive media, and/or front end coding is where I should focus in if I want a comfortable living wage in the next few years and I wish I took advantage of this stuff earlier. My art style tends to lean more to the illustration side as I'm more of a comic, cartoon/character artist, but I also do logo design and what not on the side. My portfolio is okay, It needs a lot of diversity but I'm confident that i could build it up, but I feel as though im stifling myself because I dont know WHAT I should do to build it up with. I mean, I like graphic design, but I also want to be practical with my goals.

What would you recommend I do? I know that a lot of people say to find your niche. as I said again I really like creating comics and cartoons but I feel like i should try getting into coding and programming. I feel like I could get into interactive design or UI, Maybe I could combine it with my illustrations. but how should I go about ? Would it be better to teach myself and create a nice portfolio? or do you recommend going to school for it or something? Im trying to stay away from schools if I dont need it. If I were to build my own website or some Interactive media that showcases work and use it as my portfolio, would that be more impressive? finally, which one would be best to learn first? "

The account is a throwaway- I do have a main account I post on here occasionally with, but my partner knows the user. 

**This is a really long rant.** I would love advice, but I don't want the stereotypical ""don't bother trying, just break up"". Also, trans people (I know you lurk here), please don't read/respond if you're just going to get offended and call me transphobic. My point of view is from being frustrated with being a partner of a trans person, and I want support from that perspective.]

---

Sometimes I don't feel like we're meant to be. When we're together, it's great, most of the time. I mean it's hard sometimes. Sometimes I feel like she's a bit focused on herself, and she forgets that I have needs too. I feel like it's transphobic to say this, but it's true: she was raised as a man, and she's got the same lack of ability to do emotional labor as one. She forgets I have needs and she can get so caught up in her transition, or in wanting social justice, that she forgets that there's a time and place for everything, and that I exist too. She tells me she'll get better, and she does, but only on very specific things. She doesn't seem to get the bigger picture that it's a bigger trend, which was also an issue in a previous relationship of hers that lasted like 2-3 years. It's frustrating. Maybe it's just because she's autistic (maybe, she's been playing with the idea and so far it seems to fit, but she hasn't gotten diagnosed or talked to anyone about it, and she's still considering some type of sensory thing). I want her to go to therapy about PTSD and prior relationship things, I want her to really work on fixing things, but she just sees that in the present moment things are fine, and doesn't recognize that she's not being a good partner until I get fed up and have an outburst about something specific, and she doesn't fix the whole trend.

Sometimes it's great. We dream about the future. I want to meet her parents and be close to her family and friends. We've talked about wedding ideas (nothing solid, obviously); and we have the same ideas of wanting kids (two or three), saving and donating money, and living a frugal lifestyle. But they're just dreams. They're ideas. I want something solid. I need something solid. How can I even plan for the future though when I have no idea where I'll be in a year, though? If I'll be employed, where it'll be, how much money I'll make and what benefits I'll have, all the expenses I'll have...

Sometimes I feel like I'm putting aside too much of myself for her. She's two years older than I am, graduated college already, though she quit her job (because it was an unhealthy culture for her) and has been unemployed for a while now. She has a lot of power in the relationship, being older and established, and I worry that I'm willing to make sacrifices that she's not. Location, for one: I really love my work right now, and even though it's only an internship, I could see myself here for a while because the work culture is great. But it's in the suburbs, and she really wants to be in the middle of a city. I like cities, but I want to settle down to the suburbs one day. I think I'd be okay renting, but I don't know if that's just the part of me that wants to be with her or how I actually stand. I think to myself that I'm willing to live in a city and commute here (about an hour), but I worry that I'm planning ahead and making these sacrifices when she's not even thought about it at all. She's just living her life, letting it go wherever, not caring what happens. She doesn't plan ahead like I do. It's a difference between us. And I guess in a way that goes back to the emotional labor thing, like I'm carrying the mental load for our future.

Sometimes it feels like she doesn't care. She'll be great most of the time, staying up til 2AM when I can't sleep before work, calling and just sitting on the phone with me while I lie crying in bed. But then sometimes she just disappears, which is so hard in a long-distance relationship when I know nothing of her schedule or her plans or anything. She's bad at doing the whole ""tell me how your day was"" type of things, sometimes I don't even know she's doing things til a mutual friend mentions something that happened a month ago. I feel so disconnected from her life.

Sometimes I doubt that all of this is worth it. I never wanted a girlfriend. I mean, I love her with all my heart, but I feel thrust into this where I'm forced into a relationship with a woman before I even started identifying as bi (and still don't strongly identify as bi, more as ace). And now she's thinking she wants to experiment again with pronouns and gender fluidity. ""Today feels like a ""they"" day"", my partner says to me, buying they+she pronoun pins at target. I'm not ready to go through the whole questioning process again. 

Sometimes I think I'm a horrible person for thinking it, but it's true: I don't want to date a person using ""they"" pronouns. I want something normal. I want to have the stereotypical relationship, dating a man for a while and climbing the relationship escalator and having 2.5 kids with a white picket house, a slight exaggeration but still accurate. I mean I have my own tweaks, I want to keep working and don't ever want to be a stay-at-home mom (at least right now that's my plan). But still, I want something *normal*. I feel like I'm weird for wanting it, but I love the idea of it. And she's not normal. She's out and proud, very vocal queer, loving to be bold and bright and brilliant. And normally I love that about her, but I don't know if that's who I really want to be with.

I don't know, maybe it's the 4 hours of sleep or the anxiety talking, but sometimes it's so hard to be with her. I'm so exhausted from my own issues, and I know she shares some of that burden sometimes. But it feels like there's this huge gap other times, and it feels like she doesn't care, and it feels like we're just so different that I don't even know how it can even work in the end. But also I feel like she's someone I could see myself spending a long time with, and I don't know how to bridge that gap and make things right. I'm not ready to let her go. I still do think we can work and figure out a method of communication and stuff that works for us. But it's so hard to figure out, and it's so difficult when she's far away and maybe transitioning again and figuring out so many things for herself. I feel like I/our relationship is taking a backseat to her explorations... I don't know how to even bring it up to her.

**tl;dr:** I'm struggling. A lot."

We are both girls, and we are studying the same thing in school. We have a lot in common, which made us fast friends (from my perspective). I'm just having some difficulty understanding her. She is very hot and cold with me. We both invite each other to do things that we both enjoy fairly often and we have really good, in depth conversations when we talk. Both of us are uncharacteristically open with each other. The thing is, she never seems to tell me things outside of these hangouts. I have to check in or I would never know what's happening with her. She didn't even mention that she would be going across the country for an internship this summer; I found out through a mutual friend. I keep questioning whether she actual likes me because of this. She also tends to be a little flaky at times. I know she struggles with anxiety, so I have been attributing it all to that, but it's becoming a source of anxiety for me now. I feel like I consider her a much closer friend than she considers me, which is pretty disappointing. I guess I am wondering if any INFJs could give me insight into what may be going on?"

6ejr0d,8,2017-05-31,"DAE struggle in the college environment, regardless of their work ethic or being attributed as intelligent.",pinhead94,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/6ejr0d/dae_struggle_in_the_college_environment/,"I am a college senior that was trying to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science. After a lot of introspection and being fed up and exhausted from the constant stress of it. I decided to withdraw and am just waiting for my paperwork to be approved. Whether it is approved or not, I am not attending or doing anymore schoolwork.

I tried to lie to myself into thinking I was more intelligent and more ambitious than I really was. 

I thought that having a decent interest and aptitude in computers and programming could make me enjoy or tolerate school. It didn't for the past year, I have had frequent depressive episodes, anxiety attacks, and for the last past month non-stop panic attacks and mental breakdowns. 

There was a period of almost a year, I worked and didn't go to school and after getting acclimated I came to enjoy and tolerate it. I really enjoyed a 9-to-5 time structure where work time and free time was more clearly defined. 

This is why I hate school and honestly even though I have had a GPA of 3.3 and even when sometimes do good on tests or projects I feel no satisfaction or triumph or anything. I feel, like always, that I wasted my time. I feel like I wasted years of my life giving my time to school and feel angry at myself for pretending to be someone I wasn't. Especially at my school, the environment, the pacing, the structure, and size just trigger the all my bad traits and I eventually always become the worst version of myself.

I am scared of what lies ahead for me, but right now I just want to work, probably different jobs and find out what I like to do from there. I have an internship in my field, but after this terrible year of school, I am only sticking with it because it will be a job for the summer. After that, I will continue to look for jobs with whatever skills I have now.

Looking back, I went to school for fairly stupid reasons. I was stupid enough to believe just because I did well in science in high school and in the beginning of the college. It's weird I used to love computers and programming but after this year, I hate it so much with a passion. In all honesty, if my internship wasn't paid, I would have walked away from it by now.


UPDATE: Hi guys so my withdrawal paperwork got approved and I don't know if it sounds bad but I'm pretty relieved and actually a little happy.  I appreciate all the responses as well as all the insight from people who have left school to work.

 Looking back I feel like I had been lying to myself for way too long about what I wanted to do and was afraid of starting over. Well, I'm not afraid anymore, I guess I'll just have to wait and see what the future holds and so be it. All I know is that I didn't want to go forward in the field of comp sci and I don't want to step foot in a classroom for a LONG time. For now, I am gonna talk with my mom to see how I can contribute more and eventually live on my own even if it's bare minimum. I guess I realized that education is just  not and never was appealing to me and I accept the consequences that I may face without a bachelor's degree.


TLDR;
Do any of you guys have ease with doing simple, repetitive work, but cannot complete college? Are any of you guys considered by outside people, intelligent, but struggle, whether it be socially, mentally, or academically with the normal college environment?

""UURGH."" The severed head resting under the covers groaned. ""WHY.""

The phone rang again, prompting the woman holding the severed head to her chest to roll over and set him aside on a pillow so she could grab the phone.

""Honey, you knew the hours would be shit when we decided to become superheroes."" She said before answering it. ""Hello, you've reached Perseus and Medusa. What's your emergency?""

The severed head could hear the screaming from the other end of the phone even from a foot and a half away in his pillowy isolation.

""Yes... Okay... Robots. Understood. We're on our way.""

""Do we have to?"" The head complained. ""It's four AM.""

""Yes dear. Besides, your body has been under the charging laser all night. You're at full laser power right now.""

""Fine... Let's go...""

Emily, known by the superhero name Perseus, grabbed her severed head husband and took off to don her superhero costume, a bronze tunic and helmet stylized to look like a Greek warrior's armor.

You may have, at one point in your life, thought ""I'll bet there's some conceivable universe where the phrase 'severed head husband' makes sense"". This is that universe.

It all started as a lab accident. An esteemed scientist's head was cut off by a laser, due to the machinations of his sinister intern Keith! Yet he lived on, as a sentient severed head! ^^* What's more, the headless body can absorb lasers and grant the scientist laser vision! And so, he took up the name Medusa and his girlfriend Emily the name Perseus, after the way Perseus wielded the Medusa's head as a weapon. ^^**

Perseus ran with Medusa to the League of Extraordinary Shitposts' Shit Shuttle and took the pilot's seat. Within moments they were landing atop a skyscraper. Down below in the streets, a chrome robot was launching missiles and blowing up cars.

""Cool."" Medusa said with a grin.

""It is not cool, silly, it's awful."" Perseus chided. ""Now let's go. We have a city to save.""

Perseus pulled out a grappling hook and used it to descend to the city streets below.

""How come we have to save the city?"" Medusa complained. ""What did they ever do for us?""

""Look at it this way. If you do superhero things, the government won't try to dissect you.""

""Fair enough.""

Perseus landed in front of the robot and raised Medusa up, the latter's eyes glowing a fierce red.

""The robot has a giant metal horse dick."" Medusa said. ""This must be one of Bad Dragon's war drones.""

""It'll be a pile of scrap soon enough."" Perseus replied. ""Fire at will!""

""You got it- AH!""

Medusa's face contorted and his first laser missed the robot and hit a nearby building.

""What the hell was that?"" Perseus asked.

""Someone's grabbing my dick!""

""*What*?""

""I can feel someone touching my body over at the HQ building and they're *grabbing my dick*!""

""Look, just, ignore it and hit the robot!""

Medusa's eyes glowed again, but this time he groaned and fired a laser at the robot's arm instead of its head, hitting its arm mounted missile launcher and causing explosives to fly wildly all over the city.

""Oh my god Medusa."" Perseus groaned.

""They're putting stuff in my asshole now, I can't help it! Call the HQ and ask them what the fuck is going on!""

Perseus pulled out her cellphone and started talking as Medusa accidentally blew up a nearby car and continued to moan and squirm.

""Uh yeah... Natalie? Hi, Perseus here. So, Medusa says someone is grabbing his dick and putting stuff in his butt... Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yes, I kno- I *know* he has a cute butt, but we're busy here with the robot! Yes. Okay. Yes, you can play with his body after we're done here. Yes, Latex Lad can have a ride too. Yes, so can Miss Mucus. Okay, thank you.""

Medusa sighed as he felt whoever was touching his body desist.

""'Bout time."" He sighed, fixing the robot in his gaze and turning it to a puddle of molten metal.

""You're in for an interesting ride home."" Perseus told him as she headed back to the Shit Shuttle with Medusa tucked under her arm.

""Why's that?""

""Because Natalie wants to test your body out. And Latex Lad. And Miss Mucus. And me, later tonight.""

""Being a severed head *sucks*.""

""Oh hush, you love being a severed head.""

6ekh8x,3,2017-06-01,[RF] State of Decay,rehtuS,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/6ekh8x/rf_state_of_decay/,"I zig-zagged my way through the winding hallways of the Davis-Shall Cancer Treatment Center. My photographic memory helped guide my through the twists and turns like a rat in a maze. Today was going to be a big day, I started to get antsy as I got closer to the office. I walked down the last hallway, and opened the door to Dr. Shall’s corner office on the top floor. Debra and Kate were already sitting across from Dr. Shall who had his legs crossed in his burgundy leather chair.

“Nice of you to join us on time, James.” said Debra.
 Her scowl had become the expression that defined her. It's like she forgot how to smile ever since our divorce.

“It’s always a pleasure, Debbie.” I replied. I playfully squeezed the fluffy ball at the top of Kate’s purple knit hat, and flashed a smile as I sat down in the open chair next to her. My mother made the hat before Kate’s chemotherapy began a few months back. She wore it almost every day since then. It covered what used to be the most beautiful blonde hair. The same hair as her mother, Debra. It was part of the reason that I asked her out in 2032 when we were still in medical school.

“Alright James, I mean...Dr. Marrs, my apologies, shall we begin?” said Dr. Shall. His mustache sat awkwardly on his chubby face. He showed a hint of discomfort. I already corrected him once regarding my credentials at our first meeting, and he apparently a bad habit of forgetting. People who were active in the medical field had a tendency to get nervous in my presence. My reputation as a doctor preceded me wherever I went. I was the youngest graduate in the history of Johns Hopkins Medical School. Within three years of graduating, I had single handedly developed a way to eliminate hyperglycemia in humans, essentially curing diabetes. They called it the greatest medical advancement of the generation. I saved millions of lives, and now they printed my name in science textbooks.

Kate was diagnosed with kidney cancer, and she had been going through a grueling treatment process for the past few months. Dr. Shall had scheduled an appointment to discuss the latest PET scan results.

Hearing that Kate’s treatment was a success would be a unfathomable weight lifted off my shoulders. I took a long breath in, and slowly exhaled. “Go ahead.” I motioned for him to continue as I nervously toyed with the Newton’s Cradle on the desk. Dr. Shall shifted his papers around, and opened the file folder in front of him.

“I’ll just get right to the point” he said. “After reviewing the results of Kate’s PET scan, I’m sorry to say, we’ve located what appears to be a small tumor lodged next to her brain stem, a very troublesome location. I’d still like to have a biopsy for confirmation, but the scan has been fairly definitive in the past”

All of my hopes were immediately flushed away, and Dr. Shalls voice faded into the background. I could only hear the metal balls of Newton’s Cradle rhythmically clicking. I could tell that Debra was on the verge of a breakdown as well, she stared aimlessly out the window behind Dr. Shall. The lines of her eyes strained to fight back tears. We had to be strong for Kate who held herself together through Dr. Shall’s spirit crushing explanation of the path ahead.It wasn’t easy news for a seven year old to deal with. Her outlook was grim, but I raised my girl to be strong, and she wouldn’t let this news destroy her. Behind this facade, I could tell how painful it was for her to hear. She looked down at the floor, trying to process it all. The last year of treatment was practically a waste, and her outlook was darker than ever.

I grabbed the file from Dr. Shall’s hands and looked through the results with my own eyes. My sadness turned into anger as I flipped through the pages. Dr. Shall watched me with wide eyes, being careful not to say anything stupid. I had to make sure there was no mistake in his diagnosis. “I’m taking this.” I said, pointing to the file as we left the office.

In the parking lot next to Debra’s black SUV, I pulled Kate aside, bent down, and wrapped my arms around her. Tears welled up in my eyes as her face rested against my neck, I wiped them away before she could see them.“Do you remember when I used to lift you in the air, and spin you around over my head?” I asked.

“You used to make helicopter noises too” she managed to let out a laugh.

“That’s right” I laughed. “It’s how I used to cheer you up when you were being grumpy” I said. “It’s hard to have a frown on your face when you’re spinning in the air to the sound of bad helicopter noises.” I thought about lifting her in the air in that moment, but she was very weak, and I wouldn't want to hurt her.

We held on to each other in the parking lot for a moment longer before I let her get in the car to go home with her mom. I walked around to the other side of the car where Debra was waiting next to the driver side door. She looked defeated, but I didn’t know how to comfort her. Not that she would want to be comforted by me.
“Remember, you can come to the house whenever you want to see Kate” She said. “Obviously I’m not going to get the lawyers involved again...given the circumstances.”

“I know” I replied. We stood in silence for a few seconds, unsure of what to say. 

“Call me if anything happens, or if Kate needs anything.”
“I will” she replied. She looked down at the pavement as she was thinking. I could tell that she wanted to say more.

“I’m going to fix this, Debbie--” I said, but she stopped me before I could finish.

“You can’t fix this, James. You’ve been saying that for the past year” she snapped. 
“And don’t you dare start spewing that bullshit in front of Kate.” She looked through the car window to make sure Kate wasn’t listening. “It would be cruel to get her hopes up like that.”

“I’m serious, Debbie, you know I can do this” I replied.

“I know you can, eventually” she said. “But you don’t have time. You heard what Dr. Shall said, she could only have a few months left given the location of the tumor.”

“I know the prognosis...Better than that walrus, Shall, or any other doctor for that matter. And you’re right. I’ve been saying this for the past year, but I’ve been working my ass off in the lab, and I know I’m close to a breakthrough with the jellyfish serum.”

“Don’t kid yourself, James” she replied. “Kate doesn’t need you to fix her. She needs you to be there for her in the next few months.”

“I won’t accept that” I replied. “I can’t just roll over and watch my daughter die. My whole life has led up to this moment. This is what I was meant to do.” Debra just shook her head in disagreement. “Debbie, I don’t care about my accomplishments...I don’t care about the past, or my legacy...Everything I’ve done means nothing if I fail now…”


&gt;It had been *one month* since I found out that Kate’s cancer had spread to her brain, and I practically lived at the lab since then.

 I would go to Debra’s house to see Kate almost every morning, then it was back to the lab for upwards of twenty hours per day. I hardly ate, and I certainly never slept for any extended period of time. I took micro-naps throughout the day on an old inflatable mattress so that I could remain somewhat physically functional, but this lifestyle had definitely taken its toll. I’d lost a significant amount of weight, and sometimes I would be oblivious to the fact that people were talking to me. I was stuck in a research driven autopilot that was difficult to snap out of. I did not have time to waste on things that weren’t necessary, and I couldn’t afford to waste any thought on trivial matters.

I worked for Nucleus Clinical Technologies ever since I got my M.D. A professor of mine connected me to a research job after I had adequately proven myself in several of his courses. NCT was a middle of the pack research company when I first started, but they had an open ended research focus which was exactly what I had in mind. They hit the jackpot when I revealed my hyperglycemia remedy. When my drug hit the market, NCT and their parent pharmaceutical company became one of the highest grossing companies in the world. Now the bigwigs at NCT basically kissed the ground I walked on. Since then, my research funding was essentially infinite. Investors and philanthropists from around the world started pouring money into NCT. I made a lot of people here extremely rich, including myself, and I could have any of their jobs with a snap of my fingers.

That is the reason that I was able to get my hands on a *Turritopsis vitrosii*, an elusive evolutionary cousin to the *Turritopsis dohrnii*, also known as the Immortal Jellyfish. I watched it glide past the glass of the aquarium with hundreds of spaghetti like tentacles protruding from its translucent exterior. A faintly glowing red core rested in its center, holding the secrets of cheating death. They are biologically ageless because they are able to revert dysfunctional cells back into stem cells, and are able to grow according to how their DNA originally intended. NCT was not pleased about this “request” as they could have bought a Triple Crown winning horse with the money. I told them I would walk away from the company if they refused, and they practically got on their knees before I could leave.

To avoid distractions, I sequestered a large private room that had everything I needed for my research. Nobody was allowed to come in unless they had my permission, or if they wanted to risk having a beaker thrown at their head. I had no assistants, and no other researchers helping me with my task, and I certainly had no interns. I could not jeopardize my work by involving some shaky-handed amateurs.

I was sitting hunchbacked at my lab bench peering through a microscope for the fifth straight hour. *Chopin’s Nocturnes Op. 9* played through the speakers on the other side of the room. I usually avoided music while I worked, but after the first week of isolation, the silence began to unnerve me. I was looking at a small chunk of grey matter from a deceased man. He had a stroke which led him to have a massive brain hemorrhage. I treated the tissue with a *vitrosii* serum that I was working on, it was dark and in a state of decay. I watched as the damaged tissue deteriorated, and new lively tissue filled its place. This was the first version of the serum that actually worked on tissue originating outside of the *Turritopsis genus*. Ideas of all of the applications that this serum could potentially be used for began flashing through my thoughts; wound repair, heart attack recovery, anti-aging… Immortality? This in itself was a discovery that would have the Nobel Prize committee wetting their pleated pants, but the serum still wasn’t developed enough to save Kate. There was much more investigation to be done before I could use it on her.

&gt;It had been *three and a half months* since I found out Kate’s cancer spread to her brain.

 I placed the carcass of Rat #J12 in a body bag with the rest of the rats from Group J. Another failed serum. I placed the bag into the incinerator, and burnt it into a pile of ash for disposal. The serums continued to fail in living organisms, and I haven’t been able to come up with a complete solution. I was scraping the bottom of the barrel for last ditch ideas, and I didn’t place very much confidence in them. I only had one more serum experiment group before I was completely out of options.

The computer monitor mounted on the wall lit up to the left of my bench, Debra was sending me a video call. I clicked the notification on my watch to accept the call, her face appeared on the monitor.

“I just wanted to remind you that Kate is having her surgery tomorrow at 10:00 AM” she said. The thought of that made me feel a twist in my stomach. I was forced to consent for the surgery because I had not achieved a better alternative with my vitrosii serum. The location of Kate’s tumor made the operation extremely life threatening, and it had a very low likelihood of success, so we hired the best neurosurgeon to perform the procedure, a personal acquaintance of mine.

“I’ll be there tomorrow morning” I said. “I have one more serum to test.”

“You should be here now, tonight” she replied. “It could be the last night you spend with her...This is out of your hands now.”

“Who else is going to do something, Debbie? The surgery is a hail mary, and you know it. Do you think God will reach his hand down from the sky and save her? Because I don’t. I’ve come to far too give up now.” She looked at me with a mix of anger and pity.

“Look at yourself, James” she said. “You look like you haven’t eaten in weeks. You’re a complete mess, and you obviously aren’t thinking clearly.” She paused for a few seconds. “You really don’t want to be a part of Kate’s last memories?”

“I...I’ll be there tomorrow morning.” I said.

“Fuck you” she replied. 

The screen went dark as she hung up, revealing my gaunt reflection staring back.I stood up to walk to the shelf with the Group K rats. I was a little bit dizzy upon standing up too quickly. Maybe Debra was right, I needed to eat. There were twelve rats in small separate enclosures. All of them had been given cancer with varying brain tumor sizes. I injected a precise amount of Serum-K into each of their spinal cords.
 
Rat #K12 was cold to the touch, and appeared limp and unmoving, but I injected the serum anyway. Maybe it could work even though the rat is dead. I grabbed the flask of Serum-K off the shelf, and turned around to walk back to my bench. The spinning motion made me dizzy again. I took a few steps before my vision started to go black around the edges. I dropped the flask of serum, and it shattered on the floor in front of me. I started to lose control of my balance and my ears rang. I fell with outstretched arms onto the broken glass mess. A sharp pain shot up my arms before my head smacked into the ground. I saw the yellow puddle of serum turn red with the blood from my hands and wrist as my vision faded completely black.

I slowly opened my eyes and squinted at the intense white light of the lab. My face was still resting in a puddle of red serum. I was slightly disoriented, and confused how I got there. I sprung to my feet and dried my face off with the sleeve of my lab coat. Then I remembered what happened. I looked at my bloodstained sleeve that had a gaping hole where a shard of glass sliced through. My skin didn’t have a single scratch on it. I inspected my hands and wrists, and wiped all of the blood away. The skin was a little bit tender, but they looked completely healed on the surface.

“The serum...It must have worked.” I said aloud. I was filled with joy, and a smile was fixed onto my face. I ran over to the shelf with the Group K rats. All of the rats were moving around in the cage with an uncharacteristic vigor, but rat #K12 remained unmoving. I placed one of the living rats into the portable PET scanner. The results showed no tumor in the brain, or anywhere else. I was overcome with excitement. I began to jump around the lab in celebration with a newfound energy that I hadn’t felt in months. I stopped myself. Now wasn’t the time for celebration, I needed to give the serum to Kate...*before her surgery*. Sunlight was shining brightly through the window along the wall.

I began to panic, and I ran to my lab bench and swung a drawer open to grab my phone. *13 missed calls, and 4 new voicemails from Debra*. I looked at the time, 4:00 PM.

“Wait a second, it can’t be 4:00 PM...It was 5:00 PM in the video chat with Debbie...”
 I looked at the date displayed on the phone, and my heart sunk. I had been unconscious for almost 24 hours. “Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!” I opened up the voice mails and let them play.

**7:31 AM**: *“James, get here now. Kate is waiting for you. You better be on your way.”*

**8:32 AM:** *“What the hell are you doing, James? Kate needs you here. She won’t stop asking for you, and she is getting really upset.”*

**9:40 AM:** “You really are a peice of shit. I didn’t actually believe you were capable of stooping to this level. Don’t bother contacting me or Kate ever again.

**3:52 PM:** The message began with sniffles, and stuttered breathing. *“Are you happy with yourself”* she cried. *“She...She didn’t make it through the surgery...”* I covered my mouth in horror at the words. Tears began streaming down my face as I stifled back cries. *“How can you possibly live with yourself now?”* The message ended, and I sat for a moment in silence.

I slumped down in my chair, and stared at the picture on my desk. It was Kate, Debra, and I from a year before our divorce. We were in the backyard on a sunny afternoon, their golden hair blew gently in the breeze. It reminded me of *vitrosii’s* thin tentacles floating through the water. We were so happy in this picture. Kate was cancer free, Debra and I still loved each other. We thought we had everything figured out. I would give anything to to return to that reality. I neglected my daughter in the time when she needed me the most, and I let my ego drive me into a self destructive spiral. A delusional method of avoiding the problems that were right in front of me. I can’t believe I let myself do that, it infuriated me.

I looked up at the aquarium next to the rat shelf. The *Turritopsis vitrosii* hovered in the center near the glass. It’s red core staring at me like a menacing eye. I stared back at it, my face felt hot as I got angrier. I picked up the picture from my desk, and tightened my grip on the bronze frame. I threw it with all of my strength at the creature, and shattered the glass enclosure. I watched as hundred gallons of water flooded onto the floor of the lab. It washed away the broken glass and bloody serum from the floor. I stood there as the water washed over my shoes. I walked over to the broken aquarium to see the *vitrosii* resting in a few inches of the shallow water that remained. I wondered how long this jellyfish had been alive. Hundreds of years? Thousands? There was really no way of knowing. I picked it up by the gelatinous exterior and placed it into the incinerator. I looked through the window, it glowed with flickering orange flames, I listened to it sizzle and pop in the heat.

To my left, the Group K rats scurried in their enclosures, enjoying their new found life. I walked down the row to the 12th enclosure and looked at the motionless rat surrounded by soft bedding. I stared at its lifeless body. I reached out and brushed it’s soft grey fur.

“I’m sorry, I was too late to save you.” I whispered.

 Rat #K12’s whiskers fluttered, and his eyes slowly opened to the white light of the lab."

6emxwo,45,2017-06-01,[MF] the time I fucked my gf in the same car as my mom.,Aarkans,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6emxwo/mf_the_time_i_fucked_my_gf_in_the_same_car_as_my/,"It was summer a few years ago, and I was on holidays in Greece with my mom and a few friends, while my girlfriend was working in Paris for an internship. Charlotte was French, 5ft tall, dark blonde hair, amazing DD cups and a phat ass. By far the hottest girl I've ever been with and way out of my league.

&amp;nbsp;

As a three-day weekend was coming up, we had the brilliant idea of her flying out to see me for a long weekend in Greece. As she was scheduled to land late at night, my mom and a friend proposed to drive me there to pick her up, as the airport was an hour away. 

&amp;nbsp;

Her flight lands, and she comes out wearing tight leggings that hug her ass perfectly, and a tight top with a nice cleavage. We get in the back of this minivan we had rented, as we were 6 people traveling together in Greece. It's late at night, the inside of the van is pitch black, and we're making out with our hands all over each other. At this point we hadn't seen each other in well over two months, and she'd been an obedient little slut by not wearing any underwear, as she'd been told. I start nibbling on her earlobe, and kissing her neck while she struggles not to moan. We lie down on the backseat and end up spooning, as she starts grinding her ass against me. I was wearing sweatpants for this exact reason, as I pull my dick out and nestle it between her ass cheeks, as she keeps grinding against me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I can feel her warmth through her leggings, and see her struggling not to moan as I kiss the back of her neck while firmly holding her neck in my hand. I then reach down and pull down her leggings, knowing we're playing a very dangerous game with my mom and her friend in the front seat, driving and making small talk, but we love being risky so this is pushing all the right buttons. I slide my dick along her soaking wet pussy, and she looks back at me with lust in her eyes. This is the riskiest thing in our lives we're about to do, but when my hard dick slides against her wet pussy reasoning goes out the window. I slowly push the tip in as she pushes her ass against me and it felt so incredible.

&amp;nbsp;

The long wait and the excitement as we're about to have sex in a van with other people made this feel amazing. I struggle not to cum as I start thrusting slowly inside her. She's arching her back as I have one hand firmly holding her hair, and the other shoving two fingers down her mouth. She's licking my fingers clean and doing everything she can not to moan, as I keep kissing her all over her neck. 

&amp;nbsp;

We realize we're on the verge of having full-on sex, and that would really be much too risky. We stop half-way, much to our disappointment, but the fun isn't quite over yet. We fold down the middle row of seats that was hiding us, and we sit on them so we're closer to the front. As I'm sitting in the middle, leaning towards the front to make conversation with my mom, Charlotte has something else in mind. She's sitting on the right side behind my mom, and with a devilish grin pulls out my cock again. I'm still sporting a semi that she quickly takes into her mouth and licks clean. She's blowing me slowly as not to make any sound, and I'm trying to maintain a straight face while getting my dick sucked a feet away from my mother. She gets me rock hard again without much trouble, and takes me deep down her throat, while sometimes licking my dick up and down, and sucking on my balls. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again we can only really fool around, as anything full blown sexual act would be too obvious. She teases me by going ever so slowly, as I keep droning on about whatever we were talking about with my mom.

&amp;nbsp;

We get home at 11pm, hornier than ever and under the guise of a tiring day we quickly retreat to our room. I close the door and order her to get naked, and she's happy to obey. She lies down on the bed face down ready for me, with her pussy soaking wet and desperate for a pounding. I get naked and kneel behind her, as she pushes her ass back towards me, begging me without a word. I slowly push my my dick in, until I'm deep inside her, and enjoy the moment for a second. I grab her hair in one hand, and put the other on her waist, and start gently thrusting into her tight pussy. She moves a hand to cover her mouth again, as I firmly hold her against me by her hair. I start thrusting harder and deeper as she lets out a few moans of pleasure and pain. ""fuuuck you're so deep"" she lets out between moans. I'm stretching her little pussy and she's bouncing back against me even harder.

&amp;nbsp;

I grab her waist with both my hand and now start pounding her hard and fast and she moans she's gonna cum. I give her one big slap on her ass, at the risk of being heard, and she moans even harder. I felt her tense up so I grabbed her hair and pulled her back up, as I reached out with my other hand to choke her. ""are you gonna cum for me?"" I ask her and she nods, as I start nibbling on her earlobes. She finally cums, and falls back down onto the bed, as I lie down on top of her. She raises her ass against me and I start thrusting again. ""I'm gonna cum all over your face, you slut"" I whisper again. ""yes please"" she answers, as she pushes her ass out even more. I can feel myself getting close, so i start pounding as hard as I can, until I quickly pull out, and stand up. ""come here"" I'm barely finished talking that she's already on her knees in front of me, rubbing her clit furiously with one hand, clocking her head back with her tongue out. I slap her across her face, but she's unfazed. I quickly jerk myself to finish, and cum thick ropes across her face and tits, before pushing her head onto my dick. She sucks my dick dry, and then gently licks my balls before wiping the cum off her face and tits with her fingers and licking them clean. ""you love swallowing don't you"", she nods. 

&amp;nbsp;

Needless to say we slept like babies that night. "

And a 7 mile round-trip to my internship. 

The seller of the Riva has to sell by Friday since he'll be moving out of town. I'm hoping I can get a desperation fire sale if he still has it by then. 

I'll be viewing the Kymco to tomorrow. If she is willing to let it go for $1100 I will be inclined to take it. 

Riva Pros:
-nearby
-it's a Yamaha
-lower in price 
-well taken care of w/ records/receipts of services
-comes with a helmet &amp; battery tender
-custom rear basket
-custom choke or bypass valve (I think that's what it's called?)

Riva Cons:
-needs new gas cap
-rusty exhaust and rims
-""older""

Like Pros:
-""newer""
-comes with battery tender
-low miles
-fuel injected

Like Cons:
-far from home
-higher in price
-not a true 200cc (actually 163cc)

What's your take on my choices and reasoning?

Thanks in advance for your input!

Yesterday, I was informed that my grandmother had passed away at my family's home in the morning/early afternoon. My grandfather (her husband) passed away three weeks ago, so my mother brought her to live with us. She had Parkinson's disease and was too weak and saddened to be by herself. Sitting with my dog during the day and eating dinner with the family at night seemed to help her feel less lonely. As my brother is still in high school, both my parents work, and I have an internship, we are not home during the day. Although the autopsy result is pending, we believe she fell in my bedroom (where she was living in the house), suffocated, and passed on. As you can imagine, we are feeling immense guilt for her suffering and not being there in her time of need as we were not there when she fell and didn't find her until 6pm. 

What I am asking for is help with finding prayers for this. As I am new to Christianity and do not have a specific denomination, I am open to any and all prayer suggestions. I want find prayers for her and her suffering. I would also like to know if there are any prayers to specific Saints or prayers in general that can help my family deal with our guilt.

Thank you for any help you can give!"

During my junior year of high school, I was able to obtain an internship (40 hours) in a marketing department under their Marketing Manager. This was my first exposure to what was apart of marketing and the process of analyzing data and the importance of the team aspect (at least at this business) in the creation of a marketing campaign. 

I have just finished my first year of college in the business administration program with a focus in marketing at a popular community college. 

My grades have been terrible due to my ability in math classes. I have never been very good at higher level math (calculus in particular). In my first semester I failed statistics 1 because of laziness (I know, not good!) and business calculus in my 2nd semester. 

My question is, with my terrible track record, besides raising my grades (working on my self discipline) how could I stack the deck in my favor of being a likely candidate in the future for a marketing firm? 

I'm not sure if this belongs in this subreddit, or if it violates any rules. But, I figured I would ask.

I'd love to bounce a few role play ideas up and see what you would be interested. If there's something you've had trouble finding a partner for, let's chat about it. Maybe we can make something work:)

First, I've had a big fantasy about a secret office romance. An intern or entry level girl being seduced by the boss. I'm very much submissive, and would love to have my married boss dominate me and show me how he wants me to act at work. From what I wear, to who I talk to, nothing is off limits to my master. 

Second, I've been toying with a weight gain fantasy. I haven't really played with it in the past, but I think it would be fun to play around with. Maybe you like me bigger, and you either hypnotize me or have an app that allows you control over my mind. I find myself eating all day, and slowly, my clothes start to not fit, and then my friends stop talking to me. You find me in a depressed and swollen state, comfort and seduce me. 

Third, your personal maid. I love the idea of being a maid to a married couple, but being naughty with either husband or wife (or both!). When it comes to these fantasies, I get very nasty, and I'm okay with scat and piss. Again, I prefer to be the submissive. I don't want to peg you. Sorry, that's just not for me. 

Finally, your dream girl/celebrity. I want to help people achieve their fantasies, and I've noticed that a lot of times, people dream about fucking certain celebrities in the dirtiest of ways. I'd love to be her. I want to play your Sofia Vergara, your Taylor Swift, your Audrey Hepburn. I want to be whoever you desire most, and play out your darkest fantasy. 

Send me a message to get started. Include ""suit"" in the title so I know you read through this. 

Kinks: bondage; domination; impreg; piss; scat; lesdom; teaching 
Limits: blood, pegging, permanent damage, beast.

6eprzt,65,2017-06-01,6 things I wish I knew before working as an electric on my first feature,tonivuc,cinematography,https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/6eprzt/6_things_i_wish_i_knew_before_working_as_an/,"My background: 9 months of practical film school. 12 months freelance gaffer, best boy or electrician on low to medium budget shorts, commercials and music videos. Read most of [Set Lighting Technician's Handbook.](https://www.amazon.com/Set-Lighting-Technicians-Handbook-Distribution/dp/0240810759)

I recently got to work 4 days on a medium budget feature film here in Norway as they filmed around my city. I got the job by applying via email. Had good references from some of the production companies in the area.

Before this I thought I knew it all (or almost at least).
Oh boy was I wrong.

1. At one point we were tying down a a big diffusion frame. And I didn't know any knots. I had anticipated this and done some training but it had all escaped me in the moment. That was fun when everyone was super stressed. Basically I just stood there and gave people a hammer when I had the chance. GG no re. [Check out howtofilmschool for some knot tutorials.](http://howtofilmschool.com/knots-every-grip-should-know/)

2. How to coil giant ass cables. Lucky for me the best boy was friendly and showed me how. You kneel, turn your back to the cable. Then you drag it in front of you, and looping it on the ground. This gives you a lot of control and doesn't strain your back. If anyone has other techniques feel free to share.

3. Not knowing where anything is in the truck. Tip: The gel name is on the end of the roll, you don't have to guess what it is... (Took me 3 times to cut the senior electric the right combination of gels (""NOT STRAW dammit"")). Otherwise, if you aren't doing anything and nobody needs you, go to the truck and figure out where every single thing is. When we had wrapped one of the senior electrics told me he wasn't going to bring me on set for at least a year because it took me longer to find something he asked for, than for him to find it himself.

4. Try to learn gripping. (At least in countries outside of the US)
In Norway the electrics do everything lighting related. That includes crazy rigging. Grips ""only"" move the camera. When 3 electrics were rigging a huge crane with HMIs and diffusion frames I really just had to stand by. I had no idea how to rig that safely. Right now I'm trying to learn this but I don't really know where as difficult rigs are mostly done on high end commercials and features here. Tips?

5. Work out your entire body. On a feature, everything was BIGGER and heavier. I know very well that it's worse to injure myself or the equipment than ask for help, so I always did when I felt overwhelmed. But it still sucks to be the weakest guy on set. My strength is compeltely average, but it's just not good enough. You should be able to lift heavy lights on top of stands... Tip: You can setup a light stand, and lift the light onto the stand, from the back of the truck. So you don't have to lift it so high where it's hard to balance. Also you can mount the light while the stand is laying on the ground, then tilt the stand up, but maybe someone else can elaborate here as I only did it once?

6. Learn about power phases, electrical distribution and the different high power cables available where you are. I'd probably recommend going to a friendly studio and looking at their power outlets. Maybe someone there can explain the different cables. Took me some minutes to figure out what they were asking for.

So yeah, those are the things I kick myself in the sleep for. Some things are harder to prepare for than others. But hopefully this helps somebody. I'm traveling to the capital of Norway this summer to try to learn more about gripping.

*Question:* Should I try to get on the next big set as a lighting intern, or as an electric? I've learned a lot over these 4 days so I'm certainly not as lost as I was, but I still don't know advanced gripping and don't want to disappoint. I've never heard about ""lighting interns"" before, and nobody asks for one. So I'm a bit hesitant. But working seems to be the only way to learn."

He is currently in the process of filling for bankruptcy. Today his landlords (who are supposed to be good-hearted church goers) raised his rent $100 after saying they never would. I want to help him so bad but I don't know what to do. As I typed this he came and told me he's moving. Now we have to find him a place he can stay with his two dogs. I feel so bad for leaving and right now I'm trying to be someone he can talk to. I can hear him crying right now. What the hell is this world coming to when an honest, good-hearted man gets screwed from every angle possible? I feel so bad for moving out."

I got approved within a day, which is awesome, so I was just sort of wondering what to expect.

If anyone has any experience in Pittsburgh, or in a comparable city, with doing specifically deliveries:

How frequently will I get opportunities to do a delivery? Will it be a constant thing, or are they fairly uncommon?

How much money should I expect if I'm doing this part-time? (I have a part time internship with a web development company as well, so I am doing this to supplement my income, probably hoping to work 15-20 hours/wk).

Are there any other tips or advice I should know before starting this?

And finally, I opened my app and tried to go online at my home in Lancaster, PA, and it told me that I was not allowed to operate in Lancaster.  I'm assuming this is because I'm not in Pittsburgh yet, but I just wanted to make sure this wasn't some other issue I should get fixed before I move to Pittsburgh and find that I can't work right away.

If anyone could help me with these questions, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!"

Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I have a general idea of what each job is like, but there is none that I'm hard set on choosing. But I must choose because I need to pay my bills and have a huge student loan. I believe I can learn quickly regardless of the field, but wish I knew which would be the most interesting and the best fit.

[rant] [discussion],Narcsharks,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6erw74/were_anyone_elses_nparents_particularly_abusive/,"I recently graduated high school and am beyond excited to move on with my life and move out of my house for college come August. My nmom, though, is making sure that my last summer at home is a memorable one, and not for the better. 


Every summer my mom insists and yells at me that I should find a job instead of spending all my time with my friends. Every summer for as long as I've could, I've found myself a job and that has seemed to appease her. This summer, the same thing happened. So I found a job, and then another (the second one was one that she suggested). I've been doing my first job part time and will begin my second job, which is a paid internship, in a couple of weeks. Despite this, my mom's anger seems to flare up any time I am out with friends. A couple of nights ago I was at an event with some friends that I had given her three week's notice I would be at and she still sent me angry messages, with quotes such as ""What does it matter what I think?? You do whatever you want anyways!"", ""If only you dedicated as much time to working at to your family as you do to your friends!!!!! "", and ""We're going to talk when you get home, and I don't want you to be making any faces or yelling at me."" 

That talk ended with me locked up in my room for the past two days, not wanting to leave or see anyone. I've only left to go the bathroom and to eat, and even then only after taking special care to make sure that nmom wasn't home. My edad and ebrother have been getting yelled too (about me and my ""egoism"" as she calls it), and she has come into my room a couple of times to yell at me too. 

Getting back to the point, my nmom used to always be this bad, but she hadn't been for a long while. A friend that I recently tried opening up to for the first time suggested that she's just going to miss me next year and wants to spend more time with me, to which I replied that that might be, but she's mainly just a narcissistic control freak. Now I'm wondering if perhaps what he said could have some merit though, have any of you experienced an uptick in abuse in your last few weeks before you moved out? 
Thanks for reading."

6escvp,19,2017-06-02,OMFG WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING,ProfessorJNFrink,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/6escvp/omfg_what_the_hell_is_happening/,"So, Tiny Tot's (he's two years and two months) daycare is wonderful and amazing and magical, but only operates during the academic year. They teach my kid so many good habits and had him on a great sleep/nap schedule. They would stuff the kids full of lunch, clean up, change diapers,  and then at 12 pm the white noise machine goes on and they say ""okay, kids! Time for sleep!"" And then all the toddlers would go to their cots and lay down and go to sleep within minutes like angels. 

Since it's the summer, for the last three weeks, I've been on my own for the most part. Had a baby sitter (who was an intern at magical daycare) here and there on days I had stuff to do and she would get my kid down for a nap no problem. But the days it's me? Takes me over an hour at least to get him down. And I don't even both trying at 12 PM any more because he shows no signs of being tired and it takes even longer to get him to sleep.

He sings, he wiggles, he talks, he does everything but tries to sleep. Usually after 45-60 minutes of me pretending to sleep myself, shushing him, patting his back, telling him it's time to sleep ump-teen times THEN he goes to sleep for a few hours.

It's happening at night too. His bedtime is moving later and later and same story: he sings, he asks to play tricks, he talks. For over an hour. In a pitch black room.

I'm seriously at my wit's end. I have wasted so many hours over the last few weeks trying so hard to get this kid to sleep. I'm 9 months pregnant and I'm so tired myself. I'm always needing a nap when he goes down and now that his bedtime has crept up to 10 PM at night, I'm dead tired by the time he is FINALLY asleep enough that I can leave the room (because I have hell to pay if I leave too soon). I'm so tired and so frustrated and so bored!

What the hell happened to his schedule? Why am I so incompetent that I can't seem to get my kid to sleep? What the hell am I going to do when Number 2 gets here (literally any day now!)?

I am a software engineer/machine learning student graduating soon. I am planning to start my career in Shanghai from this summer as my girlfriend is living there and that we both really love Shanghai. We have been living in long distance for almost the whole duration of our relationship and have been dreaming about this reunion in Shanghai for long time. (I’m French she’s Chinese)

Doing a 6-months internship is a requirement from my home university. I have been looking for opportunities for around 2 months now maybe, I had interesting ones but I couldn’t make it happen for visa issues. The most recent one killed me:

 I got interviewed by a big automobile company in Shanghai to work in a research team, on automatic driving. I really loved the offer but unfortunately we couldn’t make an agreement because of the visa. Indeed, seems like it is necessary for foreign students to have part of their education in Chinese university, which I don’t. I tried to find alternatives ways to get a proper visa to be able to work with them:  - getting hired by a consulting company and being sent in mission for 6 months  - studying mandarin in language agency and get a 6months X2 study visa, and realise this internship as a side project. 
After nearly 3 weeks of negotiations, both options got rejected and I’m afraid there is nothing I can do to get this offer anymore…

They also told me that I might not be able to find any possible agreement with any company for internship in Shanghai.

I have a back up plan in a small company, but to be honest the offers are not really interesting and this is not really my field. They provide for their interns 6 months business visa. This is definitely not completely legit and I’m afraid that it would discredit me when i’ll be looking for full time job, when they will learn that I’ve been working with a business visa.

I am still looking for potential companies hiring for interns but I am afraid that I’ll meet the same issue every single time.
I wanna keep fighting, I wanna find a way. If I don’t we would probably won’t be able to keep it up with my girlfriend.  Had anyone have the same experience and managed to solve it?  Thanks a lot for your help, would really appreciate.
 Regards! "
6eu8bj,1,2017-06-02,Should I quit my stressful McJob ?,McGregorFTW,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6eu8bj/should_i_quit_my_stressful_mcjob/,"Hey ! 

I'm a 19yo student who's going abroad with Erasmus next year, and I need a lot of money for that, I mean a lot of money for a student ( but not that much for someone who has a normal full time job ). 

Sheffield will cost me about **350€/month of rent**, **100€/month of food ( hopefully not more )**, and I plan on spending **100€/month on leisure** ( parties, travelling.. ), possibly more.

I calculated that at the end of my semester abroad, I'll still have **1400€ left** if I spend exactly this much on the 3 parts of my budget. Rent may be a little cheaper than expected, and food/leisure a bit more expensive, these are just averages. 

When I come back from England, I'll get my bike driving licence, which will cost me about **1 000€** ( I'll get **160€/month** from the government as I'm a student, and hopefully I'll get money from my internship in a business company in May and June, if I do it'll be about **1 000€ for 2 months** ), it's not compulsory, it's just something I'd like to do. Plus I get 25€ a month for doing freelance work ( hopefully it'll grow overtime and reach a certain amount that I can count as a salary, I'm just not counting it in the **1400€ left** as it's not that much for now )

So basically I CAN quit my job and still do everything I want in Sheffield. But working at McDonald's in June will make me **450€ more**, which is like a **month worth of food and rent in Sheffield**, which is really good. The thing is, I hate my job I'm at the lowest "" rank "" of the social ladder anyone can ever be at, I hate being managed, being told what to do, when to do it and how to do it the way McDonald's managers do ( they're not mean ( for the most part ), and they have to do it, but I just hate it ). I hate not being in control of what I do. Plus I'm supposed to go to work at 6.30pm this evening, and finish at 1am tomorrow ( this is a typical shift for me ), so I'll get back home, sleep, get up late tomorrow and realise I won't be able to do anything productive and a bit too time-taking because it'll be the same tomorrow, and Sunday too. And last but not least, it's really stressful. I'd like to work in Marketing, I know it's a stressful field, but at least I know I'll do something that I like and/or earning a decent salary. Cleaning tables, cooking sandwiches and smiling fakely to clients is not something I like to do, especially given my hourly salary. I'm not really good at it ( except smiling ), but they still keep me for some reason, and overall it makes me so stressed.. and also my parents think it's kind of too bad to quit my job and say good bye to 450€ 


So what should I do, should I keep on being a slave, earning 1/100 of what I make them earn, being stressed, not being free on weekends, thus not doing anything of half of my week, but getting 450€ at the end of the month, or should I quit, knowing that it **may** ( it's not even sure, whatever happens I'll still live there with a roof over my head and with food ) be hard to travel while I'm abroad ?


If anyone has ever been in this situation, or basically if anyone has any thought about this, I'm all ears, I think I need a few votes, for or against, to make a decision.

Thanks a lot !"

She's 12 years old, tiny, and absolutely [adorable](https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/19384502_1491230598.26.png). She's afraid of anything and everything, but if she warms up to you she will drown you in kisses. When she gets excited, she will sometimes let loose the most high-pitched howl you've ever heard. Her favorite activities are [nesting in a pile of warm blankets](http://i.imgur.com/3Kne2Do.jpg) and devouring whatever food she can get ahold of, especially potato chips. We sing to her, include her in our jokes and games, both talk to and about her constantly, and consider her as much a member of the family as anyone else. She's our [little baby](http://i.imgur.com/cKbvkrf.jpg).

Towards the beginning of April, Sweetie started showing signs of jaundice and loss of appetite. My girlfriend and I took her to the vet and did everything we could for her, including having an incredibly risky liver biopsy done to determine what might be causing her problems. We stressed and worked tirelessly to find some kind solution for her. Through it all, Sweetie was an absolute champ. Sadly, as of June 1st, we've been told that she's showing the first signs of what will inevitably be total liver failure.

Sweetie only has maybe a month left with us.

This news has devastated us, but we're trying our best to deal with it. Unfortunately, lately the phrase ""when it rains it pours"" could not be any more appropriate. On May 1st, two days before her capstone presentation for her final semester of college, my girlfriend got into a horrible accident which absolutely [destroyed her car](http://i.imgur.com/KnDCeFs.jpg) (thankfully she came out unharmed). This has set us back considerably, and in order to graduate, this summer she'll need to work 400 hours at an internship that won't be able to pay her. This means she can't work as many hours as normal at her regular job, while my hours have been getting cut due to poor sales from my company. We also need to save money to move across the state of Michigan by August 15th (when our lease is up) so that my girlfriend can find a career to start paying back her student loans this fall. In addition to all of this, we have a small mountain of vet bills to conquer from trying to get Sweetie as much help as we possibly could. Long story short, we can not catch a break.

Within the timespan of two months we've been exhausted, financially tapped out, and unable to properly set ourselves up for a stable future. If we could get any kind of assistance with at least one of these problems, then we'll actually stand a chance of getting out of this deep, deep pit of emotional and financial turmoil. So I ask, if you or anyone you know have anything to spare, or even know how to help in some other way, please consider looking at and sharing our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/help-save-the-sweetie). If we can just cover the cost of our veterinary bills, that should be more than enough to help us get back to moving forward on the right foot. We're already losing our little baby Sweetie, we don't want to lose everything else, too.

Thank you for listening.

**Random Thoughts**

- We sure got a crap ton of Joe’s this episode.
- Addison thinks Russell Crowe is cute. Unh-unh, nope, he is NOT cute anymore. [Exhibit A](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000312079106.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=768&amp;quality=100) 
- I love how George, Izzie, and Cristina were all blocking Derek as he tried to talk to Meredith.
- I can’t help but smile that Addison requested Meredith to be her intern. Love it!
- George is finding out loads of stuff today. He is not inconspicuous at all, but no one is noticing him.
- I’m glad they finally addressed how expensive visiting the hospital is.
- I feel like the Joe story line should have waited until they’d spent more time at the bar. I think it would have had more emotional impact.
- I spy a budding romance betwixt Alex and Izzie. 
- I don’t know what is up with all this berating of patients and/or their families. It’s become quite irksome. First, Bailey with the autopsy people and now, Addison. Like that woman’s life already sucks (her husband left her and her babies are sick). Can we not be mean to the pregnant lady?
- Speaking of Addison I don’t like how they revealed she was a cheater. It was weird.

**Tearjerker Moment**

- Alex acting like a human being and hugging George for what he did for Joe.
- Burke dumping Cristina

**Quotes**

- “Let’s play a game of whose life sucks the most.” - I feel like Meredith is still playing this game in season 13. She’s totally winning.
- “They’re slabs of meat. We’re butchers.”
- “I’m an evil mistress.” “Still, you look nice.”
- “Why even confide in me at all if you’re so intent on not discussing it?”
- “You’re my person.”

**Questions**

- Which relationship do you think defines Grey’s the most, Meredith and Derek or Meredith and Cristina?
- So does the fact that Addison cheated on him absolve Derek?"

Where should we go?,heinekenpapi,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/6evbsh/girlfriend_and_i_would_like_to_travel_this_coming/,"My girlfriend and I are both graduating university and will have enough money saved up to travel a bit in the fall after both our summer internships are over. We are super open to suggestions and would be flying out of Toronto. Right now we are considering anywhere from California to Costa Rica.

Length: around 2 weeks

Budget: anything below $1000, we'd much prefer stay in an airbnb - beach bungalo type of place rather than an all inclusive resort

Climate: we both would really like tropical + sunny weather. Taking this into consideration, we are a bit weary of travelling to central America in the fall as it is hurricane season, but would love feedback to see if there are certain areas that are more likely to have nicer weather.

Interests: 
50% beach (relaxing, maybe surfing &amp; reading on nice beaches)
25% hiking (any kind of physical activity enjoying the nature around us, zip lining, exploring caves and such)
25% exploring the area we're in (visiting markets, looking at at any historical buildings - i would love to see some Mayan ruins, for example)

Safety is obviously of importance, we don't know much about travelling in central america about safe/unsafe certain countries/regions are. I'm fully fluent in french and understand decently well Spanish. Getting ripped off is also kind of a concern.

That's about it! Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll try to clarify."
6evfsc,1,2017-06-02,"Me [21/F] with everyone, feel like I'm good at nothing and a constant fuck up.",230895230895,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6evfsc/me_21f_with_everyone_feel_like_im_good_at_nothing/,"Hey guys, I could really do with some advice and a friendly word too because I've never felt this worthless in my life, I won't lie. 

I've been quite average all my life. I got through school with mainly Bs, a couple of As... I never really stood out as someone who would be Prime Minister or change the world. For a while this annoyed me but I've come to accept it now and set goals that are achievable and know that success doesn't have to be such a grandiose thing, it can be little things. I think this average-ness has led some people to underestimate me in the past and for quite a lot of people to think I was stupid. I used this to motivate me to do well when I was accepted into University.

I graduated University last year and I was honestly on top of the world. I graduated with First class honours in History with three internships under my belt - as soon as I graduated I walked into a job with a Google partner company. I used the money I'd saved from working a part time job at Uni to put down the deposit on a flat I now rent by myself and moved straight from my University house to the flat I live in now, 200 miles from my parents. 

I've never once thought this meant I was set for life; ultimately I know a degree really doesn't mean that much anymore. The bottom line of this back story was I had an understanding that I was at least fairly intelligent and had - for my age - a good deal of work experience that would serve me pretty well in an entry level graduate role. As well as this I'm doing all I can to be independent.

Fast forward a year and it's the exact opposite. I feel useless and worth nothing. After a great start at my job, getting on well with my team and managing my responsibilities well, in the past month I've been knocked for six. I recently went through a health scare where I was tested rigorously for type 1 diabetes which has taken its toll on my emotions but I thought I was handling it okay. I'm also into sport and take my sport quite seriously - as a lot of people know that can take its toll emotionally, mentally and physically too. At work I seem to be making small mistakes that add up; none that cost the company money but ones that I'm scared make me look stupid and incompetent. I'm trying; checking everything thoroughly and doing my utmost to make sure my work is of high quality, but I keep making so many small mistakes. It's annoying because I know I can do better, but the more I try it seems the more I fuck up. This was exacerbated by the guy I work with who is at the same level as me say a few weeks ago apropos of nothing that he ""should really be my boss, or my boss's boss"". Granted this guy has more experience than me, but I think that's fair to say it would knock a lot of people's confidence. 

Recently my boss noticed that I'd changed; that my motivation and productivity had dipped and she seemed really worried about it. I put it down to me just being exhausted and that I'd be okay after a restful weekend. I vowed to come back on the Monday and really do my utmost to kick ass, and I'm still keeping to that. But I'm still fucking up and I'm at the point now where I wonder whether I can actually do /anything/ well. I'm leaving my job in 3 months as I have been accepted onto a research degree in my chosen area of interest; if there's something I know I'm good at it's research (and writing as #2). But how much I'm fucking up at the moment is making me question if I'm even good at the things I thought I was good at and more so, if I'll even last more 3 months in the job I'm in. It isn't helped by the fact that my boyfriend is so so incredible at his job and has a real talent for what he does. Obviously I'm so proud of him but I can't help but compare, you know? I look at how happy he is in his job and how well he gets on with his colleagues and then there's me. 

The past week I've had about 3 panic attacks over this and right now I can't picture it improving. I spoke to my mum about it - I'm so scared of disappointing her. Her response was that I'm trying my hardest, I do what I can, and that's all that matters - that the only person I'm disappointing is myself because I hold myself to very high standards. Which I do see some truth in. But despite me working as hard as I can I can't help but feel like I fuck everything up and that I'm dead woman walking in my job. I just don't know. Any suggestions on what to do?

tl;dr: I feel useless at everything feat. long life story at the start. "
6evlmp,0,2017-06-02,Just graduated and am currently waiting for a job. Have 1.7k in credit card debt and about 1k in other miscellaneous debts. Should I use upstart.com?,Jriz909,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6evlmp/just_graduated_and_am_currently_waiting_for_a_job/,"Hi r/personalfinance,

this is my first post on this subreddit. As the title says, I just graduated with a BS in computer science with a solid GPA, past internship experience, numerous side projects, etc. So I'm not too worried about being able to get a job. I have a part time, $300/week job already set up that starts at the end of this month (June) as a back up just in case. I am also currently in an email exchange with a CEO of a startup that has verbally expressed interest in hiring me after the startup just got VC funding. He says he wants me on board and at one point said something about me earning six figures. Again, I'm just waiting for an official offer which should be coming very soon.

However, I'm currently totally broke and have about 3k total debt between a credit card and a few other things and my next credit card payment is coming up. 

I checked upstart.com for a personal loan and since I have a good degree and a promising financial future, they are offering me a 3 year loan for 4k and 12.35% APR. $125/month payments. This seems like a pretty good rate to me and I imagine I'll be able to pay it back long before 3 years once I get started working full time. 

What do you guys think?

EDIT: Also as a side note I have zero student debt and I plan on living at home for the first few months after I start working to maximize my savings."
6evprq,6009,2017-06-02,The Loser's Guide to Getting Over [OC],darpachief,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6evprq/the_losers_guide_to_getting_over_oc/,"""I FINALLY paid off $8 of credit card debt in 2 years while making $95k!""

""My Grandfather, the CEO of a prestigious candy bar company, left me 250k after he died! Should I visit all 490 countries or start a boutique pickle company?""

I'm exaggerating here, but growing up poor, some of the headlines on personalfinance have screamed ""First world problems!"" at times, and helped to reinforce the kind of uncertainty and anxiety I had as a Poor. I couldn't help but think that being secure in my own life was a pipe dream.

As a foreword, I wanted to write to this post as a sort of tribute to r/pf (and r/frugal) because of all the invaluable information I've learned from it over the past few years, and how I've applied those lessons to my own life. But I also wanted to write this for those people who, like me, happened to be born poor, isolated, or desperate to escape your circumstances.

A bit about me: I was raised by a single mother in a working class neighborhood in a large American city. She, my sister, and I lived for many years on a meager social security check we received each month because my father died young, and my sister had Down's Syndrome. 

Finances eased after my mom remarried (to a factory worker), until working class wages stalled in the late 90's and completely cratered around 2008. I received no financial education as a child--I had to google how to write a check at 22 because no one ever thought to tell me. I was also imbued with a healthy distrust of authority. 

Like many of you, I was considered a Child of Promise. It was a foregone conclusion that I would attend college. I was the shining star of the neighborhood, after all, and it was a powerful statement that I was bettering myself. As a first generation college student, coming from a working class school, no one questioned my major (writing), or my school choice (a private art school). I was 17 years old, unwittingly signing up for $80,000 of student loans. 

I was academically prepared for college, sure, but socially I was completely out of my element. Is this story starting to sound familiar? I know now that I'm not alone, not by a long shot. 

I didn't understand the value of making connections. I couldn't take that life changing internship because I worked part-time at my stepfather's factory. I graduated in 2011, right around the most stagnant labor market in 30 years. Saddled with debt and uncertainty, I did what many do:

I didn't pay my loans, I wandered aimlessly, I battled anxiety like a full-time job. It wasn't until several years later, a move across the country (and back) that I started to get my life together. Thanks, in no small part to this sub and others that stressed financial planning, accountability, and discipline.

But what nagged me was that while many people here posted about building something that lasts, I and millions of others were simply working towards that ever elusive 0: no debts, no masters. In fact, I still am. 

What follows is an incomplete list of things I've learned as someone born under the line, that they never taught us in school. That they never taught us at home. That I hope will help you 

1) **No one is coming** - It took a long time to let this one fully sink in. There will be no salvation. I don't mean this in a fatalistic way, just as a matter of fact. No one will pull you from poverty or desperation. Those lottery numbers aren't coming in. Your lady whose house you clean isn't leaving her money to you. The world is indifferent to your suffering. 

I found this freeing: It is solely up to you.

2) **Adapt** Outside of maybe 6 fields, most jobs and careers are teachable to anybody with an 8th grade education. In a sea of equally qualified candidates, you will only stand out as a personality fit. This was a hard pill to swallow as a young person. I lacked social skills, and leaned heavily on my immaculate resume. What an employer really wants is a ""3am guy."" Someone who they don't want to murder on a late night, when the deadline's coming. Someone they can depend on, joke with.  


Put yourself out there

3) **You're not the only fuckup** I let my student loans default in my early 20's because I was literally too afraid to pick up the phone. When you're born poor, your standing is all you have, and the feeling of failure can be immense, unbearable. But you're not the only person struggling. These companies know the system is held afloat by a few top earners and the rest of us paying what we can when we can. Make the call, get your shit straightened out. You'll find them willing to help 9 times out of 10.

4) **Lie** I assume this will be the most controversial point. I have lied on every resume I've ever written. I've lied in every interview I've ever taken. You will not get ahead over someone who has the time and means to perfect themselves. It simply will not happen. Lie, be charming, confident. Lie like your livelihood depends on it. It does. But know that you are now accountable to your lies. Be able to back them up with results. You will not get ahead by luck. The odds say you're not getting ahead at all. 

5) **You have more skills than you realize.** Poor people have a fear of failure ingrained into their psyche because the stakes are real, and many become bitter of people for whom failure is just a minor setback. But failure, true failure, is the greatest learning experience in the world. No rich kid has ever had to come up with $200 by rent day, keep the lights on, find a way to get to work or, pay for a funeral on a line cook's wage. These are the skills to run a business, to run a family, to run your life. You are hungry, and you are sharp. No one can take that away from you.

6evrz8,0,2017-06-02,"Which 0% apr secondary card for me? (800+ score, mba student, have main card already)",SSGSS-SithLord,CreditCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/6evrz8/which_0_apr_secondary_card_for_me_800_score_mba/,"I need a secondary 0% APR card as my previous 0% is about to run out and I'm moving in August for grad school and will need some flexibility with finances. Here is a little about me to help:  
  
*I have an 803 credit score    
*I'll be starting grad school for my MBA in the fall (so the only income I will have it student loans until I start my internships)  
*I have the Amex Blue Cash Preferred for Groceries/Gas as I get 6% and 3% back respectively.  
*I also have a BofA cash back card I don't use and a Chase cash back card that will become inactive in a month when the 0% runs out.  
*My main purchases will be furnishing my apartment, books, school supplies, etc. Basically EVERYTHING except groceries and gas.  
*I will be flying 2-4x round-trips across the country but I don't see much travel in the next 2 years.   

So knowing that I don't believe I'll be eligible for any signup rewards for any BofA or Chase card I've ruled them out. Also I do not want another AMEX so looking for Visa/MasterCard.

My research has narrowed it down to 2 cards.  
*1) Barclay CashForward MC (15 months 0% APR, $200 signup bonus, 1.5% rewards)  
*2) Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa (12 months 0% APR, $200 signup bonus, 1.5% rewards, phone insurance)  

Basically the battle comes down to the 3 extra months 0% APR vs phone insurance.

Which would you do? Also given the above is there perhaps a different card you'd suggest?

Thanks reddit!"
6evzob,1,2017-06-02,Major Help: Can't get My top 2 science professors to respond. Plan B?,yonahwho,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/6evzob/major_help_cant_get_my_top_2_science_professors/,"Hello Everyone: I am panicking a bit about my letters of recommendation. My school does not do a committee letter, and I have had problems getting 2 letters from science professors, strangely enough.

So far I have had no problems getting letters from
 - non-science professor
 - my P.I. for my research
 - My boss &amp; V.P. joint letter for the company I have worked for for nearly 6 years
 - Doctor who was my boss for an 8 month internship I did at a hospital

However I cannot seem to even get responses from two of my science professor. I thought I had 2 that would happily write me letters, but I have emailed them about meeting to discuss over the summer and have heard nothing over two-three weeks. 

I know it is best to drop by in person, but one of them (my biochemistry prof.) is teaching for one of our schools study abroad programs in Europe, so I emailed him about it and the possibility of discussing over Skype or email - no response.

My physics professor may not be on campus frequently over the summer b/c he is a lecturer and doesn't have a research lab nor teach summer classes. I've walked by his office a few times over the past two weeks and every time the door is shut and lights out. I emailed him to see if he could meet me and again, no response. 

These two professors are by far the two who know me best in the science because I was able to take small-section classes with them. 

What is the best route to take next. Do I wait a few more days, and attempt to email them both again? Or should I risk asking other science professor who I had for larger classes and may only know me from 1-2 office hour visits and risk a mediocre letter? 

A final option is asking a professor who likes me and knows me well, but I got a C in his class (Physical chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics). I don't know if its is frowned upon to get a letter from a professor in which you did not get a good grade, even if it is not a pre-req class.

Any advice would help

6ew4ey,236,2017-06-02,Lyric Bitch Gets Me Fired,binibby,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6ew4ey/lyric_bitch_gets_me_fired/,"Still no real update on the therapy situation. Apparently, the place doesn't take her insurance, so I have to/get to be the ""patient on record"". Thanks, TriCare. 

So, onto the first history lesson about Lyric Bitch. This was when I was a senior in High School, so around 2012, to date myself. F(at the time)DH and I were engaged by then, and I was visiting him instead of finishing out the year. My school record is A Mess, because I missed a month of school being in the hospital sophomore year and then a month in junior year when my dad passed, and they didn't tell me for both those semesters I had automatically received failing grades in all my classes for 'skipping' until my senior year. Like an Adult, I rebelled and just gave up.

So, I was planning on visiting him at his military schooling place, originally intending to stay for two weeks. As per usual, Lyric Bitch lost her mind over something and on the way to the airport to drop me off told me I'd better 'fix my attitude and apologize before I came back if I wanted to live with her'. 

I realized that my internship at an art gallery in San Francisco was starting a week or so after I'd be getting back, so I decided to just stay the extra week and fly straight from where DH was training to SF. Towards the end of my stay I got a very smug phone call from Lyric Bitch, asking if I was ready to grovel, basically. I said no, I'd be staying with DH until my internship, and would speak to her at the end of the summer, when the internship ended. 

I should have picked up on her reaction being off, as instead of throwing a temper tantrum and demanding I apologize right then and how could I be so abusive, she was eerily calm. So we get off the phone and despite being kind of shaken up, I feel pretty good. At least, until a few days later, two days before my internship is set to start, when I get a call from the head of the art gallery, who had hired me. 

Art Director: Hi, binibby. Do you have a moment to talk?
Me: Yeah! I'm packing up my stuff right now, thank you again for the opportunity.
Art Director: ........ Yes. Actually I'm calling about that. I actually need to revoke my invitation to you for our internship. 
Me: Excuse me? 
Art Director: It would look bad for our gallery to have someone flighty and unstable working for us. Your mother informed me of your situation and it just doesn't look good for us. I'm sorry. 
Me: Uh. Right. Okay. 
Art Director: Take care! *click*

I sat there in shock for a good hour, alternating staring off into space and bawling my head off. Once I got my shit together, I called Lyric Bitch to confront her.

Me: Mom, what the FUCK?
LB: What? Don't use that tone with me!
Me: You called my BOSS and got me FIRED because I didn't want to apologize?
LB: You wouldn't have been a good fit, anway. It's better off this way! Come home and we can work this all out.
Me: No.
*click*

And, uh, then I stayed for two more months, and DH and I eloped. "

Before we do this though, we want to back up all the existing machines over the network to a server we have in the office.  I tried using Nmap and the command nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24, but after a couple minutes of scanning all it does is report how many IPs it found (256) but not what they are.  I just want a list of devices on our network that I can use to crosscheck when we begin the backup process of each computer."

A little background: I did an internship at my firm in the spring of 2015 and was given a full time offer. I went back to school to finish my senior year and graduated with my 150 in May 2016. 

Initially, my start date was late December 2016 but I was asked to start in the fall. I wanted the summer and fall to work on the CPA, but I was happy with starting in the fall because I was ready for some income. I was able to pass 2/3 before my start date, failing REG and I passed BEC in late November. (Currently waiting until August for my retake score for REG).

I felt like I had a pretty successful busy season and I was ranked in the top of my new hire class by our manager and above group. I'm satisfied with my first raise, but I'm curious what other received in the industry.

Circa late 90s/ early 2000s

For her 18th birthday, Donald and Ivanka were having a little celebration by the pool. They were being attended to by the real estate interns that were working at The Trump Organization, one of which was a young Jared Kushner. One of Donald's favorite traditions was to haze his interns by giving them many non-real estate related tasks. Sometimes, Trump liked to be a bit more cruel than usual in his hazings. 

Donald made a request to one of his interns, ""Jared, I believe Ivanka need some more ice, do you mind?""

""Sure, no problem"" Jared said leaping out of the pool and coming running over to the kitchen. Jared Kushner had been delegated to cleaning the pool, but was up for any task The Donald threw at him. 

On the surface Ivanka appeared to give him little heed. But hidden behind her sunglasses, she took the opportunity to look over, and appraise the half naked young man. Donald has said quite a bit about him, during their last dinner. 

Ivanka: ""Hi Jared. Thanks for the ice""

""Sorry it took so long, and here is your ice."" Jared liked it when he got to interact with Ivanka. She was very pretty, and was always nice to him.

Donald chided him, 'I was just telling her about your physical' (Donald conducted all the company physicals. . . himself)

'Mr Trump!' Jared fumed, quite exasperated, as he started to turn red.

'She didn't believe me, when I said told them that you were already developed, and were so large!'

'MR TRUMP!!!' he was about to die from this embarrassment.

'In fact young man', Donald ordered, 'why don't you just drop that speedo so Ivanka can see that her daddy isn't a liar.

Ivanka couldn't believe he said that, nor could poor Jared. 

'What?'

'You heard me, off with it!' A few seconds went by as he stared him down. Finally his resolve broke, and his hands went to the waist of his swimsuit.

Ivanka gasped as he whipped the speedo down. His cock sprang free.

""Oohh, my, yes you are developed."" Ivanka lifted up her sunglasses, her eyes clearly fastened on his penis and said, ""Jared you have nothing to be ashamed of. Many guys would kill to be hung like you.'

Sitting up in her chair to get a better look, she continued,'Ya know you're already alot bigger then some porn star men are'

Those kinds of comments continued and under her gaze his member started hardening.

'Ooh Look Daddy,' exclaimed Ivanka,'He's getting an erection!'

Jared had shrinkage from the pool, but Ivanka's eyes which focused on his penis were like invisible hands stroking his cock. It was like someone filling up a water balloon. It just started to swell and swell.

She was shocked into silence as she watched Jared grow a massive erection.

Finally Donald broke the silence. 'See Ivanka, I do not lie. I told you he was very developed. Only the best for my daughter!', Mercifully he said, 'Okay, thank you Jared, you can go now.'

Jared pulled up the speedo. Although it was difficult to get it back in now that it had lengthened.

One week later, Jared and Ivanka went on their first date.

As your waiting in line to board the plane Stephanie slips in behind you. She mentions that Jennifer, her other employee that has been with the company for a few years, and April, the college intern, are taking a later flight. Steph travels a lot and gets a bump up to first class while you get stuck in coach next to a large man that talks your ear off  for the entire flight. 

Arriving at the hotel, you and Steph check in. Being the only male on the trip you get a small basic room while the women share a upgraded suit. Steph says she is going to get freshened up before the others arrive and we will all meet in the lobby in a few hours for a nice dinner. 

When the time comes you head to the lobby. [They are already there](https://i.redd.it/n7my5ndbrq0z.jpg) and waiting for you. April, a couple years younger than you and college volleyball player.

6ez12g,175,2017-06-02,"Improve because you enjoy doing so, not just because you want to reach high elo",Helmet_Bro,summonerschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/6ez12g/improve_because_you_enjoy_doing_so_not_just/,"I know this sub heavily emphasizes the point that playing this game is about improving yourself, but I just want to caution people who are trying so hard to improve that it starts to take over their lives.  
  
Some background: It was about when I started going into college that I started to understand that League wasn't about winning every game, but rather, about trying to improve myself. Having realized this, I would zealously take notes as to what I did wrong after every game, and whenever I would watch a stream, I would try to soak in as much information as possible. However, I really hated this process of analyzing everything, and yet, I forged on, hoping to reach the elusive elo heaven. What was happening was that I was creating a rather lofty goal for myself, saying that success was improving until I hit diamond. My thirst for improvement was not out enjoyment, but rather, for self-gratification. Eventually, this manic desire took over my academic and social life, causing me to skip classes to squeeze more games and valuing 30 minutes of game time over hanging out with friends.  
  
Eventually, I had to take a semester off to recollect my thoughts and reevaluate my priorities. As I played more during my time off, I began to realize I hate putting myself in a 45 minute cage match where it was possible my own teammates could turn on each other and I can't do anything about it. In the end, I stopped playing because it was affecting me emotionally.  
  
A few weeks after I quit the game, I sort of realized that the mentality I had with League was the mentality I had with everything else: I wanted to improve so I could reach an ambitious goal, not improve because I enjoyed the grind. And the thought of not reaching said goal would scare me so much, that I would end up doing nothing (for example, I didn't apply for interviews for internships because I was really scared of facing failure). I realized then that actual reason why I despised playing was because I was fixated on my goal rather than enjoying the journey to it. Ultimately, this mentality is what a lot of solo queue players have, especially when we are enticed with rank rewards, and to me, this is not the most optimal way to enjoy the game.  
  
Now, I'm not saying that you guys should quit playing because you're not enjoying it. It might be that you guys are improving so that you hope you can find some sort of satisfaction in attaining a higher elo, rather than enjoying the process itself. All that needs to occur is a shift in mentality about improving. I found out the hard way that if I improve because I'm desperate for reaching a goal, the game becomes an addiction and becomes a detriment to my academic and social life.
Sorry for the long rant here, but I just want to make sure that the people who are playing this game don't wind up farther than I did, and hopefully, find their joy of playing this game again.  
  
**TL;DR:**  
1) Improve because you enjoy the grind, not because you want to reach gold, plat, etc.  
2) If you improve with the mindset that you fail if you don't reach a certain elo, the mentality can eat away your academic and social life, becoming an addiction.  
3) Even if you try to change your mindset about improving and you are still unsatisfied, maybe it's time to put this game down for a while.  
4) And finally, I think this mindset can be applied to any hobbies you have. What this means is that you will eventually get better if you keep improving, and the best way to sustain that improvement is not by dangling a carrot in front of you, but rather, find joy from grinding it out.  
  
Edit: Made a lot of changes to original post here because it was sloppy writing (still kind of is). It's kind of strange, but I have been playing this game for seven years and never thought about moving on until now. I really enjoyed my first moments of playing the game, and have met several friends on the rift. However, having realized my true ambitions (coding and art) and becoming burned out from being unable to hit plat for 5 years, I think it's time I say goodbye to this tumultuous journey of League of Legends. I will occasionally pop in the main subreddit to see what zany characters Riot comes up with and if SKT wins another World Championship, but overall, I think I'm finally done playing League 
  
Edit 2: Posted this on the main subreddit, hoping my message can reach a wider audience. "
6ezsja,122,2017-06-03,"IAMA 33F. 14 yrs ago I helped my (then) serious boyfriend get over serious ""deathgrip"" by offering to let him finish in my mouth (and swallow) for several months, to help him cut back on masturbating.",30DaysOfCum,NSFWIAMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/NSFWIAMA/comments/6ezsja/iama_33f_14_yrs_ago_i_helped_my_then_serious/,"An early serious boyfriend of mine back in college my sophomore year (14 years ago) couldn't cum any way other than from masturbating (himself). He had what I later learned was death-grip syndrome (he masturbated way too much, and too hard, and couldn't come any other way no matter how hard he tried). He was desperate to come from a blowjob, and as much as we tired, a half a dozen times or more, he just couldn't. He finally explained why, and it was clear that he was wracked with guilt and negative feelings about himself. So I very sweetly asked him if he would please include sometime when he was jacking off, that I would gladly swallow for him, even if I couldn't take him there myself.

I been swallowing for a little over a year from giving blowjobs (with my very first really serious boyfriend my senior year of high school, who loved blowjobs). And the summer before college, I got really good at giving them, and at swallowing, which I fairly quickly learned to enjoy a lot too. 😊

But I'd never done anything like that before, just letting someone cum in my mouth and swallowing for them (with them masturbating to get themselves off). But it just seemed like the best thing I could think of to help make him feel better about himself, and let him know I really cared. He broke out in tears, he was so torn up about not being able to cum with any of his girlfriends before. I held him, and cradled him in my arms, and the tears flowed, and he just let it all out.

We made a date for later that week, and that was the first time I ever let a guy jack off in my mouth. We dated another 5-6 months, and because I thought it would help him change his habits, we made a deal that if he'd decrease his frequency (he was jacking off 2-3 times every day), that I would swallow for him that way every few days. By the end of the spring semester, he was down to once or twice a week, and I finally blew him to completion the last week before finals. He took an internship over the summer 1,000 miles away, and we'd agreed to each see other people, and we both met other partners. We're still Facebook friends to this day, and he's married with 3 kids. I'd like to think I had something to do with him being able to get his wife pregnant, and suspect I probably did.

I liked swallowing before, but the experience only helped me like it even more, so much that in later years I learned it was fun to go from PIV sex to finishing that last little bit with a quick BJ, or just pulling out and aiming for my open mouth (and a lot better than sleeping on the ""wet spot"" in bed).

Even now, my husband of 8 years (NOT the same guy as who I helped 14 years ago), sometimes finishes in my mouth when he masturbates, 2-3 times a month usually.

I've always felt swallowing brought me closer to my partners over the years, just a few guys in college (all serious, 6-month or longer relationships). And I've always frlt proud of my enthusiasm for letting my partner finishing in my mouth, and even encouraging it.

But I'll always remember ""Brian"" (not his real name), who I helped by providing a real motivation to cut back on his daily habit of jacking off so much, and helping him set goals for breaking that cycle. That very last week of finals (and almost a full week after, before we each had to get to our separate internships), I gave him three (3!!) successful blowjobs, and I'll always remember how triumphant tasting his cum felt. Yes, he felt like a million dollars, but honestly, I did too. I'm not sure anyone else could or would have done what I offered to him, but I did, and really felt empowered by it.

So, that's the story of my experience, and a bit about how it has affected me, even to this day. Glad to answer respectful questions.  

Please note: I will NOT answer PM's (or do chat, or trade pictures, or anything of the sort), so don't even bother. But I'm glad to dialog in this public space."
6ezx8r,13,2017-06-03,Dear Braveryjerk: YOUR SUBREDDIT IS A SCAM! This entire place has been run by the Ron Paul campaign this whole time. See inside for the truth.,PossiblyLance,Braveryjerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/comments/6ezx8r/dear_braveryjerk_your_subreddit_is_a_scam_this/,"Note: I originally posted the below post in /r/conspiracy but was told it was a good idea to x-post it here. Please read and know the truth about your moderators

Hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit but I thought it would be the best place to post what I've uncovered. Recently I've had a lot of suspicion surrounding the Circlejerk group of subreddits. In particular, I was appalled how circlejerk moderators could get away with posting blatant sponsored advertising on their subreddit. This was called out by someone on /r/SubredditDrama but the thread was summarily deleted. It's been my suspicion that the circlejerk mods have a lot of influence on this website, and the above confirmed this.

The Bravery Delusion

I'm here to talk about a whole different scheme of theirs, however. This one is so hilarious, so unbelievably insane that it's hard to stay with but please bear with me. First of all, a quick visit to /r/Braveryjerk gives off a strange vibe. It's apparently full of random internet memes and Ron Paul's face is for some reason plastered everywhere. The place seems to be very loosely organized and I was able to gain moderatorship for a few hours. In that time, I found the shocking secret: Braveryjerk is and has been sponsored by the Ron Paul campaign, and I have proof!

It was hard to find any good nuggets because the modmail is mostly just jibberish and exhausted memes, but after an exhaustive search I was able to find a few good quotes. Here is a recent modmail thread where the users are talking about Ron Paul/Gary Johnson and the next election campaign. I dug a little deeper and found THE FIRST MODMAIL THREAD in the subreddit's history. A little more digging discovered that /u/Boobies_Are_Awesome and /u/GodOfAtheism were, back in February 2012, interns working for the Ron Paul campaign. We can see that the subreddit's creation was a direct order from the Ron Paul campaign itself. Both of these moderators are also high-ranking members of /r/circlejerk. Skeptics like myself of course remember the time when circlejerk changed its CSS to the Ron Paul website's theme. Of course everyone passed it off as a joke but it turns out these clever fucks were subtly promoting Ron Paul's campaign the whole time! It's genious if you think about it, and it certainly worked. Now if you all remember back in February, 2012 the Ron Paul campaign was sputtering and it needed a boost, so the HQ told the interns to consolidate their efforts and make a brand new subreddit. Apparently circlejerk's subtle hints were enough so they created a subreddit where to jam Ron Paul down your throat. The guy is literally everywhere. He's in the CSS background. A bunch of their fake ""advice animals"" have his face substituted in place of popular meme images. They also have attempted to discredit many of Ron Paul's competitors such as Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. And obviously the sheep eat it up, thinking it's all a joke when the subliminal advertising is going in their heads. It's truly genious!

Now I know this doesn't seem like a big deal because /r/Braveryjerk only has 17000 subscribers or so, but it only represents one level of this advertising campaign. I unfortunately haven't been able to be modded in any of the other Circle* reddits, but if you go through them you can see the same Ron Paul propaganda emanating through. Circlejerk mods have also been modded to places such as /r/TheoryOfReddit, /r/Facepalm, and even /r/IAmA. I'm going to try to uncover as much information as I can about the BJ mods as I can in order to topple their little delusional scheme. In the meantime, PLEASE keep a lookout on Braveryjerk spammers trying to shill for whoever has paid for them.

6ezytn,57,2017-06-03,How Scarface came to be: a military short story.,Vorsaire,Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/6ezytn/how_scarface_came_to_be_a_military_short_story/,"I joined the Army late 2010. It wasn’t because of money or job stability or whatever. I just REALLY didn’t want to do college, so the military didn’t seem like too bad of a gig. I was wrong, but I would never want to go back and change the decision I made that day.

My first 11 months was all training: Basic, AIT, Airborne… The whole shebang. It’s a very stressful time in one’s life because your freedoms are very limited. You’re told when to shower, eat food, go to sleep, wake up, etc. You’re basically a drone, just doing what you’re told every day.

After all my training was done in late 2011, I got orders to 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell. I wasn’t very excited to go live on the border of Tennessee and Kentucky, but I was glad to have got the unit assignment. I was terrified and happy and anxious all at once.

When I arrived at my unit, I was very thrown off. I knew these guys were cool, but walking around with hands in pockets? Talking to senior leadership like they’re buddies? What the fuck is this?

The first few months were very awkward. You’ll never find weirder people in the Army than you will working with Special Operations Forces. However, these guys knew how to do their fucking jobs. Sure they weird, but they worked hard and partied harder. Shit was nuts. 

I ended up getting PRK (which is basically Lasik) my first few months there. Only so fast because my platoon Sergeant said “I hate looking at your fucking face. Every time I see you, I want to punch the fuck out of you. Change it!” It may have been just the glasses he hated, but whatever…

Fast forward to June. I have officially been in the Army 19 months at this point and I was going to be promoted to Specialist next month. Last month, on my birthday, I was dumped by my girlfriend because her parents are psychotic control freaks. Needless to say, I was heartbroken and down in the dumps.

Then in late June, my unit was having a field exercise, which is basically camping in the woods without showers or good food for 10 whole days. At first, I was pissed about having to go. After the first day however, I was surprised to say I was thoroughly enjoying myself.
It was really nice to get away from the real world after months of unending anger and sorrow. Just a bunch of guys camping in tents, eating shitty food, killing animals for food. It was pretty fucking cool.

Fast forward to day 8 of the field exercise. We did a lot of cool shit up to that point, but everyone was getting tired of smelling their balls and sweating their asses off all day. Needless to say, the longer you’re out there, the crazier things tend to get.

And boy did I get my fill of crazy.

We were taking turns driving Humvees on an obstacle course that was surprisingly challenging. Everyone had their turn to be the driver, passenger, and then gunner. The gunner was there purely to help give the driver a bit of a heads-up in case he needed to avoid a hole/obstacle.

It’s my turn to be the gunner, so I put on my helmet and climb in to the gunner’s hatch. One of my co-workers is the driver and the other is the passenger. He starts the vehicle and pulls up about 100 feet from the first obstacle, which is three 6-foot-tall hills back-to-back.

The driver stops the vehicle and says to me, “You better hold on, it’s about to get bumpy.” I think nothing of it, having been through twice already in other positions. I knew what to expect.

He slams the gas, scaring me and the passenger, and starts beaming for the hills. I hear the passenger yell at him to slow down… He didn’t. We hit the first hill at 40mph and were launched into the air. Right then, I was holding myself inside the vehicle because I was about to be ejected from the hatch.

Thoughts raced through my head, I wondered if would just be a scare…

The vehicle, after going airborne, had completely flown over the second hill and slammed nose-first into the third one. True, I stopped myself from being ejected, but there was nothing except my helmet keeping my head from kissing that turret mount…

Everything went black for a solid two minutes.

After impact, my head shot forward with force, straight into that damn turret mount. My helmet softened the first blow, mostly, but was destroyed and came straight off. I didn’t stop there. Obviously unconscious from the impact, I rag-dolled in the turret mount, striking my head on various steel objects. After a few crippling blows, my body slumped back in to the vehicle.

All twenty people rushed to the now motionless vehicle. They opened the rear door to get to me, and when they did, my body simply fell out of the vehicle.

My face had literally been peeled off, from my left cheek to the back of my head. The skin was attached, but just flopping in the breeze. I was covered in blood, several other wounds prevalent on the rest of my head. Everybody froze at the sight.

Everybody except one man, who immediately leaped into action. He yelled at two soldiers to take off their shirts and then carefully but firmly wrapped them around my head. He pinched me to wake me up, to no avail. He then decided to give me a sternum rub, which did elicit a reaction.

I woke up in intense pain, trying desperately to open my eyes. I screamed and began flailing around, trying to get the makeshift bandage off my head. Five people held me down while they worked on securing my bandages. We had no litter to put me on, so I was put onto a cot then secured to it with belts.

Not wanting to waste any time, they threw me into a van we had there and sped to get back on post to the hospital. We blew through stop signs and red lights to get there as quickly as possible.

When we arrived at the hospital, their first responders stabilized me to the best of their ability, but they claimed that no surgery could be done on me there. Instead, they threw me into an ambulance and drove me the 60-miles to Nashville, the next-closest hospital.

On the way there, my heart stopped from blood loss, but the EMTs did their job and got the old ticker beating again. It was only for about 30 seconds or so and no, I didn’t see the light.

We arrived at the hospital and I was rushed in to have my face stitched and stapled back together. The pain was excruciating. Being on morphine can’t even dull the feeling of 3 doctors simultaneously stitching and stapling 15 inches of tissue back together.

Once it was all over, I finally noticed a decrease in my pain levels. Between vomiting up a liter of blood and watching Scooby-doo on TV, I didn’t have a damn care in the world. Tons of doctors and interns came to see me once I was out of surgery, everyone wanting to have a look at the guy who had his face peeled off like a potato.

The doctors gave me the extent of my injuries a while after some scans and tests: I have multiple fractures in 4 different places on my skull, about 15 total inches of damaged tissue that will most definitely scar, and to top it all off, a chipped front tooth. ‘Cause fuck me, right? I looked like Jim Carey from Dumb &amp; Dumber until dental fixed it.

It’s been 5 years since then. The fractures never completely healed. I have constant facial pain and headaches from my brain injuries. My jaw dislocates randomly when I’m eating. I have been diagnosed with “Unspecified Depression Disorder.” I also have some PTSD from that as well.

The only good thing I got out of this ordeal? A pretty nice scar… That’s it.

Moral of the story: don’t fucking trust anyone. Fuck ‘em all. 

Cordially yours,
SCARFACE.

6f01ed,1,2017-06-03,"[X-post from /r/summonerschool] Improve because you enjoy doing so, not because you want to reach high elo",Helmet_Bro,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6f01ed/xpost_from_rsummonerschool_improve_because_you/,"I have been playing this game for about seven years now, and recently, I have decided I'm going to stop for my social and academic well being. That being said, I do have a cautionary tale that I want to tell others so that they don't end up worse than me.  
  
Some background: It was about when I started going into college that I started to understand that League wasn't about winning every game, but rather, about trying to improve myself. Having realized this, I would zealously take notes as to what I did wrong after every game, and whenever I would watch a stream, I would try to soak in as much information as possible. However, I really hated this process of analyzing everything, and yet, I forged on, hoping to reach the elusive elo heaven. What was happening was that I was creating a rather lofty goal for myself, saying that success was improving until I hit diamond. My thirst for improvement was not out enjoyment, but rather, for self-gratification. Eventually, this manic desire took over my academic and social life, causing me to skip classes to squeeze more games and valuing 30 minutes of game time over hanging out with friends.  
  
Eventually, I had to take a semester off to recollect my thoughts and reevaluate my priorities. As I played more during my time off, I began to realize I hate putting myself in a 45 minute cage match where it was possible my own teammates could turn on each other and I can't do anything about it. In the end, I stopped playing because it was affecting me emotionally.  
  
A few weeks after I quit the game, I sort of realized that the mentality I had with League was the mentality I had with everything else: I wanted to improve so I could reach an ambitious goal, not improve because I enjoyed the grind. And the thought of not reaching said goal would scare me so much, that I would end up doing nothing (for example, I didn't apply for interviews for internships because I was really scared of facing failure). I realized then that actual reason why I despised playing was because I was fixated on my goal rather than enjoying the journey to it. Ultimately, this mentality is what a lot of solo queue players have, especially when we are enticed with rank rewards, and to me, this is not the most optimal way to enjoy the game.     
  
Now, I'm not saying that you guys should quit playing because you're not enjoying it. It might be that you guys are improving so that you hope you can find some sort of satisfaction in attaining a higher elo, rather than enjoying the process itself. All that needs to occur is a shift in mentality about improving. I found out the hard way that if I improve because I'm desperate for reaching a goal, the game becomes an addiction and becomes a detriment to my academic and social life.  
  
Sorry for the long rant here, but I just want to make sure that the people who are playing this game don't wind up farther than I did, and hopefully, find their joy of playing this game again.  
  
**TL;DR:**  
1) Improve because you enjoy the grind, not because you want to reach gold, plat, etc.  
2) If you improve with the mindset that you fail if you don't reach a certain elo, the mentality can eat away your academic and social life, becoming an addiction.  
3) Even if you try to change your mindset about improving and you are still unsatisfied, maybe it's time to put this game down for a while.  
4) And finally, I think this mindset can be applied to any hobbies you have. What this means is that you will eventually get better if you keep improving, and the best way to sustain that improvement is not by dangling a carrot in front of you, but rather, find joy from grinding it out.  
  
Edit: Made a lot of changes to original post because the first I wrote on /r/summonerschool was rushed. It's kind of strange, but I have been playing this game for seven years and never thought about moving on until now. I really enjoyed my first moments of playing the game, and have met several friends on the rift. However, having realized my true ambitions (coding and art) and becoming burned out from being unable to hit plat for 5 years, I think it's time I say goodbye to this tumultuous journey of League of Legends. I will occasionally pop in the main subreddit to see what zany characters Riot comes up with and if SKT wins another World Championship, but overall, I think I'm finally done playing League"
6f0we0,20,2017-06-03,"Highlights from the ""Zeit"" articel over the Tuchel sacking",Tarkleigh,borussiadortmund,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/6f0we0/highlights_from_the_zeit_articel_over_the_tuchel/,"The Zeit did a big story over the Tuchel/Watzke drama this Thursday. While it is behind a pay-wall, I managed to get a digital copy and extracted a few things. It is in German, I wanted to give the original copy and currently don't have the time for a translation (**Edit: the translation is here, check out my post below**). Here they are

&gt;Thomas Tuchel gilt in seinem umfeld als Gerechtigkeitsfanatiker, der nur schwer verzeihen kann. Wer ihn kennt, weiß, dass er kein Mann für große Kompromisse ist. Sich zu verbiegen hält er 
für Verrat an den eigenen Werten.

About the fight with Mislantat
&gt;Zu Tuchels Überzeugungen gehört es, bei der Auswahl neuer Spieler nicht nur auf Statistiken und Videozusammenschnitte, sondern auch auf den Gesichtsausdruck und die Persönlichkeit der Spieler zu achten. Seine Herangehensweise war nur schwer mit der des langjährigen Chefscouts des BVB, Sven Mislintat, übereinzubringen. Es kam zum Streit. Die Version, die wenige Zeit später in der Presse nachzulesen war, lautete: Tuchel habe sich mit Mislintat, dem engsten Vertrauten des Sportdirektors Zorc, überworfen und ihm Platzverbot erteilt. Laut 
Tuchels umfeld heißt es, diese Deutung entspreche nicht der Wahrheit. Vielmehr sei der Chefscout von der Vereinsführung gebeten worden zugehen. Doch was wie eine Loyalitätsbekundung 
des Vereins Tuchel gegenüber aussah, war in Wahrheit eine Beförderung Mislintats, der wenige Monate später zum »Leiter Profifußball« beim BVB aufstieg. Tuchel war düpiert.

About the attack (with a protocol of what happend Tuesday)
&gt;Nach Informatio­nen der ZEIT rief Watzke kurz nach dem Anschlag einen Mit­arbeiter an, der im Mannschafts­bus saß und das Handy an Tuchel weiterreichte. Watzke soll dem Vernehmen 
nach gefragt haben, ob die Mannschaft spielen könne? Tuchel soll erwidert haben, es gebe einen verletzten Spieler. Die folgenden Benachrichtigungen erhielt der Trainer dann über eine WhatsApp­Gruppe, zu der neben ihm auch Michael Zorc und Teammanager Arne Niehörster gehörten. Innerhalb der nächsten 
60 Minuten nach dem Anschlag wurden rund zehn Nachrichten ausgetauscht, darunter die In­formation, dass das Spiel abgesagt worden sei, der Ersatztermin diskutiert werde und die Entscheidung über die Spielverlegung gefallen sei.Als Tuchel am Abend des Anschlags nach Hau­se kam, rief Watzke ein zweites Mal an, diesmal direkt auf dem Handy des Trainers. In diesem Telefonat soll Watzke Tuchel darüber informiert ha­ben, dass die Entscheidung der Spielverlegung auf den Folgetag unum­gänglich sei. Vor allem aber gab es nach Recherchen der ZEIT entgegen den Beteuerungen des Vereins meh­rere Spieler, die am Vormittag nach dem Anschlag darum gebeten hatten, nicht zu spielen. In einer Mannschaftssitzung in der Kabine vor dem Ab­schlusstraining, bei der rund 30 Personen anwesend waren, soll Marco Reus aufgestanden sein und – im Namen der Mannschaft – gesagt haben: »Ich halte es für falsch, dass wir heute Abend spielen.

About the interview before the Hoffenheim-match
&gt;Hört man sich im Verein um, gab es allerdings sehr wohl eine Botschaft , die Watzke mit dem In­terview in der WAZ (das vor dem Hoffenheimspiel, Anmerkung von mir) hatte senden wollen. Dem­ nach diente das Gespräch weniger der Außen­ als vielmehr der Innenwirkung. Das Interview soll als eine Art »Selbstschutz« im Dienste des Vereins ge­wesen sein. Watzke habe den Spielern das Gefühl geben wollen, dass der Verein für sie da sei. Zumindest viele deutsche Spieler, heißt es im Verein, hätten sich intern gegen Tuchel ausgesprochen. Genährt wird diese Darstellung durch einen Be­richt in der Bild, in der die Rede davon ist, mehre­re Spieler hätten mit dem Weggang gedroht, falls der Trainer bleibe. Man kann Watzkes öffentlichen Auftritt auch so verstehen: als Botschaft, wer im Verein das Sagen über die Geschichtsschreibung in der Öffentlichkeit hat.
Der Rest war nur noch eine große, grandiose und verlogene Show: der Auftritt zum Pokalfinale, die Umarmung von Watzke und Tuchel nach dem Schlusspfiff, die Beteuerung, man wolle sich jetzt 
zusammensetzen, ergebnisoffen natürlich. Alles Fake­News.

End of the articel
&gt;Einer der Dortmunder Spieler hat Tuchel nach 
dem Attentat eine E­Mail geschrieben. Er wolle dem Trainer sagen, welch großen Respekt er davor 
habe, wie der mit der schwierigen Situation um den Anschlag umgegangen sei. Ohne Tuchels Hilfe hätte er das alles nicht geschafft. Er wolle einfach nur Danke sagen.

Hope this helps, I will add a translation when I find the time :)

I'm a bit hesitant to approach the staff at this time since I'm only in my first year so I'm here on reddit, seeking honest experience from fellow students. 

From your experience, do you find it difficult to secure a job with only a bachelor, especially in the field of science and engineering? Did the university provide internship opportunities for undergrads? Did your job come from the help of the university or your own job hunt? Is there any difference or disadvantages when you're international?(If there is any international wants to share their experience, it would mean the world to me). 

One last question: What would you recommend I do to maximize my job opportunities and experience at uni? Currently I'm feeling I  haven't spent my tuition fees good enough. 

Thank you and have a great winter."

6f2a9x,1,2017-06-03,Confused after college. Any advice appreciated.,MousyBrown,Life_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life_advice/comments/6f2a9x/confused_after_college_any_advice_appreciated/,"Salutations: 
Hello, my name is MousyBrown. I’ve been out of college and in living in Los Angeles for 9 months, and, because I don’t know how to talk about this to any living soul, I am asking The Internet for advice on how to direct my life. 

Maybe this is a bad idea, asking other people for advice. I’ve spent most of my life following the directions of others and I think it’s led me to be aimless, helpless, and indecisive... but I am DESPERATE to talk. 

About Me: 
I was an actress from elementary school through college. Praised through elementary and high school, I got to college and found myself feeling inadequate. I was not cast frequently. I started feeling stiff and shy onstage. Though still occasionally praised for my work, I felt like a screwup. I truly loved performing, but depression set in. I decided that the stage was not for me, but I finished out my theater degree anyway. 

I took a few screenwriting classes during college. I loved writing at first, but when professors criticized my work, it crushed me. Still, I enjoyed it a lot deep down, and it made me giddy when it didn’t make me miserable. 

After college I decided-- Hey! You know what? I bet I could write children’s TV! I love children, I like writing cartoons, I can make this happen! So I got an internship at a children’s media company and moved to LA. 

Fast forward to now. Internship ended with no job prospects. Trying to get an assistant job ANYWHERE in the industry, and surprise, surprise: I’m not writing. 

About My Problem:
I’m afraid to write. I feel like my liberal arts education taught me little about the film industry. I don’t think I’m good enough. There’s always something else to do, so I’ve written very little. I’m so ashamed to admit this. The shame makes me depressed every morning. I feel so alone. I believe I’m an idiot who can’t string two words together. I cannot fathom how I could possible accomplish this goal. 

And I’m no stranger to this feeling! I’ve always been such a shy human with such a negative view of myself and the world. I never want to commit to a path. Shame, depression and honest belief that I’m inadequate have always stopped me from pursuing... much of anything. 

I wish I had some structure! I think about grad school a lot. I want guidance! Maybe this means I’m a fool and a coward because I can’t self-motivate. If you can’t self motivate, you’re destined to fail, right? Anyway, I wouldn’t spend the money on grad school unless I was SURE the cost would be worth it. Whatever I choose to study, it’d better pay off! That’s the smart way to think... I think... 

God. Sometimes I just want to give this whole thing up. I miss the stage, but that path is just as difficult. I taught theater classes during college and was very good at it, so maybe I could be a theater teacher? I’ve even thought about becoming a therapist, since I’m so obsessed with analyzing myself and friends. If I want to give up before I’ve even started writing, that means I shouldn’t do it, right? Right? I’m too weak, and I should try for a more conventional career. I’ve been a theater teacher, and I’ve worked with therapists. I know what those jobs look like. I don’t know what being a children’s tv writer looks like. 

At heart, I want to feel proud of myself. I want to feel like I’m accomplishing goals. I want to stop feeling ashamed of my life every day. I want to work towards something. Why can’t I decide what that something will be? 

This is a sappy-millennial-privilege-laden sob story, but it’s the only one I got. I needed to get it out and face it. Thanks for reading :)

6f2kzu,4,2017-06-03,Today I was sexually assaulted by a coworker,coworkerthroww,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6f2kzu/today_i_was_sexually_assaulted_by_a_coworker/,"Hi TwoX. Throwaway because some people at work might somehow remember my username. I'm not even sure if this fits here but I need to tell someone - let me know if there's a different subreddit I should post to. Trigger warning for obvious reasons although nothing that graphic.

Last night I went out for drinks after work with a few coworkers. I missed the last train home, my BF was out anyway. Over the course of the night, things whittled down to myself and 2 others, both men, CW1 and CW2. CW1 I know well, we both started at the company at the same time nearly a year ago out of college. We got cheap takeaway and ate at his house. To be a good host, he insisted he take the sofa whilst myself and CW2 took his double bed despite me telling him we would all fit.

I woke up at 4a.m. this morning to feel a hand rubbing the crease of my leg at the top of my thigh, and squeezing my hip. I'm hungover and disoriented, and panicked. I lie there and after the shock wears off, I decide to test and see if CW2 is awake; it's unlikely given how deliberate his movements are but I want to make sure, I don't want to accuse him unless I'm certain and I desperately want to believe he's not the type to grope someone unconscious. I make noises like I'm waking up and shift my body so his hand is forced off me. The hand immediately comes back, the rubbing doesn't stop and goes further, reaching down towards my crotch and brushing against it.

I get up and stumble in the dark to get my things, can only find my bag and not my jumper. I find my way through the labyrinthine house to the downstairs living room where CW1 is sleeping. I sit on the unoccupied chair and start crying, I can't find my phone in my bag which means it's still in the bedroom. I'm not brave enough to go back up there. I start wondering what CW2 did while I was asleep to be so bold about reaching for my crotch. I regret taking off my bra but am intensely thankful I kept my jeans on. I wonder why, as someone who has been assaulted before, I was too stupid not to insist I take the sofa, why it didn't occur to me that sharing a bed with CW2 wasn't a good idea. I tell myself I am never missing the train home again.

I wake up CW1. I'm crying so hard I can barely speak; I tell him CW1 tried to touch me. He puts an arm around me while I shake, asks me what I want to do. When I say I want to go home, he goes and gets my things from his bedroom while I try to calm down and tell myself CW2 won't come back down with him. I dress and CW1 walks me the 30 minutes to the station. On the way he asks if I want to talk about it, I give him some vague answers I honestly can't remember now. I call BF when on the train and don't say what's happened, just that I will need picking up from the station, he agrees without hesitation.

CW2 messages me saying he woke up to the sound of the door, asking if he did something to annoy me, says he hopes I get home safe. CW1 tells me CW2 asked him whether there was ""something CW1 wasn't telling him"", CW1 told him no; he explains to me it wasn't his business and asks me what I want him to say. I tell him he can say what he likes, CW2 knows what he did, that I would like to believe he somehow managed to grope me in a very specific place in his sleep *twice*... but that I don't. Not for a second. BF picks me up, I know he can tell something is very wrong but he doesn't push. When we get home I hand over my phone to open on that conversation with CW1 because I don't even know how to say it out loud and leave the room while he reads it. I come back and get into some long sleeved pyjamas and cry some more while BF holds me, he's silent and doesn't seem able to speak either, he knows this is not the first time. I try to fall back asleep.

After getting some more sleep and some food and feeling more able to deal with it, I finally message CW2 back, saying I know he was awake, that if he comes near me again I will report him to the police. I wish him a nice weekend. When checking the conversation a while later to screenshot it to share with CW1, I see that CW2 has blocked me. 

CW1 and I discuss this tacit admission of guilt. CW1 tells me how surprised he is CW2 would do something like this. I tell him that's how it always works. If someone comes across as an abuser or a sexual predator or whatever, they're doing it wrong. Their best defence is always to ""not seem the type"" to do X thing. Now I have to go back to work on Monday in the same office as CW2, luckily I do not work with him directly, but I have to walk past his desk to get to mine. CW2 is one of the older crowd that is often with us and the interns for drinks after work. He ruined all that, outed himself as an opportunistic POS, and for what? To get a good feel of my leg and maybe a boob? Did he really think I'd had enough to drink I wasn't going to wake up? Was he deluded and convinced I wanted it even though I'd never expressed *any* attraction to him?

Sorry for the wall of text, I want to write this down as I'm already beginning to feel that self-doubt, that ""am I really sure he meant to do that?"" questioning that people like CW2 rely on. I'm already dreading work and how I'll handle this, I'm glad CW2 will not have had many opportunities like this but I also know I have to duty to say something, that next time it could be a girl who *is* passed out instead of asleep and won't wake up. At the same time... I'm aware that CW2 is well-liked and respected. I'm aware it's a classic ""he said, she said"" and that some people would tell me I brought this on myself by getting into bed with him. I'm aware that it's unlikely people will take my side over his as I have no proof other than his lack of denial and maybe CW1's word, and they know CW2 better as he has been with the company much longer. I don't want to get CW1 caught up in a shitshow where he has to stand trial as a witness. I'm terrified of people managing to convince me that I don't know what I felt, what he intended to do.

God TwoX, why do people have to do this shit? Everyone was getting along just fine with some superficial, mundane disagreements, and now I hate the idea of going back to work, of hanging out after for drinks. Now every time I'm out, I'm going to be on guard, I'm going to have to leave if CW2 is there and people are going to *know* and it's going to be so awkward. Now I'm wondering how to change office or whether I should take the hit and quit my job. Now I'm wondering how I even begin to tell my manager, who knows CW2, that I don't feel comfortable working from the office anymore.

I'm angry. Fuck CW2. Fuck everyone like him. It's not that fucking hard to keep your hands to yourself. For 5 minutes of pleasure for himself, he's caused stress and upset that will take who knows how long to go away, and undone years of work getting past my previous experiences. I hope he's ashamed of himself. 

Thank you for reading all of this.

TL;DR went out with coworkers for drinks, shared a bed with one of them who groped me and tried to pretend it didn't happen. Confronted him but am dreading going back to work and don't know how to handle the situation."
6f2qtu,29,2017-06-03,More marriage blues. I'm wondering if we should even get married.,iobraska,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/6f2qtu/more_marriage_blues_im_wondering_if_we_should/,"So here's the situation. A month ago me and my girlfriend of a year got engaged. We're both serious Catholics and her family is especially wonderful since her dad's a deacon for our parish. The problem is life seems almost too stressful for us. I lost my job due to false accusations from a staff member and now have only a part time job, though i'll try (probably unsuccessfully).

To add to that, my girlfriend is having troubles too. She works as a school pscychologist, but hates it. She's worried about passing her internship. she gets to redo it and still gets paid, but it bugs her. Also we're both going through struggles trying to lose weight and deal with wedding stuff, and it makes me wonder, what if we just aren't ready?

I mean what if we both are just too immature? Not that we're too young (i'm 28, she's 25) but i wonder if we just aren't mature enough? Also we both struggle with tough but treatable forms of mental illness (depression, anxiety, anger management for me) and I wonder if that just makes us not ready or even not eligible for marriage. We both love each other, but to me love is only a part of the equation.  We have to be able to provide a good home for kids and take care of each other, and love won't pay the bills or make our problems go away.

I almost wonder if maybe being that I have mental illness, should just be single for the sake of the kingdom, or ask her to wait to get married until we fix our issues, if we even can.  

So what should we do? I feel like we're just doomed to a crappy life together and maybe we'd be better if we just stayed apart. "
6f2rp7,32,2017-06-03,Growing tired of my muslim mom... [Advice/Help],justanotherbasicbtch,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/6f2rp7/growing_tired_of_my_muslim_mom_advicehelp/,"Hello guys, I just want to rant a little about how oppressive my muslim mom is. 

I don't live at home anymore since I'm in college, but she keeps calling me everyday to tell me to pray and whatnot. I usually say that I will to get her off my back, but I think that it's obvious I don't : I mean, I can't even be bothered to pray when I come back home... 
The truth is I have never really believed in God, but since I wanted to be a good girl, I spent my whole pretending to be a muslim. I felt like I could live with that, but I am not so sure anymore...

My mom just called a few hours ago. I'm currenlty doing an internship abroad and staying at my aunt's. She wanted to know  if I was fasting. As I was having fun and kinda forgot about her ways, I told her the truth. She just lost it : she started screaming at me, telling me about hell and whatever rubbish she likes to go on about, she threatened with not talking to me ever again if I didn't fast tomorrow...  She even told my aunt to watch over me and make sure that I don't eat tomorrow ! I mean like really ? I thought that I could pretend, but I'm slowly realizing that sooner or later, I'm going to have to tell her what I'm sure she already knows : I have NEVER believed in any God. 

Knowing that I'm going to have to start living with her again soon, I don't know how to deal with this... I know she's my mom and whatnot, but I think that I am going to have to cut her off as soon as I become independent. I really don't want this, but I feel like I have no other choice.

Anyways, I just feel like there's no one I can tell this. If you took the time to read my novel, thank you, and have a good day :)

6f331t,134,2017-06-03,[NeedAdvice] 31F constantly failing myself,failinglawyer,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/6f331t/needadvice_31f_constantly_failing_myself/,"I don’t know how to go about my life anymore. I always had big dreams and aspirations, but after graduating high school everything started to crumble. I think my main problem is lack of focus, not being able to prioritise, no self-esteem, escapism (mostly internet) and letting my emotions rule my life.

I live in Europe and my main dreams were being a lawyer and studying/living in the UK in the future. I started law school (5 years) and a politics bachelor at the same time. Second year I added another degree (English and American Studies) but left after one semester because it became impossible to do three schools at the same time. I focused on the law and politics one, was doing internships and working at a bank part time.

My main problem turned out to be big oral exams at the law school, the way it works here we have lots of dates to take each and I kept postponing them, retaking the courses next year etc, because I would always study and then didn’t take them, because I never felt I knew enough. I didn’t have the same problem with written ones. I would also take too many electives every semester (we have no limit) and kept postponing finishing the classes I needed to graduate.

I also started to escape to internet and my friends there, I didn’t have much self-confidence and was very shy and never even went on a date. One of my online friends (female) expressed interest in me and we dated for a bit (I was 23 at the time and she was my first love). She lived in another country and we broke up after a few months, but stayed friends. I guess I didn’t processed it back then and hoped to be with her in the future again. Next year she made it clear we are over and then cut me out of her life. I went crazy and ended up at a therapist, started taking antidepressants and all that.

I was still struggling at school, postponing exams and doing electives I didn’t need to and then after attending and doing the work all semester not taking the exam, rinse and repeat. I was also unable to force myself to start writing my bachelor thesis at the politics school. I got accepted to do a study exchange for a year in the UK, which was my dream come true), started hanging out with my real life friends more, travelling etc., but emotionally I was still a mess.

The first half a year in the UK was horrible, I kept crying because of the ex-girlfriend still and locking myself in my room, but I was happy to be there and was trying to do a lot of things like going to conferences etc. However, my study issues came back - I was supposed to hand in four papers instead of exams, however, I couldn’t make myself finish them. I just felt like they would never be good enough. I lacked focus and just spent days and nights in the library going through dozens and dozens of recourses being all over the place. Eventually the uni allowed me to hand them in at the end of the year along with 4 other ones for the second semester. I was happier then and met lots of new people and fell in love with a boy and lost my virginity to him (at 25), there was some drama but I felt like he was the one. However, once again I had trouble with the essays, now eight. The guy broke up with me out of the blue when he went away for the summer, cutting me off completely like the ex-gf did, and I broke down again. I was supposed to leave the UK end of June, however I stayed till end of October all the time just trying to finish the essays, I was at the library every day with a lot of all nighters, but my brain just couldn’t function anymore. I also had to quit the politics school, because I couldn’t finish the bachelor thesis in time, even though I had all the other exams.

When I got back home, I remained depressed as hell and never managed to get better since then. Before going to the UK I was offered to do an internship at the UN in NYC which was my dream, but I felt like I first needed to sort the uni stuff out and it never happened. I missed my boyfriend like crazy and felt absolutely worthless because of the way everybody just kept cutting me off out of their lives. I didn’t go back to work and just isolated myself from everyone feeling like a failure. I was 26, it’s five years later now and it only got worse. I got kicked out of law school with only three exams left, because I just couldn’t bring myself to go there and take them, I was too scared and kept postponing them. That was the worst thing I ever did, my marks were really good overall and I was so close to finally finishing even though it was 8 years instead of five. Instead I applied again and found out most of  the dozens and dozens of exams I’ll have to retake, because of the law changing so fast etc. Same thing happened with the politics school, there I only had to retake some, but I still took a lot of electives I didn’t need. I chose different thesis topic and got stuck, I was scared of my advisor and couldn’t force myself to see her so even though I finished all exams two years ago I still haven’t graduated because I can’t write the thesis I feel overwhelmed by the topic I chose but can’t change it. 

Naively I had a really close friend from the US I really liked and flirted with and always thought we would maybe date one day, I knew he was coming to live in the UK and when they kicked me from law school I kinda thought it was fine, I will do even better the second time around, start dating that boy, move to the UK etc. We met years ago studying in England and he was crushing on me, but I was with my boyfriend back then. We finally met agin last year and he made it clear he only wanted sex, didn’t even want to be friends other than that, I was devastated. I also met someone in my country and fell in love, but it only lasted a few months again and I ended up heartbroken once more. However we stayed friends and slept together but two months ago he finally found someone new and cut me off as well and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Last year I applied to do a politics masters abroad and got accepted, but I just broke down in April and fucked up everything. I was doing tons of electives again and two internships plus work as a student research assistant and lecturer and then one day I just couldn’t, I switched my phone off and stayed at home. Since then I spent months being afraid to check my email or deal with anything. I finally went to a therapist in summer again and been seeing her regularly but it’s not helping. It’s a year later and I never apologised to the ppl at the internships for disappearing, never apologised for not turning up at the abroad uni and not telling them I won’t come which meant I was blocking somebody’s spot at a really competitive programme and I’ve been feeling absolutely horrible about it (I wanted to go but couldn’t because I didn’t finish my bachelor in time), I haven’t taken any exams at the law school because there’s so many and it’s so hard to find any motivation doing it all second time around. I haven’t started my bachelor thesis. Even getting kicked out and restarting both school I could have already finished them by now, but I’m making the same mistakes over and over and over again and I don’t know how to slip out of it without just killing myself. I always get very good marks, the past eleven years I did nothing but school and exams I received hundreds and hundreds of credits and yet I still can’t get my shit together to graduate and start a normal life. I’m stuck in the past, I still want the ex-boyfriend from five years ago back, I regret all the things I messed up so much and the life I could have had watching all the younger students being brilliant and the opportunities they have and which I once had too, watching my friends being successful lawyers and starting families and me being in a worse place than I was ten years ago, never having accomplished anything, never having a longer relationship, even though I had everything going for me. Most days I’m scared to go out so I stay home for weeks at a time crying and thinking about killing myself because I can’t see another way out. I have felt too old to apply for the jobs I want for several years now, because everyone wants young graduates, I also feel too old for any relationships anymore because the latest ex found someone 11 years younger after me, I’m scared to go to exams because all the teachers must thing I’m a failure being so old, I’m scared to reply to an email the ex sent to me two years ago apologising to me, I feel tired and stupid all the time.

I though the pills and therapy would help me, but it’s mostly me listing all the things I didn’t do every week. If anyone has any advice on what I can do to help me get out if this cycle of failures I’ll be very grateful. Thank you!

tl;dr Been a uni student for 11 years now, unable to finish both schools right before the end, starting both again and it’s even worse now. I have been super stressed for years, feeling like I have so much to do all the time and unable to do anything and finish anything, constantly running away from things. Letting my emotions dictate my life. Feeling old and like a failure, can’t see a way out anymore."
6f3ufr,2,2017-06-03,18 year old first credit card,Caseywalt39,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6f3ufr/18_year_old_first_credit_card/,"Hi reddit!  As the title states I got approved for my first credit card. It is a discover it card with a 750 dollar line of credit. I am a graduating senior in high school. Well in a week I will be graduated😂. I consider my self lucky because I got to work at an awesome company as a paid ""IT intern"" last summer. The internship got extended through my senior year and now I am the level 1 IT person and will be until I start college in October. Obviously I have some money. I would like to start to build credit early and now. I want to try and work during college if I can. My point is I want to be able to start my life after college and not be like most kids who run around like a chicken with its head cut off because they are broke and have no credit. Also my parents are buying a house and I see them constantly trying to improve their credit score. I want to try to avoid that.

My questions are: 

Does discover it auto pay only pay the minimum payment? Or the payment in full every month? And is there risk using this?

I read that you should only use 25-30% of your line of credit each month. Is this true? 

Is there any thing I am missing that would help me in the future? "
6f3yfa,8,2017-06-03,I have decided to go NC after i get a stable full time job,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6f3yfa/i_have_decided_to_go_nc_after_i_get_a_stable_full/,"I have decided I am going​ to go NC from NMom after I get a stable full time job in my line of work. This will be soon after I graduate college (in 4 years). 

Today NMom asked me if I had seen NDad at my (high school) graduation ceremony. Explicitly against her promise that she would not invite NDad, she decided to and then changed the topic as if it did not matter at all, despite me stating clearly that I was offended by this.

Also earlier today NMom decided that she will only give me the $1k she owes me if I spend it in certain ways as decided by a friend of hers who has no clue why/what I need to buy.

If I allow this to continue after I graduate college, NMom will try to control who I marry, who I date, bully me after I come out as bi, send me snarky texts attacking my political / religious views, and step over my boundaries however she sees fit for the rest of my life.

The only reason I am putting up with her for now is she is paying my tuition / room and board / other expenses, and as long as she does not physically abuse me, it is worth it for me personally to stick it out, as I am moving out soon and will be LC for the next several years until I graduate college (I will be in a dorm). I will likely be expected to visit NMom at Christmas/my birthday​/etc but I plan to get an internship down near college so I don't have to spend the Summers with NMom.

I also need to go NC with NMom because of how she treats my SG sister- like a piece of shit. If SGsis tries to defend herself against NMoms wild accusations she is hit and screamed at. 

On top of that, NMom has zero respect for any of my interests she disagrees with, such as music- I spend around 60 hours/week making songs which I have to hide from NMom because otherwise she will take away my music gear. And NMom is emotionally abusive to me as well. I have learned to not cry because NMom will scream at me, ""stop being fucking weird or I'll kick you out and you can go live with your fag father"". And I could never go to NMom with a problem with a friend / girl / etc because she would only use it as ammo against me.

She also has no respect for my religious / political views- this is a long story. And I don't even want to imagine what would happen if I told her I am bi."
6f4a7q,1,2017-06-03,Background info for the territory,the_masked_redditor,New_Periopolis,https://www.reddit.com/r/New_Periopolis/comments/6f4a7q/background_info_for_the_territory/,"Situated in the northeastern corner of Chroma is New Periopolis, the former capital of Orangered. During its Orangered days, people called it ""Oraistedearg"", which is such a terrible name that I'm not going to type it again in this piece. After the territory was conquered and formally assimilated into the Periwinkle Kingdom, people came to their senses and renamed it to New Periopolis. Although most of Eastern Chroma retained most of their pre-Periwinkle identities, New Periopolis, as the former OR capital, was radically changed. After the Second War, a massive Winklization effort began, renaming almost everything, heavily propagandizing, and purging dissidents. Many of the remaining Orangered-leaning residents chose to join Orangered's colonization of Kingston, leaving New Periopolis with a massive pro-Periwinkle majority by the start of the Third War. Orangered, understandably angered at the sight of their former capital in Periwinkle hands, launched an assault on New Periopolis, kicking off the Third War. [It did not go well for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/FieldOfKarmicGlory/comments/38kr2w/invasion_the_orangered_armies_march_on_new/). Following the Third War, New Periopolis experienced substantial growth due to its rapidly emerging tech sector. The burgeoning tech sector, in turn, encouraged many of Chroma's most prominent futurists to set up shop in New Periopolis, leading it to be called ""The Cutting Edge of Chroma"". The residents of Londo Lazuli accused New Periopolis of stealing their niche, and to this day, Lazulians view Periopolitans as Lazulian rip-off assholes. Tensions between the two territories increased when ArcadiaCorp, Ultra Cheapo Tech, ChoadCo, and the Mousepad Collective all decided to move their operations from Londo to New Periopolis, pursuing a number of tax breaks promised to them in exchange for moving. With the election of Governor Masked, New Periopolis joined the POTATO alliance. In recent years, New Periopolis has been at the heart of the Goate faction, which evolved into the revolutionary Emerald Federation. Today, New Periopolis serves as the capital for Emerald and proudly touts its heritage as the birthplace of the revolution.

#Map

I know the map isn't any good, but I didn't want to be sitting here all day drawing a map. It at least shows the cities and road structure.

EDIT: The new map doesn't have the roads, but it actually has the correct city placements as per the Chroma interactive map. Some cities were moved, a few were added, and one was renamed.

#Cities

---

**New Periopolis**

The capital of the territory New Periopolis is the rather uncreatively named city of New Periopolis. To reduce confusion between it and the territory itself, the city of New Periopolis is often stylized as ""The Emerald Imperial City of New Periopolis"". One of the largest cities in all Chroma, New Periopolis has a bit of a seedy reputation due to the Chroman movie industry making every futuristic dystopian cyberpunk movie take place in the city. New Periopolis is home to the Emerald Imperial District, which houses the Emerald administration. It acts as the main hub of trade between Chroma and Kingston as well. Attractions within the city include the Neptune Lighthouse, the Eternal Periwinkle Victory Museum, the Astraldome(home of the New Periopolis Pilots baseball team and the New Periopolis Dragoons ~~handegg~~ football team), the Good Tyme Olde Tyme Sundry Events Colosseum, and the Bundestag building.

**Ulm**

Most of the territory of New Periopolis is now heavily urbanized and somewhat homogenized. However, there were a small sect of people who disliked that and flocked to the city of Ulm in the south. Ulm is the second largest city by population, but it lacks the clout of cities like Fortuna or Midori. The citizens call their culture ""German""(whatever that means). It is the only city in New Periopolis that used traditional architecture. Ulm competes with various cities in the VU for the coveted position of yodeling capital of Chroma. It is believed that most of the funny names the Emerald Federation adopted were due to Ulmer influence. The biggest attraction in Ulm is Kaiser Albrecht's Bockwurst and Biergarten. Famed yodeler Takeo Ischi(a Midori native) often performs at Rüdersdorf Arena. 


**Midori**

In the west of New Periopolis lies Midori, which is best known for its electronics shopping district, the biggest in the world. The residents are stereotyped as socially awkward shut-ins that do nothing but play video games, watch animated TV shows, and obsess over virtual girlfriends. Retro gaming is especially popular, with tournaments of 20+ year old games commonplace. Midori is also home to Sato Fishmongery and Canning Concern, the primary producer of mediocre seafood products to the Mega-Cheapo supermarket chain. Attractions include Nishi Beach, one of Chroma's only nude beaches, the aforementioned Izumi Electronics Market, and Kinoshita Field, home of the Midori Fish Fighters baseball team.

**Fortuna**

Located just to the northwest of the city of New Periopolis is the city of Fortuna, unfairly considered New Periopolis's little brother. Fortunans tend to have a chip on their shoulder regarding the Imperial City. Fortuna itself is known for the Advance Human Enhancement Company, which makes electronic and mechanical enhancements such as bionic eyes and exo-arms. Youth culture in Fortuna glorifies enhancements, and young people often go deeply in debt to fund their enhancements. In addition, normality is shunned, meaning there's a number of ridiculous outfits and hairstyles to be seen in Fortuna. Attractions include the Arax Club, the largest nightclub in Chroma, the Museum of Pointless and Shitty Art That Only Philistines Find Meaningful, and the famed Fortuna Red Light District.

**Tesliton**

Tesliton, in the southwest, is named after the massive Tesla coil in the center of the city. It was initially four different cities that merged together in 320 BF to become to new seat of Baron Cranemore. In more recent years, Tesliton has become the industrial center of New Periopolis, with places like Cerovo Electric Power Company and Cranemore Manufacturing(which is totally not a ~~money laundering scheme for the corrupt Cranemore clan~~) *The writer responsible for the above has been sacked.* Outside of the Tesla coil, Tesliton doesn't have any real attractions. The residents in the city tend to go to Malachite Cove for entertainment.

**Winkleston**

In the northwest corner of New Periopolis is Winkleston, a comparatively normal city compared to its contemporaries. Care was taken to make Winkleston more aesthetically pleasing than the other cities in the region, and there are many parks for recreation. The heart of the city is Saint Annette's Square, named after a martyr of the Holy Periwinkle Light. Unlike the rest of the mostly irreligious territory, the residents of Winkleston tend to be highly devout, revering either the Holy Periwinkle Light or the ZORBO IS OUR RIGHTFUL OVERLORD faith. Highlights of Winkleston include the Neon Fountains, Avesnes Cathedral(the oldest surviving building in Eastern Chroma that's still in use), and the Auxiliary Tang Factory.

**Jade Point**

Jade Point is the northernmost major city in Chroma. It is named for the numerous jade deposits located in the area. While other northern territories chose to concentrate their cities in the south, the people of New Periopolis instead decided to double down and build a large city despite the cold and chilly climate. Many of the buildings in Jade Point use green lighting, giving the entire city a green tint at night. Attractions include the Freedom Spire, the Orangered Sucked and This Is Why Museum, and the ruins of Medellin Castle. Also, just a short drive away is Mount Koruko, the highest point in New Periopolis.

**Emerald Bay**

Emerald Bay, in the northeast of New Periopolis, is full of suckups that renamed the city upon the formation of the Emerald Federation, despite the fact there isn't even a bay nearby. The portion of the Skaro Fleet loyal to Emerald quickly built Starford Naval Base, and it immediately became the main source of employment. Emerald Bay is also home to New Periopolis's Silly Party Headquarters. They actually built a pyramid for Prince Lolz, but ran out of Lolzifoam when all the Lolzifoam assets were seized for the war effort. Other attractions include Sensei Jimbo's Super Effective Kung Fu Studio, the New Periopolis Opera House, and Brandwell FCAR Raceway.  

**Malachite Cove**

Malachite Cove is a small city, but it's the entertainment capital of New Periopolis. It needs to be, since Tesliton is boring as shit. It's the only place in New Periopolis where gambling is legal, leading it to be full of casinos and strip clubs. Malachite Cove is only rivaled by Fortuna as a hive of vice and debauchery. It is also connected to Caerulus Antris through of a marvel of tunneling technology known locally as ""the Moleway"". Attractions include 
the LOADSOFMONEY Casino, and Mega-Cheapo Enterprises World Headquarters. 

**Caiseal**

Caiseal is lame. It's full of the few remaining Orangered partisans, and it's as close to a backwater as you can get in New Periopolis. There's things like quaint farmer's markets and quilt-making societies, but that's just stupid. There aren't any attractions unless you want to piss on the Grey Avenger statue.

---
#Climate
---


The climate in New Periopolis is considered dreary by outsiders due to the tendency towards drizzle and fog. Residents are used to the dark skies and rain, but visitors often find it a bit offputting. The temperature is a bit on the cool side, with mild summers.

---
#Flag
---
https://i.imgur.com/rf4P9qC.png

The flag of the Emerald Federation is heavily based on the flag of New Periopolis. This was due to the flag-making process getting delegated to an intern named Alfred Haniger. Haniger was given 30 minutes to create a flag and decided just to quickly alter the New Periopolis flag. However, the new flag was quickly adopted anyway and was voted #4 in the 75AF edition of the *Jade Point Yellow Rag's Yearly Flag Review*.

Details in thread",gabbycoelho,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/6f4l11/i_need_advice_probably_someone_to_help_me_to/,"So, first of all, Im sorry if this ends up being a kind of text wall, but I'll try to keep my backstory the minimum enough to make my point of things. 

I'm a male guy, 24 soon to be 25 years old and for much time I've been surrounded by this constant idea that I would like to be a woman. I've beeing keeping this off-side of my life for the past 10 years orsomething. It isn't like I hadn't have a good life, but I was feeling miserable inside, without any joy of living. 
More recently(4 years ago maybe) I started hating my body, my face, my voice, everything was just driving me nuts.

That was up until about 1.5 years ago when I decided that this coudln't be this way and I that I should give a chance about embracing my feminine inner-self as I was thinking about this more n more. I wasn't sure about wanting to actually be a girl, but I sure knew I didn't want my masculine traces and personality to stay. I started then living this fem self on my day to day life. I dress the more fem possible way that I feel is adequate, I've let my feelings flourish and even my personality had soften up a bit and I absolutely loved it.
Since this decision life has been great, I've come back to collage, started giving music classes to some friends and I'm dating some really wonderfull guy that is really making me super happy. 

The thing is.....I still feel like it isn't where I want to stop. I still envy woman, still think about having boobs and being ale to keep a full day-to-day woman life, wearing dresses, high hells, going to woman's restroom and all this stigmatized things. I feel like it's super important for me that I live my feelings as I don't want to be miserable again.  but I just ain't sure when I should do because things are starting to be good for me and Im super scared to screw things up. 

Holy cow I don't even know how I would talk about this with my family, I have a very close sister but it would be super hard to tell her something like this when neither I know what I want exactly.

Beside from that Im graduating on what we call here licenciate(in english/portuguese at the same time) which means I will give classes to people, I will have direct contact with lots of people everyday, the fear of rejection kicks hard sometimes. Count in from now more 4 years of study, 500 hrs of internship plus the phd time. I also don't how what the guy im starting to love will think about that and if it wasnt hard enough Brazil has the highest rate of trans-homicides in the world, people in general have been open minded here but still there is a lot of free hate on the streets, all this things keep freaking me out and I really don't what I should do.

I really feel like I would be a more genuine person if I tried to transition, but I have fear about screwing my life over. At the same time I don't want to keep this for later as I want to enjoy life now when Im still young and truly live it. But sometimes I feel like I'll just fuck over my life that is starting to feel like a happy thing.

I fucking don't know what to do with my life."
6f5erg,15,2017-06-03,"Terrible year filled with failure, wasted $10,000 in one summer.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6f5erg/terrible_year_filled_with_failure_wasted_10000_in/,"Hey everyone, I’ve had a hard time these last few years, but this past year in particular was pretty painful. After holding it in for months and months and talking my ever-supportive girlfriend’s ear off about it, I’ve decided to write about it here in the hopes that putting it all in writing and sharing it will allow me to actually get it off my chest and out of my mind. Fair warning, this is going to be a very, *VERY*, long read. 

Both of my parents are immigrants who met in the US in their 20s, one of them didn’t graduate high school, and neither of them speak good English, and both of my older brothers work in the service industry. As such, it was a pretty big deal when I was accepted to a prestigious university four years ago, given a big grant that took care of about half of my tuition, and started my journey as the first college student in my family. Ever since I was a young child everyone in my life would tell me how I’d use my intelligence to do “great things”, become rich, and change all of their lives for the better, and this acceptance seemed to begin to realize that expectation. I say that not to be arrogant, but to paint a picture of my environment. 

I began my studies that fall and, after floundering in the relatively intense academic environment for a while, I gained my footing  and started excelling in all of my classes and activities, but I wasn’t happy. I was alone in the city my university is in and because of some things that happened to me in the years leading up to college, I wasn’t making any friends. I spent virtually every weekend, event, non-vacation holiday, and birthday alone in my room feeling awfully about myself. Not just for personal reasons that would take unduly long to explain in one post, but because I was afraid that I would fail in the end, that despite all the money and work I was putting into college no one would take me on for an internship and I would be unable to find a job when I graduated. I would think back to the housing crisis that formed my early teen years, when we lost our house, my mother lost her job, my parents lost their relationship to one another and to us, and I had to move and finish my last stretch of high school alone in a new place, and I would feel terrified and inadequate, like if I didn’t “do better” all of that would happen again because of the debt we were taking on for my schooling and it would be my fault. It wholly consumed me – I did nothing but study, work, go to class, and apply to as many internships as I could. It felt hopeless for the first two years, but then, as the summer of my sophomore year was ending and I was nearing a breaking point, I got a wonderful email while I was trying to relax at a lake. I was accepted to an extremely competitive internship program with a major international organization, where I would live in another country for a few months and complete the work of an entry-level officer in their field. It was the exact employer and position that I wanted to work in when I graduated, that all of my efforts were aimed at, and was thus a dream come true. After I read the email I stood in shock for a what felt like a few minutes, just looking down at it, rereading it over and over while the sun beat down at my face, the birds sang above me, the waves hit the shore, and the people around me with asked me what happened. I truly couldn’t believe it, I felt like the luckiest and safest person in the world, like this was it, my ticket, the sign that everything would work out. 

I emailed the organization to learn more about the internship and, to my dismay, found out that it would take place during the academic year instead of next summer and that it would be a full-time obligation, meaning that I would need to take an entire semester off from school to pursue it. That was quite distressing as my major mandated that I become fluent in a foreign language by the time I graduated and I was in an intensive language program where missing one semester would equate to missing one year of material, and that program would not be running again when I would return. One would think that I would already know a foreign language and thus be exempt from that major requirement given that my parents are from two separate foreign nations, but neither of them passed their language down to my brothers and I as they wanted us to be “Americanized.” I spoke to the chair of my language’s department, who, by the way, is an insane asshole who calls students mentally disabled and makes them stand up in front of the whole class when they mess up so he can scream at them in the language until they cry, and he told me that he would accept no language credits taken outside of his program and that missing for the internship would, in his mind, almost certainly doom me to an extra year of school. I spoke to other graduate and undergraduate students in the program and a number of them told me that the chair made them start at “Language X 101” despite having years of education and experience in it because he did not personally teach them, showing that he truly would reject any courses I could take during my internship to make up for the lost time. I asked the dean for input and they said that I could theoretically test out of the language requirement. I was elated to hear that and asked how I would go about getting the test administered, and was crushed when they told me that the aforementioned sadist chair is the only person allowed to administer it. I asked if there was any way around testing with him or if the fact that the language I was studying was the language of the country the internship was in and they very firmly told me no, that there was no getting around him. Thus, this was a big risk. Miss this once in a lifetime internship or take the risk of having to pay for an entire extra year of school for one set of courses. I took in a lot of input from everyone in my life, and even sought advice from alumni in my school and employees of the company on LinkedIn to see if they thought the internship program was substantial enough to mandate missing a semester, and all of the advice I got, literally all of it, was to go because everything else would “work out.” I thought hard about it and realized that thousands of people would graduate from my university with a couple hundred a year having my major, but I was the only of them who would have this internship on their resume, making me much more competitive. So, I decided to go. The internship would only start about six months after my acceptance so I still had time.

Then came the second intimidating aspect of this internship opportunity, and I’m sure most of you already know what it is. Despite being in a foreign country, being a full-time job, and having an enormous opportunity cost, it was completely and utterly 100% unpaid. Not even airfare was covered. This was very daunting to me, but my parents, ever optimistic and certain of my ability to succeed, assured me that it would work out somehow. They had no money to give me for it so I redoubled my efforts to get a paid job in the city and finally got a job. Thanks be to the gods, I got a job in a place ten year old me swore he would work in one day, and it paid $15/hour. I was again amazed at my good fortune and momentarily happy, feeling safer from all of the worries that kept me in my room every weekend. I worked as often as I could given my class schedule in order to get enough money for a plane ticket and entered myself in some competitive scholarships the university offered. I didn’t expect to get them so I focused on working. I had a few thousand dollars in savings from the entirety of my life and the summers I spent working so I knew I could afford the tickets, some clothes for the job, and the basics when I got there, but I would be cutting it close and have absolutely nothing left over. My fortune didn’t stop there, however, as a few days later I got an email informing me that I won the grand prize in the biggest scholarship I applied to – the school would be granting me $3,000. I was ecstatic. Still alone in my room, not celebrating with anyone, but ecstatic. Now I could afford more than airfare and basics, I could afford warm clothes for the climate, my groceries while I was there, and a suit or two for the office. Two suits! I was a junior in college and had never owned a suit and now I was able to buy two brand new ones off the rack! It was amazing. Then, as if all of that wasn’t enough, I got a small $1,800ish refund from the university because they’d overcharged me or something. I’m not quite sure what happened, but I got an email saying I was getting a refund and $1,800 more dollars appeared in my account. I really felt like everything in my life was coming together and that this would be a great experience.

Then, a few weeks after the semester, just before I was due to leave, I got a call from the school saying they would have to take my scholarship money away because I wouldn’t be a full-time student during my internship and that was apparently in the scholarship’s fine print. I made it very clear in my application that I would be working full-time in a foreign country so who knows how the hell this issue was even allowed to happen, but it was happening and I had a terrible few days calling administrators, writing appeals, and begging. It all ended in my favor though as I eventually got an email from the person in charge of the scholarship apologizing for everything, telling me I would be getting all of the money, and saying that thanks to some of the briefs I filed with them they’d be changing their rules to reflect situations like mine in the future. After that I was all set to go and just waited for the day of my flight. You’re now probably thinking “Good for you! You dodged a bullet and got to have that amazing experience!” Too bad my internship was an absolute nightmare! 0/10. The worst professional experience of my entire life. Could have been the plot of tragi-comedy. Awful, just absolutely terrible in every way. It was one of the worst periods of my life. 

Long story short, there had apparently been miscommunications regarding my arrival on their end so they were surprised at my arrival and had no apartment ready for me, no work for me, no one to help set me up in this foreign country that I’d never been in, and, the best part, the day I arrived was the day my supervisor left on a two week long trip. They were literally walking out of the office as I walked in. I should have taken that as an omen of things to come and immediately boarded a plane back home, but I was too stupid and inexperienced to think anything but “Everything will be okay. You’ll make it okay.” Now I could go into detail about all of the ways this internship went wrong, but that would make this the longest Reddit post ever so I’ll just give a few quick highlights. 

After my supervisor returned from their two week trip they sat me in their office to discuss what I would be doing and they opened the discussion by saying “So… what school are you from? What do you study? I haven’t looked at your resume – I know absolutely nothing about you. Wait, are you an undergraduate or graduate? What do you want to do here?” and closed the discussion with “Whelp, I have absolutely nothing for you to do.” 

Turned out everyone in the office hated each other. I mean HATED EACH OTHER. Even the married couples wanted each other dead. The prestigious boss with his decades of experience was driving me home with his wife, who was a former employee, one night and he took a wrong turn and his wife took on this terrible tone and started saying things like “Boss person, where are you going? What are you doing? Do you know how to drive?” and it was very clear to me that he was quite embarrassed and uncomfortable, so I tried to steer the conversation away comedically by saying something like “Oh we’re just seeing some sights since I’m new to the city! No big deal!” but she yelled at him for getting me lost anyway. I tried to tell them I didn’t mind that he took a wrong turn because I had nowhere to be and the boss interrupted me and said in a defiant tone “Oh don’t worry, throwaway. Wife isn’t upset, she’s just taking another opportunity to let the world know how little she thinks of me and my abilities.” In that moment I transformed into Jesse Pinkman drinking water at Walter White’s table and kept my mouth shut and let them fight until they dropped me off. This seemed to be the norm; every married couple I that worked there would just talk shit about each other in front of me, and employees would openly insult employees who weren’t around.

One of the people in the office asked someone to watch their cat when they went on vacation, and that person just never gave it back. Never. The vacation ended months before I even arrived and they were still embroiled in a fight about coworker B not giving coworker A his cat back. 

One of the people in my area of the office took my aside one day to tell me what a terrible supervisor my supervisor is and how they’re not qualified to lead anyone. They told me that my internship was a disaster, that I was being mismanaged, and that it was all their fault. 

Someone asked me how well I spoke the local language and I told them that I knew few words but that I thought I pronounced a certain set of vowels a little better than someone who was speaking it in our general area at the time. I thought I was just harmlessly using someone as a benchmark, not calling them out or insulting them but just simply saying something like “I think I’m pretty poor with the grammatical structures but I think I pronounce “x set of sounds” slightly better than X.” In retrospect, now that I’ve a little more experience in tact and awareness of how butthurt people can get, I wouldn’t have mentioned pronouncing those vowels better than X person at all. I thought it was harmless then and truly didn’t mean anything by it, but now I see how it’s rather uncouth. Despite that, I still don’t think it was a huge deal. Were I the person I was speaking to, I would have politely told the little intern to consider their words a little more carefully in a professional setting or something like that, but they instead simply nodded and went “Oh that’s pretty good, don’t worry, you’ll learn new words in time!” and acted like all was fine. They then apparently sent a complaint regarding “insubordination and disrespect” to my supervisor for that comment and exaggerated it to me bragging to everyone that I spoke better Russian than person X. 

On my first day on the job I was sent to observe someone doing something so I could ask questions and learn. I observed and asked exactly one question, which was “Why did you do X thing in that situation instead of Y thing?” They responded calmly and told me why and I said “Okay, got it.” They then apparently sent a complaint regarding “Disrespect for the chain of command and the decisions of superiors” to my supervisor for asking that question. I learned about these complaints because a month and half into the internship my supervisor called me into their office to scream at me for an hour, yes literally an hour, and told me about these two complaints and said I was a worthless, useless, intern. She also informed me that the position that was originally set aside for me as an intern was given to someone’s wife a little while before I arrived and that the only reason she was my supervisor was because she was the most junior person and they shooed me to her to figure out what to do with me.

When a certain department made mistakes they attributed the mistakes to me despite the fact that I never worked on what they blamed me for. Being the intern, I guess I was an easy scapegoat. 

I was told to write and submit a comprehensive professional business case justifying a major, $20,000+ purchase of service from a local contractor, despite knowing nothing about the subject matter, having no business experience whatsoever, and no knowledge of the requirements and formatting of a purchase-justifying business case for the organization. I emailed the person who gave me the project asking if they could give me any further directions or if there was a handbook I could look at, and their response email, in its entirety, was “Just Google it.” 

Someone on a company forum posted talking about how terrible it was that they didn’t pay their interns and everyone was commenting on it agreeing. I thought about commenting as an unpaid intern but thought it was dangerous, but also thought it was the “right” thing to do, so I asked the superior overseeing me if I was allowed to comment and they said “Uh huh! Of course you can. Your input would be invaluable.” So I stupidly commented saying something about how I was extremely grateful for the opportunity and blahblah but that I agreed with the original poster’s points that having the internship be unpaid unfairly excludes a considerable portion of students and makes it extremely hard for those who do go to live given that most need to pay for their own housing and food while working full-time. (Think about those UN interns that lived in tents) My comment got several hundred likes and someone in the organization saw my comment, pitied me, and sent me a few hundred dollars so I could enjoy my time there. I was beyond grateful but sadly as I was having so many difficulties I left early and the cost of changing my ticket ate all of the money they sent me.

So all in all I learned nothing I was supposed to learn there, gained no connections, and was even more miserable than usual 24/7. I left early and HR called me from their local headquarters, which was hundreds of miles away, because there was no HR office or officer on site but they wanted to handle my exit interview since I was choosing to leave early. I told them everything, they were aghast and told me to write everything that I experienced in my internship down. I did, I sent it, they took it, I left the country, and they sent me an email weeks later saying they got some people in trouble with it, that’s all I know. 

So I got home, had had a terrible experience that in no way justified missing a semester, and was in a very bad place emotionally. I felt like I’d made the biggest mistake of my life and had bad thoughts for weeks. Eventually, however, I pushed out of it and told myself “Okay, that was a terrible experience and maybe it was a mistake to go, but you made the best decision you could have at the time and it’s done with anyway. You need to keep going forward and make sure this doesn’t ruin everything.” So I got my old summer job at home back and poured all of my remaining savings and scholarship money into online courses at a different college that would allow me to make up for the credits I missed and an intensive language course in another state that would hopefully allow me to catch up on the language course I missed. I had a full-time job and five online courses for the first few weeks of summer until the language course began. When it did I stayed at the school Monday through Friday and had class there from 9:00am to 5:00pm and would then do the work for my five online classes. After class on Friday I would drive back home, which was several hours away, work Saturday and Sunday, and drive straight back to the school after work on Sunday. 

The courses and board at the language school all cost me around $11,000 up front, with the gas money, tolls, the price of insuring me as a driver, and the hours I missed at work bringing it up to $13,000. I knew I was spending all of my savings but the cost of taking an extra year of school was so much greater. I thought I was doing the right thing by working hard and fighting to keep my major and graduate on time. Everyone told me I was doing the right thing. Everyone assured me that “everything would work out.” I had a nagging instinct inside of me telling me I was messing up, but I doubted myself and listened to everyone else over it. I made myself think that all of my hard work and spending would pay off, but I was wrong. 

The language course was expensive and intensive, but it didn’t’ teach me everything I needed to know and I couldn’t pass the test. So the choice was either pay for a full extra year of school to complete the language requirement or change my major, so I changed my major to the next closest thing. It saved me from having to take an extra year, but it meant that the language course, the single most expensive endeavor of the summer, and two of the five other courses didn’t count towards anything. They were just thousands of dollars down the drain. “It’s alright.” I told myself “You made the best decisions you could have with the information you had. You messed up and wasted some money, but you’ll make it work, you can do this. Don’t give up.” Once my major was officially changed in the school’s system, however, it showed that none of the other three courses that I took counted for anything either. “That can’t be right.” I told myself “I checked all of the requirements and they matched up perfectly with x, y, and z. Let me go to the whatever office and have them fix it.” So I went to the relevant office and pointed it out to them but they informed me that in the particular college that I switched into within the university they did not accept outside classes for those three specific requirements after you reached a certain class standing. So those three courses would have counted for those three requirements if I’d taken them and then transferred to my university, or if I’d taken them as a sophomore or freshman and then transferred them in, or if they were any three other requirements, but these three particular requirements did not allow juniors or seniors who had already matriculated to fulfill them through courses outside of the university. It hit me like a bombshell: “I wasted all of my money. All of it. Every course, every dollar, every drop of gas, every hour spent driving and studying instead of enjoying the summer, it was for nothing.” I hit a breaking point. I hated myself. I had wasted everything and made every mistake possible. Not only had the internship been terrible, none of the courses that I spent all of my savings on counted for anything and I now had to take and pay for an extra course in the fall semester in order to graduate on time. It was terrible. I felt terribly. I hated myself. My girlfriend lived with me in my senior year and even with her part-time job we struggled to afford food in the ungodly expensive city we lived in because I’d wasted every dollar I made. I struggled to feed us and we had to use a food pantry. I felt so low.

Despite all of those struggles and all the bullshit academic issues I contended with throughout the year, which included them not properly attributing some of my courses to my new major, the financial aid office yelling “SURPRISE, YOU HAVE A $5,000 CHARGE NOBODY TOLD YOU ABOUT”, and a professor giving me an F on a final paper because he graded the final paper I submitted as an extra credit paper (was absolutely moronic, I can share the emails if anyone is interested), I graduated on time. I took graduate level courses by the end and graduated with honors, and the few people who came to my graduation told me how proud they were of me, but I wasn’t, and am not, proud of myself. I feel like a moron. I was miserable throughout all of college, gambled on an internship that was worthless, and blew my entire life savings on courses that counted for nothing, that are just “elective” spots on my transcripts. Even worse, I turned down the only job offer I got. From August to May I must’ve applied to over 200 jobs and only one gave me an offer. It was an entry level position with a major company that, while having nothing to do with my field of interest, paid good money, gave yearly bonuses, and paid for relocation. It sounded like a wonderful offer, except it was multiple states away from every place that I had lived or wanted to live in, in a place that’s in the grip of winter nine months out of the year, and it was 60-80 hours a week with up to 90% of the work week spent traveling and mandated being on call 24/7. 

Just like with the internship, I took advice from everyone I could and tried to look at it from every angle. Just like with the internship, the universal opinion of everyone in my life was that I should take the job because “Everything would work out.” “Oh, you’re worried about the mental strain of working upwards of 60 hours a week every week? Don’t worry, it’ll work out.” “You’re concerned about uprooting your life and moving to a place you’ve never been to and where you know no one for the fifth time in six years? Don’t worry, it’ll work out.” I thought about it rationally and said to myself “You might be miserable for a few more years, but what’s some more misery in the face of all of the money and potential career advancement you’ll get? It’s a tradeoff for the greater good and an investment in the future.” But I stopped myself and realized that I just did not want to fucking do it. I didn’t want to move away again, to a frozen waste in the middle of nowhere, so that I could work myself to death. My mother was texting me one night and told me “It’s okay, child, you’ll just have a few hard years.” and I said “But, mother, all of these past few years have been hard years. I’ve been miserable for as long as I can remember and I’m tired of it. I’ve made so many sacrifices for ‘the greater good’ and it’s made me hate life. I have no friends, no good memories from college, and no money. I wasted it all trying to do the right thing. I’m so tired, I just want to be happy.” She responded with “I know, sweetheart, you’ll make the right decision on your own.” I know she was trying to make me feel better, but it didn’t help at all. All of their advice that things would just “Work out.” and “Be fine.” Always just made me feel like no one was listening to me. So I put everyone out of my head and trusted my own instincts, and they told me to turn the job down, so I did. I knew I would hate life if I went there so I said fuck it and didn’t go. 

So now here I am, sitting in the bedroom I had in high school, on my computer that’s coming apart at the seams and going to break any day now. I’ve no job, no car, not enough money to rent an apartment in a city where I could potentially find a job, and not enough money to go out and enjoy the summer. Everyone in my house is laughing at me, telling me I’m having a nice vacation sitting at home on my computer everyday, but I’m not. I spend almost every waking hour filling out job applications, writing cover letters, and looking for other jobs I can apply to, feeling constant shame over my mistakes and wasting all of my money. If I hadn’t thrown that money away I could have a car and enough rent for a month or two in a city where I could find employment, or at least I would have enough leeway to actually go out and have a little fun and feel like I’m on vacation. My family keeps telling me that I’m upset about nothing and should spend more time relaxing, that a job “Will come eventually” but they don’t seem to understand that I can’t really relax when I’m stuck in the house all day and have all of these shameful memories from the past year, and that you generally need to apply to jobs in order to get a job.

I know that I likely will get another job offer at some point in the next year, and that plenty of people make mistakes with their money, but all these thoughts and memories have felt like a typhoon in my mind for months and I just had to finally get them all out. I’m filled with regret, but driven to push forward. I’ll try to think of all of these things as lessons and do my best to make up for my mistakes, and try to make my money last. I just wanted to share to get it all out of my head and move on. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. It helps to feel like I’ve been heard.

Tl;dr: I was the first person in my family to go to college. College was not fun. I was offered a very expensive internship that would make me miss a semester. I took it. It was terrible. I then spent over $10,000 trying to make up for it in summer courses. I then had a miserable year where I had to go to a food pantry to feed myself. Then I turned down a job. Now I’m typing this between job applications on a years old computer that’s falling apart to try to clear my head. I’m filled with regret, self-loathing, and shame, but driven to move forward. 

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest."
6f5m0c,3,2017-06-04,My [24M] girlfriend's [23F] parents continuously belittle her achievements and future plans. Realistically can I do anything about it?,unbearable_cactus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6f5m0c/my_24m_girlfriends_23f_parents_continuously/,"Hello all. I'm very confused and worried about my SO's current state and future mental well-being. I'm sorry for the wall of text. 

My girlfriend and I met in college (both studying engineering) and have been dating for over three years at this point. She comes from a small New England town and she's the first woman in her family to get an engineering degree. Her mom is a teacher at a local community college (education degree) and her father is a carpenter (no college degree). She's always been quiet and reserved, though she's academically stellar. She went to college on a 50% scholarship, was inducted into a myriad of honor and service societies, and even managed to get a publication out because of her undergraduate research. Either because of the nature of the work or an inexperience with the field, this has never been praiseworthy to her parents. I want to stress that they've been very nice and welcoming when I've interacted with them, and economically they have always given her a good life. However, her mother always finds a way to divert any conversation to my SO's teenage years and her mistakes when in high school or applying to college. Her father has the uncanny ability to always string words in a particular way to make her think she wasted her degree or that she was incapable of competing with her classmates (Ex. ""you should have studied something else given the job market"", ""X got an internship this summer, why didn't you"",""I used to think that if you failed out it would be a semester in"", etc).  She stopped reporting her grades since her parents would always act disappointed if she got anything below a A-, and this evolved to her essentially keeping about 80% of her college life a secret (even successes). They're both also passive-aggressive about her distance from home, and coupled with the fact that they're awful with phones this has resulted in strained communication. Sometimes they won't tell her about family scares or important events for a few days. This has ranged from news that her favorite aunt was in the hospital to her hearing about the death of her childhood cat 3 days after it happened. 

When compiled, all of this has resulted in her being very self-conscious and pessimistic to the point of professional harm (not applying to internships/job due to personal doubts) and experiencing serious episodes of anxiety and depression. From the start, I have always made sure to prop her up and point her in the right direction, serving as a cheerleader and as a shoulder to cry on, even if I actively had to fight an uphill battle to convince her to remind her of her capabilities. It's my joy to see her succeed, but I have to admit that its been exhausting. You can't help but get frustrated when your SO cancels on an anniversary dinner last minute only to find her crying at home huddled on the couch because she got a B on a midterm. I've asked that she get professional help to at least vent, but she's shot me down (sometimes aggressively) given the ""risk that her parents would somehow find out and cut her off financially"". I graduated a year before her and even though I could have taken a dream job a state away, I decided to get my Masters' locally to keep an eye on her. To my personal calm fortunately, she found her stride during senior year. She recently graduated with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering and was accepted to a top-tier PhD program (self-financing and she has no loans because she worked part time during school). This effectively means her parents will no longer be supporting her. 

Because she'll be moving to the West Coast, she decided to spend this summer at home to make the transition easier on her mother. Over the past year she had managed to find personal peace despite a hectic course-load, but two weeks has been enough to turn the clock back on this progress. Her mother plays the guilt card daily, and her father has apparently told her that's she's wasting her future by getting an advanced research degree, along with implying that she's lazy for not having a full time summer job. This has been enough to rekindle a serious concern I thought we had put to rest. 

Realistically, though I see a future with her I don't know how long our relationship will last given job prospects and location (I have to stay put for a year to finish my degree while she moves, and recently I found out I may have to return home for a bit due to some family concerns). Regardless, I care deeply for her and I'm afraid of what will happen over the next 4 years while she balances a graduate workload with this apparent lack of support from home. She's asked that I simply accept her anxiety but I know how detrimental it can get. 

Maybe I just needed to vent myself, but if you have any form of insight or support I would greatly appreciate it. 

TL;DR - My GF feels pressured and belittled by her parents despite her academic achievements and I'm afraid of her mental well-being in the future. Is there any way for me to help?

Thank you friends.

6f5rey,2,2017-06-04,[WP Response]The Adversary,Boenerhorse,Boenerhorse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boenerhorse/comments/6f5rey/wp_responsethe_adversary/,"[Prompt Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6f1say/wp_the_year_is_2023_humanity_has_just_received/)

A simple message in a complex binary, translated in days. Director Samson of the now-provisional Xenoform Activities Department of the U.N rapped his knuckles against the desk rapid fire. The beacon had been repeating the message for five thousand years-- five thousand! -- as if whatever was out there knew we would broadcast at some point. It was right, evidently.

Samson had a near heart attack as an intern pushed open his door with ridiculous speed. ""Director--""
He didn't have to even say another word before Samson stormed out of his office and onto the catwalk that overlooked the command center, looking at the scientists, linguists, and programmers with combined fury and elation. ""Well?"" He boomed.

The room was silent. One of the men at a computer flipped a couple of switches, before the screen lit up. Static filled it at first, before a full body of a creature came into view. It said something in a chattering and unintelligible tongue, which was translated by subtitles on the bottom of the screen. ""Greetings."" It had said. The alien was insectoid, and looked like a bipedal cross of a stag beetle and a centipede. Five pairs of arms, two enormous legs, 12 eyes. The room behind it was indistinct, flowing with geometric designs.

Dead silence gripped the room as they awaited more. Their first contact with alien life.

The chattering resumed. ""My name is unimportant to your species. Know we are your progenitors, your forerunners. You were not intended to be the dominant species. But here you are. An interesting turn of events."" The thing sucked in air and whooping as if emulating laughter.

""If you're listening to this, we are long dead."" Somehow, the silence got even deeper as those harrowing words were spoken. ""Taken by the Adversary.""

Samson yelled out, ""What is it?!"" forgetting he was watching what amounted to TV. Nobody looked at him or gave him a dirty look.

""The Adversary is what lies at the center of this galaxy, of all galaxies, that which slumbers until one awakens it. Broadcasting into it carelessly makes it stir. We silenced you because of it. We hope you've listened.""
The sound of servers being turned off filled the room. Communications arrays broadcasting into deep space went silent one by one at the command of the alien. Better safe than sorry.

""The Adversary is unbeatable, from what we can understand. Two hundred million [untranslated. Translator note: seems to be a unit of energy] was not enough to even harm it. It swallowed it like it swallowed our worlds."" The insect seemed to weep for a moment, green ichor flowing from its eyes. ""But unlike our ancestors, we are prepared.""

What followed was a massive data stream-- exabytes of information flowed into several dedicated servers. As the men tending them scrambled to ensure there was no massive overflow, the voice continued. ""What we are sending you is all knowledge of our civilization, every other civilization in the galaxy, and our technology, as well as our complete star maps. You'll find each of them to be leagues more useful than your own primitive works.""

Samson's jaw dropped. This would send Humanity forward thousands of years. He had been the one to lead it. Joy-- pure, childlike joy-- filled him to the brim.

""But we ask a price in return for this information."" Samson sobered immediately. ""You must work with your fellow aliens. Do not hoard these works and live as powerful hermits. The Adversary cannot be defeated alone."" The xeno made a sighing motion, as if a great weight had been taken off its shoulders. The sounds of wind and screeches could be heard somewhere far away. ""It comes now.""

The data just kept coming, millions on millions of terabytes. They had filled tweelve dedicated drives with it, and already it was being translated as the message was relayed. Shouts and voices filled the room like an orchestra, the message continuing unabated.

""Humanity. You must fight together with your allies. If you do not, you will be swallowed as we are. Do not broadcast into space again until you have the proper technology we sent. Do not throw your lives away. Fight the Adversary. Succeed where we failed. End message."" A map of the milky way then appeared, with stars highlighted by circles and lines, each ending in a stream of text-- ""Quz'aki, Hingajhgh, Bukoro, Jilak, Crawana...""-- Alien names. Names of Humanity's allies.

January 12th 2023 would be remembered as The Day of Stars, for the gifts given by our progenitors. They were called gifts, but they were what they were-- tools. Tools to destroy what lay at the center.

Today, 2698, we stand among countless ships of silver and gold and fire and energy. Millions have come. We lay before the center. With a blast of a coded bugle from a synthetic's artificial breath, we awaken our enemy.

**Random Thoughts**

- George trying to “save” the dead patient. Waste of hospital resources and insurance money? Nope. Just another life lesson courtesy of Bailey.
- I guess it’s only been 2 months that they’ve been interns.
- Adele! I liked her.
- Judy doll swallower is giving off strong psychopath vibes.
- Olivia and George, so awkward, but I feel bad for her.
- Burke is right about separating patient’s personal lives from the job they have to do. But still, I don’t like it.
- Why were there so many people in the doll swallower’s surgery? It looked like there were 30 people just standing around.
- When Burke and Shepherd have a standoff, it’s almost like Meredith and Cristina do too.
- Sign of the times - Ebola virus shout out
- Webber would want those Judy doll heads, Bailey. Don’t throw ‘em away!
- Aww, Alex giving real advice to the son of the wife-beater. Now you’re just making me fall in love with you.
- Kudos to the kid for deciding to do the liver transplant and for being smart enough to have conditions.
- I literally do not understand how women with children can stay in abusive relationships. I feel a mixture of pity and anger. Pity because I know there’s some deeper mental or psychological issue that makes them stay. Anger because they failed to protect their children. My biological father used to hit my mom, but she got out before I turned one so I don’t even remember it. I was raised to believe that violence in a relationship is always a deal breaker. Alright, alright, stepping off soap box now. 

**Quotes**

- “She probably could have picked a better metaphor.” “Give her a break. She’s got a hangover.”
- “You don’t know what a vacation is. How would you know how to ruin it?”
- “Why ten doll heads?” “Because eleven would have been too much.”
- “Love has its limits.” Preach!

**Questions**

- Are you Team Cristina or Team Burke in regards to the wife-beating liver transplant patient?
- Is it just me or are Cristina/Burke giving anyone else Jackson/April vibes? It’s like they know they should be apart but they still want to be together. The angst is real y'all.

6f5woz,2,2017-06-04,Where Can I Find a Reliable Mode of Transport from JLT To Deira,tidalrise,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/6f5woz/where_can_i_find_a_reliable_mode_of_transport/,"My girlfriend just started an internship in Business Village (Deira) which takes over an hour and half to reach using the metro from where we live (JLT). I've been on the hunt for a car that would take her from home to Deira on a monthly basis payment. The only one so far I found was through Dubizzle, which he agreed to 1K monthly, and wanted me to pay upfront for it. I said sure, but today I had to make sure its safe so I went down with her to see the guy, then he comes up with a random friend with him, I said Im coming along, to see if the random guy was maybe another customer, but he wasn't he was just sitting there. So once we reached I told him deal is off and just paid for the one trip.

Does anyone know a trustworthy mode of transport (car pool or private car) that would agree to 1K monthly payment that is safe for ladies?"
6f637z,2,2017-06-04,Reasons why I'm a horrible person,throwaway_trash97,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6f637z/reasons_why_im_a_horrible_person/,"Before I start:

1. I'm a terrible person. I know this, you can confirm this if you want to, but you'd be better off writing to someone who deserves encouragement in another post. 
2. I'm not suicidal anymore. Those copy-paste 1-800 numbers for [insert country here] replies don't apply. The number is in my phone if I need it. 
3. I'm adding up all the money given to me over the years, and I will pay it all back, every last penny. 
4. I know this sounds like a whiny asshole post. I don’t care, I just want this written down somewhere since I can never admit the entire story to anyone.


I graduated HS 2 years ago with an 82% average grade. If I applied myself I could probably scrape a A in all my classes except calculus. I moved into a dorm room in the fall at a nearby trade school that had a reputation for squeezing the contents of a 4-year Mechatronics focused Bachelors program into a 2-year diploma, and a hiring rate of 95%. It also had a reputation of having intake of 30 people/year and only 4/year completion. I only cared about the first part. When I got there, there were 3 people my age, and a lot of 30-35 who had several years in a similar field who were looking at getting a specialization in robotics.  There were 6 courses with 30h/week in the class and another 30/week of homework. I also had a part-time job selling computers. 


I failed every class my first term there. 


At this point most people would realize that somethings wrong, and that they should reconsider their choice of program that they joined. I thought I should take part-time courses in the spring/summer/fall term so that I could re-join the second term-students next winter. Not even wait a year to enter with the first semester in the fall, I paid for each class individually and spent $3k driving/parking to take the courses 2 at a time. 


I took the math course in the fall with the first semester students, I failed again. It’s worth pointing out that this math course is covering exponents, logs, basic MATLAB and some formula’s for finding unknown currents/voltages in a basic resistor/power circuit. There’s no reason for me to fail this twice. 


I took it again in January, and I failed. Now I’ve failed the same class 3 times. I got an email saying I’m no longer able to take this program, and that I will have to select something else, or leave. My credits are specific to the program and have no equivalent courses in another program/school. 


Honestly if I had tried my hardest I wouldn’t hate myself at this point. But I know why I failed and that’s why I hate myself. 


So, there’s a few reasons why I failed. 


The first is because I’m depressed, drink Starbucks and hate being paid attention to. I don’t know if you can get addicted to Starbucks, but I think I’m hooked on their iced lattes. Every day I go in, order my drink with extra espresso shots and leave. The entire time I’m screaming in my head that I shouldn’t do this. It costs too much and I know I won’t get anything good out of it. But I just smile at the barista and pay. I always get to school with barely any time to spare, and if I’m late I can’t go into class. The profs would actually love if I came inside when I’m a few minutes late, but I can’t make myself go in. I usually sit next to the door and scream inside again. Then I go wait for my next class to start. Sometimes when I’m late I don’t even make it to school. I just start verbally screaming in my car and go park somewhere and sit in the car all day. When I get home I’m still vibrating from all the caffeine, and I can’t fall asleep. I just lie awake until 3am thinking about what a POS I was today and all the reasons why I don’t deserve to live. Then when it’s 5am and I have 2 hours sleep I just lie in bed and cry some more. Then the cycle repeats. I’m aware of how to fix this, but I can’t stop myself, this just keeps happening. 


Second reason is that I like to go on CL and buy crap to feel something. Might be an old laptop, server or smartwatch or something stupid. Never for a good deal, and always something I don’t need. When I fail a test, I get something else. Then I’m too busy playing to do homework so I don’t fail the next test. Again, I know what I need to do, but I can’t stop myself. 


The third reason I’m not in the program is that I didn’t stop to think. I should’ve paid attention when I was one of the only people in the program right out of HS. When I failed every class I should’ve thought about what that meant. When I found out some courses only run once/year, I should’ve realized that I can/should wait to take the program next fall instead of spreading it out. When I failed math twice I should’ve stopped immediately since I signed a contract saying the third try was my final attempt. But I don’t think. And now it’s too late. 


SO:


I’ve added it all up, my parents/family have contributed ~10k towards my education and I have 0 payoff for it. My job has paid ~ 20k since I started. I’ve spent ~19k on Starbucks, old computers and gas/insurance. When I got the confirmation that I was out, I honestly thought about ending it, I drove down a side road in the middle of nowhere at 200k and thought about going into a light pole. But it wouldn’t be fair to my family since they haven’t been paid back, they would have to cancel a vacation they were going on the next week, and the hydro company would have to put power back on for someone. 


For some reason, I’m still going to Starbucks since it’s the only time I feel anything other than self-hate, although after the drinks gone I hate myself even more. I know how dumb this feels, and I hate myself even more for it but I honestly cannot help myself. 


I’m going to get a second job and not go back to school, shred my credit card and put most of my money in a savings account that charges per transaction. I’m going to start paying fair rent immediately and once I have 10k saved up (2 years?) I’m going to pay back my family and move out. I’m severing all ties financially with them after that, I’ve told them I don’t want them throwing away any more money since I had a very good chance and I blew it. If I manage to ever save up enough I might actually get to go to a trade school, I’ve heard some of the apprenticeship programs pay for themselves after the first year when you get into the paid internship. I really wanted to do something with programming robots, but I blew my chance for that. 


My family knows I washed out, but I haven’t told them why. Right now, they think that the course load was too much, which is only a small part of it. I’ve seen the second-year stuff, and I think I would’ve washed out anyways, but if I made it that far, maybe I would’ve been smart enough to realize I wasn’t smart enough for it and take a year of self-studying.  I don’t know if I’m going to tell them the truth.

6f7g1t,8,2017-06-04,Background to the murder of Hae Min Lee,bluekanga,Frankenserial,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frankenserial/comments/6f7g1t/background_to_the_murder_of_hae_min_lee/,"Hae Min Lee was a responsible, mature, well-known, committed student at Woodlawn High School, in Baltimore County, Maryland.  A great lacrosse and field hockey player, as well as manager of the wrestling team, featured in a short, 1999 TV segment, Hae was “a prize” – a vibrant, intelligent, outgoing, young woman born in 1980 in South Korea. She's a member of the Magnet program at school. She hopes to be an optometrist and is planning and saving for a school trip to France. She's an intern of her French teacher, Hope Schab and she gets to school early each day to help her out. Hae's mother, who lives with Hae’s grandparents, was raising her. Her mother, Youn Wha Kim, moved from South Korea with her children to the USA and was previously in a relationship with a guy in California. After that relationship broke down she moved, with her two children, to live with her parents in Baltimore. Hae’s younger brother, Young, completes their family. Hae has a busy schedule: not only interning at school involving early starts, but also working part-time at Lenscrafters after school and weekends. She owns a car and has recently started to pick up her 6 year old niece from kindergarten after school and before she goes onto work or sports duties. She's had boyfriends before and has the normal spats with her parents and grandparents as she tests her boundaries. She seems to have a reasonably close relationship with her brother. 

Adnan Syed is from a Pakistani background and is seventeen when he murders his ex-girlfriend, Hae, in 1999. He lives with his parents who are devout Muslims. He is the middle one of three sons, with no sisters. He has many acquaintances and is popular, by all accounts, although reported to be a little pompous and a little arrogant. He's elected Prom Prince in 1998 at Woodlawn where he's a member of the Magnet program. He's hoping to go to University. He has had relationships with girlfriends before, although nothing serious by all accounts, and  is no stranger to dates and apparently has procured sex before. He’s already experimenting with drugs by 1998 and has a supplier, Jay. His father, Syed Rahman, belongs to a strict Islamic sect. His mother, Shamin Syed, runs a nursery at her home and in addition, is a traditional, Muslim wife and mother. She has many of the red flag behaviours of an abused woman (see previous posts). The family unit is steeped in traditional, Pakistani, male entitlement culture that embodies women as property. 
At 16 and 17 years old, in common with many young people, Syed wants to sexually experiment.  However this is a problem for him as his family and religious community forbid dating and even socially mixing with the opposite sex – essentially girls are off limits. 

Jay Wilds finished at Woodlawn High School in 1998.  He works to support himself, not in a career at that point, more of a variety of part-time jobs. His grandmother and mother have raised Jay. His uncle seems to be have involved in more serious drug dealing and is known to the police. Jay’s worldly wise and on occasion, has been on the receiving end of the heavy-handed police campaign prevalent at that time in Baltimore. His grandmother and mother attempt to steer him away from the parts of the extended family that have drifted off the straight and narrow. He was steeped in the “No Snitching” culture of his community and knew of the appalling consequences of breaking that taboo. Being black, he also knew first-hand of the systemic failings that hindered his community. Jay dated Stephanie, another prominent member of the Magnet program and a peer of Hae and Adnan. He is close friends with Jenn who is studying at University and works part-time as a swimming attendant. Jenn also worked with a woman whose husband was a Baltimore City Police officer. Jenn is close friends with Cathy who lives with her boyfriend Jeff. Their apartment often seems to be a meeting place for Jay and Jenn to hang out and smoke weed. Cathy is at University. 

Adnan Syed was elected prom prince in 1998. On that occasion, after the school celebrations, at the subsequent Hard Rock Party, he “gets off” with Hae. Hae is seduced by his love bombing. She’s his first serious relationship with a school friend and one he’s forced to keep hidden from his family. Adnan’s father turns a “blind eye” to his son’s dating, thus condoning and enabling it. Muslim young women are oftentimes tightly controlled and off-limits to their male peers. So there exists a culture of using non-Muslim women as sexual fodder, under the guise of romance, but really it’s about Muslim male entitlement to use these women to develop their sexual prowess. The informed consent of their targets is wilfully ignored. Not too different an attitude from many non Muslim males one could surmise. The difference being, that this breaks the values that the family are supposedly to be living within in the eyes of their religion. Deceit and male entitlement would therefore seem no stranger in the Syed family. 

Hae’s diary documents the development of the relationship through the infatuation, fucking and fall out phases. However, this is no normal teen relationship. The diary provides evidence of dating violence – in the form of severe emotional abuse of Hae by Syed. One can read there of the gas lighting tactics he used to confuse and subjugate her. Her friends and teachers also testified, at his two trials, to his controlling and possessive nature plus how he stalked her by invading girl-only get-togethers and also intruding in her intern time at school where she once hid from him, witnessed by a teacher. Also testified to was his physical abuse of Hae using “stand-over” threats witnessed at school. He also harassed her repeatedly using such distancing tactics as phoning her late at night causing friction between her and her mother plus grandparents as well as ignoring her plus putting her and her accomplishments down. It all testifies to a male who has no concept of women having independence from their male partners.

He was the “Golden Child” who must not be outshone by anyone. His partner must hide her light under his bushel, in accordance with his cultural and religious norms. Thus his coercive control of Hae would seem “normal”, and her rejection of it and him as abhorrent, in his and his families’ eyes."

I was dating my ex for 2 years. About 20 months in I moved across the country for an internship that was going to last 6 months. I had trouble making friends so I resorted to drugs to cope with the loneliness when I got out of work. I still talked to her, but because of the drugs it was very distant. It got to the point where I was under extreme loneliness and I probably should have told her that or went to therapy or something.

Anyways, the loneliness and lack of communication with my ex got to me and I downloaded tinder and cheated on her.. she found out because one of the girls I was talking to found her Instagram and sent her screenshots of my profile and messages with her. I visited her for our 2 year and told her the truth and we ended up breaking up.. it's been 2 months since then and I've quit drugs and started working out and focusing on my online class and just being a better man. 

Last night she called me because she also moved out of state for a summer internship that started in late May when school got out. Her phone got stolen and she didn't know who to call or tell about her situation. It made me happy that she could still talk to me, but her roommate was with her and she was understandably PISSED she called me.

I don't get it. I fucked up BIG time. It's been almost 2 months now and I still can't get over how sad I am for putting her through this.. why does she still talk to me? I'm hoping to get back home when my internship ends and visiting her at hers and talking through this. I'm not sure she'll take me back but the fact she called me last night crying tells me she's not over me..

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do next? I told her I had an extra phone for situations like this that she could use and she's going to let me know if she needs it after she tells her parents her phone got stolen. "

Current I game on a MacBook Pro (I know) that I have for college. I play CS GO, Day of Defeat, and other similar games. I really want to play Player Unknown Battlegrounds, but its only on PC. 

I have just landed a nice internship and will be making good money, and want to spend a little bit on a gaming PC.

As far as laptop vs. desktop, I am not sure. A laptop would be a lot easier, and I don't need insane performance. Just want nice graphics, and smooth gameplay. I dont hack, or do anything too extreme, I just like playing.

Any recommendations? Sorry if this is too much/not enough information I am totally new to the idea of building a PC and gaming PC in general. 

Top budget is around $1000, but I don't want to spend that much if I don't have to. I would also potentially use this computer as a home office computer with basic functions like microsoft office, email, chrome, etc. which I assume a computer of any sort is capable of.


Thanks!

I drove out here in my old 04 Acura TL. It had bad transmission problems. I have wanted to live here my entire life. I have so much passion for what I'm working on. Yet I was hesitant to make the move.

I lived with my girlfriend of two years in Atlanta. We had a dog together. She was going to be in Kansas City for the summer working a law internship. She told me I had to take the job, that we had done long distance and would do it again.

I make the move. I'm sad; I've left all my family and friends behind, along with my girlfriend and dog. I am alone out here now, whether or not it's where I want to be.

I had decided I'd be getting a CX-5 this fall. When my girlfriend drove from Kansas City to Denver *just to leave me* out of nowhere last weekend, I sat in my room for days. Didnt sleep. Didnt eat. I finally decided that despite not having the down payment I wanted, I would get my car on Memorial Day. I got the GT AWD in Soul Red Crystal :) [Here is a picture](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/QwP03GH) for anyone interested, taken at Roxborough State Park!

I have already visited two state parks and Rocky Mountain National Park in her. I wouldnt have trusted my TL's transmission to get me through the mountains. This car got me out and exploring and hiking on my first week. I needed the change of pace.

I get excited driving her to the store. I love how quiet she is. She is a beautiful car. I get compliments from coworkers. They ask for me to drive to lunch now. She has given me access to everything Colorado has to offer. I don't know where I'd be this Sunday afternoon if it wasnt for her. 

I am still extremely sad about my girlfriend. She used to tell me how excited she was for me to get this car, and now I cant share it with her. I miss my dog. I miss my family. I am relatively alone out here (for now). But that sadness isn't completely consuming my life anymore, and I have my new car to thank!

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend left me and my CX-5 has given me a new spirit to explore and be happy again."
6f913o,3,2017-06-04,Did I screw up? (long post),jshalpert123,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6f913o/did_i_screw_up_long_post/,"I'm very sorry for the long post.

This was my very first breakup - we both started dating at the age of 18.

I'm 23 and she is 22. We went out for 4 years (since the first year of College). We're both from Toronto, Canada.

We had a mutual break up in September (I had just begun an internship in Seattle at the time). The break up was extremely amicable - we had been having some toxic fights and there were also cultural/religious differences so we decided to end it(she is Christian and I'm a Hindu, her parents were extremely strict and didn't know we were going out). I feel like she was just using religion as an excuse since it wasn't a problem earlier, but the fights were also toxic in my head so I didn't say anything. We promised to stay each other's best friends and that we'd always support each other.

About a week after the break up, I noticed that she was flirting with another guy on Facebook (her account was still logged in on my phone). Instead of feeling angry, I just felt extremely sad and disappointed, that it was so easy for her to start talking to someone else - I still tried my best to remain her friend though.

Side Note: She cheated on me in the summer of 2014 by kissing a guy on two different occasions, but I took her back because she said she regretted her actions and I believed her. Also, I don't believe anything physical was happening between her and the Facebook guy as he was thousands of miles away - I feel like it was just for the attention.

As the days went by, I started making more and more friends in Seattle and they would invite me out to explore the city and have fun. So I slowly started to enjoy myself and grew a little distant from my ex. I'd spend the weekends either sightseeing and hiking or partying it up with the other interns (there was weed and alcohol involved). Every time I was with the other people, I would forget the pain of the break up and be enjoying myself. Whenever I'd be alone in my room, I felt absolutely horrible. Throughout this time, I would still talk to my ex, but not as much.

Then, in November she sent me a message saying how hard it was for her to move on, that she missed having me around and talking to me, and that she could only remember the good times of our relationship - implying that she wanted to get back together. At this point, I said no (the toxic fights still being fresh in my head and her flirting with another guy right away were both primary factors) and reminded her of the reasons we broke up. I told her that I'd always be her friend (I still cared about her a lot) but she had caused me too much pain and I was not mentally ready at the time.

Anyways, as November and December went by, she'd constantly hound me for prioritizing my new Seattle friends over her and say that I was being a ""horrible friend"" to her. She said that I was ignoring her and never initiating conversations with her. I tried explaining to her that it was my first time in Seattle and I was trying to make the most of it, but I still considered her to be a dear friend.

 I felt tremendously guilty for not messaging her like I used to, but I was also really sad on the inside. I was also kind of numb on the inside about her talking and flirting with another guy so soon and the way she raged at me for not being a good friend strongly reminded me of the way we used to fight.

I was back in Canada by Christmas and our final semester of college started in January. At this point we were still friends with each other. During the first few weeks of the semester, she would still get angry when I didn't message her enough. She even drunk texted me and tried to come over, but I lied and said I was out with friends.

Things started becoming slightly more normal in February, she'd initiate texts in a friendly manner (I'd do the same), and whenever we saw each other on campus it would be a positive interaction. There was one weird moment near the end of February, where she asked me to have dinner with her. Then randomly during the middle of dinner, she asked if I was happy - I said that I was working towards it, but not yet. When I reciprocated the question to her, she quickly said that she was and that she was making new friends.

Anyways, near the end of March, I started missing her a lot more than I realized. (there were random days in that month where we had intimate moments- like holding hands or lots of hugging). At the end of March, I asked her to meet with me and told her how much I missed her, and asked her if she'd like to get back together. She then told me that she'd been dating a guy from her church (not the same guy she flirted with) since the end of February - basically around the same time we had that dinner.

When I heard she was dating someone, I became pretty pathetic lol (kinda regret it), I started tearing up and asked her to leave him and come back to me. She hesitated at first, but then started making excuses about religion and how we aren't compatible with each other, etc. She told me she really cares about the other guy and wanted to make it work with him. I respected her wishes and walked away and kept NC for about 3 weeks.

The first 3 weeks of April were absolute HELL, I had to study for final exams while dealing with heartbreak, while she was super happy in the arms of the new guy. On the day before my final exam, and also my final day of college I saw her in the library sitting alone, waiting for her friend. I quickly went up to her and asked her if she had a few minutes to chat. (big mistake)

We then talked for about 30 minutes. Basically ,she told me how happy she was in the new relationship and how her and the new guy ""argue differently"". I told her all the pain I was experiencing during the 3 weeks of NC and that I missed our 4 year friendship a lot. I only realize now, how pathetic this conversation made me look in front of her. I told her I was happy for her and how she found someone from her religion and I knew how important it was for her. She then says ""It's not the most important thing to me..."" (wtf).

Anyways, the conversation ended with me saying that I'd always be there for her but I would be distancing myself for a while and she responded by saying that I could message her anytime. 

Now, the very next day - the last day of my college career (April 24th), she sent me a HUGE text saying we shouldn't talk to each other anymore and we both need to completely move on. The text was really cold and it basically said that even though we had a good ""thing"" (referring to our 4 year relationship lol) there was no point in maintaining a friendship. I am 100% sure the new guy made her write this.

When I received the text message, I was heartbroken. I always thought there was a chance we would reconcile and I never excepted her to move on so fast. I didn't reply to the text message at all and immediately went NC once again.

Then all of a sudden, I received a message from her (after additional weeks of NC):

Her: ""How's it going :)?""

Me: ""Hey, doing well - how you doin?""

Her: ""Okay ""

Her: ""I felt bad about the text :( - sorry  it was a tough spot at the time""

Me: ""Oh thats fine - it's no problem""

Her: ""Okay""

Did I handle the conversation well? I didn't want to seem rude but I feel like she was just trying to clear her guilty conscience. I tried to stay as neutral as possible and not look pathetic like I did the last time we talked in person.

I've gone completely NC but I miss her dearly. I had the chance to take her back in November but blew it. I also try to play the timelines out in my head and ask myself ""When did she actually move on?"". She was messaging me all the way up until January, telling me I was being a shitty friend and not hanging out with her (which isn't true, I valued her as a person but I also was so turned off by her flirting with someone else and her behaviour). And then by February, she had moved on to another guy. All of the interactions I've had since she's been with the new guy have made me feel like garbage. She talks to me like I'm a stranger and replies very coldly.

I feel like the memories of our relationship will always haunt me. She was my first everything.

6f91d5,3,2017-06-04,"I [22/M] am lost and don't what to do with my ""girlfriend"" [22/F] who doesn't know what she wants. Can anyone help?",myloxylotoo,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6f91d5/i_22m_am_lost_and_dont_what_to_do_with_my/,"I originally wrote a 3 page essay describing my situation but deleted it all because it was hard to follow; it was too wordy and lengthy so I’ll sum it up as quickly as possible now-

I've only known this girl for about 2 + months and now I'm leaving for the summer for a summer internship.  I want to keep ""dating"" her but she comes with a lot of ""baggage"" (her words not mine) and she has a lot of issues she's trying to deal with. So couple that with the fact that I'll be leaving for 10 weeks puts me in a weird situation and I don't know how to proceed. 

I’m conflicted on what I should do going forward now. We've only known each other for 2 months but I feel such a connection with her. So to make it easy on you Internet folks, I’m going to make a pros and cons list of her. I know it’ll be hard for you guys to give any advice without really knowing the stories behind all of this, so if you guys want, I can go more into detail about things.

Pros-
She’s beautiful; her smile lights up my life

She’s smart; she graduated from college last year and has an awesome job working with kids

She’s hardworking; she works full time and is pretty much the guardian and protector of her younger siblings. 

She inspires me; her life has been very hard with alcoholic parents and abusive ex-partners but she keeps pushing forward and wants to be better than the people who raised her.

She has an amazing heart underneath the tough exterior she hides behind. 

Cons-

Has cheated on all of her ex partners; she claims that she did it because all of her past partners have been abusive and controlling and she wanted to escape from them.

She’s now afraid of commitment; again, the shitty relationships she’s witnessed in her life have influenced this.

She doesn’t believe in herself; she thinks she’s destined to be a shitty person like her parents forever no matter how many times I tell her she can change

She’s an alcoholic; takes after her father

She doesn’t want to “burden” me with herself; she thinks her wellbeing shouldn’t be any of my concern but I really want to help her because I see so much empathy and good in her but she doesn’t believe me… I want to help her, I want to support her but I feel like I can’t get to her.

She doesn't want me to be tied down when I'm in this new exciting city I'll be living in.  She wants me to see other people.  I know we're not dating officially, and I know she has hung out with this other guy closer to her once or twice in the past few weeks, but I just feel like I can't leave her.

Ah shit, this is getting too long again.  I'm just a rambling, nervous wreck.  Any advice.  I'd love to DM someone and talk more in private... I'm just lost."
6f95ck,2,2017-06-04,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6f95ck/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
6f9cd8,6,2017-06-04,What we're not allowed to notice about terrorist attacks,iuseupyourusernames,accountt1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/accountt1234/comments/6f9cd8/what_were_not_allowed_to_notice_about_terrorist/,"""That it's always Muslims who blow themselves up!"" No, that's not what I was going for. If you complain about Islam you're boring, if you deny there's a problem with Islam, you're an idiot. No, here's what you're not supposed to ask: Why did these three guys in London wear fake suicide vests? It's a statement we make, that the attackers were wearing fake suicide vests, but we don't want to bother investigating why they might wear such vests. The answer isn't hard to figure out: They wore these vests because they wanted police to shoot them on sight rather than arresting them.

When it comes to what causes the attacks, we conclude that the guys were brainwashed by a radical form of Islam. If you're a liberal you pretend that this is a misinterpretation of Islam, if you're a right winger you pretend that this is the natural conclusion of Islam. If you think that an idea can lead people to jump out of a van and start cutting people's throats, you have a deep belief in the power of ideas. What everyone wants to ignore however, is the power of emotions. What causes suicide bombings is the idea of radical Islam, fine. But what causes someone to believe in radical Islam?

Imagine a young Muslim man. Do you have an image in your mind? Great. Keep that image in your mind. Now imagine the young Muslim man, living not in an apartment block somewhere in London, but in a mansion in rural England he bought that once belonged to a cousin of Lord Byron. Our young Muslim man does not have a unibrow and an oversized nose. Rather, he looks like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/92/dc/d3/92dcd374c286623b988f229c8baf760f.jpg). 

Our young Muslim man is not on welfare and he's not working as a car mechanic or a cab driver. Our young Muslim man owns a tourism agency that's marketed at millionaires who want to have a unique experience. He takes them scuba-diving in underwater caves, he hired a submarine to explore sunken ships, he visited the Mt. Everest twice and he once dropped someone off blindfolded in the woods of Northern Russia.

Our young Muslim man also happens to have a lovely wife. He's in his mid-twenties and has three children with her. She takes great care of herself and enjoys going out in the London underground scene with him from time to time, although she also enjoys staying home watching art house movies. In her teenage years she was an anarchist who lived in a squatted house. He also has a mistress at work, a young woman he hired as an intern. In weekends he goes to stand up comedy routines and he occasionally smokes DMT or salvia with his friends to talk to archetypal entities.

I think you get the point. Now ask yourself this: If someone walked up to our young Muslim man and told him his Imam is a Jewish shill who misinterprets the Quran and that he should actually be busy figuring out how to kill as many non-believers as possible, do you think he would be convinced of the argument? I think he would always manage to come up with an excuse. The reason being: He has too much to live for.

What about the young Muslim men who mangle people with trucks, who behead people, who blow up little children in stadiums? They don't have anything to live for. They want to die. The desire to die comes first, Islam is just a means to an end. When the Muslim grows his beard, starts memorizing the garbled nonsense that constitutes the Quran and hangs out with other jihadists, his desire to die is no longer a taboo. 

They don't call it suicide, they'll refer to it as a sacrifice for the cause of Islam, but that just serves to make the emotion itself something that can be discussed and acknowledged. When they're around moderate conservative Muslims, suicide is as taboo as it would be among conservative Christians. You can look online and you will find videos of Muslims who are crying and receive hugs from their friends because they're afraid of the suicide bombing they're about to carry out. The desire to die is a fundamental deep aspect of their identity, but it can not be discussed with anyone, except with other jihadists. They live a lie to the outside world.

If suicide bombings were non-existent before the 1980's but occur daily today, what could be the reason for that? Why is the soil so fertile for this meme to grow? I think the reason is quite similar to the reason white teenage boys have to slaughter people in their school. There are simply far more people today who have no desire to live. The simple truth is hidden in plain sight: People are more likely to commit suicide bombings these days, because people today are far more miserable than they used to be. You should notice the outrage it causes when you state this to people.

You might say that the suicide rates don't reflect that. I think this misses a few things. To start with, there seems to be a growing trend to cover up suicides, they're written down under different names. Second, we have gotten much better at providing aid to people who try to kill themselves. An overdose of medicine that would have meant your death in the past now means a liver transplant. We notice that suicide attempts are rising much more rapidly than completed suicides for this reason.

Third, we manage to brainwash a lot of miserable people. We send them to psychiatrists, we lock them up in mental hospitals or we feed them Prozac and other antidepressants. Fourth, we have reduced suicides by making it more difficult for people to kill themselves. Medicine that makes suicide easy is no longer available, cars don't emit carbon monoxide anymore, high buildings and bridges have fences and nets everywhere. Fifth, although we made it more difficult to commit suicide, we did introduce ways to commit suicide that we will not recognize as suicides. A hanging is an obvious suicide. A heroin overdose not so much. And yet, despite all these measures we have taken, suicide rates have *still* gone up dramatically over the past fifty years or so.

It seems to me that we have reached a critical mass within the population, of people who want to commit suicide but have no easy method to kill themselves. The vast number of miserable people alive against their will has breached a threshold that allows those people to self-organize. A goat-herding Muslim boy who wants to kill himself in Morocco won't easily meet other suicidal people. Population density is too low and people there are simply not miserable enough. A Muslim boy living in an apartment in London however will quite easily meet other miserable people.

The main problem with Islam is not that it makes people blow themselves up. It's that it allows people to blow themselves up while everyone around them will pretend not to notice the real problem. Rather than hearing on the news that a radical Muslim blew himself up, we should be hearing that someone was miserable enough to meet up with a bunch of other miserable people and kill himself and place the blame on some theological thought construct. I'm not saying you should let Islam go scot-free. When you tackle Islam however, you're not capturing the evil villain, you're capturing one of his decoys.

The big problem I see, is that something else goes scot-free right now: The deep seated misery that so many people feel nowadays. When people hear about a terrorist attack on the news, they don't think ""there's someone even more miserable than me"". They think: ""Gee, those Muslims have a really hateful ideology!"" To blame Islam is a limited hang-out. If Islam is the problem, then there's a relatively simple solution. If Islam is the problem, we don't have to take a serious look at how we live our lives.

This ties into another issue, which is that acknowledgement of misery is taboo in our society. When you're feeling sad and you have no socially accepted reason, like physical sickness or death in yourself or a relative, how many people are there you'd feel comfortable saying ""bad"" to when they asked you how you're doing? Not a lot I'd wager. Certainly not most of your coworkers. If we could acknowledge the vast misery around us, it would cause problems. When a suicide bombing was announced on the news, people would think: ""I haven't really enjoyed the past ten years I spent working as a customer service representative either."" Sadness is bad for the economy. Sufficient misery tears a society down.

What I wish to propose here, is that we need a fundamental restructuring of society, because the way we live our lives today makes vast swathes of people deeply unhappy. The kind of restructuring we need is more complex than we think we can accomplish, so what we prefer to do is pretend not to notice it. If your child has protuding ears, you get it fixed. If your kid is simply ugly as hell, you pretend not to notice. That's how we treat our society.

So what do we actually need then? If I'm truly honest, I will tell you that I think we need to get rid of 99.9% of the population, so that we're left with a population of seven million people who live like nomadic hunter-gatherers with an average life expectancy of around thirty years, take hallucinogenic mushrooms in a communal setting and ideally do not comprehend the connection between sex and childbirth. If you want people to be truly happy, that's how you accomplish it. However, I fully acknowledge that even just moving back to a society more akin to the 1950's, when a man with a high school degree could raise a family on a single salary, would lead to a dramatic reduction in misery.

Of course none of that is going to happen. I'd love to tell you how we can get to that stage, but I don't know. If you want to understand how society is most likely going to evolve, ask yourself the following: What's the easiest change that would increase the amount of misery people experience? This allows you to predict the future with near scientific precision. We have an almost supernatural ability to use technology to make ourselves more miserable. As an example, look at [this video](http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/7144855/87cc2ad4/het_mooie_buiten_leven.html). Here we see a couple who were about to get it on, only to be caught red-handed by a pencil-dicked STEM-nerd with a drone. If you want to have sex outside in nature today, be prepared to be immortalized on the internet. In fact, if you simply [ride your bicycle around in circles](http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/7137275/ba817697/man_fietst_alleen_maar_rondjes.html), people will videotape you with their cell phones and immortalize you on the internet.

So, what I want to predict is as following: Everything remotely fun and spontaneous you can think of will be rendered into a self-destructive act that ruins your life. In fact, if you go out and piss against a tree somewhere, fifty years from now potential employers will still find a recording on the Internet and tell you they found a better candidate. Another prediction I want to make is that peak oil and climate change won't kill you or cause the collapse of civilization. That would actually make you less miserable, so it's not going to happen. More likely is that peak oil will make your toys too expensive and climate change will simply ruin every beautiful place on Earth that might remind you of God's presence in our world.

This brings me back to the question of what we're supposed to do about these terrorist attacks. I spend a lot of time thinking about this question, but I have to confess that I honestly don't know the answer. You can deport all the Muslims, but that's like pulling all the gray hairs out of your head when you're growing old. They're a symptom of a deeper problem. I will leave you with the words of Don Colacho: ""Metaphysical problems do not haunt man so that he will solve them, but so that he will live them."""

Just getting back from a vacation with my fiancé. She'll be leaving for an internship in a week or so and I won't be seeing much of her til December. Due to spending a ton of time with her I've gotten very little progress done with Case Files. I do apologize for that but I'll be getting back on the horse rather soon.

I also wanted to update people who were worried about me encountering an onryo. I still have yet to see it for myself but my weird nightmares are still continuing. I've also been fairly ill on a regular basis. I get sick on occasion but I'll admit that it seems to be more common than usual. I'm still not 100% on board with the idea that I'm being haunted by an onryo but I'll be sure to continue avoiding the haunted stream just in case.

On to other news! I've found an editor and Files 1 through 20 will be completed and cleaned up by the end of August! Woo. I'm kinda excited about this. I have no idea what route I'll take for publishing. I may self publish but I might also try to shop for a publisher. I'm going to attempt to pass the Files off as fictional since that's what my family already believes. The idea is to direct everyone who buys the books back to the NoSleep subreddit and get them following this rabbit hole. I'll gladly take opinions on that. I am also adamant that I want both a digital and hardcopy version of the first ""book"" or ""collection"" available. 

I've also been working on some dumb content for my youtube channel. I've been meaning to post a link but I always forget to link to it while at home. This is another one of those cases. The channel is just called Organizing_Secrets and all it has on it right now is my Patreon video that I'll probably be remaking. Still though, I need to remember to link the damn thing. I have no idea what my ultimate intentions are with the channel. There will definitely be horror things on there but I also intend to put stuff related to my other interests that I can never express on Nosleep. That would be things like video games, giant robots, anime, and other junk like that. The content is guranteed to be a mixed bag so feel free to skip out on that if it doesn't suit your tastes.

So thanks for keeping up with me. Drop a line down below.

Stay safe everybody,

I can say I've used this subreddit for a  lot of support pre and post break up for making sense of my partner and situation. I am extremely grateful that something like this exists to assist me in this journey and can't wait for the day that I no longer have to use this thread. I was subjected to both emotional and Physical abuse. I've been managing these phases of grief pretty healthily IMO and letting my mind work through the emotions I had been suppressing for nearly a  year. I have kept myself active with socializing with friends and revisited my passion of running that has really helped my mood. I even picked up an old part time job from my high school years to fill my time a little bit. I haven't visited counselling or support groups because I leave for a 2 month trip abroad in 2 days but I plan to get involved in an abuse support group once I 'm back in the states and particularly address my codependency issues and work to NEVER find myself in this situation again. I have called domestic abuse hotlines for counselling as well as read up on many BPD and abuse victim readings to understand more about what and why I endured as much as I can. (I'm just this type of person. I feel the need to make sense of things and will research and research until I do, which is something I think has helped me escape the cycle of abuse as ""early"" as I did.)  

If you talked to me about three weeks ago, (Or read through my other posts) I was at a total loss and despair after ending this relationship, full of guilt for feeling like I had given up on my broken partner and stripped of all of my self-esteem. Today, I feel like I'm on the verge of new life. A life awashed in truth and in the distant future when I'm ready to search for a new partner, I have more of an idea of how to be (and will continue to learn how to be) respected. I no longer will be that carefree, young 20 year old roaming in ignorant bliss and only seeing the best in all people. Someone that believes that relationships are meant to be in that euphoric honeymoon love bombing phase constantly or someone that  puts the blame on myself for other peoples grievances. I am now a motivated, resilient and inspired 21 year old that appreciates myself and my brain more. Someone who is actively understanding the full idea of people, and someone who doesn't limit my own abilities. Some days are absolutely euphoric compared to the emotional lull I was in just a month ago (especially after running) and on those days I can't even remember the last time I loved myself this much. These days assure me that I am not perpetually broken for the trauma I endured but rather healing more and more everyday. These days are coming more and more often which is promising.

 Other days are harder, when I get consumed with thoughts of our past, false fantasies of how happy we would be if I had never ended the relationship, debating to break our NC and check in (Thank god I've never caved in) and just a feeling of plain missing him. I constantly wonder how he's doing in therapy which he finally decided to get towards the very end of our relationship when his abuse was getting too dangerous (But I still decided i couldn't stick around for his counselling, It was too dangerous for me). I wonder what he tells his therapist what happened between us, If his therapist has caught on that he has BPD (or at least some kind of PD, there is no way this behavior is normally functioning). He leaves for the whole summer himself to work at a church camp and I'm curious if he can keep up his normalcy front for the whole summer with no one to vent to or stay sober from marijuana that he was terribly addicted to. (two days sobriety resulted in a total suicidal break down and keeping me hostage in the woods) These days are usually triggered when I don't have much to do, I am returning home from a trip and know I don't have an SO to come ""home"" to, or someone brings him up and what he's up to in some way. I feel annoyed and mad at myself for being so fragile at things like this but at the same time, this is healing and I can only hope that these bad days and consuming thoughts will fade more and more. I'm writing this and It has already been extremely therapeutic to my bad day and I feel a little more at peace for vomiting out how I've been feeling the last few weeks and with that, Here's some observations I've had so far about life after abuse.

I listen to music more and actually enjoy it. I don't know why I wasn't when I was in my relationship but I assume it has to do with my suppressed emotional state.

I haven't cried in two weeks, This is huge. during my relationship I cried nearly everyday and seemed really sensitive. When I noticed I wasn't crying all the time, I remembered that before this relationship I NEVER cry. I'm not a crier. 

My own self-esteem issues were really inflated when I was in the relationship. I was in the beginning of forming ED habits and showing signs of depression. After, I haven't had issues with my eating at all and have successfully channeled my bad thoughts into healthy habits. 

I believe in myself more. I have more energy. I put myself out there and seem to succeed what I put my mind to. I remembered I am strong willed. And that has gotten me far in my life.

  Talk of suicide is especially really hard for me now. Even in in just dark humor jokes among friends. My ex threatened suicide during every failure in his crisis oriented life and with the fact his older brother killed himself three years ago, the threat seemed ever present and close to home. 

I'm really grateful that despite this traumatic year I've achieved all of my goals for myself. Despite feeling so emotionally drained and stripped of everything. I am entering my senior year of college, I've obtained a really competitive internship I've been working towards since I was 16, I raised enough money to work and travel abroad for two months, I ran a 178 mile relay yesterday, and overall, life is looking promising for me. Thanks to me. 

I hope this post helps anyone that is, about to, or will face the post break up phase with a pwBPD. It's not easy, It's really freaking sad. But it gets better and better and I just become stronger and stronger. I'm a month out and so much has changed for the better. I'm still healing but one day, I think I will be healed and enlightened."

**Random Thoughts**

- Another sign of the times - Meredith’s iPod
- Blushing patient - Yeah, her blushing was bad but the sweating made it even worse.
- Ellis Grey in full effect. I totally would have pulled a Meredith and hid too.
- Richard’s hats, LOL
- One of my favorite moments was when George owned being Thatcher’s lookalike and told Ellis what was what. Her response to him afterwards was just the cherry on top.
- Bailey staying with Cristina solidifies the fact that she is a mama bear and the interns are her cubs.


**Tearjerker Moment**

- Tiny baby in the NICU - just the sight of her made me well up.

**Quotes**

- “Make the lambs stop screaming.”
- “I’m sorry I thought I was your resident not your hostess.”
- “I look like Meredith’s dad?”
- “I am Thatcher Grey and I'm your husband. And uh I know you don't like me very much but ... the fact is I don't always like you very much either. I don't like the way you speak to me. And I really hate the way you speak to Meredith. She deserves better from you.”



**Questions**

- You know when you look at a couple and wonder how in the world they got together. That’s how I look at Richard and Ellis. What do you think made Ellis attractive to Richard?
- Addison and Derek, Derek and Meredith, how do you choose? Both couples have good chemistry."

I'm excited to be done with classes but dreading every other part of leaving college. I currently live in a house with 14 other dudes from my fraternity and I love it. I had thought that I'd be able to find a place to live with some of them after graduation but it didn't happen. My two best friends in the fraternity/house are both moving away, and all the other guys are either moving away or living with people outside the fraternity. I'd been asking around since as early as November if anyone wanted to live together after graduation, but it transcended from ""too early to make plans"" to ""yeah I'm living with friends from my major/hometown/work/etc."". The one guy who had agreed to live with me signed a lease elsewhere and didn't tell me until a week after he signed it. I've asked my other friends not in the fraternity about housing but none of them seem interested in living with me for various reasons. Feels incredibly shitty; am I really that unlikeable that nobody wants to live with me? I don't move out of my current house until September, but at this point I'm probably going to have to find a random place off Craigslist and just live by myself or with random roommates. Both of which sounds incredibly fucking lonely.

Additionally, I haven't found a job for after graduation yet. I admittedly haven't been looking as hard as I should be, but it's stressful as fuck looking through listings. All the entry level jobs want experience I don't have. I have an internship and a few random jobs under my belt but nothing that's setting me apart from every other candidate applying for the entry level jobs.

I feel like I'm going to be absolutely miserable come September and I don't know what to do about it. It's making me miserable. For the past week I've been sleeping in until 2 or 3pm and barely do anything during the day, just browse reddit, study a bit, hang out with people in my house for a bit, and that's it. I'm incredibly afraid that six months from now my entire life is going to be working 40-50 hours a week at a shitty job I hate and come back at night to my shitty, empty, one bedroom apartment. And despite that this anxiety is making it hard for me to get out of bed in the morning, hard for me to do anything during the day, I don't know what to do about it."

Barbara the Wise was a Dark Staffer of the Commerce Department. She was so powerful and so Wise, she could influence the other staffers to create..... classified files. She had such a knowledge of the dark secrets of the Clinton Family, she could even save the files she loved from being deleted. The Dark side of the Commerce Department is the pathway to many files, some, consider to be..... classified. She was so powerful, the only thing she ever feared or was afraid of was, losing her files. Which eventually of course, she did. She told the Chair everything she knew, and the chair stripped her naked and killed her after violently bruising her. Ironic, isn't it? She could save so many from deletion, but not herself.

While being explained my benefits I learned the company will match half up until the first 6%. 

Being a regular on this sub, and generally wanting a good retirement for myself, I figured I should definitely deposit the max for the match. However, I am only vested after 3 years. So basically, if I don't work at the company for 3 years I don't get the match. 

This is a great company that I am definitely interested in working for for a long while. However, I'm not sure if I would get hired back, I find a better position etc. 

My question is, should I bother contributing the 6% of my paycheck even if I don't get the match. Or would it be wiser since I'm young to just keep the 6% and spend it on more pertinent things. 

Thanks to everyone for the advice !!"

About a month ago I moved back home to Atlanta for a job opportunity I couldn't pass up, but soon realized none of my friends back home would be in town. It's been a month since being back, and I'm extremely lonely. I'm living with my brother and his girlfriend in the city, but don't have anybody outside of them. It's really starting to get to me, and I would love some company! Here's a little about me: I work at a hospital in downtown Atlanta, I'm a senior in college studying human performance and exercise science, I'm an intern with the university working as the manager of a disabled sports team, I have a German Shepherd puppy, I enjoy video games and I watch too much TV, including Game of Thrones, The Office, Rick and Morty, House of Cards, Arrested Development, The Man in the High Castle, Parks and Rec, Fargo, Westworld, Black Mirror, and so much more. I'm also a huge scary movie fanatic, even though I'll admit most of the recent ones are pretty terrible. I'm really looking for a friend, a good friend who I can talk to and who I can laugh with. We don't have to open up to each other if you're not comfortable with that, it's okay, we can keep it light and fun. I really just miss the company. If you're also looking for someone to talk to, or even if you just have a stupid story you never had the opportunity to tell or a joke you know that you never get to tell, send me a PM.

6fba8g,3,2017-06-04,[Question] Am I wrong to think I should do a gap year?,LatteLift,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/6fba8g/question_am_i_wrong_to_think_i_should_do_a_gap/,"I’m a highschool senior, got accepted into Rutgers New Brunswick Honors program for Computer Science, want to get a second major in Business. For the past few months I been thinking about doing a gap year and told my mom about it but she keeps telling me I should keep going. I could see why she would say that if I were a regular student with little willpower but I’m not like that. 


I’m the valedictorian of my grade, completed an internship at a trading firm this senior year, took my first AP course Sophomore year. Been in my school’s academy and had to go an hour earlier than the rest of the school for morning classes. I've been learning how to code (Java, JavaScript/TypeScript) and be a better programmer. 


Since the end of last summer, I have been on a nonstop journey on becoming the best version of myself. I quit TV, anime, video games, fiction literature, never done any drugs and have no desire to ever. I completely cleaned up my diet and been going to the gym, I lost 30 pounds and started to build lean muscle since this last summer. I cleaned up my chronic cystic acne after dedicating hours to learning about nutrition, anatomy, psychology when the dermatologist told me my only cure was Accutane. I see my artwork improve everyday as I dedicate time to practice and learn theories, applying it in Photoshop or Blender. I had friends call me a computer because of my unreal work ethic and focus. I’m willing to make sacrifices to reach my goals and to work hard.


I want to dedicate the gap year to set up my life to what I want. Highschool really stopped me because of how I had to work around it. It really hurt me because of the chronic sleep deprivation it forces on you due to ineffective management (having to wake up earlier at 5:40 am for the extra morning class when it isn’t even necessary when later on in the day I have two study hall periods and 2 electives). During the gap year, I want to move out as soon as I can, support myself with a humble job (like at Starbucks, I would love the social setting and being able to enjoy preparing nice smelling coffee) while supplementing the rest of the time to program and develop apps. I would spent time making web games and publish them, make passive income. I would focus on things I love, improve my cooking skills, build my art portfolio, do freelance work. I would get my driver license, buy a nice car, reach my fitness goal of 12% body fat. I would focus on building a relationship, get a girlfriend, experience intimacy for the first time. 


I want to prove myself, that I have the skills to so much already without college. I tired of all the inefficiencies that come with school, the debt I would get because of the student loans. I don't want to have to live with roommates who would probably spend their days partying or playing games. I'm tired of having to beg for financial aid, I want to work to support myself! But I can't do that if I have to yet again center my entire life around school, and continue on missing out on what really is important in life.


I can see why my mom would think I should keep going. We're immigrants from Colombia, she been working as a housemaid for all these years while my dad as a delivery person. To them, the best path is the safest path and don't really see the advantages going their your own way. I feel confident that I can do anything I set myself out to do, but when the closest person in your life doesn't seem to acknowledge all the work you put in, seeing you come home and pushing yourself to understand WebGL shaders at home, building your own PC, reading books like The 48 Laws of Power, letting go of your old timid, social anxious self and becoming a social butterfly, seeing what your truly are and will be capable of, it really does instill some self-doubt.

Weekly plan::: I'll take this day by day. I applied for a class that is offered through my college this summer for some kind of consulting company. This may lead to an internship. I also have some construction work to do for a family member that is in the business. 

Weekly goals:: 
-make it through without fapping, I really can't afford not to reboot at this point 
-show up to class on time, even early maybe and ready to kill it
-work construction on days I do not have class 
-workout, this will be easy since I love lifting and it offers me an escape from this hell I call life. 
-just make it through to day 7 and establish further goals for yourself
-try forgiving and forgetting your PMO addiction
-maybe give church a try??"
6fbxis,2,2017-06-05,What can one do to stop making excuses and pursue happiness?,GirlsLoveEggrolls,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/6fbxis/what_can_one_do_to_stop_making_excuses_and_pursue/,"My sister is in a depressing situation right now. She got 2 degrees from college, decent grades, and internship experience.
Her resume coming out of college was pretty damn good.
Right now, she works at a minimum wage job which she hates. She's been having a very hard time finding a job she wants - which I believe is due to factors like poor interviewing and personal issues that translate into poor communication/body language.


In any case, I've been trying to get her to keep applying to jobs but she has stopped. She keeps coming up with excuses to not pursue her dreams. She even admitted being conscious of this... so I think there is actually an issue psychologically - like she has associated this depressing lifestyle with comfort and her mind is too afraid to exit her 'safe-space'.
I've connected all the dots for her - locations/people/career/finance - all the things she wants in her life into one simple path (she did all the research into this stuff, I just connected them together). She has everything she needs right now to do it today if she wanted to. She won't though, and she might not do it for 4-5 more years. I don't know what the fuck to do.


I've addressed all the issues that she has come up with, from poor self-esteem and interview tactics to fallacious/illogical reasoning. I've tried to suggest finding ways to fix these things would help her improve. I've given my own examples and how I got out of them. I can only show her the path, I can't do things for her. She has acknowledged all of her shortcomings and knows that being happy eradicates 99% of them... or at least has told me so. I don't know if she truly understands that though.
 

How do I get her to stop making excuses and pursue happiness?  
I'm trying to make her WANT happiness more than her 'safe-zone', but it's not working."
6fbxla,15,2017-06-05,Eating At The Same Restaurant,uiucuwm,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/6fbxla/eating_at_the_same_restaurant/,"This past week, I started my internship and my mind has been off my past relationship for the most part. I was out at the gym a lot and hung out with family and friends often. I have been no contact for a little over a month.

The first time I encountered my ex, I was shook and didn't know how to feel after seeing her, definitely sad though, knowing that she was going out with the guy she cheated on me with.

Earlier this afternoon, I was out grabbing food with friends. We decided on this particular restaurant beforehand. Right before entering, I saw them through the window. I was hesitant in going in because this was the first time I've seen the two together (but I did hear a lot of accurate suspicions from friends since the break up on how they were seeing each other).

I thought to myself, I did nothing wrong to disrespect them and I had no shame in showing face. If anything, they  should be the ones who should be surprised to see me! 

I entered the restaurant and the guy attempted to say hi to me in a friendly tone. Oh yeah, keep in mind, this guy was one of my classmates and he knew that I was in a relationship with my ex at the time too.

They tried to acknowledge me, but I didn't even look in their direction. I turned the other way and walked to our table. I have to admit, it was sort of uncomfortable sitting there knowing that they were literally right there.

At this point, my mind was everywhere, but on the outside I was more calm than the first encounter. A small part of me was angry and wanted to punch the guy, but I knew better. And the other part kept reminding myself that my ex and her new boyfriend are cheaters, disrespectful people, and liars. 

I'm glad I handled this encounter better than the first. I'm not fully healed. I still ponder about the past and get reminded of happy times, but it's getting better. It sucks knowing that she's creating new memories with someone else so quickly, but I know deep down...I'll be better off focusing on myself and on more important aspects of my life and not rushing things.

Thanks for listening! :)"
6fclt3,0,2017-06-05,Should I pussy out of the double degree,GucciLifestyle,wlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wlu/comments/6fclt3/should_i_pussy_out_of_the_double_degree/,"Hoping some upper year double degrees, or just BBA students could weigh in on switching out of my program, and what it entails for co-op prospects. Basically, I’m looking at course requirements for the next two years, and realizing I may be fucked. 
I’m currently in the BBA/BSc Comp Sci double degree, and I’ve just finished my first year. I managed to end off the year with an 11.0 GPA, which is high enough to keep my $5k a year presidents gold scholarship. But my business/econ marks (11.5) are pulling up my CS/math (10.5), and I definitely put more hours into CS. This next year I’ll have 8 CS/math to only 2 business courses, and I’ll also be playing on the varsity rugby team, and being a don. Basically,  I’m worried about losing my scholarship and the effects a lower GPA might have on coop prospects.

So my question to upper years is, who is likely to get better co-ops, business single degree with ~11+ GPA, or double degree with ~9 GPA. And is there significant difference in job prospects leaving university, because I’d likely be taking a $15,000 hit if I stayed in the double degree (assuming I lose my scholarship). I’m not worried about the guaranteed coop vs. application process, I have enough on my resume that I should be solid. (Won new venture, play on a varsity team, currently working a paid internship in Australia)

TL;DR: How badly will I die in second year double degree if I stick it out?

6feazl,7,2017-06-05,"Me [27F] with my boyfriend [29M] of almost 3 years, he doesn't know if he wants to get marries",subrolit17,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6feazl/me_27f_with_my_boyfriend_29m_of_almost_3_years_he/,"TLDR: My boyfriend of 3 years suddenly drops the bomb that he's not sure about marriage with me.

Me and my boyfriend Harry have been together almost 3 years, living together for over 2. Currently we are long distance (2-3 hours by train) for the summer while he interns in my home town. Since it is pretty close and my friends and family live there, I visit him every weekend.

The issue: recently I've been feeling that Harry has been pulling away from me but for the most part I've blamed this on long distance. This came to a head this weekend when I told him I felt like he wasn't pulling his weight in our relationship. This is when he confessed to me that he was totally unsure about the relationship going forward into marriage. Reddit, I felt totally blind sided. Honestly, our relationship this year has been really great and Harry even admitted himself that our relationship is overwhelmingly positive. However, he still just feels unsure about us.

At the time, I told him that this decision doesn't have to be made now but he at least needs to put some effort into the relationship otherwise this doesn't have any chance. Now I'm going back and forth with thinking if I should give it time or just break up. Honestly, I'm already heartbroken over this and at least I would have some semblance of control over the situation if I was the one to leave. I feel worried about wasting my time but I also would be devastated to lose him and our life together. Any advice right now would be appreciated.

I emailed them back accepting the interview and suggesting times for us to meet (as they asked me to do in their initial email). As of today, 6/5, I have not heard back from them. 

In the initial email, they requested I reply to them ""ASAP,"" which I did - as soon as I received the email, about 2 hours after they had sent it. I find it odd that I haven't heard from them. The date that they wanted to interview me was this Friday, 6/9. Should I go ahead and send another email, or perhaps even call them? I don't want to come off as pushy, but also, I find it odd that they would urge me to reply as quickly as possible and then drag their feet in responding to me.

6ffr9t,3,2017-06-05,Just finished W1D1 - and nerves galore!,p1nk_p4nth3r,C25K,https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/6ffr9t/just_finished_w1d1_and_nerves_galore/,"Sorry in advance of a bit of a long post - I'm just hoping for some support! 

I've been lurking here for a few weeks, been considering this program for a month or two. My Facebook is slowly filling with people getting through this program, and I had a friend mention that the only way they can lose weight is by incorporating running into their diet.

I'm a PhD student with a summer internship, and my internship lets me work out for 3 hours a week. So I do 1 hour 3 times a week, which is great for this - 30 min workout, and 30 mins to get ready/clean/stretch. I've often tried working out, but I never keep it up once the school year is fully in force.

I'm too scared to post on social media as I'm tired of posting ""hey look i'm trying to work out!"" ""hah i failed"". So I'm hoping to make actual progress before doing that this time.

Today was an interesting day - i barely remembered to pack my gym clothes, forgot a towel, forgot my socks, forgot my deoderant in the car... so it was an interesting work out. I only did the treadmill as I overheat very easy outside, and I'm in TX. 

I struggled more than I expected today, I'm kinda worried I won't be able to do W2 next week and will have to do a repeat of W1. I feel this is pretty shameful, but running has always been my weak point.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Just had to get it off my chest!

tl;dr: just starting, extremely out of shape PhD student, and nervous! wish me luck!

6fg02l,3,2017-06-05,The Night Drummer,ahilgen,AHilgenWrites,https://www.reddit.com/r/AHilgenWrites/comments/6fg02l/the_night_drummer/,"When you lie down to sleep, head resting gently on the cool pillow, do you ever listen to the gentle *thrum thrum thrum* in your ear or do you ignore it? As a child I would get startled by it, swearing that it was growing louder and more insistent. A powerful giant lumbering closer and closer but yet unseen. Only when I lifted my head from the pillow to seek out the danger would it disappear, its cover blown, and retreat until another night when maybe it could catch me unawares. 

Age and common sense pushed such silly thoughts away. It is, after all, only our own heartbeats that we are hearing. The panic of something unknown coming to get us sets our heart going which only heightens the fear. Silliness. But what if I told you it wasn’t *just* our heartbeat? What if I told you that there is something you could learn from that dull, rhythmic thump?

When I was nine I fell out of a tree while trying to race a friend to the top. My right leg took the brunt of the force from the fall and shattered in three places. I was in a cast for months and although it healed completely I have had issues with it ever since. It is my early warning system for bad weather, the reason I have to go an extra twenty minutes to the airport for security, and why I need to stretch each morning and each evening to prevent lock-ups. Even though it is healed it will get really stiff if I don’t stretch it out really well, especially when it is cold or if I have been working hard.

It was during that long, slow recovery time that I overcame my fear of the heartbeat. With a lot of time spent in bed reading and watching television I would hear that thumping often. Eventually I learned that I could control it, making it speed up by taking short quick breathes or slow down with long and steady deep breathes. 

Over the years such things fade away and we forget all about them. They become routine, mundane, and we no longer pay them any mind. A decade after my broken leg I was a freshman at university and doing what freshman do best – party. On this particular occasion I was befriending a bottle of McCormick 360 and attempting to woo a lovely young thing by the name of Becca. The wooing was unsuccessful but the alcohol poisoning was not. I had to be rushed to the hospital where I was pumped, attached to an IV, and eventually released after a long night of sleep. 

During my stay there as I lay on an uncomfortable bed I closed my eyes and listened to my heartbeat. It was different. I know it was different because I had listened to it for months, memorizing the patterns, the stutters and lurches, the muffled wet *thrum thrum thrum* that made my ear itch if I listened too closely. It sounded weaker now, less distinct. I chalked it up to the weakened state that I was in and pushed it out of my mind.

I wish I had learned my lesson from that night. I wish I had eased back, taken it slow, been responsible. The next few years of my life were a whirlwind of drinking and finals. How I made it through I will never know, let alone manage decent grades or a decent internship. Connections certainly helped. The old “it isn’t what you know but who you know” is pretty damned accurate. From that internship I built a solid career in advertising – using my skills from college to drink my clients into contracts. It was fun, we had a blast. But then I needed a liver transplant at the old age of 33. 

Again, I was lucky. A family member died and donated their liver to me – not that I deserved it. I should have been thrown to the back of the list and left to rot out my final days with a bottle of Sambuca. Again I had time to lay and ponder my heartbeat, and again it sounded different. Weaker, softer, skipping a beat even though I could feel my chest thump where the beat should have been. It freaked me out, set me sober. I cleaned up my act, changed professions, and swore off alcohol. I was clean and I was happy. I found a lovely woman who somehow tolerates my harsh laugh and soft belly. 

Life has been good since then. Almost two decades of sobriety and happiness. Our daughter turns nine years old tomorrow so of course I banned her from climbing any trees. But that isn’t why I am writing this to you. I am writing because this morning I woke up with a stiffer than usual leg. I lay in bed massaging it out to get ready for the day when I realized I couldn’t hear my heartbeat. I pressed my head deeper into my pillow, turning my head one way and the next with no reward. I can feel it thumping rapidly in my chest. I can feel it speed up and slow down with my breathing. When I place my hands on my chest I can feel the steady rhythm against my palms. 

Maybe we don’t hear our heartbeats like we think we do. Maybe we are hearing something else. Maybe I am the only one or maybe it is all of us. What I do know is that it slowed with each major injury in my life but only *after* it had happened….

I was in a cast for months and although it healed completely I have had issues with it ever since. It is my early warning system for bad weather, the reason I have to go an extra twenty minutes to the airport for security, and why I need to stretch each morning and each evening to prevent lock-ups. Even though it is healed it will get really stiff if I don’t stretch it out really well, especially when it is cold or if I have been working hard.

It was during that long, slow recovery time that I overcame my fear of the heartbeat. With a lot of time spent in bed reading and watching television I would hear that thumping often. Eventually I learned that I could control it, making it speed up by taking short quick breathes or slow down with long and steady deep breathes. 

Over the years such things fade away and we forget all about them. They become routine, mundane, and we no longer pay them any mind. A decade after my broken leg I was a freshman at university and doing what freshman do best – party. On this particular occasion I was befriending a bottle of McCormick 360 and attempting to woo a lovely young thing by the name of Becca. The wooing was unsuccessful but the alcohol poisoning was not. I had to be rushed to the hospital where I was pumped, attached to an IV, and eventually released after a long night of sleep. 

During my stay there as I lay on an uncomfortable bed I closed my eyes and listened to my heartbeat. It was different. I know it was different because I had listened to it for months, memorizing the patterns, the stutters and lurches, the muffled wet *thrum thrum thrum* that made my ear itch if I listened too closely. It sounded weaker now, less distinct. I chalked it up to the weakened state that I was in and pushed it out of my mind.

I wish I had learned my lesson from that night. I wish I had eased back, taken it slow, been responsible. The next few years of my life were a whirlwind of drinking and finals. How I made it through I will never know, let alone manage decent grades or a decent internship. Connections certainly helped. The old “it isn’t what you know but who you know” is pretty damned accurate. From that internship I built a solid career in advertising – using my skills from college to drink my clients into contracts. It was fun, we had a blast. But then I needed a liver transplant at the old age of 33. 

Again, I was lucky. A family member died and donated their liver to me – not that I deserved it. I should have been thrown to the back of the list and left to rot out my final days with a bottle of Sambuca. Again I had time to lay and ponder my heartbeat, and again it sounded different. Weaker, softer, skipping a beat even though I could feel my chest thump where the beat should have been. It freaked me out, set me sober. I cleaned up my act, changed professions, and swore off alcohol. I was clean and I was happy. I found a lovely woman who somehow tolerates my harsh laugh and soft belly. 

Life has been good since then. Almost two decades of sobriety and happiness. Our daughter turns nine years old tomorrow so of course I banned her from climbing any trees. But that isn’t why I am writing this to you. I am writing because this morning I woke up with a stiffer than usual leg. I lay in bed massaging it out to get ready for the day when I realized I couldn’t hear my heartbeat. I pressed my head deeper into my pillow, turning my head one way and the next with no reward. I can feel it thumping rapidly in my chest. I can feel it speed up and slow down with my breathing. When I place my hands on my chest I can feel the steady rhythm against my palms. 

Maybe we don’t hear our heartbeats like we think we do. Maybe we are hearing something else. Maybe I am the only one or maybe it is all of us. What I do know is that it slowed with each major injury in my life but only *after* it had happened….

I've always been avoidant of searching for work because I'm scared, I'm scared of screwing up on interviews and I look at my resume and think I have nothing good enough for anyone to want to hire me. 

All I've ever done is perform well at school, I barely joined clubs and did extracurricular stuff and before I know it, two years of university have passed already. I have no internships or work placements or whatever, only good grades that might as well mean nothing for me right now, cause I know everyone wants real life experience, yet that's what I've been avoiding out of fear. I know I have to look for jobs, I know my friends have already done it, I'm proud of them for sure, but I also hate myself for being so useless in comparison. 

You keep telling me to do it, but I haven't the vaguest idea /how/ to do it right so I keep avoiding it. I used my depression as an excuse last year but this year you're taking none of it. I'm not really much better, but I know I have to try harder or else my future is fucked. You refused to let me take the prescribed medication because you didn't want me to grow dependent on it, but I haven't tried much myself either to get better, it's like I've accepted my fate that I'm always going to be like this. I appreciate you leaving me alone, but at times I also wished you cared a bit more and didn't treat me as if I wasn't ever sick in the first place. 

In short, I've avoided opportunities because I have no confidence in myself and no experience, now I'm 19 years old and worried everything's too late for me. I'm ashamed of myself, but I still somehow with you'd give me some guidance on how to do things, instead of just throwing it at me and telling me to do it. Mom, how do I get over myself and how do I get a job like this? I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.

6fhcrc,17,2017-06-05,"fucked up extremely, advice and positive thoughts welcome",MariaCaterina,proED,https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/6fhcrc/fucked_up_extremely_advice_and_positive_thoughts/,"Prepare yourself for some of the stupidest and pettiest shit you will see all week...

I can't even fucking believe myself. I'm such a freaking failure. I finally blew up, in a big way, at SP (my brother). I was pissed because he had finished the OJ and left the carton out on the counter. Little prick couldn't even be bothered to recycle it. (I KNOW that this was an objectively stupid thing to get pissy about, but our relationship has been EXTREMELY strained for WEEKS, and I am not thinking clearly atm, hence the extreme irritability).

I slammed a drawer while I was picking up his shit and he came in to sneer at me. I did not want to talk to him. I did not intend to talk to him. 

I've been in a funk since Saturday night. I felt majorly hurt because I was planning to watch a movie with my mom, but SP came down and started cooking, making a can of tomato soup for himself which I had bought for the family. We started bickering. Have you ever been so mad/frustrated that you wanted to pull out your own hair? Well, I slapped myself several times in the face. Hard. 

Nobody said anything. Nobody even noticed. I went upstairs, leaving Mom and SP to queue the movie, figuring she would call me down when he was gone and she got it working. Nope, they watched a different movie without me. Ow. 

Reading this, I know how fucking pathetic I am. Blubbering like a sad whale and skulking while they were enjoying themselves. No wonder nobody wants you around, no wonder nobody cares, you fucking buzzkill.

I was so steamed that Sunday I didn't leave my room at all. I don't think mom even realized that I was upset about something. She probably just figured I was being a fucking overgrown teenager.
 
I binged and purged and cleaned all through the night and into the morning. Today, when I woke up around 3pm, was when Sean started picking a fight with me. He said, ""No one wants you here, I don't want you here, C [my baby sister] doesn't want you here. Don't you have any friends to live with?"" 

Fuck you. He probably thinks it's abnormal because our older brother V has been renting an apt with his friends for the last two years--but when he had to take a break from school for a year, guess where he lived? Yeah, at home. It's not uncommon for students to live at their parents' houses through the summer. K, R, and L [my friends] are all doing the same thing. But I do feel like a failure. I feel like a waste. When I went to the ___ Library (where I worked all through HS) to get some books, [the children's librarian] actually said, ""Oh, so you're not doing anything? Just working?"" 

Um. 

It made me feel like trash, like everyone else has internships and career-training, and I'm just a slug. I KNOW THIS IS OBJECTIVELY NOT TRUE, I know MANY students who aren't doing anything besides working a minimum-wage position and saving. Why are we (or just me) made to feel like lazy, sleazy, bags of trash?

Anyway, I snapped. I haven't been on my Prozac in quite a while--I always forget how scary it is when you finally crash--and I seem to be increasingly emotionally fragile, irritable, and unstable. Frankly, I've been trying to conserve my suppy because I have no intentions of going back into treatment, in part because I'm an adult who's ashamed to still be dealing with this shit, and in part because I'm frightened of how the American health care system will be changing in the newt few months/years. 

After he said that shit to me, I yelled, ""What if I killed myself? What if I went upstairs and killed myself right now?""

He responded, ""Do it,"" (!!) and then scolded, ""You shouldn't joke about suicide, especially not in this family."" Which, excuse me? What the actual FUCK? You really think you're more sensitive to the history of this family than I am? You really think you need to remind me? You really think I wouldn't say that if I wasn't being pushed past the edge of bearable?

I fucking turned around and left. 

That cunt called our mom to tattle. I guess that was his due diligence: Hey, I told her nobody wanted her here, and she seemed distraught, but I'm telling you so I am absolved of responsibility if she actually does kill herself, right?

My mom called me and frostily informed me that if I went around ""threatening to kill myself"" she would have me committed. 

I should clarify that I actually don't want to die, I was just:

 (1) not thinking clearly because of chemical imbalances, 
(2) sensitive to that particular line of attack, and 
(3) stunned that he would say something so objectively evil. He's said shit along those lines before, but I've never been vulnerable to it before. 

I hate myself so much for this. I don't WANT to have attention on my mental state, I don't WANT to cause stress for my mother. Hell, I don't want to be arguing with a sixteen year old kid. I am twenty years old, not twelve. I don't want him to have the power to wound me, either. I want to be calm, and steely, and above it. I wanted to be untouchable, and instead I feel like an exposed nerve: red and scraped raw, unstable, screaming.

This will have repercussions. My mom texted me, saying she wants me to go back to therapy. That is something I cannot agree to.

I know I sound like a broken record, but I literally do not have the words to express how disappointed and angry I am with myself. I'm supposed to be grown. My mom shouldn't have to worry about holding my shit together at this age. I shouldn't be making her. Why can I not just be self-sufficient? Why can I not control my emotions? 

I told my mom about the Prozac. Hopefully I can convince her this was a result of withdrawal, or whatever the fuck you would call it. In addition to all the shit that I discussed above, I am really frustrated by my inability to hold it together because while I haven't been actively pursuing recovery for a couple of years now, this is the first time that I've been actively pursing my eating disorder ""weight loss"" SINCE entering residential treatment in 2011, and I just recently got back down to the all-time low I had before they sent me there. The fact that everything is slipping out of my control really reminds me of that time, and it;s starting to feel like I can only get to xxx lbs before I start losing my fucking mind.

I am determined not to let that be the case. I will be calm, I will be ambitious, and I WILL BE THINNER. 

Only upside of this fucking disgrace was that C was out of the house and not around to hear the shit that came out of my mouth. As a kid, my parents, particularly my mom, were not the most stable of people, emotionally speaking (since divorcing my dad, she has improved by miles). I know first hand how destructive it is when the people who are supposed to be caring for you cannot care for themselves. Thank God she was not around to see me fuck up like that. I think I might actually rather be dead than feel like I caused her that distress. 

I meant to be fasting as atonement for being so selfish last night with my binging and purging, but I can't right now. I sat down to journal and had: two pieces of toast, one with peanut butter, cinnamon, and salt for electrolytes, and one with raspberry preserves, a banana, an apple, and yogurt along with a litre of water laced with some fiber powder. Now I am going to take my Prozac and try and meditate or something. I feel calm now, but just--low. Dirt-low.

I was considering transferring into the CSSE program.

I'm 20 years old, asian female (if that matters to admissions), and at first out of highschool I did 1 quarter at a WWU to do a, then left due to them blocking admissions to the major. Now in the past 1.5 years I took classes to be a registered nurse and worked as a nursing assistant but due to injuries sustained on the job and the experience of being a nursing assistant in general made me reevaluate my goal..

I have a 3.99 GPA. I did running start (community college during high school) and earned an associates degree with a DTA, meaning the credits directly transfer to Washington State universities. The only issue is that I have 3 college transcripts, which includes my running start college transcript. Will I look to fickle to universities and would they possibly reject me?

Also, the only course relevant for prerequisites to apply for the CompSci majors I have taken is Calc I, which I received a 3.8 in. I may need to take anywhere ranging 4 more courses (Calc II, two programming courses, and Advanced English composition) before applying.

I was looking at UW Bothell's Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) degree. Is anyone aware of how competitive the programs are for admissions (such as the admit rate) and advice on how to make myself a good applicant (by extracurriculars, activties, internships, jobs, volunteer etc)?

TLDR: I am an asian female student with 3.99 GPA, have 3 college transcripts, one is from high school that has an associates degree with a direct transfer agreement, one from 1 quarter at WWU, and I would be applying as a transfer student. Will I look fickle to UW Bothell because of this? Also, does anyone have any advice on how competitive UW Bothell's CSSE program is, if its worth it for me to apply, and how to be a competitive applicant (such as extracurriculars, activites, jobs, personal projects)?"

However, on the transfer worksheet online it lists classes needed for an AST-2 degree, however I already have a AA with a DTA, so I feel this is a waste of time.

Today I'm bringing to you a couple ideas for a fun prompt in which one of the following girls is fucked! After the list of prompt ideas is a list of girls I'm fine with playing.

For clarification, I'm also open to playing with other girls in an [F4F] scenario or even trans/traps in a [F4T] scenario. I could even be convinced into a [T4M] scenario if it's good enough.

**Prompts:**

1. *The Gym Leader's Reward:*
After winning against me in a Pokemon battle, you recieved your Gym Badge and the proof you defeated me. However, you were a little surprised when I invited you into my private back room for a little more of a prize....

2. *Crime Always Pays:*
As a young Pokemon Trainer, I've done my best to stop you and your criminal organization (whether it's Team Rocket, Team Galactic, or any other one) from upsetting the balance of the world. But I didn't expect to be defeated when I challenged some grunts at your HQ, and I didn't expect them to use mr against my will...

3. *Double Battle Royal:*
After a year of harsh training and a rigorous application process, you finally made it into the Battle Royal Club; a prestigious trainer's club in a fancy Villa beside a beach. Here, Trainers can fight each other in large Double Battles set to an arena near the water. The club also has plenty of rooms for the inevitable ""relaxation"" that comes after every battle for the four trainers involved...

4. *The Champion's Trophy:*
As new reigning Champion of a region of your choice, you now have the right to any one girl in the entire region. Which also means that you're expected to plant your ""Champion's Seed"" inside her as well. The catch? It's got to be on Video, and you're going to have to release it to the public as an official film of the Pokemon Champion. So make it a good tape!

5. *The Professor's Assistant:*
As an intern working with one of the most established Pokemon Professors, you've grown quite a crush on her, even if she is a bit older than you. However, don't think she hasn't noticed. Because she has. And being as lonely as she is, she has no issues with seducing you and introducing you to her interesting kinks...

before you start reading, listen to this for 20 seconds you will get the idea,
 or listen to all of it, I love it :) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOnKCcjP8Qs

         Ever heard of the song “Sweating Bullets”-  by MegaDeth? (link at the bottom).
 Basically, about fighting a war with yourself, we all live inside our heads, it's a 
war sometimes. I woke up, went to work still fogged up from my last binge and was 
having an Okay day at work, all I could think about was how awesome of a job I’ve been 
doing at life.  The truth is I was talking myself up because I wanted to give myself a reason 
to go home and drink my leftover beers, I only had 8 so I knew I’d have to get more when I 
get off work.

      	 ""Rob, you need to stop drinking, you’re fat and need to lose weight, 
you’ve lost some things in your life because of this problem.  

	“Hello me, meet the real me,” what are you talking about guy, 
you’re losing weight.. you haven’t even eaten anything in the last 24 
hours and you have walked 8 miles sweating your ass off today at work."" 	

	""Wow, you’re right, plus I just landed this job... Life is great! I can have a 
couple,but let's get some hard stuff too because, well, calories.. duh."" 

	""Fuck yea I’m right, drink up, you’re awesome, you deserve to treat yourself.""
 (insert Mr. Burns meme)&lt;My head every day, around the clock&gt;

	Before I left work I had to have a class, just some extra HR stuff for work, 
it's because I recently went from intern to employee pretty quickly, I sat in a room
 fool of people that are about to start off just like I did. I saw how many people sat in
 that room, it was a big room full of young, energetic people ready to fight for a chance
 to start a career at Micron.  Reminded me of my first day as an Intern, but I was hungover
that day... like most. Mr. Orange, the person that brought me on as an intern, was so happy
 to see me and congratulated me. 

	“Good morning class, my name is Mr. Orange and welcome to Micron.
 Before we get started I would like to say congrats to all you happy looking interns,
 very many apply and only so many can get in. Oh! Before we get started, I almost
 forgot, not everyone in front of me is an intern. We have two people that were interns,
 but today they sign the offer we gave them. They started 6 months ago in a 1-year 
internship, they didn’t come to hang out and get a participation trophy, they came to fight 
and win. Meet Robert B. and Mr. White, they earned it and if you want some tips, I’d ask them.” 

	Everyone clapped like it was some type of a big deal, not to me. I just did my
 job and put in some effort. No big deal. I paused, thought about it and gave myself
 a real pat on the back, for a moment I felt true happiness, like the sun shining in
 through a cold dark, and cloudy day. It's not the gratitude that I was searching for,
 it wasn’t being pointed out and noticed, it was when Mr. Orange said, “we came to fight and win.” 

 	“Shhh!! don’t talk too loud, the other you might hear you and prepare himself for
 this unstoppable war, I’ve got to go in swinging, here goes! You’ve done great things in my
 life, but alcohol has kinda set you back a little, sometimes more than a little. You’ve lost too much!
 Think about all the people that have tried to reach out and help you, they are going to
 come in too. Hello friends, thanks for coming over. We are about to jump this fool. It has been
 a long 13 years, the other you is very strong, this won't be easy or over in a day. Hydrate yourself,
 this will be a long fight. We need a plan, think about this....”

	Knock knock... “Hello?” 

	“Go away I can't talk right now, I’m thinking.. about... um, booze! Yea! 
Booze! I’ll fill your hunger when we get off work, just let me do this. It will be another
 reason to celebrate, I promise.” Fuc*, I need a plan, I need it now.

	Whispers, “dude, this is the other-other you, the good you. That’s why I’m here,
 I have a plan, but it will only work if we do it every day, its a life long fight. The only 
we can win is if you accept help and you’re ready to finally win.”

	“Well damn man, you going to whisper a novel through the door, can't let the other
 me hear us, come in. I accept.” 

	“Thank you, Robert, okay my plan will sound odd, but work with me here.
 Sticky notes.”

	“Wtf, ok good me, you have seconds before I toss you out of my head.”

	“Robert, STFU and listen. I saw you read some stories on Reddit/r/stopdrinking,
 everyone that quit couldn’t be happier. Yes, even the ones that just started today.
 The plan will be to share this with them, also sticky note calendar, get one.
 Every day you will wake up sober and write something, anything. Then we are going
 to take a picture with it and place it on the wall and in no time you'll see your wall full
 of your progress.”

	“Everyday!?!? Seems a bit much.”

	“Everyday, but we don’t have to put every picture up.. but we will take one daily
 and keep in touch with anyone that supports this idea.”

	“Wow. You know what, good me? That’s not a bad Idea, let us start this war today.”


	The war has begun, June 5th, 2017- 09:15 am.

A reminder of what alcohol has done to me and why it's very important to 
me that I stop drinking right now! 
O and any Alcohol that I had is now in the trash. 

Been drinking heavy for 13 yeas with a 1 year break in the middle because of deployment. 
That one year out of 13 was the best I've ever felt.  So, I had a talk with myself today. Crazy?
If I don't stop I wont grow much more, I became very comfortable being anti-social and binge 
drinking bottles for days-weeks, maybe take a day or two off and go back at it. A half gallon on
 a Saturday and Sunday was the Idea amount for me. My problem isn't so much that I need it
 when I wake up, but its something I think about all day. My problem is, when I start drinking, 
i'm not done till every things gone. Even then, if I know someone that is sober and awake, I ask for
a ride to get it. Normally thats a pretty pricey trip too. I now now I cant just have one.
not right now, maybe not ever. I've accepted this path. Im starting today and staying true to
 myself and all of you. Thank you for reading :)

Usually about work stuff, and my cut hours. I am sorry I can't help with the house bills, when I can barely afford to pay the bills I have. When I had steadier employment, I offered to help. But you always I don't like your attitude about it, and thus the cycle repeated. I am sorry you feel I contribute nothing financially to the house. Other than two house payments, taking over both our phone bills, letting you use my credit card for your emergencies, and paying for your car to get out of impound when it was repossessed. And gave you almost every cent I had when you quit your job, that you rightfully should have been fired from. I am sorry I am working on paying my expired car tags. However you have not paid yours since 2015, our situations are not the same. But most of all I am sorry I am not where you were at my age. I am not exactly where I want to be either. But between you and I, I didn't get three DUIs before my age. I didn't marry an abusive husband I met in a drug and alcohol treatment program. But I am doing the best I can, and I will not be told I am not trying. Working from home, part time as a sales associate, and working a third unpaid internship. I will not be told I am not trying to do better for myself and I don't spend my time blaming others for my life.

If you wanna punch me in the face for complaining about my day at work, go ahead. You said during a fight that you did not like me anymore, that is fine with me too. I made mistakes and I am working on fixing them. I won't blame illegal immigrants and millennials for my problems. You didn't want to tell me that you might have to file for bankruptcy and almost lost the house. The thing is I already knew. It has been non-stop money problems since we moved here. You sunk all of your inheritance in this house, but did you really think ahead about it? Because I don't think you did, and living in an apartment is not beneath you. I can't fix every problem that you have. If the only appreciation you give is too people who fix all your problems for you, then I guess you can hate me all you want. I have my own problems, and I have to fix those. "
6fiwc8,1,2017-06-05,I [26M] feel like my gf [23F] has a better relationship with my sister [23F]. Is it selfish to not want my gf to spend time with my sister?,johnffken,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6fiwc8/i_26m_feel_like_my_gf_23f_has_a_better/,"Sorry for the length guys. But I need your help...

Some backstory: My girlfriend and I got together when she was 19 and I was 22. Fast forward 2.5-3 years (2015), and we decide to move in with each other. The only thing is, I am in the middle of my Masters degree and am pretty poor. I am also very busy, with school during the week and a 25hr per weekend internship. She works part time during the week, and is taking a night class at the community college. Thus, to reduce costs and potentially having my gf feel ""too lonely"", I decided it would probably help to have my sister move in with us. It would be the first time my sister has moved out on her own, and what better way than living with people she already knows. Other important notes are that my gf and I's social circle is not that large, limiting itself to a couple of close friends and family. Also, my sister and I grew up always fighting. We eventually outgrew this. She and I were never were close in the sense that we shared personal information/feelings, but we always held the belief that family came first. We are also both very stubborn and sensitive to criticism. 

When we all first moved into the house together, my sis and gf almost immediately began to hang out. I had brought my gf around my family multiple times in the past, and my sis and gf had many shared interests; I knew they would click. Everything went smoothly at first, but about a year into it, I began to have feelings of ""being left out"". I started to feel as if my sis and gf were ""ganging up on me""; small things like voting for me to take out the trash, watching a certain movie, etc. There were even fights between my gf and I where my sis would include her input, saying I should act a certain way. 

There was a point where my sis and I got into a huge fight, where we didn't talk for two weeks. My sister had brought a second dog into the house without notifying the leasing agency, and I was totally against this. She had planned a weekend trip to go to a concert with her friends later that week. She invited my gf, but not me. My gf decided to go. I was very upset, but decided against bringing this up with my gf.

Many other instances like this occurred throughout the two years there. Although this post may come across as the entirety of the living situation was malicious in nature, this was not the case. There were plenty of pleasant times, and we all enjoyed each others company. I would say that arguments or feelings like this occurred approximately 30% of the time.

Anyway, last year in Nov/Dec, our household was in sync. We felt like a family. Were were constantly doing things with each other, hanging out with family and friends. It wasn't until a trip to see family in Orlando that things fell apart. Long story short, I said something sarcastic to my gf that my sister didn't like (something like, ""if you had thought about this ahead of time"" yaddayadda). My sister got mad at me. An argument ensued between me and my sis. My gf got in on this too. Normally I hear everyone out, but I couldn't take feeling like my sis and gf were against me. When my sis left to the hotel, I broke up with my gf. Instant regret. My gf was livid, and I had to get my dad to talk her out of not driving all the way back to Atlanta. We eventually made up, but the large fight between us made for an awkward Christmas. 

When we got back home, my sister was still upset about the fight in Orlando, and decided to move back home with our parents an hour away from Atlanta. Two weeks after this, my sis invited my gf to stay the night in our hometown with my parents. My gf and I had gotten into an argument just a day prior, and had not made up. She tells me she is going to stay the night at my parents with my sis and I get upset. I tell her how I feel about the situation, how it isn't right, and that if she goes then I'll break up with her. She says she is going anyway, and we break up. Such a stupid reason to break up with someone, but I couldn't take this feeling of competing for my gf with my sister any longer.

About a month ago, after several months apart, me and my gf start seeing each other again. I've missed her, and she has missed me. She has come over and we have gone out multiple times in the past month. During the past several months though, she has hung out with my sister. Going out to clubs, watching movies, going to each others house. They hang out weekly. I was planning a trip to Nashville for my girlfriends birthday in July, but I had to cut a day out of the trip because she is going wine tasting with my sister and her friends the day prior, and to the coast the day after. She just went to a movie today with my sister. This really bothers me. I still haven't spoken to my sister since January; no attempts have been made by her or I.

I'm just in a really weird place guys. I am so mad at my sister for the way she had placed herself in our relationship. At the same time though, I am mad at my gf for allowing this. It should be said though that my gf doesn't have a ton of other friends (neither do I), and I guess I understand why she hangs out with my sis. I just don't know what to do. I would like all of to be how we were, where I could go back to my hometown to my parents and hang out with everyone along with my girlfriend. But I can't handle the feeling of gf and sis being better friends than my gf is to me. Idk. Is this selfish of me? Am I right to feel this way? Lay it on me straight.

Tl;dr Sister moved in with gf and I. During the 2 years of living there, gf and sis became very close. Close to the point of a better relationship than gf and I or sis and I. Gf and I broke up in January, only to get back together a month ago. Gf and sis still hang out and have a close relationship. This bothers me, and I don't like the feeling of my gf hanging with my sis more than I or vice versa. Still don't talk to my sis, and don't think I can without resentment about the situation. Mad at sis for hanging out with my ex during our breakup and mad a gf for doing the same, although look past this as I love her."

I'm from Alberta, Canada. Living in the Bay area for summer on an internship. I have a full motorcycle license from back home, as well as a MSF safety course completed. I am looking to purchase a motorcycle for my commute and I am looking for some advice on the following:

* What do I need to register the bike? I have an address where I am living for the three months, but I am here on a student visa.
* Geico said they won't do short term insurance. Progressive said they would charge me extra for a foreign license, and would not accept a Canadian course.
* Should I register and insure it back home? Not sure if possible if I'm not there in person, but family could assist. Planning to ride the bike back in August, then ride there for a month until it snows. 
* What is the bare minimum I need to ride here? Not planning on purchasing anything expensive or new, so insurance will be pretty low. 
* What bikes are good for low insurance? I'm over 6' and ~190lb and would like to do a highway trip over the Rockies. Needs to be small enough to lane split.

UPDATE 2017-07-09:
About two weeks ago I purchased a 2006 SV650S for $2800. Would really recommend http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/, great website, better quality motorcycle and gear than Craigslist. Geico insured my at double California minimums approx. for ~$250 for the year. First one in line at DMV and only had to part with $274."
6fj2ak,1,2017-06-05,Mandela Effect - Purgatory? A continuation of life?,Matthewgalin,mandelajerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/mandelajerk/comments/6fj2ak/mandela_effect_purgatory_a_continuation_of_life/,"I'll Start off by saying that my opinion is that we live in a simulated existence, but that doesn't mean that we are not created and part of a Devin entity. We are in a lucid world. The soul inside of us lives in the real world/realm. We are here for the reasons in which you can only find for yourself. We shall wake up to truth in the right time.

I live as one with my soul! I can see the real world if I let myself. The simulation that ""IS"" this world can be as breathtaking and beautiful, as it can be dark and dangerous. I enjoy playing with others who enjoy the game as I do. That keeps me wanting to play.

I'm an old soul. I've been on this journey for quite some time. I would not be me without me. I am the reason I exist. However, I do give thanks to the creation!! Fulfilling my mission here will allow me to start the next. I have an understood position of myself.

If it exists, it cannot be wrong. If I want to know, I must look and find! Answers are there! 

I can't remember hearing anything about the flat earth talk until the Mandela effect came to light. Yet I would not be surprised if the earth was flat! I see all the evidence that supports that. And with all the other changes we are seeing in and through the Mandela Effect, how could I rule anything out? 

Before I go any further let me say that I am a person who has done a lot of travelling and I can clearly remember seeing the curve of the earth. It was something I paid attention to. I can no longer see it. I see the moon taking on a new rotation. Land has been shifting all over the world. So I have to ask myself, ""Could it be possible that the earth I knew had a major life altering event? And through a Divine Knowledge of that upcoming event, people were shifted to what we now know is the new earth?""

All I can say is that I know with all my heart that this earth is a lot different from the place I grew up calling home. I felt the shift long before I even knew what it all meant. I was standing on the beach in 2008 when this feeling came over me. I said to myself at that time that I just shifted into a different dimension. That's exactly what I felt and thought. I had no idea of what that would mean until the ME was revealed to me.

There are clearly questions to which I don't have the answers to. I will continue to explore the facts. Evidence is not just pointing to a flat earth, but providing proof to it. I would like to know that everything in the world was the way I understood it to be. I hope we are in orbit around the sun! However I don't need any more convincing of a major change that's taken place. I'm sure of both the changes to the earth and of the changes to in the material we use intimately.

I feel that the creator of this life has in some way been part of the shift. So much still unknown though! And I don't think we have enough evidence to determine how/why yet. That's what I will be looking for. Hoping ever evolving in my quest for the truth.

Maby this is Purgatory. Here is the definition :

pur·ga·to·ry
ˈpərɡəˌtôrē/
noun
noun: purgatory; plural noun: purgatories; noun: Purgatory
1.
(in Roman Catholic doctrine) a place or state of suffering inhabited by the souls of sinners who are expiating their sins before going to heaven.
mental anguish or suffering.
""this was purgatory, worse than anything she'd faced in her life""
synonyms:	torment, torture, misery, suffering, affliction, anguish, agony, woe, hell; More
an ordeal, a nightmare
""his internship was purgatory""
antonyms:	paradise
adjectivearchaic
adjective: purgatory
1.
having the quality of cleansing or purifying.
""infernal punishments are purgatory and medicinal""

Dose it not seem to have gotten somewhat darker in the world? Evil has become more prevalent and people are more excepting of that which was once completely unexceptable. 

I can't help but to see this as being a strong possibility. 

I am not a Christian and like I said, I still have to answer a lot of questions for myself. I am however  a spiritual person and weather we are in Purgatory or not, I cannot help but to understand through my own research that so much of the Bible is wrong.

So to me, this is almost like an oxymoron. But I always except that anything is possible and I look to the true nature of what is in front of me. 

How can so much have changed and continue to change in so little time? We are seeing an evil presence in this world like we've not seen before. 

We are unable to stop anything that's taking place, but maybe we can grow and evolve through this. We have suppressed ourselves for far too long! We have been ignoring the truth. That's why we have not been able to grow as a species past selfish and fake ideals. We think we know it all and except the word of man as the word of God. I think that is the reason for the Bible changing. To show us that it has fault. I am not trying to offend anyone and I only speak for myself.

I can see things for what they are not. Giving me a chance to sort through the years of oppressed spiritual growth by seeing the truth to the lies that we have been told, and through the misunderstood events.We just ignore the deception all around us by crawling into our greed and our denial.

Anyway, I know that we are able to evolve, but I also know that we need to get rid of the bullshit to do so. We need to admit that we do not know, except that anything is possible and try to understand as much as we can about this new world we live in. The truth is out there. We can see that now more than ever before. It's up to us to find it."
6fjdoq,6,2017-06-05,Curious about other people's meditation routine,maseephus,Meditation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/6fjdoq/curious_about_other_peoples_meditation_routine/,"I have been meditating for the past four months almost daily, engaging in morning sessions that last between 10-15 minutes. When I first started, I used the headspace app to learn about various techniques, and even learned some other techniques while reading a book on Buddhism. After my free month with headspace ran out, I decided to pursue meditating on my own with the hope that one day I'd explore other resources. Thus, I've been meditating completely on my own for about 3 months now. Soon I intend to check out other apps/resources. My meditation routine goes as follows:

1) after I wake up, shower, and brush my teeth, I throw on some clothes and sit on my bed, beginning my meditation

2) I start breathing in through my nose, out through my mouth, passively observing my surroundings

3) when I feel ready, I close my eyes and concentrate my attention on my body touching the bed and the feeling of my hands resting in my lap

4) I breathe in and out through my nose, settling into my surroundings, listening to sounds, and trying to visualize the surroundings I left

5) after I feel quite calm, I ""scan"" my body head to the toe, trying to concentrate on each part of my body

6) then, I try to briefly think about how my body feels (perhaps I am itchy/uncomfortable in some places, or I am tired, or I notice that I am quite awake)

7) I proceed to think about the other people in my life whom I care about and care about me, filling me with warmth (lovingkindness--I am also away from friends for 8 months on an internship so this is especially helpful)

8) I ""start"" the core of the exercise by repeating a mantra. In the future I'd like to have a solid repertoire of these, but I found that I like to recite ""mindfully approach the day"". I breath in through ""...mindfully approach..."" and draw out an exhalation through ""...the day..."". I find this mantra especially useful because it is easy to recite when I find myself in need of a reminder to be mindful or aware during the day

9) I recite the mantra until I've settled my mind. This is an arbitrary number of repititions; I imagine that it probably goes on for about 5 minutes. If thoughts enter my mind I ""note"" them, objectively stating what they are (ex, work, anxiety, etc) and gently return my attention to reciting my mantra. 

10) If I have time or am willing to do a longer meditation, I practice focusing my mind on different parts of my body. I'll focus my attention between my ankles, then on my belly, my diaphragm, chest, throat, brow, and above the top of my head, going through these points multiple times. 

11) Another thing I will occasionally do is let my mind roam freely for a few minutes to see where it will go

12) Finally, I wrap up the exercise by visualizing the surroundings I've left, listening intently to the sounds around me, feeling the weight of my body on my bed, and feeling the weight of my hands in my lap. Once I am satisfied I then open my eyes and consider how I feel.

So that is my routine. I am interested in practicing more variety and trying different mantras. I will also look into other apps/online resources for a guided meditations. How do your meditative exercises differ? When I scan down my body in the beginning, it is in an amorphous manner. I imagine my focus ""sloshing around"" parts of my body instead of uniform rings passing down it, and I wonder if you guys feel similar/different.

To sum up: how do your routines differ, and how does it feel to scan down your body?"
6fjs52,3,2017-06-06,I [20/F] am rethinking relationship with boyfriend [24/m] of 2 years after moving across the country for a summer internship - Grass is greener syndrome?,lcacm,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6fjs52/i_20f_am_rethinking_relationship_with_boyfriend/,"We have dated for a little over two years. I met him when i was 18, he was 21. What started as a hookup became a two year relationship. In the past two years, we have grown so much, especially me. I know I have a long way to go, but looking back, I can see I was a child when I was 18. He was my first everything, and I have never had sex/ been in a relationship with anyone else. 

Throughout the whole relationship, I have had doubts. He is not perfect, but he is kind, funny, caring, and generous. I mean, I'm not perfect either. But what is important is that he takes my comments to heart and works to improve our relationship if need be. I can tell that he loves me wholeheartedly and makes sure to let everyone know how much he cares for me. 

There have been no huge red flags (lying, cheating, abuse), just little yellow flags. Like how he and I come from totally different backgrounds and his ambition is unmatched to mine (I am very hard-working and passionate about my work, he is more easy-going and just plays video games). How he often sounds impatient when I try to talk to him about his day. How he never takes initiative to makes changes in his life, how he can never stick to a plan or try something new. How he refuses to do spontaneous or silly things with me. 

But the problem is, I was always trying to find something wrong with him to convince myself he's not the one. The truth is, he is an all-around good guy. I love him and his mom and his sister, who have all been so good to me. For every ""yellow"" flag, there are a dozen great memories and lovely things about him. I think the problem is the fact that I don't see a future with him. I can see spending another month with him but I don't see us getting married, or having kids or living together. The problem is that I love him for all he has done for me, but it is like the love I have for a good friend and not a lover. He is so loyal to me, so it's not like he would ever cheat on me (nor I to him). 

I've been on my own for 3 weeks now for a summer internship. Spending this time apart from him and my friends from home made me realize the things I want in life. It's not that I just want an excuse to break up so I can hook up with random guys. Honestly, the thought of a one-night stand makes me a little icky (just personal preference). I just want to be by myself a bit and grow on my own. It is concerning because I am ecstatic that my female best friend will visit me this summer, while I am sort of filled with annoyance at the thought that he will also visit me. 

I have thought about breaking up many, many times. Sometimes a whisper of doubt when I am drunk or have smoked weed. Other times, when I am home from school and haven't seen him for weeks. But there has never been One Big Thing that pushed me to. Every time I had doubts, I would think of all the good memories and how much I love his dog (that we adopted together), his family, all the nice things he's done for me, all of our inside jokes... We broke up briefly last year and I cried and cried until my stomach hurt. I know what will happen if I break up with him but I feel like I have to rip this band-aid off. 

Everything is fine on paper, and I know he will never break up with me if everything just stays exactly the way it is. So I know that I'm the one who has to do it. The days before I left for my internship, I was very emotional and cried a lot. My boyfriend got sad and thought it was because I was going to miss him. I mean that is true, I cried because I was going to miss him, but also because I felt a sense of upcoming dread. I think deep down, I knew that it wouldn't work out in the long term, so I may well have just broken up with him at that point. But I decided not to. We have had lots of talks in our relationship but there are some things that I know will never change of him. I have given this relationship 2 years to know that I do not see a long-term future with him.

We try to call once a day and we both chat while at work, but it just seems forced to me (on my side). I ask myself if it's just because I want to have sex with other guys or go into an open relationship (no and no). Is it because I have feelings for someone else? No. Do I feel like I am missing out a little? Yes. I think I just don't want to be in a relationship any longer, and I feel like such an asshole for abandoning what a lot of my friends say they would kill for. But I know myself the best, and I know that I am not 100% fulfilled and satisfied when I am with him. Is this grass is greener syndrome? Is it the distance between us and the lessened time we have to talk? I would love any input.

Thank you!

**tl;dr: have ben away from boyfriend for a few weeks to have some time to think. Realizing that there are no big red flags or huge reasons, but I just no longer want to be in a relationship with him. I feel really bad because he does love me and I love him, and we have had so many good memories. I feel like I will be throwing away something good, but I know I will never shake this feeling off**"

Also I am not totally sure how to change the flair on mobile which I apologize for.

I am renting a house with three other people, one of which is staying in the house over the summer for an internship that is local. This is my roommate L. L has some issues related to untreated ADHD and anxiety and she has a tumultuous personality at times, especially when things don't go as expected.

I have been coming and going from the house as I need to visit my doctor in town on occasion, so I will be in the house for two days max a month over the summer. I was expecting to be in town at the same time to pay rent, but something came up and I had to transfer the rent to L so she could pay it instead. (The system our landlord prefers is for us to write a check and put it in our house's mailbox for him to pick up.) 

L knew this system but there was some hiccup apparently. At 5pm she has texted me about the landlord not picking up the check yet and at 7pm the landlord at emailed me saying that he dropped by but had not seen the check in the mailbox, so I assumed that L took the check out of the mailbox after she texted me and the landlord just missed it. I asked the landlord for an address in future to mail the check to, but if I had not heard from him I would tell L to just put the check back in the mailbox otherwise. I texted L this information and she then just went off on me telling me I am being extremely unhelpful and irresponsible and that she was ""...putting the check in our mailbox so the landlord better fucking get it."" (I'm paraphrasing here but this was the more... Chill statement she made.)
I have tried my best to keep her as informed as possible by letting her know what I have heard from the landlord as soon as I received the information so there isn't much I could of done differently in the situation. When I asked her if she had decided to put the check in our mailbox or the landlord's home address she refused to talk to me all day so I was unable to tell the landlord where the check was. 


Today I got to the house and went out for dinner. We have two entrances into our house, a side door and a front door. We're not really suppose to use the side door since it goes through one of our other roommate's bedroom. She isn't here currently and the house is still being moved into so the room isn't set up, so L is using this as her main entrance and exit. I locked this door after I left and as I was eating dinner L called me and asked why I had locked the side door. I asked if she was locked out but she said her key just didn't work on the side entrance only the front even though they're the same locks, and that I shouldn't be locking that door at all. She was very short with me and abruptly hung up. When I came home I checked her key and it worked fine, she just didn't understand how to unlock the door. Regardless, she shouldn't even be using that door long term as it will be blocked when our other roommate sets up her things in that room.

I'm at my wit's end. I don't want to snap at L because it will just make matters worse but I don't know what else I can do to deal with her outbursts of anger and frustration at seemingly small things... Is there anything I can do differently to make this more bearable?

TL;DR: I have a roommate who gets unreasonably upset at small things and then takes her anger out on me. I don't know how to handle these situations and would like guidance."

I know this will sound obnoxious and petty but it really bugs me.
Basically I have no private office space to go into. My desk sits wide out in the open. 
Not so much with clients but because I work in a teaching institution, interns are always with me.
Not even my own and I feel like I can't get a moment to just ease into my day and drink a cup of coffee before questions and client discussion is being thrown at me.
Head phones is not really an option and sometimes I've had to say ""I'm not being rude but I just have some work to do which is why my back is to you"".

Because I'm wide out in the open I feel like I have almost no boundaries.

Creating a private space is not really an option either like others I work with have. I also don't think setting up a cubicle would work either because of the space layout. Others have noticed too and said its really not fair, but it is what it is.

On occasion too, because I have a big room, our admin team also sends clients and family into my space, especially if the waiting room is crowded. I've complained and gotten no where. This is annoying when I'm trying to do work and make phone calls.

Again I know this sounds petty but I really feel like I never ever have any downtime. "

- Do you have any feedback on housinganywhere.com? I'm currently using this site to find shared apartments but I can't find any reviews online

- Are there a lot of scammers? I'm not in the city atm and I'll have to rent before making a visit of the room. I come from Copenhagen where housing is expensive and you have dozens of scammers

Your biggest threat to me when I was in middle school was ""I won't send you to Saint Tikhons this year!!"" I was the that weird kid who went to church camp and enjoyed it. I still wear camper shirts with pride. I met the two boyfriends I've had there, my current one with whom I am discussing marriage. There have been more summers of my life spent at camp than not. I that week is the highlight of my year. 

And, as you also know, I'm heading into my 4th year as a counselor... and my boyfriend isn't coming to counselor with me. I really don't care, as his (impressive as hell!!) internship in California is far more important for his and hopefully our future. I can handle that, and already have plans with a few other counselors for some after lights out fun, like D&amp;D games and night Walmart runs. 

However, I have four major problems that I really do not know how to handle, especially without J (boyfriend) there. And I want to talk to you about it, but you're still mad that you haven't been accepted back since camp changed hands. I really need your help and advice and I don't know what to do. 

The first and biggest problem is T. T is the camps EMT, allegedly. We haven't needed one in ages, but like, he's an added insurance if something goes wrong. However, unlike the other nurses at camp, he prowls the campgrounds and sort of terrorizes a number of people there, including me. He would constantly look for me and J to slip up and be affectionate (which, we weren't. Kids come first, and the most I would get is a hug and a kiss on the forehead in the main stairwell at midnight before going off to bed, never more) He watched us play video games on J's laptop for three hours when J was on night duty, which is just a peek around the dorm every 15 minutes or so to make sure the kids are heading to sleep. He complained to the directors that we were even playing video games, and Tat, the most honest of them said ""well night duty is boring. At least they found a way to stay awake."" Even so, he always complains about my work ethic. 

However, without J, I am more concerned. I inherited your knees mom. I work out to stay strong though and took two extremely physical acting classes in college this year without even needing my brace once. However, every year at camp, something is demanded of me by T, and my knees suffer. Last year I actually fell to the floor during a prayer before a meal when my knee gave out, after being told to flip, drag and launch a 250lb paddle boat into the water by myself. I did it, but I suffered greatly after. T also caused my brother to faint, having him carry a full water dispenser 1/4 of a mile by foot, and then up two flights of stairs, only to find the water dispenser that he was supposed to replace was already full. T causes trouble and i a, really scared for what I may go through this year without J there to let me vent and help me when my knee was bad (J sweetly packed an extra ace bandage and a few thing I didn't think of, like nighttime painkillers, and was just really sympathetic when I needed it.)

Secondly, is M. M is my friend, sort of, I know you don't like her but we have been through a lot together. She skipped camp last year to work, but she's coming back and stationed lakeside with me. However she out J and I through hell her last year there, and still hasn't apologized to either of us. She has said that she knows she has to, but that's not an apology. That's a statement. Besides that, I now have a years seniority on her, and she won't like that. And her boyfriend of three months is doing boot camp for the navy and this is her first long distance. She is the type to be the FIRST AND ONLY to go through any suffering or trial ever, so all she will be able to talk about is how much she misses her boy. J and I have done long distance for a majority of our relationship, and he is on this internship until January. I might fly out to see him, but if not, it's seven months without him. But it won't matter to her and I have no clue how to deal with it. 

Thirdly is N. N calls you mom and has been to our house for holidays after his own mother passed from breast cancer. However, he alternates between ""you are my little sister"" and ""let me flirt with you"" and I hate it. I brought this to your attention and he suddenly stopped coming to Christmas. Thank you for that. But I don't know what to do for this year. He calls me a childlike version of my name (think ""kitty"" for Catherine, but my name isn't catherine) and honestly, the only person I like calling me that is J because he has respect behind it so it doesn't sound like he is speaking to a five year old. I'm going to have to try my best to avoid him, but I know it's nearly impossible. I am going to try but this p, partnered with everything else is going to exhaust me to no end. 

Finally, this is the one that you don't know about at all: Aunt S. Your best friend, the person that you purposefully arrange the weekend before camp to hang out and catch up with. As soon as you leave she starts trying to shit talk you to me. Every year. ""Your mother doesn't understand that my time before camp setting up is sort of supposed to be for me alone"" ""Your mother talks too fast and is too opinionated, I hate how New Yorkers talk, I'm from Ohio, women don't talk like that there"" and so on. I don't know what to do about her either. It's painful. I see you go through so much excitement when we get ready to drive to camp, and you help the set up process so much even though you don't have to, just to see her and she doesn't care nearly as much as you do. And then she spews all this toxic mess at me. Even when you helped her daughter with panic attacks last year, even when you protected her daughter from her ex boyfriend. She doesn't get that you're my mother. Sure, you drive me nuts. It's what you're supposed to do to your college aged daughter. We butt heads and argue and you drive me straight up a wall without directions sometimes. But you're my mother. And it hurts me to see how she real,y thinks of you when you are gone from campus. And the worst thing is, if she were to tell you ""hey I could really use an hour/the evening/a meal without you"" you would immediately allow it, no questions asked no hard feelings. And that's what hurts the most. 

All of this is driving me crazy. I will never back down from camp, because I want to give as many kids an experience like I have gotten since I was six. I came to the conclusion last night chatting with the head of the lakeside that there are campers who have never known any lake counselors but us and that made me cry from all the emotions. I want a happy and positive year, but I could never tell you anything that I'm feeling right now. I'm scared, mom, because everything here is happening at once and I don't know what to do. "

I got on the train and took it to a station near my dad's house (not married to my nmom) and have not contacted my nmom or her husband since. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. 

To celebrate, I thought that I would make a list of some of the positive things that have happened in the last year.

1. I got a summer job (2016) refurbishing macs
2. I got spend time with my uncle and other relatives on my dads side (my nmom hated everyone related to my dad).
3. I celebrated my 19th birthday without any Ns. Just my chosen family and friends.
4. I started college at a four-year university and I am perusing a degree that I am passionate about.
5. I joined PRSSA (professional organization for my major) and met some awesome people.
6. I got an internship working for a youth voting campaign.
7. I got a job at a marketing agency (I want to go into marketing/PR/communications).
8. I filed for a legal name change to remove my nmoms last name from my birth certificate and legal documents.
9. I spent Thanksgiving with my dad's relatives and chosen family. 
10. I got my name legally changed a few days before Christmas.
11. I spent Christmas with people that truly care about me.
12. I was invited to be on the PRSSA board (as a freshman).
13. I got a job at another marketing company. 
14. I finished my first year of college with a 3.6 GPA (I have ADHD and school has always been hard for me.
15. I got to watch my friends graduate from college.

It's hard for me to believe that all of these good things (and more) have happened in just 365 days. If any of you are thinking about going NC, please do it. You deserve to be happy."
6fm7kg,3,2017-06-06,Can I take out a car loan / lease a car the same year I am taking out private student loans?,randomguy182,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6fm7kg/can_i_take_out_a_car_loan_lease_a_car_the_same/,"A little background: I am a 20 year old college student, living at college over the summer working at an internship making $11 an hour. I am 430 miles from home and travel fairly irregularly to home and would consider having a car a necessity, I use it for work and school as well. I plan to graduate with a Computer Science B.S. degree in two years and have some fairly good looking prospects already lined up when I graduate.
    
My current car (1999 Pontiac Bonneville) is on her last leg, as of today the CV Joint failed and the cost of repair is ~$600-1500. Normally I would just suck it up and pay this but as my mechanic has mentioned she will NOT be inspected by anyone when the inspection goes up in September. I don't see a point in investing even more money into this car when there is no way I can continue driving it after 3 more months.

Starting the coming semester I will be taking out a private student loan for an estimated 15,000 ( I have explored all other options, and am currently drafting a letter to the school to request additional help to finish up my last two years of school with the director of my schools Honors Program ) and plan to do so again the year after for my senior year of school. My credit score is decent.. FICO 734 and I have one credit card in my name with Discover Student and the line is currently 1,300. I plan to take the private student loans out with Discover as well but nothing is set in stone. The only other credit lines I have open are the various federal student loans (16,440.46 total) that I have been paying interest on. 

I have no co-signer on any of my loans and no possibility of one, my parents have horrible credit and I am trying not to get stuck in the same boat.

I would like to ask, is it completely out of the question to explore looking for a loan for a used / refurb  car? And if not, where should I start. I really have no other options here and don't want to royally screw myself but I am desperate."
6fmffw,1,2017-06-06,Another intern clearance question,aborteddinosaur,foreignservice,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/6fmffw/another_intern_clearance_question/,"Like many others, I'm still anxiously waiting to hear back about my secret-clearance investigation for a summer internship in an Embassy.

I am worried because up until a few weeks ago, things seemed to be moving along smoothly. My supervisors for both of my previous internships were contacted, but unfortunately the government has not reached out to any of the other references I listed in my SF86 (high school teachers, college roommates, friends, etc.). 

For those who have already received clearance for the summer or in the past, is this something I should be worried about? Is it common for several of the contacts listed to not be interviewed and still be granted a clearance on time? Really searching for any info to put my mind at ease right now."

So I am applying to an internship that requested a Chinese cover letter. I wrote it up, but I know for sure that there are errors that I cannot see. It isn't The Red Chamber, but I hope it works well in exhibiting my reason for wanting to joing the team. Here it is：

中国劳工观察, 
	
最近，中国的经济发展速度变得慢。习主席和共产党政策要决解这个趋势，因为经济发展的速度对劳工的市场有很大的影响。然而，目前中国劳工观察的工作越来越重要，很多中国的工人权利收到压力，解雇的水平一直提高。众所周知，中国政府的劳工统计不是准确的，所以中国劳工观察的研究和知识普及对全球企业和政府是必不可少的。
	
我接近两年住在中国大陆，在上海我是一个教育顾问，然后录取清华大学的中文中心项目。我亲眼看中国的经济发展，亲眼看被剥削的工人，亲眼看全球化的缺点在中国。学习在纽约公立大学的时候，我跟一位教授研究民主的制度在非洲的国家，安排统计发给USAID。我相信我的经验对这个实习性的地位是非常合适的。
	
中国劳工观察的使命让我感动。中国的劳工人口是世界上最多的，但是他们的权利和真实的情况非常不清楚，并且非营利机构研究中国的劳工形势不是很多。因而，我要参加中国劳工观察的团队，增强全球对中国的理解力，产生知识能保护中国工人的权利，和支持中国劳工观察的使命。
 
感谢,

I also thought it could be a cool excercise for the subreddit, since we mostly see basic grammar questions, which are still super helpful to me, but some longer texts might be cool. I apologize if anyone finds this to be tacky, but I hope users can flex their skills and help me out :)

Graduated in 2012 and I feel have a good variety of experience- worked in the academic library in undergrad, post MLIS have been a temp school librarian, in public libraries, internship with archives and most recently as a research librarian at a law firm. So I know my skills are applicable outside of jobs with librarian in the title. But I'm struggling with an app for a job titled as a senior research associate and for the most part I'm able to relate my skills with the job posting (familiar with literature reviews, interviews, focus groups)- except for the stuff discussing statistical analysis/data analysis. It asks for proficiency in basic data analysis and use of one or more statistical software packages. The person who is the head of the ""research lab"" has a PHD in sociology so I want to make sure I'm able to show that I can keep up. 
Any advice?"

I'll be graduating after Fall 2017 with my B.S. in Chemical Engineering. I have been fortunate to have had a few internships throughout my undergrad career. To briefly describe them:

Position (Year)|Description|
:--|:--|
Research Intern (Sophomore)|I spent a summer working under a research chemist formulating dye mixtures for a tattoo ink. I was involved in developing experiments, making solutions of dye, encapsulating them in polymer, and performing tests (spectroscopy, heat degredation).&lt;br data-cke-eol=""1""&gt;|
Reliability Engineering Co-op (Junior)|I took a semester off of school to work for a reliability engineer at a large pharmaceutical company. I was responsible for identifying gaps in our maintenance department's spare parts inventory. I got to see a lot of process equipment, but I mainly only observed as I was taking down information on various pieces of instrumentation.|
Production Intern (Senior)|Currently working right now for the same company I did my co-op with in their Production department. They are responsible for planning and operation of our manufacturing plant. It's a little early for me to describe my roles in this position as I have just started.|

I wanted to share some trends that I have noticed with my limited professional experience. I have noticed that the typical ""engineering"" jobs at my company where I currently work can be done with a B.S. degree. These jobs, however, appear to be more problem solving and project management oriented. Engineers at my current company seem to fill a small role in a very large working machine that is the company operations. With that, I have found that engineers typically are not involved in the process operation or process development. 

With my co-op and my current position, so far, I feel like my degree is not being used at all. I am worried that when I get into a job market, I won't be doing any real science. All I have been exposed to is ordering equipment, troubleshooting problems with manufacturing equipment, and generally fixing small tasks day-to-day. When I decided to become a ChemE major, I had the expectation that I would be working hands on to design chemical processes, performing calculations to fit design specifications, and even working on scaling up small research processes into larger designs. What I am finding is that all this knowledge that I am learning in my undergrad really isn't being used.

**A disclaimer** is that I have not had much exposure to the field and I could potentially just be working for a company that does not employ engineers the way most are. So I have been thinking about professional school beyond my B.S. I know that I definitely do not want to get my MBA. The business side of a company (managing finances, people, project management) is not something I am interested in. I think I would much prefer to have hands-on exposure to the chemistry and processes that each company are using to produce their product.

I have been looking online for jobs that might interest me since I will be graduating in about 6 months. I'm worried that these jobs will not be what I am looking for. I have been considering getting a PhD, but at this point I am worried that I misinterpreted what Chemical Engineering actually is. The problem is that I absolutely love my classes. My Chemical Separations course was my favorite undergrad course I have taken. My worry is that a job as a chemical engineer is not at all what my classes were like.

**TL;DR: My internship experiences have not been the greatest, and I'm worried that I won't enjoy my job as a chemical engineer. I'm considering alternative options after I graduate like getting a PhD, but I don't think it is smart for me to do that while still being unsure if I like Chemical Engineering enough. My plan is to get a first job and use it to gauge whether I will be happy working with my B.S. or whether I should go get my PhD.**

Any comments and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
6fol0j,1,2017-06-06,Making big academic decision. Advice appreciated.,srhreddit,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/6fol0j/making_big_academic_decision_advice_appreciated/,"Hello /r/tefl. I figured I should post this on here since my decision relates to tefl. As the title says, I have to soon make a big academic decision in my life. Before I explain my situation, I would like to give a short academic background about me so you all have a better idea of where I'm coming from. Since I'm a resident of South Carolina, all my secondary education is from that State:

- Went to military reserves right out of high school in 2011.
- Decided to go to technical school at the beginning of 2012 and dropped out of two semesters.
- Got my life together and went back to technical school in 2013. Spent two years there getting all my basic education requirement courses out of the way so that I could transfer to a 4 year university
- Transferred to 4 year university in Spring of 2015. Spent a semester there and decided to do an exchange program from Fall of 2016 to present.
- Have obtained 70 credits so far.
- Major is German studies, but want to change it to English major.
- During the whole period of my education, I have done 3 internships: one in IT, one in teaching, and one in translation.

Right now, I'm finishing my exchange semester abroad and will be returning to the U.S. in August. I want to change majors because, for me, I've realized that I want to teach (more specifically English) for a living. The teaching internship I did was in Russia and through that internship, I was able to get in touch with someone who owns a language school there and has offered me contract work there teaching because of how well I did during the internship. To say it basically, contract work is very difficult for foreigners to obtain in Russia and even more difficult for those without a bachelor's degree, so I really lucked out on finding this job. I know that by taking this job, it can be my first step in the door towards a teaching career and would also allow me the opportunity to pursue a master's degree in Russia if I choose to do so (I would honestly love to since I would hardly have to pay anything for it.)

My current problem is that I can't take on this job because of my university. I have to finish my last two years at my university since I have to obtain a certain amount of in-house credits in order to graduate. I've thought about how I could go around this problem and I eventually did some research on universities that offer online bachelor's. The universities that interested me the most were Arizona State University and University of Massachusetts. Both of them offer really good online english bachelor degrees. I applied to both colleges and got accepted to both and from the conversations I had with the academic advisers, it seems that I could finish either degree within a year since most of my credits would transfer to either university. I'm interested in Arizona State in particular because, if I decide to do my masters in the U.S. anyways, they offer an online masters specifically for teaching english to foreigners, which would be my dream masters degree to have and would be complimented by my contract job in Russia. I can also continue with the contract job in Russia since the masters degree is online.

What should I do? If I decide to stay at my university and change majors, that means I'll have to study another two years and would probably have to take on volunteer work teaching English since paid work is very hard to come by where I live. I could stick to my German major and finish in a year, but like I said before, I don't want to have a career related to German and German Studies. I want a career teaching english. If I transfer to an online bachelor's degree, that means I can take on the job in Russia and actually start earning some money while doing something that I love. However, I'm just worried that if I pursue the online bachelor's, future employers won't take my degree as seriously as with a residence degree. I've talked to friends of mine who have already had plenty of years teaching experience and they said that if I stated that I was working in my career field while obtaining my online degree, I could use that work as a reason for transferring to an online degree and would be appealing to future employers since it shows good work qualities like time-management and self-determination. They also said that I could just finish the German degree in a year and start looking for work right after since I have a degree that shows I know German and knowing German would be an advantage at any language organization I want to teach at. But I honestly can learn the rest of the German I need on my own. I'm already a C1 speaker, so I could take a language test (ex. TestDaF) and that results and certificate from that test will show that I know German anyways, so why bother with the German degree?

My thoughts are a bit scattered on this and any advice would be appreciated on what I should do. Thanks in advance to those that can help.

6fotqn,30,2017-06-06,"[GEAR] my two electric guitars, Fender Tele MiM, Gibson Flying V 2007 and self-built tube amp",CokeyTheClown,Guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/6fotqn/gear_my_two_electric_guitars_fender_tele_mim/,"http://imgur.com/a/2YQtp

I turned 30 a couple of weeks ago and my friends surprised me with an amazing present, this brand new Fender Telecaster MiM, I've been wanting to get my hands on one of these for years now, and they pulled it off... I might start to switch a few things on it in the next months, probably installing a P90 in the neck (not sure if standard of humbucker-sized, like a SD Phatcat), and a SD Hot tele pickup in the bridge to match the output level of the P90.

I bought the Gibson with my first internship pay during my first stay in the US in 2008, it's not only an amazing guitar, it's also a great memory of the time I spent in the US. If I'm happy with the P90 on the Tele, I might put one in the neck position of this one as well, as good as this axe is, I almost never use the original 496R.

I built the amp using a kit from http://www.madamp.de/ (model A15Mk2) at the end of last year. It is loosely based on the Fender Brownface, and building it as been a really fascinating experience. the cab is a 2x12 Palmer cab, and I changed the tolex to match the amp head (DIY case, covered in royal blue tolex, though the picture doesn't do it justice)

The pedalboard contains the following:

* DIY Powerbox
* DIY Delay
* DIY Compressor
* DIY Tube screamer (TS9)
* Dimebag Darrell signature Wah
* Not on the picture: Vox Satchurator (probably going to sell it)"

I've gotten extremely efficient at it but after 9 hours (usually take 15 minutes for lunch n eat it at my desk) when I get up to leave my fucking manager is always like ""wait, you can't leave...here do this n do this"" all of which are intern level work or stupid entry corrections other employees make and are certainly capable of correcting. 


I don't mind working 12 hour days of I'm being challenged and learning. But being in a role that I've mastered n gotten down in 9 hours and her expecting me to just keep working doing stupid shit, it's extremely insulting. 


Furthermore, the fact that I was hired to do this job n do it extremely well and my manager still doesn't trust me enough to allow me to make judgement calls on when to leave the office is extremely discouraging and again, insulting. 


Just to add, there's no room for upward growth here.

6fq7da,10,2017-06-06,My story: the 90s,publisher_24601,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/6fq7da/my_story_the_90s/,"Previous chapters: [Prologue I](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/6c7znw/my_story_prologue_idad/), [Prologue II](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/6cknxf/my_story_prologue_pt_iimom/), [Early years](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/6czeod/my_story_early_years/)

It's been a while since my last installment, I've been busy. Couldn't think of a clever title but the 90s is pretty accurate, since that whole decade was interesting. **CONTENT WARNING: EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND MILD PHYSICAL ABUSE**

So by the time I grew older, ages 7 onward, things sort of cooled down. My dad had stopped the spankings and mass toy disposals some time before then. Looking back this was around the time he was appointed first as a MS then as an elder, so it's possible he was just trying to keep a clean rep to get promoted. But who really knows? 

For the most part, the years between ages 6 and 11 were pretty good. I watched cartoons (in this regard my parents were surprisingly lenient), played with toys, even got a Sega Genesis and a PlayStation. 

We did move a lot, mainly because my father would work maintenance at apartments and get free/discounted rent. When he'd rage quit his job we would get kicked out and have to move. As a result we never stayed more than a year or two in any given congregation, and I never had a chance to make friends with other JW children. As a result I'd play with my non-JW cousins, especially when we moved to where my mom's side of the family lived. My cousins were the closest things I had to siblings, and as an only child I very much cherished these moments. 

My mom didn't care much for them, as these were the children of her hated younger sister (see Prologue II). During these years I recall my mom would be very emotionally abusive towards me. She was always cold and distant, but more so as I was growing up. She would slap me on the mouth whenever I ""talked back"" (Latinos reading this will know what I mean). She'd accuse me of not doing enough to study for school or for meetings. Sometimes it seemed like she would go out of her way to make me feel like I wasn't good enough. 

School during these years was a mixed bag. On the west coast of Florida, where my mom's side of the family lived, the teachers were nice to me, the school had recess, and I had lots of friends. So since I was happy here, naturally my mom hated that school and would always talk bad about it. On the east coast of Florida, where my dad's side of the family lived, teachers were meaner, there was tons of homework, I was bullied, and there was no recess. In particular my 4th grade teacher was a real bitch. She'd specifically pick on me. Whenever I missed my homework, seemed like I wasn't paying attention, or basically did anything that a kid that age normally does. 

Things got really bad when an intern came in to assist her. In order to get on the teacher's good side, the intern made it her mission to break me down. One time I remember her slapping my arm because I was ""fidgeting"" while she was scolding me for some reason. Looking back I could/should have reported that incident, but I didn't because I was so used to my mom treating me that way I figured it was normal. 

The one silver lining of this experience is that it helped erode any faith that may have begun to take root. After all, if Jehovah was watching and protecting his servants, why was I suffering as a child? 

Somehow I survived 4th grade. My 5th grade teacher was somewhat better but when he got mad at a student he would yell at them in front of the class. I was on the receiving end of a few of these tirades, and they did their fair share of damage to my psyche. 

As the 90s drew to their close I remember a tract about the year 2000. I remember thinking that this was going to be the Big A. And 1999 did prove to be a pivotal year, but for a different reason. On December 10th, my maternal grandmother passed away from pneumonia. Two weeks later my aunt (my mom's older sister) caught a strong flu which she didn't treat, also developed pneumonia, and died on December 31st 1999. Strangely, I didn't cry when they died. I was emotionally numb, and looking back I suppose my upbringing to that point played a significant role in my lack of emotion. 

However, these deaths would set a chain of events in motion that would lead to some of the darkest chapters of my life. 

My next installment will cover such topics as my mother's JW radicalization, middle school hell, and how I let myself get dunked. Thank you for reading! "

--------------------------------------

* The first Opie &amp; Anthony Show on High Voltage 202 features a really great [intro and opening production piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDoR4fw2E-8). It really feels like ""Ecstasy of Gold"" is fitting theme for their triumphant return.

* The first show is a must-listen - O&amp;A talk about the past couple of years, catch up with which crew is still with them, introduce new staff members (Master Po and Sex Bagel, who Anthony describes as a bleached-haired 15-year-old). Opie says the next time they get fired the show is over for good. Rick Delgado doing morning show in NY; Opie says there's no bad blood between them, although he is no longer dating his sister Sandy. There's so much great stuff this episode that it’s just worth listening to the whole thing.

* Wackbag, CringeHumor, and OpieAnthonyLive all are major message boards.

* Jimmy made his first appearance on Leno just prior to the show’s return. Can't find a video of it though.

* Opie and Anthony hate both their heavily-edited new publicity photo and the [cartoon caricatures](https://media2.giphy.com/media/bq9nB7005Ghhu/giphy.gif) of them.

* Steve C's bizarre production becomes a recurring point of ridicule. 

* Lady Di, who they say has aged tremendously since WNEW, works at a flower shop. Frenchie calls in and swears at them, but it lacks whatever minimal entertainment value it used to have. Stalker Patti has a full time job with benefits.

* Anthony's sexual appetite has shifted away from Olson twins (who are now legal) and he would now like to fuck Lindsey Lohan.

* Jimmy tells [story of how Opie apparently made the Radio Chick wait](https://youtu.be/QsxyrSSgIsU?t=25m51s) in the mailroom while he walked down the hall.

* Now that he's unsencored, Jim is able to fully explain his love for meaty pussy. It's actually pretty hilarious; he talks about how he ""wants a pussy that looks like it got blown up by a cartoon cigar."" It's worth listening to all the shows to hear Jim's vulgarity. He says his favorite hooker calls herself Nurse and she gives him ""his medicine"" by pissing on him and spitting in his mouth.

* They can now openly talk about Howard. They hear he will be going to satellite by 2006.

* Opie recounts how he recently gave himself an enema in an attempt to gross out everybody in studio, although it doesn't sound particularly true. He insists that throughout the entire process he felt ""humilified"" 

* Bob Kelly's first appearance was on the 10/6 show

* XM commercial breaks feature tech updates in which a voiceover guy talks about near-field communication and new AT&amp;T phones that allow kids to communicate via AOL and MSN through full-keyboard phones.

* [Jim's hilarious cleft palette bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANNOI2v5aYk)

* Steve C or whoever else was running the board rejoins the show with ""A Favor House Atlantic"" by Coheed and Cambria, which makes Jim groan off-mic.

* Jimmy tells story of how he gets ""full toilet service"" and he paid $4000 for a girl to piss and shit in his mouth. He says he typically washes his mouth out with peroxide after.

* Stern announces that he is signing a five year, $500m contract with Sirius as the FCC continues to cripple the hot talk format. Opie and Anthony talk shop about the negotiations prior to joining XM, but it is very tough to determine what is real and what is made up, given that so little of what Opie says today is accurate or factual. Jim does add that he was very close to signing on to the show to be contractually a third mic but he never did, thus he never got paid like the boys did before their firing. Opie adds that Howard signed to Sirius without telling the staff and adds that he would never do that to Anthony.

* [Ant before Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4lIQlnR6ag)

* Judging by the new callers, the show has immediately become popular with truckers 

* Jimmy has started commenting on Opie's Aryan appearance and his ""luscious V""

* The 2004 MLB playoffs are heating up, and the entire room eagerly awaits the Red Sox next choke.

* Joe cumia in studio to hype up his latest song parody about SARS, played to the theme of ""Cars"" by Gary Numan.

* *Last Comic Standing* is canceled one episode before its Season 3 finale.

* Steve C introduces the Ramone production, in which the narrator shits his pants and requests “Ramone - clean this up.” It doesn't get brought up or ridiculed much though.

* *Tough Crowd* is cancelled, causing Jim to rant about how honest comedic discussion is constantly replaced by cartoon-based comedy.

* [A caller phones in looking for ""skits""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWutfclHao)

* They play tracks from *Demented World* and other bits from the internet that are terribly cringey. The show has sharply relapsed into very corny radio - [they play this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWutfclHao) and think it's great. [And this one gets played regularly too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUgl4u9F9SQ)

* Opie already hates the XM High Voltage channel name and wants to call it either Opie &amp; Anthony's Virus or the O&amp;A Virus. Jim asks why they don't just call it the Opie &amp; Anthony Channel.

* Jim refers to jerking off as 'scrapping'

* Hearing the Yankee collapse and the show's reaction to it is fantastic. It's great hearing the [entire saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSF_HbMx9PQ), and their expectations of the Red Sox failure, is amazing because of how wrong they were. 

* E-Rock gets reprimanded for showing up late and Opie tells him to go home, says his job can be replaced by interns, and says that if he were Sex Bagel's age he’d have gotten a cot and slept in studio or slept outside with the homeless to ensure he showed up on time during morning shows. The show introduces Intern Than, and Opie says he is doing great and could be Eric’s replacement if he keeps it up.

* Jimmy tells the Monster Rain story for the first time, leading Ant and Opie to tell their respective childhood stories. One of the sad things about listening to this show in hindsight is that even fairly harmless stories like Opie hiding in the apple tree to shield himself from his father talking about sex even sounds made up at worst and, at best, are completely uninteresting compared to Jim and Ant's stories.

* Hookers are in-studio and invite Jim to their place after the show. He recounts what he describes as the best escort experience he's ever had.

* Jimmy says he will be voting for John Kerry because he’s sick of the language policing via the FCC and the Republicans. What’s interesting is that they briefly talk about how Kerry isn’t much of a liberal though. It's interesting how there was a clear difference between the liberals and Democrat and conservative and Republican. 

* Bill O'Reilly is wrapped up in a sexual harassment lawsuit in which a former producer alleges that he harassed her and made sexually explicit phonecalls to her while describing how he had a dildo lodged up his ass.

* Opie claims that he was once so angry at the ""ragheads"" who were selling makeshift commemorative photos of the WTC on fire near ground zero that he roller bladed down there, flipped the entire table of photos over, and cursed out the guy selling the photos. He adds that a cop was nearby but he just let Opie do it, no big deal. Jim and Ant mock Opie for the fact that he probably had to awkwardly roller blade away from the scene like a faggot, completely deflating Opie's five-minute bullshit story.

* Opie has now fully developed his crutch of bracketing all nouns with ""the ____ thing"" i.e. I'm not a fan of ""the terrestrial radio thing"" rather than just speak concisely and saying ""I'm not a fan of terrestrial radio."" He does it constantly.

* Spaz gets through the phone screener and mysteriously gets dumped out of before he can say anything interesting.

* Jimmy references his doctor Steve, from Tennessee, who diagnoses lots of his issues remotely. He doesn't provide context to how he knows Steve.

* Ant says he can't vote for Bush because of his poor judgment and leadership in getting the US into the Iraq War 

* Ant shows no signs of worry after the Yankees lose ALCS Game 4, and he raves at how incredible it is to watch the game in new High Definition. 

* Scraping the barrel for content, they play Rodney Harrington's ""Dear Penis"" song between one break 

* Jim mocks Opie's inability to speak and there are no residual greggshells 

* President of Programming Eric Logan calls in for the first time on October 20

* Danny Ross first appears on the 10/21 show, he's living at his parents' house making no money as an intern. 

* The boys play clips of the Tony Danza show and mock the forced applause and insincere dedications and tributes Danza pays (thoughts 'n' prayers) to random do-gooders

* Ant says when he was in kintergarden a friend and him started a fire in the woods that led to the fire department showing up. A firefighter picks him up, puts a helmet on his head, and asks him if he saw what happened, and he blamed it on “two black guys.” He says something like that is definitely from his upbringing, he says those are things you are taught.

* Opie does a lot of declarative statements about the show, like ""we like to do [blank] on this show"" or ""one thing about this show is it you gotta do [this]"" but all these statements are completely pointless and out of left field.

* They mock the Ashlee Simpson hoedown on SNL.

* [Spilled my coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_L0nTj8FMg)

* Frenchie isn't funny anymore so they find replacement Frenchies before ultimately giving up on the bit entirely.

* Opie says there will be a light-skinned black President to help ease America into the idea of a non-white male in office. He says the US just is not ready for a woman yet. 

* During a discussion of sex, they ask Stalker Patti about sex terminology and ask her to describe what she thinks it might mean. She says she has to consult her ‘funk &amp; wagnalls’

* During the airing of the Red Sox first World Series win in 86 years, O&amp;A are live on another channel which is airing the *John McEnroe Show*. Both McEnroe and Opie are completely vapid.

* Ant says he finds Wackbag messsge boards to be the most critical of the show, which prompts Opie to finally acknowledge the message boards, which have been mocking him for his long-standing issue pronouncing the word [""put"" as ""bwut""](https://youtu.be/Kr3sKCOCZ2I?t=3h25m30s)

* Opie gets insecure about his speech issues, prompting an insult/attempt at a joke that results on an absolutely [colossal bomb](https://youtu.be/Kr3sKCOCZ2I?t=3h25m47s).

* Opie and Anthony complain about how the XM management aren't paying enough attention to them, which is interesting because of how, in later years, they generally regarded XM to be very supportive of them

LAST-MINUTE SUBLET SCENARIO: I am in need of a person to sublet my private room in a 3 BD/1 BA Lincoln Park apartment for the rest of June and July (June 10th - July 30th). PARKING SPACE INCLUDED!

I HAVE A 4 DAY TIME CRUNCH, I AM MOTIVATED TO FINALIZE.

I am pursuing an internship opportunity in NYC and would need to move to New York at the end of this weekend. Because I would not be out of my apartment until the tenth, rent for June would only be $575, and then rent for July would be the full $775. I will be covering most of the additional costs, I just ask for $20/mo to help with electricity, gas, and internet.

The apartment is conveniently located between the Fullerton Red/Brown/Purple Line station, and the Armitage Brown/Purple Line station. The room will be furnished with a full bed, a dresser, a desk and chair, an AC unit, and a smart TV with access to many applications (no cable though). I will fly back to move out the furniture the very last weekend of July, so you will only have to bring bedding (sheets, pillows, mattress topper, etc.), clothes, toiletries, and various decor of your choosing; you will not have to worry about moving any furniture. My roommates will be here over the summer so we ask that you make time to meet with all of us to see the apartment before agreeing to sublet.

Some additional features include:

- Dishwasher
- W/D in basement (coin operated)
- Parking spot is located behind building
- A fireplace in the bedroom
- Two windows overlooking a treelined street

Shoot me a message if you are interested and I can give you more details/send pictures!"

 - How do you approach a technical/engineering problem, and what are the first steps you will take to solve it?    
 - Does your approach change when you don't know enough on the subject?      
 - *How can I best approach a problem in order to make the most of how I process information, understand systems &amp; relationships, and visualize solutions?*      

**Background:**      
Hi all, I'm an INTJ male studying Electrical Engineering in college and I've just started my 3rd summer internship.    

I've been tasked initially with programming a Microchip (using Mplab) to accept/react to SPI commands I'll send it using LabVIEW. I know LabVIEW very well, but the only thing I've done that's similar &amp; relevant to this is monitoring I2C 2 years ago.     

One of the EE's who I'm working with is my mentor on this. He's told me that for the first week, he's gunna let me try and figure it out with minimal assistance. He's there to answer my questions, but I don't have the knowledge on the subjects in order to ask good questions, or have any idea what my next step will look like after.       

**What spurred me to create this post:**    
Earlier today I came across another issue that was essentially impassable for me: I sent a signal successfully to the Microchip, but I only got junk back. With my lack of understanding, I had no idea where to even start to debug this.     

In my mind Mplab, LabView, SPI, or any of the pin connections could have been the culprit, and I didn't have the knowledge to know where best place to start was.     
  
I got some actual help on this one, but it also took about 4 hours of me reconnecting pins, scanning code, PDFs, forums, and online examples. All I got out of it was frustration and the feeling of stupidity."

During my stay, I want to get to know the city and the people and don’t just hang around with other exchange students. Are there a language partner programs (I’ve realized that's a nice way to get in contact with locals)? Or is here anyone interested in speaking some German and showing me the city’s life? I would also like to continue learning Swedish. Any Swedes in Brisbane?

Thank you very much for any advices."
6fs7jh,1,2017-06-07,How do I [20/f] know if to stay with bf (20/m) of 4 years?,throwaway14154,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6fs7jh/how_do_i_20f_know_if_to_stay_with_bf_20m_of_4/,"So I’ll start off with a little background. I’ve been with my boyfriend since my sophomore year of high school. We recently have gone to off to college in separate states. It’s not a huge distance around 350 miles meaning it’s about a 7 hour drive from my school to his. Previously I had been living with him at his parents house while he took a gap year. I was kicked out of my mom’s house the middle of my senior year (her and I have a very rocky relationship). My bf’s parents were very kind and offered for me to live with them until I went to college in August. He was taking a gap year at the time so we basically lived together the entire Summer. During this time he was very depressed, it was a personal issue that caused it but it was the reason he took the gap year. He refused medication or any kind of therapy and chose to deal with it on his own. Some of the symptoms were very problematic to our relationship, he was moody and would take anger out on me for no reason. He also had no sex drive whatsoever which left me very unsatisfied and feeling hurt most of the time. 
Once school started he perked back up but the distance was hard. It was made harder this last quarter by the fact he was rushing and I had an internship and a job on top of school. I feel like the last two times we’ve seen each other have been pitiful. He spends most of his time on his phone and I am constantly nagging him to give me attention or spend time with me. The sex has been awful, he finally wants to have sex again which is a relief but he lasts maybe two minutes if I’m lucky. So overall I’ve been pretty unhappy in the relationship. I expressed this to him and even questioned if he still loved me and he started crying saying yes he did. So I told him things need to change I needed more of his time and I needed to feel loved, also he had to try to do more sexually. He agreed to all this. I asked if there was anything I was doing wrong and he said no so now he’s just working on fixing the problems. I’m going to give us the Summer to patch things up but what I’m wondering is will this keep happening? Is this just a rut? How will I know when it’s time to leave? Thank you for taking the time to read this I just feel so confused right now.

6fsuuj,1,2017-06-07,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6fsuuj/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
6ft3pl,1,2017-06-07,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6ft3pl/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
6ftpyj,191,2017-06-07,"I (22f) am staying at my parents (46F, 48M) house for the summer and my mom's nosiness is driving me nuts. Is she pushing boundaries or should I be more respectful in their home?",unicyclebuddy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ftpyj/i_22f_am_staying_at_my_parents_46f_48m_house_for/,"Just need an outsider opinion to know if I'm out of line and being disrespectful in my parents home.. 

Before I go back to school to start my masters, I am living at home with my parents for the summer. I was originally planning on staying in the city I go to school, but they made it sound like it would be fun to come visit before starting more school. I was also able to get transferred at work to a location here for the summer. 

I've been here for a month, though, and near losing my mind with how nosy my mom is. I go out, she wants a play by play of who I'm with and when I'll be back. She'll pick up receipts on my desk and question me on why I'm buying certain things. She decides to clean my (not messy) room on her own and will yell at me for things she found. She said she was cleaning in a drawer (where I happened to have a vibrator) and she lost her shit even though she cleaned without my permission. 

I feel like if I was using her car she would be entitled to know where I was going. Or if I was spending her money she would be entitled to know how I was spending it. But I'm not. I even offered to pay them rent this summer but they refused to take the money, so I feel as though she feels entitled to be in the loop about everything I have going on. 

The final straw was today: I bought a bike a week ago and spent like 400/500 on it. When I came home with the bike, she asked how much it was. I said around 400 or so (it was such a good deal, I was originally going in to buy it at full price which was like 1200 dollars and was so stoked it was on sale I didn't even care). 

She just called me frantic because she found the receipt on the front table and cannot believe I ""lied"" to her, because the bike was 599. she started screaming at me for spending 600 dollars (of my own well earned money), because I told her it was 400 or something. While I was at my internship I have to get a phone call from my mom screaming at me. I told her it was highly inappropriate to call me while I was at work to yell at me for something so silly. She thinks I'm a liar. 

Am I out of line or do I have to establish some boundaries with my mom?

TL;DR: Nosy mom driving me crazy while I'm home for the summer.

6fuess,9,2017-06-07,Person at work,standardissuehuman1,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/6fuess/person_at_work/,"Wondering if this issue might be relevant to anyone: I am a middle manager at a large, well known company. One of my direct reports has been driving me a bit nuts, and I'm wondering if there could be rbb issues at play. This person doesn't have bpd (or doesn't seem like it to me--she has ptsd and so there's a lot of emotional vulnerability--but none of the meanness/rage). but is a trauma survivor and a lot of what she does reminds me of situations with my mother.

- She doesn't realize it, but she brings up frequently various events in her life that have traumatized her--like, around the water cooler. (This sounds like a bad lack of boundaries, but for context: there is a core group in our department who know each other very well--have been to each other's weddings and baptisms and spent time together extensively outside work, sometimes even traveled together. She shares only when members of this core group are around, not with random interns.) I'm glad she trusts us with this information, but she does it in a way that reminds me a lot of my mother's ""pain olympics"" tendencies. She'll even make comments about how nobody at the company ""gets"" what she's been through--and who knows, maybe we don't. But I dk, when she goes down that route, I see red and my blood pressure goes through the roof.

- she's much younger than my mother but older than me, and started with the company before I did--and yet I'm her manager. Which reminds me a lot of the dynamic with my mother, where I was /am in charge, and my mother needed my leadership, but she also resented me for it. This employee has never expressed resentment, but I feel like anyone would be a little miffed to report to someone younger/less experienced.

- The employee has issues with a particular person in the department. This person is a known bitch, to be fair. Everyone in the company practically has had problems with her. The problem is that she's so damn good at what she does, we can't fire her. And if you get to know her, she's actually a big softie underneath a tough veneer. But this person (not my direct report--someone higher up than both me and my employee in the organization) triggers the shit out of my employee's ptsd--by being very aggressive. My employee freezes up like a deer in headlights, and agrees to whatever she says, even if it makes no sense. This is obviously a tough situation, and I'm supposed to help my employee deal with it because I'm her manager. But my employee doesn't want this person to know about her ptsd...ugh. So I end up with a lot of meetings where my employee is crying at my desk, but refusing my offers to help. And not to mention that I'M feeling triggered AF dealing with her, so I'm feeling like I have to rescue her, protect her from this mean bitch lady...like I go into ""I'm 100% responsible for your feelings "" mode. We're like the blind leading the blind. It's kind of a shitshow, tbh.

Any advice for how to deal with this? I don't want my personal issues to get in the way of being a good manager to this employee, who I like and want to succeed. "

6fuv0g,7,2017-06-07,Future Anxiety,khharagosh,ADHD_Programmers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/6fuv0g/future_anxiety/,"I'm really worried that my unfocused nature has really jeopardized my future. I'm entering my last year of college, but I have only had one internship (my current one) that incorporates coding, and I'm still figuring out how useful it will be (because of bureaucracy issues, I'm spending a lot of time sitting around). First internship I had turned out to be totally useless. I'm not the kind of person who instinctively comes home and fiddles on GitHub all day, because I get distracted by other interests. God, I want to be, but I just can't get into it past brief moments of determination. I just don't know how to start. 

I just feel so behind. It feels like all of my peers have had at least two better internships than me, have gone through the intensive computer science interviewing process of the private sector. It feels like they all joined coding-related clubs in their first year, while I'm in a political club and an a capella group. Taking on a new activity won't help because I already feel overwhelmed time-wise, and it's too late--job hunt starts less than two months into the school year. I have pretty good grades, but employers made it clear to me that they really don't care all that much about that. 

I like programming, I really do, but I also like other things and enjoy spending time on them--something that I've heard will only hold me back when I'm competing with people who revolve their lives around programming. Hell, I'm not just a computer science major--also an art major, and I have the same anxieties that I am too mediocre of an artist to ever use it. I am terrified that no one will want me after I graduate if every other student from my school has two internships at Microsoft under their belt. I read an article by a programmer who described himself to be more like me, and all the comments told him to leave the profession because he clearly doesn't care enough to be good enough. Hell, I don't even think I know what I want to do. Web design? App design? Analytics? Animation??? Do I want to go to grad school? Cause if I do, great, now I also have to find time to study for the GRE! At this point, I don't know if I was ever smart enough to be good at computer science and if this major was a mistake.

I don't know if I'm looking for advice or assurance, but anything would be appreciated. "

6fvz6e,0,2017-06-07,[CAN] Best career path for top students?,Topstudent19,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6fvz6e/can_best_career_path_for_top_students/,"Hey guys, looking for some advice.

About me:
Student in a major Canadian city, studying accounting. Perfect GPA through 2 years of uni, and treasurer of a smaller student club. Two summers of experience as a finance intern in a large private company, working on projects with high level finance people such as the CFO and fp&amp;a director.

Career path 1:

Initially, the career path I was considering was to make it into a big 4, do 5-6 years audit until manager, before exiting to an assistant to controller role or similar in industry. Eventually, I would like to grow into a cfo (small company), controller, or other senior management role.

Concerns:After doing much reading on this subreddit, it seems like audit is less interesting, has lower pay, and worse hours than something like advisory.

I'm not sure if I will be able to put up with that combination for 5/6 years. I find that I do tend to get bored of simple tasks easily - I'm already bored of the fp&amp;a tasks I have to do every month, only a few months in. This makes it hard for me up motivate myself and I take longer to complete tasks. It seems to me like exiting audit before manager slows your career growth down a bit, which is something I'd like to avoid.

Other options:

Big 4 advisory - this seems like a more interesting area compared to audit, but I'm not too knowledgeable about the exit opportunities. A lot seem to be finance focused, like investment banking or similar, and I simply don't want those hours. Others seem to be internet audit focused, which again I think would be a little boring for me as a career.

Pursuing an FLDP - these seem interesting, but again, I don't know too much about them. Is career growth similar to big 4, if I want to reach those controller/ cfo/ director roles? Many positions at that level seem to ask/prefer big 4 experience - will the FLDP put me in a worse spot?

Other details/questions:

In general, hoping to have a career where I can work hard in my 20's in order to have a more normal, upper middle class life in my 30s. I'd like to earn somewhere around $150-175k total comp by 40, working 50 hours a week or less.

Are there industries in which this is more common? Similarly, are there industries in big 4 that tend to reliably have more normal hours?"
6fw0kt,3,2017-06-07,Absolutely confused about how to plan computer science internship program and what to expect for jobs after graduation...,silentphotographer,UCalgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCalgary/comments/6fw0kt/absolutely_confused_about_how_to_plan_computer/,"I know there is no such thing as a specific blueprint (such thought is hubris in computer science as the whole point of the program is to know how the rules work so that we can play with them as we see fit), but I couldn't find a good guide that helps with bunch of questions I have about the major. 

Ideally I could freeze time and spend my lottery money and take all the courses, but that's not happening (I wonder if it's possible to harass the profs for notes, and I'll do it at my own time outside of work hours). 

I'm about to wrap up my 2nd year, and will be taking bunch of 400 and 500 courses. My main focus is to meet the requirement for internship program so that I can get into it by the time by May (if I'm lucky enough to get hired. Not sure how competitive it is especially when I know there are couple of people I know I have zero chance against rip).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apart from CPSC 449 (Which I'll probably take during fall semester or winter... probably fall unless someone wanna voice against that), I'm good. But there are more courses I need to finish, specifically 400+ courses.

There are 12 400 level courses (minus two required for intern program as I need them anyway). There even more courses in 500 level. Let's not forget 600 and 700 courses that sounds super interesting but skeptical as to when it's offered and if that's even something an avg programmer can survive. Some do look awfully interesting though.

How do you choose? Do you harass the professors and squeeze out more info one by one? Do compsci adviser have a good experience in answering questions like this? (I hear they merely clarify or spell out what is needed if I have a specific goal, but not sure about helping them to decide what goal is what I want). I was encouraged to avoid choosing a concentration (unless you already knew what you wanted exactly... I'm not as fortunate unfortunately).  Do I really just randomly pick courses that intrigue me based on a paragraph of description on the course? (Imagine investing/trading like that in real world, and your savings will quickly hit 0 or worse). Bugging every professors seem like a daunting but doable task, but how much can professors help me really? They teach the course so they can tell me as much as they can in terms of content. But how do I decide whether that's fit for me? Will I be even mature enough to make that call wisely? Do i just shotgun my choice and hope that some courses I took will be useful in the industry, whatever it may be?

Should I just try emailing/booking appointment with my potential employers (their HR maybe... or insist on talking to actual senior staffs involved with the project) and plan from there? 

I'm not a brilliant student; I found taking 3 courses at MRU (all computer science courses) pretty difficult. I managed to do well, but I'd hate to think the level of workload involved if I chose 5 hard computer courses at the same time. I wanna say 3 to be safe (maybe 4). Or maybe I could take 3-4 and trespass other courses and steal notes/assignments from students/professors?

I have little need for options, as I have them all already. 

It's not a very concrete or specific question, but I can see a lot of people (especially people who didn't get intrigued about programming when they were very young) who could feel puzzled about what to do after all the courses you need are done. Some useful answers and insights will be appreciated, thanks.

I was also recommended to take some more challenging abstract math courses (I'm terrible at them). Being able to construct complex and abstract algorithm is a powerful arsenal that any serious compsci industry players should have... or so I'm told.

6fw4w7,3,2017-06-07,Thinking of going back to school just to take an internship. Is this a bad idea?,JWoelle,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6fw4w7/thinking_of_going_back_to_school_just_to_take_an/,"Last year I graduated a semester earlier than anticipated and have since been living with my parents and working as a janitor despite having a BS in Film and Video Production.  I’ve begun to realize this was a horrible mistake as I lack much of the experience and portfolio pieces that my former classmates (now competitors) graduated with.  As a result, finding a job has been damn near impossible. I’ve tried pulling myself by my bootstraps and freelancing, but clients simply laugh at my inexperience and amateur reel.  My hometown is too economically and culturally depressed to offer any way to gain experience here and the closest economic bastions, such as the city where I went to school, are too far away to commute from my parent’s house to.  If I got a full time job in an unrelated field I would be able to afford to move out, but not be able to commit to an internship as a flexible schedule is a strict requirement for film/video work.  If I worked part time, I could intern, but if that internship is unpaid I would not be able to support myself.  Paid internships are too rare and competitive for them to be a realistic option.  I’m considering going back to school for one more semester so I can take a couple critical classes and get an unpaid internship.  I really want money coming INTO my bank account rather than spending more, but I am so miserable and demoralized that it feels like my only hope.  


I have been fortunate to only have federal loans and I currently owe $22.3k in debt with an interest rate of 4.1% (both of which are far below the national average).  If I went back to school full time for one more semester, I would owe the government an extra $5k (if I got approved).  This would include tuition, fees, and housing.  All other expenses I could afford If my current job transferred me to the city where my school is and kept my pay at $11/hr (what it is now).  If I did this, in a worst-case scenario situation, I will have gained nothing valuable and will be forced to move back home and start where I am now; only this time I owe $27.3k in debt which I am unlikely to pay off as a janitor (or similar low wage job).  In a best-case scenario, I would secure a job or paid internship after the semester and begin my career as a digital media professional and will have the means to pay off my debt.  The likelihood of the latter situation is still incredibly slim as I’ll only have 12 weeks to become worthy of a junior position or paid internship at a company.  On the other hand, I originally went to school prepared to graduate with at least $30k in debt anyway regardless of my career path.  


Ultimately, housing and maybe groceries are the only expenses I cannot afford with my current income, so if there is a way to cover those things while I intern and work part time, my crisis will be solved.  I don’t have any friends that would let me crash on their couch long term.  If you know of any solutions, please let me know.  I deeply appreciate your feedback.

Next year we are entering the hospital as a trainee intern and I was wondering what information to focus on retaining.

We study medicine in block modules, so last year we did psyc med, MSK, CVS, respiratory, GI (+liver and stuff)
The thing is, last year I had a really tough year in my life and in the end all I was able to do is mass cram basic information into my head for the final exam, so I feel like my knowledge of all those topics is lacking in depth.

I want to know what is important for me to revise now for future practice that I actually need.

From my assumption, pharm would be good to know? Pathophysiology? But to what depth? My anatomy especially is very shaky, should I brush up on MSK and such?

Thanks for reading, I'm just a little worried that my year of poor learning will come back to bite me in the future and I'll have to learn things that should be relearning. Replies very appreciated! :)"
6fw6p7,1,2017-06-07,Will my firm care?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6fw6p7/will_my_firm_care/,"I completed an audit internship with a top 10 accounting firm during the spring semester (2015) of my junior year and received an offer, which I accepted. At that time I said I would begin working with them two and a half years later in the fall (2017). After I graduated I immediately moved to a different city and did an internal audit internship there last summer (2016). Since then I took online courses to get 150 and have been studying for the cpa since January. I haven't passed any yet and I begin work in early September. 

Like most, I didn't fall in love with audit so I wanted to explore internal audit to see if I liked it more, which I didn't. It was a good experience though. I am slightly nervous about starting and having people ask me why I took another internship while I already had a job offer with their company as well as if I begin work with not having passed a section with 9 months to study for them (even though I was not studying for all 9 months for personal reasons). Not to mention I took the cheap, easy classes to get 150 instead of a masters.

For those who work at the bigger firms, do you think I have anything to be nervous about or is it all in my head?

Invest?,zombiesofthenight,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6fwetf/young_adult_couplewith_no_debt_and_stream_of/,"Hi, my boyfriend and I have no student debt and are a senior and second semester junior, respectively, in college with promising internships that have both requested us to stay after the summer is over. 

Regardless of how long the jobs last, we have our own savings accounts with around $2000 each and currently have no debts. We want to keep our own accounts but we also want to start a bank account together. 

Before the red flags spring up in your mind, know that we are going to match every thing we put in. So if we put $300 a week, it would be $600 total. This is to prevent any issue should we ever break up, it can be split evenly. 

What's the best banking option for us? We are going to make around $10-15k this summer and looks like we are going to be part time during the school year. I've heard controversy around every single major bank and was wondering if someone could suggest a solid option for us

We want savings because our parents are both paying for rent and groceries and our cars are already paid off but eventually, and within a year or two, we will be on our own financially. 

Should we invest? Together? Separately? 

We want a joint bank account for ease for things we share like groceries. We also want a larger national one because we probably won't live in our college town for too long after graduation, but that is unknown obviously. 

Thank you in advance. "
6fwoyf,3,2017-06-07,My [20 M] girlfriend's [20 F] unhappiness in her life is affecting our relationship.,DavidKnee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6fwoyf/my_20_m_girlfriends_20_f_unhappiness_in_her_life/,"CONTEXT:
-
-
-
My girlfriend and I have been dating long distance for around 6 months (we'll be reunited in about a year) now and things have more or less been great. There have been occasional rough patches but we've figured out how to communicate and live our own lives efficiently while still fitting some time for each other. 

In the past, we were concerned if our past grad lives kept us apart if our relationship was sustainable, but A.) we've learned to be very independent but still feel close (due to courseload, we often talk not much at all for the week and have one call on the weekend) and B.)we figured we'll cross the bridge if/when we get to it (totally possible we live in similar places).

We go to school on opposite sides of the world, but the summer has made our time zones even more inconvenient. This in addition to our internships has made it much harder to communicate and even harder to communicate spontaneously (there are specific hours contact can occur now).

 I figured summer would be tough and require transition but its been really hard. Ever since our internships have started she hasn't been happy. Her internship is in a place where she doesn't really have any friends and her work is really demanding so she's really tired. On top of that she's had some family stuff that's happened recently. 


PROBLEM:
-
-
-
Recently she's been really negative about us and our future. She feels like our relationship may not have a point because of the difficulty of working across the globe. She says she loves me but doesn't know if there's a point. She's also been feeling distant lately as we haven't been able to call much. 

These concerns are definitely valid, but they're problems we've addresssed and moved on from already. Our relationship hasn't changed at all, but now she's in a worse place emotionally and she's viewing everything from the worst possible light. I can do something about the feeling distant, I can call more often and do small things, but I can't make her outlook more positive. 

TL;DR My long distance gf is having a hard time rn and because of it old problems are resurfacing and she's losing hope. I try to be reassuring and optimistic and show her that we've already dealt with these things before but I can't pull her out of this negativity spiral. It's beginning to affect me and make me anxious as well. She's really special to me (I sound like such a kid), but it's hard to always be calming her doubts especially when they're a product of her surroundings (or at least that's what I believe).

I appreciate responses! I want to help her but I don't know how."

I'm and MD in IM and this this is the only medical sub I hang out in. But if anyone knows of a sub better suited for this question, please let me know.

I was driving home today with my family when we came upon a car accident. As required by law (in the country where we reside) and morals, I got out to see if anyone was hurt. There were two cars involved. One was a van with an off-duty police officer and his dog. The guy was conscious, able to walk around (told him to lie down) and organizing help. 

The other car was a smaller car that was completely destroyed. As I got closer, I saw the driver lying on the front seats. 
In the countries that I lived and worked in, it is customary that MDs are sent out to severe accidents, so during internship, I had to accompany a few calls to observe for training (before I went into IM and didn't pursue emergency medicine)  and I've seen a share of car accidents, but this was ..... really really bad. The hood of the car was almost obliterated. The accident had just happened and the parts of the engine that were still around where fuming. There was gasoline everywhere. I and some others carefully approached the car to asses the situation and the driver was unconscious, weak pulse, no resp. He was stuck in the car spread on the both front seats (the back of the driver's seat being unhinged and somehow on top of the guy) and his neck was twisted in a very unnatural way (as were his visible extremities) like there was an unnatural angle at around C7. Other than that not much blood visible. 

I made sure someone called the emergency services and gave the necessary information. Then I sent bystanders to secure the road and spread out to the incoming cars to ask for fire extinguishers and any kind of rescue material (cloves, mask, whatever). There were two off-duty EMTs and we all came to the conclusion that without any means to put out a potential fire, it was too risky to get into the car and start any kind of resuscitation. 

I made sure the the guy in the other car was stable and taken care of, then we waited for the fire department. 
Once they had arrived and secured the scene, the ambulance got there as well and resuscitation was started (patient had no more pulse. The patient was evacuated from the car with a spine board and a lot of manpower, and then -later on -declared dead after failed resuscitation efforts. From what I could see, he probably had a c-spine injury, several broken limbs, probably damage to the pelvis and obviously trauma to thorax and abdomen. 

So, as I said, being in IM, I'm obviously not trained in the evacuation or on-site handling of patients with severe poly-trauma. 
I realise that the situation was dire to begin with. And before emergency services got there, we had no useful rescue material. 

I still feel so completely useless. I remembered being trained to not approach an accident if the scene is not safe. And I don't know much about cars in accidents but with all the fuming going on and the whole scene being drenched in gasoline, it just seemed risky to get into the car and start CPR. 

Should we have started CPR earlier. 
We estimated the risk too high and the chance of survival for the guy too low to get into a dangerous situation. But maybe I'm just a whiny wuss a d trying to justify my inaction? 
Was there anything we could have done differently? 

Also any advice on where to read up on how to be more useful next time? I already decided to get a fire extinguisher and ambu mask and maybe c-collar for our car (so far we only had gloves and bandages) Anything else I should think of? 

Thanks for any advice. "
6fx7q3,1,2017-06-07,Leaving/Switching Research Internship (xpost from r/advice),desiboy545,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/6fx7q3/leavingswitching_research_internship_xpost_from/,"TL, DR: Want to try to switch my role at or leave my research internship for another but unsure whether it would be a wise move.

I am in an informal internship right now doing research with a professor at a local university. I started last week and as of right now, I am set to work until the end of July/beginning of August - I am unpaid so the dates are flexible). To be honest, without getting into too much detail, the work involved is not particularly interesting to me. I also don't really think I will do this type of work in the future (I anticipated doing different kind of work that would be useful for me in the future). The professor isn't mean per se, but she does seem to get annoyed fairly easily. I only got this opportunity because of a past experience with another professor in the same university who I had a good experience working with and who gave me a good recommendation for this professor. As a result, I think this professor also assumes I know more than I do/am smarter than I actually am, which probably contributes to her annoyance, although I have been honest in telling her what I know and don't know. Right now, she is training me and having me do a lot of housekeeping/busy work rather than what I anticipated doing. So altogether, I don't really see myself doing much productive, since I am only here for a few weeks, or being able to get any sort of strong recommendation from her (due to the short time and her presumed lackluster impression of me now).

The thing is, this professor does have a couple of projects that do interest me. In fact, I contacted her because of those projects; the one that she put me on wasn't on her website. Although I mentioned those projects when I emailed her, she only mentioned needing help on the project that I am currently on but presented it in a different way (it might be my fault for misunderstanding). I was thinking that I could maybe ask her about switching to one of these other projects. I have even less experience with those projects which is why she probably gave me this project instead. However, I am thinking that I could ask her to maybe just let me shadow/watch these experiments being conducted as this would at least provide me with some valuable experience. The issue with this is of course that I couldn't really include such a thing on a resume and the professor would likely be mad that I never mentioned this to her during our first meeting.

Otherwise, although it might be a bit late, I was thinking of just leaving her lab and trying to find another lab at the same university that is more interesting to me or that could teach me more useful skills in the long-term. The issues here are that it would look bad on my old professor who gave me a positive recommendation. This professor also mentioned that she made an exception taking me so late, so I would feel bad to leave after her saying that. Plus, the department I am interested in isn't that big, so if I did find another professor, it's likely that he or she would talk to my current professor. And finally, it may be hard to find another lab open so late. I am actually taking the MCAT at the very end of August, so having more study time wouldn't be the worst, but I know my parents would be super pissed if I end up doing absolutely nothing this summer other than studying.

I'm just really confused and stressed out and unsure about what to do. I just want to make a decision sooner rather than later and waste as little of my time and my professor's time as possible.

Thanks to anyone who read through that whole wall of text! And thanks for any advice!"

I dropped out of the masters. Too theoretical at this point, and it isn't helping me make money. I wanted to get something out of it, so Ive made friend with a few of the others student who coincidently: also decided to leave.

Met with a prospective client yesterday. He wants an App made.
An old friend hooked me up, and Ive heard that up to 50k may be offered. Im highly doubtful.
The client offered 2 choices:

1.Be paid - Client and contractor relationship 

2.Be paid much much less - ""Partnership"" that will lead to *milllllions!*
  
Ive been down that road before.


Upon stalking, the clients family has many successful restaurants and is quiet wealthy. That being said, lessons I have learn from the past:

-Wealthy clients are not generous without reason

-Wealthy client didn't get wealthy by spending recklessly

-Wealthy clients try whatever they can to save money

-Just because a client is wealthy, doesn't mean this venture will be successful.

Id rather just be paid.

But man, I was so touched.
At college, even before I started lecturing people know me. Know my name. 

People say ""hello Van!"" I dont even know them. They remember me from past events that I went to representing our company. 
It really makes me happy that maybe just a tiny bit, people believe in us. That we're a thing.

I reflect on the past and I think about where I am now. I was rich (comparatively). 

I was making 75k in my old lecturing job. Miserable. I quit. 

I was making 40k in my Game Dev job. Yearning for freedom. I quit.

Every day I would keep track of where I was spending time. Hour after hour. I repeated the same thing. Doing endless work, for a pointless system, to make someone else rich. 
I'm poor as all fuck now.
But I'm liberated. I'm free. 
I want to live a life where I have don't have faith in systems. I have faith in me.

6fy1e7,2,2017-06-07,Overwhelmed by thoughts of death...really starting to piss me off,mulatto_hoe,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6fy1e7/overwhelmed_by_thoughts_of_deathreally_starting/,"Since the very end of April this year I've been consumed by thoughts of my death, even if peaceful and 80 years from now (they started up around my 20th birthday). Grew up a Catholic but have been an atheist since high school, and at any rate, eternal ""life"" sounds just as shitty as suddenly not existing. 


It's gotten a bit better since I got home from college but there are times (pretty much exclusively in the late afternoon and night) were I start getting consumed by these thoughts. As I don't have a summer job this year I have plenty of free time and no matter what I do my mind always wanders to these things. Few things give me pleasure any more. I used to listen to music all the time to cheer myself up or get pumped up but it barely has any effect on me anymore -- even awesome songs that I always have loved. Playing a video game (e.g. GTA V) that always made me stupidly happy ends up with my character crashing on the road and dying because I zone out thinking about death. I'm also an athlete, I've been rowing for 2 years and running for 6, and I have to put in serious mileage all the time to keep in shape. While I am, I no longer take pleasure in it. The massive endorphin rushes I'd get after a nice hard row or run just don't happen anymore. I used to work out at night a lot in the summer but now I can't because I'm depressed and tired afterward instead of excited and buzzing with energy. It's like I don't have any reward system in my brain anymore. And this is bad as it all started at the end of my season this year where I was stroke seat of my boat (everyone paces off me) and I'd suddenly have these thoughts of incredible loneliness and existential dread on the water, during high intensity pieces, which is TERRIBLE for my crew. But I never told anyone as it was the last 2 weeks anyway. 


I've had these thoughts like this before but I was always like ""don't worry about it."" Now they are constantly recurring and gnawing at me and really hurting everything I do. I went to a couple parties at the end of the school year and couldn't get myself to drink much alcohol. It wasn't doing anything for me and my normally sociable self just wanted to go home and sleep. And speaking of sleep I'm now purposefully going to bed extra late so I'm super tired and can't think at night, just sleep, and generally with music playing or a YouTube video in the background to keep my mind on other things as I fall asleep. 


I live a comfortable and successful life, always have. I was a bit dejected after not getting into colleges I really felt I should have but I still go to a very reputable place and have fun there, for the most part. I was always a bit dejected about the social life there and the fact that I've never had a girlfriend but I always told myself don't worry about it. I'm sure some of this is now gnawing at me and manifesting itself in this fear of death - the lack of a female S.O., dissatisfaction with my major (chemical engineering), not the best social life at school, and my grades are not as good as they once were (and it's engineering and my GPA is still good) .. I keep telling myself these are all stupid things. There are people in terrible situations all over the world and I'm depressed about not meeting a nice girl or not being the smartest in my class or not getting a summer internship -- first world problems imo. But I can't stop the death thoughts and I really think they are all coming from that....


Wow this post is super long. I just needed to write this out. I don't know if anyone wants to give advice besides ""see a shrink"" etc but anything is welcome, if you read all this. 


I am trying to solve these problems myself by: 
- Teaching myself some anatomy &amp; physiology, and now psychology, this summer because I want to apply to med school next year instead of continuing with engineering. I want to be more directly involved with people. When I'm cooped up I'm unhappy; when I'm with people, I'm happy. And I think it will be more impactful on society. 


-Signing up for a gym membership -- might meet some more people and give me something to do. While I row between 70-90km a week, it's by myself on a rowing machine at my place, and my only way to pass the time for the slow, long workouts is music, which again, isn't giving me much joy. Not even my old jumpy 80s playlists. 


-Trying meditation or yoga (yoga I have done before and it also helps with flexibility for crew). 


-Teaching myself more Italian (I am going on study abroad to Venice this year...like I really have it all, wtf am I so dejected about.) 


-Going back to school willing to actually make moves on girls because so many guys are shocked when they find out I'm a virgin...all my friends really like me and say I'm hilarious and very good looking. Some people even say I should question my sexuality (I don't). So I think I'm just shy when it comes to sexual advances, which I don't honestly think is a bad thing.  I had this really strong crush on a girl a year under me in the fall and the sensation I felt those weeks was so incredible. I was so fucking happy seeing and talking to her but she was a freshie who I barely saw since she lived in the dorms and was already with this other kid. If I could replicate that feeling it would be the cure for this, I swear it. 


I've considered returning to religion as I've always considered myself more on the agnostic side (whether theist or atheist can't truly say). But it wouldn't be genuine. I had a very strong education in philosophy and Catholic theology too so I've had plenty of time to think about these things. And at any rate thinking about that kind of stuff makes me depressed (like when I went to the Easter Vigil with my family I was really dejected this year...around the time when it all started).


And I've really tried to stop these thoughts. A classmate of mine from high school recently died after he got lost in the woods after a party. Went to a great uni, very smart and successful kid as well as athlete. As if that wasn't motivation enough for me to live in the moment and count my blessings. But it hasn't helped at all."

6fyamv,4,2017-06-07,Finally addressing the problem,30million,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6fyamv/finally_addressing_the_problem/,"I have an addictive personality.

When I was in middle school I could spend 18 hours straight playing World of Warcraft. In high school I played a lot of video games and read a lot of fiction instead of doing my homework; ending up pulling all-nighters for work that I had plenty of time to do. In college I started smoking herb and have been smoking almost every day for the past 3 years. It's always just one more hour, just one more chapter, just one hit.

Another issue is that I have always had social anxiety and issues with self-confidence. I craved attention from the popular kids and cute girls, and when I didn't get it, I became bitter and even more isolated.

I'm lucky enough to have been blessed with some intelligence and proper education, so at least my career goals are on track. However, even though I am now slightly better at socializing, my bitterness over not being accepted remains.

A final problem to top it off is that my sex drive has plummeted. I used to be horny almost every waking moment, deriving amazingly euphoric pleasure from masturbation. Now it's just something I do out of habit when I'm bored or want to fall asleep. It's not exciting, it doesn't feel that great, and it leaves me disappointed. My pleasure derived from sex has also drastically decreased. My first sexual experiences (At 16 years old, I am now 20) were so amazing that I still think of them daily. While I have had many more in college, they have just not been the same.

I blame this on a few things. The first is of course that things are more exciting when they are new, and perhaps I remember my experiences being better than they actually were. The second is that I had a girlfriend at 16, whereas all of my sexual experiences in college have been casual, and I had no feelings for the girls I hooked up with. The third is the herb. I know it decreases testosterone and it also reduces the motivation to do anything including going out and meeting girls. Plus, I have masturbated a lot while high, which has probably majorly screwed with the dopamine receptors involved. Finally, and most importantly, I blame antidepressants. In freshman year at 18, I was prescribed Zoloft for anxiety and depression. At that point I had been smoking for almost a year but my sex drive was still as high as ever. As soon as the medicine kicked in, my sex drive and pleasure from masturbation disappeared entirely. After 6 weeks, I quit cold turkey. I told my therapist at the time that I could learn to deal with life without the assistance of drugs, but in reality, I was self-medicating with herb, which I still believe is a better alternative despite the negative side effects. Since then, my sex drive has returned somewhat, but never to the same levels as before. It’s time for a reboot.

I go to a very stressful college so I’ve always had an excuse for why now was the wrong time to quit. I have also spent summers on campus, so access to herb has remained steady. This summer is different as I am staying home and doing an internship nearby. While I still have access to herb, I am not around any influential friends and I am discouraged from doing it as my parents do not approve of my smoking. I’ve decided to take this summer to improve my physical and mental health. I’m starting slow by changing my diet, removing processed foods. This is now my fourth day without smoking and second day without masturbating, and I’d like to quit both cold turkey for at least 90 days. I know it’s going to be really tough, so that’s why I’ve decided to join this site. I feel like if I write it out every time I have a craving, it might help me resist.

I’ve done nofap before for about 2 weeks just to try it. I didn’t get any “superpowers”, though I may have experienced slightly more energy. The main outcome was that I was even more horny than usual, which was not good as at this point in my life my hormones were still raging strong.  Now however, I think I have more to gain from it.

I know this is not a place to talk about drugs, so I will try to mainly focus on my PMO abstinence in my future posts. However my main goal is to quit smoking while my secondary goals are to quit PMO and eat healthier. Hopefully the results will be reduced anxiety, greater pleasure from sex, more energy and motivation, and a generally less pessimistic outlook on life.

We’ll see how this goes. Wish me luck."

However basically all of the assignments and projects I did were terminal programs except for a website I made using python and Django for one class, so going to anything outside of that is kind of intimidating and I don't really know how to get started.

I'm also learning JavaScript for my internship right now and I've read that some mods can be created with that as well? 

If any experienced mod devs could share their thoughts and any advice for how I can get started, it would be greatly appreciated as it has always been something I've wanted to do."

Current Rating: 7.46

My Personal Rating: 9/10


Genres: Music, Comedy 

Status : Still Airing! April 2016 - Present

Episode Length: 1 min


 
---

**Introduction** 

Aggressive Retusko, in my very personal opinion, is the best anime short out there. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly- including works like Sushi Police and Bananya. Whereas other anime shorts feel very superficial, very unnecessary, and usually a waste of time: Aggressive Retsuko delivers a rather unique concept and maintains a high quality even within its 1 min per episode timeframe. 


The thing with Aggressive Retsuko is that its just pure... good. There is no filler, there is no boring 20 episode character development, its just all *good*. From start to finish you will be entertained, you will laugh, you will relate, and you will be addicted to watch more episodes. 

**The Premise** 

Retsuko is an adorable little red panda (is that not reason enough to watch the show?) who is in her mid 20's and works at a typical run of the mill office job. The show is about her daily inconveniences and frustrations working in the office and throughout her life in general. On the surface this seems like the stupidest concept ever. Who would watch an anime of the daily life of an accountant? But the show takes a humorous take on life's everyday misfortunes. Whenever Retsuko gets ticked off past her limit- she breaks out into death metal in order to relieve her stress and take out her frustrations. That's right. This show is about a middle aged female red panda that breaks out into death metal. 




**The Execution** 

 Aggressive Retsuko manages to follow a basic formula without getting stale. The general formula is: Show Retsuko, Retsuko gets pissed off about something, Death Metal, Conclusion. There are some episode variations to this formula (I won't spoil which) but in general you can expect every episode to be the same. But the subject matter of each episode varies and with its cute style and entertaining main lead- you never get bored of it and even with its now 59 aired episodes its easy to relate to every episode and appreciate it for what it is. Just to give an example, one episode Retsuko gets irritated at a coworker who complains about themselves looking for praise from Retsuko. I'm sure most of us have encountered people like this and its just fun to watch Retsuko break out into death metal over something that many of us get frustrated about too. 

**The Verdict**

I often find myself watching Aggressive Retsuko when I feel stressed out. Either about general life issues (finances, worrying about the future, whatever) or about school and work specifically. I think this show is easy to appreciate, even if you aren't working a boring desk job like Retsuko is (though ever since I started my internship I feel myself slowing becoming more and more like Retsuko). 

At the very least you should give this show a try, episodes are just a minute long. You don't have much to lose by giving it a shot. I don't believe this show is available on any legal streaming services- but its not that hard to find if are willing to search for it. I also believe some episodes are on youtube- not sure if they are ""official"" or not. I am stunned to see this show be as unpopular as it is. It has a great charm to it- and I hope this thread at least convinces one person to watch an episode of this show.

6fzi24,1,2017-06-08,How do you guys stay focused?,Euphyllia99,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6fzi24/how_do_you_guys_stay_focused/,"TL;DR i have some underlying issues with adhd/depression and neither meds have worked. What do you guys employ to stay focused on tasks? Especially online tasks?


I guess I'll start off I have been diagnosed as having a 50/50 chance of some kind of attention deficit issue but everyone says it's because of my depression. I have been on medication but haven't been taking it for about a month now and haven't had any big issues because I'm in a low stress environment right now. But I am taking a summer course and now my inability to focus long term is starting to get me stressed and will definitely lead to something.

So, I'm trying to nip that in the bud. I've been cutting myself off of my phone gradually and tomorrow will be a point of only skimming it in the morning before I go about my day and checking it at night. I don't have anything time sensitive to get to so it can wait till then.

My issue now is that the summer course is all online and the research involves pop culture stuff meaning I end up on YouTube, and get distracted. 

I've done summer internships (I'm 23) and always get my work done too fast so my 8 hour days usually ended up as 4 hours of actually working and 4 hours of media. 

I have also taken many medications for depression which haven't worked too well, and the one medication I got for ADD made me uncomfortable because I would sit still and be moving because of the pumping of my heart and I could feel it beating faster than a horny teenager.

So yeah, what do you guys do to stay focused?

Well, doesn't matter. I'm getting paid to host this thing, so all is good for me. Anyway, welcome to Total Drama Redemption! So, if you're here, it's because you were chosen by a previous winner of Total Drama The Game*bleep* to have a chance of redemption and finally get some gold after your many, many attempts. Uh? Why was that censored, you ask? Copyrights, that's why. We're on a low budget!

By the end of this season, one of you hopeful and determined contestants will FINALLY have some gold for once. Meanwhile, someone else will get silver *once again*. Just sayin'.

There were originally 17 contestants, but I believe it's bad luck to start a season with an odd number of players. Because I couldn't be bothered with choosing another one of you annoying losers, I brought Jerd as the last contestant! Hopefully his sailor wisdom will enlighten and inspire some of you. Wishfully assuming no one is beyond help. Be nice to him... or just eliminate him first, I don't really care.

This challenge, you guys will be going into a dungeon to learn a valuable life lesson (hopefully)! Here, have some flashlights and try to come out of it alive. My interns are too busy cooking me dinner to clean your remains.

---

For **part 1** of this challenge, aafter walking a little into the dungeon, each one of you will find **two** of each of the following chests: brass, bronze, silver, gold and diamond. Each of these is worth a different amount of points. You can open **three of the chests**.

&gt;Example of submission: I'll open two bronze chests and one gold chest.

After you open the chests, it's time to move on!

--- 

For **part 2**, as you go further into the dungeon, you'll find your path is blocked by some rocks. Now, you have several options:

a) **Clear the path** - Some of the rocks are big and look heavy, but you think that you can clear a path big enough for you to get through. However, it'll make you very tired.

b) **Just go back and ask for help** - You can go back and ask someone for help. It'll take you some time and consume some of your energy, but it's certainly a good option.

c) **Wait for someone to come clear the way** - May take even longer, but someone will notice your absence and come to help you. You'll certainly save all your energy, too.

d) **Cheat and go around the dungeon to the exit** - If you're feeling naughty, you can always cheat and go around. However, there's a 50% chance you'll get caught and won't be able to do part 3.

&gt; Example of submission: I'll cheat and go around the dungeon to the exit.

---

For **part 3**, right before you exit the dungeon, you'll find a magic mirror. A figure in the mirror wants you to tell it what makes you want to win this season more than the previous ones. Certainly, you're holding some frustrations inside your chest that fuel your will to win. Well, this is your chance to let those past experiences out (and win some good points in the process)! Convey to the alluring mirror what still makes you strive after so many failed attempts to get gold! Inspire the mirror! Make it want you to win enough to manipulate the results and votes of every single-- I mean, yeah, just... be inspiring.

What? The figure looks like me and has my voice? That's pure coincidence! But do not touch the mirror! It's... fragile, yeah. But there's *totally* glass between you and the figure, so do not try to touch it!

(Write as much as you want, but bear in mind that writing more than another contestant doesn't necessarily mean that what you wrote is better than theirs.)

---

You're good to go! **You have 24 hours to submit**. Best of luck to all of you hopeful losers and see you in the results post! Any question you have about the challenge, you can either ask through PMs or by commenting here."

My partner is currently in the process of securing a summer internship. She is in graduate school and finishing next year. We are in a long term, long distance relationship. Recently, I have had a bad feeling that we are moving apart from each other. This issue has disturbed me greatly (I very much love this person) and I have been trying to approach the issue with her. Last year, she did not express any interest in spending time together (she usually verbalizes: ""When can we meet?"") and that led to a lot of insecurity and unhappiness on my part. We usually openly discuss the logistics of our relationship so we can plan in advance how to spend time together.

She is in a field where summer internships can be very helpful for securing full-time offers. I asked whether she had considered applying to summer internships in the city I live in, and she replied that she was only applying to internships in her city because she wants to be based there after graduation. She also said that she wants to be in a specific field which my city has fewer opportunities for. She told me she applied to one position in my city, but did not spend much more time searching other than obvious job posts. I told her I understood and that she doesn't have to take anything her if she doesn't want to, but she can just apply and see what her options are. That was three weeks ago.

Two days ago she got an offer in a third location. She never told me she had applied, and it's not in the exact field she insists she has to be in. She recently has not taken the time to discuss (two-way conversation) or tell (one-way info relay) me very much – everything is mostly on a ""need-to-know"" basis.

Three plus weeks have passed since school finished. If we had coordinated, we could have spent time together before the start of her internship. She says that was not an idea that came to her. Now.... she's giving me three days’ notice to drop everything and see each other before she starts work. I want to see her but I can't do this if it's not some kind of meeting each other half way situation.

The entire premise of this arrangement is she didn't discuss applying, didn't tell me she was applying, didn't tell me anything until she had to, about this internship. I told her even if she comes to my doorstep, a 'week, maybe two' isn't really feasible because it's all around her schedule, her convenience.

In my mind, seeing each other is just going to reinforce everything that I’ve fought hard against (vs clarifying that I have boundaries and it is not ok). I want to be with her. I have withheld in the past because I am fearful of getting hurt and I felt like my partner was not fully present, engaged in our relationship. I don't think there's anyone else, I do think this could be a maturity issue. This is exactly the kind of situation that 'tells' me my instincts were right.

Unfortunately, I cannot see a way around this. Even if she comes to visit me, everything... I don't really think it sets a good precedence for either of us if this is the dynamic. I can't go to see her, because that would be capitulating to everything being about her. Many times in our relationship, I have done things for her with the thought we are a team. She finally admitted last night that she used me to get to where she is, and that she is choosing her summer internship over me. I understand about the internship, but if she wanted to see me, she could have communicated that earlier, i.e. weeks ago. That would have given me more time with her, and also more time to make arrangements. She can't come here because the people I live with have seen me become increasingly unhappy, and connected the dots – it would not be a hospitable environment for a reunion. I believe this relationship deserves time and respect to discuss some of the issues between us, and I don’t see how “a week, maybe two” all on her terms is going to do it.

Because the entire situation I have described above is predicated on an imbalanced dynamic, I don’t think seeing each other is going to do anything but reinforce that. Everything is all about her: her schedule, her commitments, her timing, her choice to disclose all of this. After her internship is over, the schedule is such that she’s back to school. She said last night her plan is for us to see each other for a week, and then again over winter. I don’t see that working out. I can’t keep going like this – it’s tearing me apart. I think it's possible my partner is immature, selfish, and immobilized. I know I am not perfect, but I love my partner and wanted this relationship to work. Now I'm not sure what to do. I don’t see any way forward. This is making me feel very depressed and lonely.

Please help me think through this.

Is it possible to find a job before arriving in England? At this moment I am studying Angular 2 and English, I will take an intensive course in July of writing skills to be prepared when I go to England. I found some jobs that asked to take an online course before starting to work, do you think it was possible to do here in Portugal?
I am junior, I have a certificate in mcsd web applications. Programming is my weakness because I do not have any degree. So I was thinking about a frontend job where I could do a little backend to learn. I had a 5-month internship here in Portugal, where I worked on an application with ASP.NET MVC, C #, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and vuejs. I worked harder in the frontend part, and in the end a bit of backend. Can someone advise me where I can look? I even preferred a smaller company where I can learn faster and the development process. I would like to go as soon as possible. I was thinking about September.
Thank you guys, have a good day!"

My timezone is +GMT.

 I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything, if you read the prompts you will realize I am flexible and open to all sort of things so please don't feel shy of pitching me your idea)

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my teen daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw Kaley (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that Kaley was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as Kaley? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent little girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) A innocent little sleepover with your 2 friends and you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them and want to learn everything, but no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks), lingerie, thick girls, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for how you might look: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/
Things I would Would like to see r/girlsinyogapants r/seethroughleggings r/visiblepantyline r/cameltoe


remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :). I also have kik if you prefer

I will gladly take any and all advice as the application due date is at the end of the month (June). 


The space that is available is much larger than my original idea, this opens up many more possibilities. When trying to put together my proposal, I fully anticipate a lot of it getting cut. So I need some ""padding."" 


This would all be grown in a warehouse with no windows, Lighting costs would be a concern. And all of this has to be able to be grown year round. 


Indoor growing:


* Mushrooms (oyster/shiitake/lions mane)
* Microgreens
* Lettuce
* Strawberries
* Herbs
* Radish
* Nasturtium 
* Carrots?

6g2mxv,1,2017-06-08,Going for internship positions at fancy places and I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing !,Yeamf93,xxstem,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxstem/comments/6g2mxv/going_for_internship_positions_at_fancy_places/,"Hi 

So I applied to three internship positions and have interviews lined up for next week with all three. (yay ?) I sort of wasn't expecting to receive a call back. All three happen to be Start-up Accelerators. The biggest, fanciest is the one that is actually closely tied to the university I went to (go to, I'm about to graduate). 

I have no idea what the internship includes! I mean, what do they expect from me? My resume really isn't clear about what I can do, cause, I'm not clear about that. Here's what I mean : I'm a jack of all traits, master of none. There are a bunch of certificates and courses I've taken on there from Arts - Accounting to French and Web Development, Java, etc. I studied Math/CS in uni, and so I guess I have enough knowledge to be useful as a programmer... Other than those, I really have nothing to show for except that I know a bit about a lot and that I went to a big name university. 

I'm really worried about my ""interview""s next week. I don't want to blow it by showing up looking like a total idiot not knowing where to go, who to talk to, how to dress, what to say, ... And I don't wanna come off as an overly confident egomaniac who thinks she's the best. I also have no idea what to expect. I've been to one event hosted on the campus and met a few people in this business and they seem cool. All nerdy, and that's awesome! I should fit right in. 

I just have this idea that working at one of these places is going to change my life - cause I'll get to do something I want to do, in a cool place, learn an incredible amount about everything, meet people, better myself and actually work and have a (sorta) job. I want this, and when I want something this badly, I usually mess it up.... 

So, if you went through the same thing walking in as a dorky girl having to rely on NOTHING but your awkward self - what did you do? What happened? What advice do you have for me? 

Thanks so much in advance. and sorry, this was not supposed to turn into a rant. "
6g2r69,2,2017-06-08,ex drama,orionsgreatsky,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/6g2r69/ex_drama/,"I just really, really need to talk to someone. I have a lot of pent up upsetment and I think I just need to get it out. This might be a little long so sorry about that.

I have two exes who really upset me and are impeding me from moving on with my mindframe. Let's call one C and the other S.

C:
I met C in a bar last late February (2016). She was a defense contractor I was in college (21). Now, literally before this girl I was totally fine. No ex baggage. I literally just painted and then I went out to a bar and met her. We hit it off and we slept together. She left the next day to deploy to Iraq and we were together or ""together"" for several months. She was the one who instigated things, moved things to a girlfriend-girlfriend situation, and then when I got invested she said she met someone else out there and dumped me. I mailed her letters when we were together and after the breakup I sent her a postcard from the place I was interning. Hell I even sent her a package for her birthday with a vampire classic book (her favorite genre, ironically).  I know that last bit was very desperate. Lol. But in fairness I was young and naïve. 

What hurts about her is I felt cheated on. The thing is, she never wished me a happy birthday or acknowledged me. She never sent me a card or a letter back. I know I shouldn't give gifts if I don't expect them. I just...it hurts when you realize the other person never cared about you the way you did. Recently, she's in a very public relationship with a man (IG). I know..look I don't hate bisexual women. I'm not trying to offend people though. I've fallen in love with and dated bisexual women. What hurts is that the obsession with social currency by being in a relationship with a man. I don't have a choice...you know? Basically the guy is a very popular man on Instagram. And I followed him before I knew about their relationship. Low and behold one day I see her on IG live and my heart is just pounding hearing her voice. I feel sick, literally. So she's probably gonna get married to him. The thing that gets me is that if I could be in a relationship with her...I wouldn't want it. She was kinda mean to be during the break-up. She was saying how she wasn't going to say nice things to me about myself to make me feel better about the break-up. I wasn't being an attention whore...I just got dumped over a two line email. It hurt. And I guess it hurts because I never got closure or knew what was going on. We haven't talked since April 2017. I have cut her out of my life. That's why I felt so crazy seeing her on that guy's IG live and hearing her voice.

S:
She was after C. C dumped me in April, and S and I met on Tinder my first week in a new state for a summer internship. We have an amazing connection, everything is great. Late June, my sister is gang raped. I was raped when I was 19 and I hit a wall for sex and stuff in mid July. By August I break up with S because I feel suffocated. This was her first relationship with a  woman. I told her to take it slow with her identity work before classifying herself as a lesbian, but she came out to everyone as a lesbian.  When I dumped her, S was furious. She hated me. We weren't talking for months. She slept with another woman.

Thanksgiving I text her wishing her well and told her how I had gotten counseling to deal with what happened to my sister and myself. She thought I just dumped her because I had committment issues, not being of the trauma history. She's never changed her opinion on that even after explaining. We were together Thanksgiving weekend, and together until March 28th.  We were still being sexual with each other until May 20th, and she told me she loved me May 22 (I returned it). Throughout our relationship though, she was always very attention whore-y about being a lesbian, like using it for male attention. I never liked it (and it's one of the reasons I broke up with her late March).   

 On the phone, she talks about all these people interested in her, all these potential dates, etc. And I keep quiet for several weeks about my personal life. I mentioned how I slept with someone and it kinda sucked (she was kind of depressed since her dad die and didn't shower). So S laughed at me for the bad sex and she sent me a meme this morning about how feminists don't shower. I said well, I think she was just depressed. S says she didn't ask for an explanation. Lter I tell her how I'm rooting with her for her education, xyz and the changes she's making in her life and she just laughs at me and says she's excited for tomorrow but she ""keeps forgetting."" I had called her last night (normal for us) and this morning she says she didn't answer because believe it or not she has a life. I wasn't mad at all. She made a really big deal about being out last night. I guess it hurt. 

Again, if I had the choice I wouldn't date S. Today's conversation just hurt. She was just talking about how she's excited to go out with this guy and how she's going to make it into a party with her female friends. And she keeps posting about how she's tired of past relationships (me) treating her bad and this guy she's going out with tomorrow was commenting how he's in the same place as her. She posts a lot to social media and I kinda said I saw what you posted yesterday, it kinda hurt. She said it was just relevant in her life. :(

It's my first week working at my dream job( I'm on break now). I graduated from college with a mathematics degree. I take care of myself. I know I'm a catch. I signed up for a kickball league in my area. I just want to move on with my life and I want piece of mind. Help please? I know this is kinda pathetic.

 UPDATE: I unfriended S (C doesn't have a Facebook), unfollowed everyone on IG. I feel so much better, and I feel so much calmer. Thanks for your responses everyone. I know that was a lot of drama to take in (lol)."

It was later released to DVD on February 15, 2005. The miniseries focuses primarily on the city of Chicago as three unusual storm systems approach from the west, north and south and combine over the city to form a massive hurricane. At the same time a hacker-induced power outage cuts communications leaving a journalist and power officials scrambling to find the cause.
The miniseries was a success for CBS in terms of ratings, as it was the highest-rated movie for the channel in two years, and it earned the highest ratings during the November sweeps week with 19.4 million viewers watching the first part. Critics were less favorable towards the film, with most panning the film for its dialog, implausible science, and poor acting. Some reviewers did praise the film's high-budget special effects and felt the film had at least some ""charm."" In November 2005 a four-hour sequel, Category 7: The End of the World, aired in the same two-part format.



Andy Goodman (Brian Dennehy) is a week away from a forced retirement from his position as chief meteorologist at the National Weather Administration's Severe Weather Center. However, tornadoes level Las Vegas, an area normally not prone to the storms. Concerned and upset that the storm system formed unnoticed and that they were unable to warn the people, Goodman begins closely tracking the system. Goodman receives field reports from his friend ""Tornado Tommy"" (Randy Quaid) and assistance from new intern Sabrina Rogers (Alicia Johnston). As time passes, he realizes the system is heading towards Chicago, joined by an unusual warm storm coming from the south, which is already causing a record-breaking heat wave in the city, and an abnormally early cold front from the Arctic.
Meanwhile, Mitch Benson (Thomas Gibson), the Chief of Operations at Midwest Electric, is struggling to keep power going to the residents because the six-week heat wave is straining the system and residents are refusing to follow power conservation requests. To get more energy, he is working with the company's largest supplier, Lexer, but the company's CEO is trying to find new ways to profit from this crisis. Benson also finds himself caught in a conflict of interest as he is having an affair with the Lexer's public relations representative, Rebecca Kerns (Chandra West).
Ambitious reporter Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) is stuck reporting on the heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest are responsible for the lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.
As the storms approach, early storms knock out the city's primary power generating plant, and Benson is forced to negotiate with Lexer for even more power. Not realizing the devastating nature of the storms coming, London sets out to force Lexer to listen to his warnings by hacking the system and causing a cascading chain reaction that knocks out all of the power in Chicago. Goodman and his team are unable to warn the citizens that the storms have formed into a category 6 hurricane over the Great Lakes and will hit Chicago head on.
Harkin realizes what happened to the power and rushes to find London, while Benson and Secretary Abbott gather energy from a multitude of other companies to get around the breakdown at Lexer. Unaware of what each party is doing, London quickly reverses the hacks at the same time as the energy starts flowing in from other companies. This overloads the system, knocking out the entire Midwest power grid as the storm hits the city and London is killed in the process.
Unable to do anything further, Benson rushes to find his family after he receives word that they are trapped at a mall and that his daughter has been accidentally shot by her ex-boyfriend. ""Tornado Tommy"" drives around the city filming tornadoes and is oblivious to another tornado that is headed to his direction. He puts his camcorder in a suitcase and throws it out his window and he is sucked in the tornado. Harkin gives Benson a ride to the mall to pick up his family, then they go to rescue her pregnant sister-in-law from an elevator. After Amy's cameraman is injured while rescuing her sister-in-law, Harkin stays behind with him and their neighbor. The others rush to reach the airport during the 15-minute eye of the hurricane, where they are picked up in a plane piloted by Harkin's brother, an air force weather pilot. After the storm passes, Harkin keeps her promise and tells London's story on air.



Executive producer Bob Sertner wanted the film to have higher-end special effects to mimic the quality of those seen in feature films. To do this, the film uses visual computer effects created by special effects company Area 51 FX, which created over 100 different shots using the digital modeling program LightWave 3D. During shooting, special effect supervisor Craig Weiss noted that the scenes with Randy Quaid were particularly difficult to capture on film due to his appearing in multiple scenes where his character was chased by twisters and surrounded by their destructive aftermaths. The actors also faced new challenges, as the film often replaced traditional green screen setup, where the special effects were added during editing, with live shots taken with the effects in place at the same time. Nancy McKeon, who was pregnant with her first child during production, filmed some of her scenes using a green screen. She found the experience to be fun, noting that it challenges actors to use their imaginations while performing. She also found it easy to play a television reporter due to her being a self-admitted ""news junkie.""
Unable to find wind machines powerful enough to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers to see what a scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.



Category 6 was initially aired in the United States on CBS as a two-part, four-hour miniseries. The first part aired on Sunday, November 14, 2004, and the second followed on Wednesday, November 17, 2004. It was later aired in Australia on February 12, 2005.
The miniseries was first released to Region 1 DVD by CBS Television on February 15, 2005. On February 13, 2007, Lions Gate Entertainment released it, together with fellow disaster miniseries 10.5, as a two feature set.
The full miniseries aired in Jamaica on Television Jamaica in 2017.



The miniseries was highly successful for CBS, as 19.4 million viewers tuned in to the first part of the film and made it the channel's best-rated Sunday night movie in over two years. The second part was watched by 17 million viewers, the highest number of viewers for the channel on a Wednesday night for the fall season. Together, the two parts helped to push the channel to the top spot for the year's November sweeps week.
Despite the high ratings, the film was generally panned by critics, except for almost universal praise for the high-budget special effects. New York Magazine's John Leonard found it lacking compared to the feature film The Day After Tomorrow, though he did feel it had a certain ""raffish zombie charm."" Charlie McCollum of the San Jose Mercury News called it a ""third-rate disaster flick — with lame dialogue, voodoo science and wooden performances — spread out over two nights and four seemingly endless hours."" Aaron Barnhart of the Kansas City Star agreed, feeling the filmmakers spent their budget on special effects to the detriment of the film's dialog. He called the film an ""assault on common sense"" for positing the idea that the power outage would keep everyone in Chicago from knowing that ""something bad"" was coming. Daily Variety found the film to be full of clichés and felt the side plots gave the appearance that the film was cast first and that the plot had been written to work around the actors. In comparing the film to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, the magazine notes that it had ""two or more disastrous taste treats providing a very loud macro backdrop to the micro tales that play out involving the characters."" Kay McFadden of the Seattle Times also felt the storm became a backdrop ""for a contrived soap opera that could take place in sunshine or rain"" and that the special effects were fun, but did not feel properly integrated into their scenes.

""Category 6"" has high aspirations. Executive producers Robert Sertner and Frank von Zerneck aren't interested in providing the escapist pleasures of a ""10.5"" or ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Instead, expect a brow-furrowing cornucopia of environmental abuse, job cuts, price-rigging, global warming, nuclear energy, gentrification, aging industrial infrastructure, tourist exploitation, computer hackers, workplace sexism, corporate corruption, piggish consumption and infidelity.

The Chicago Tribune's Sid Smith found the film to be ""pretty lousy, despite a wealth of impressive special effects that end with an image of a completely demolished Chicago skyline."" He found the plot to be overly melodramatic and ""hokey"" with an excessive amount of coincidences and ill-fortunes thrown at the characters, despite the performances of the star-studded cast. Australia's The Age gave the film a slightly more favorable review, praising the stunts and special effects, though it noted the effects suffer from poor computer editing and referred to the film as ""a little entertaining supertrash"" that does require one to not think too much about the science to enjoy.

6g46g8,1,2017-06-08,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6g46g8/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
6g4ci8,6,2017-06-08,I Still Love My Nmom...Am I Crazy?,LilMissMuppet,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6g4ci8/i_still_love_my_nmomam_i_crazy/,"I love my Nmom and I always will. Sometimes it feels like an obligation because she's my mother and she gave birth to me, but I do have genuine love in my heart for her. When she's not being witchy, she's a good person.

Life has not been kind to my mother and it is absolutely not her fault that she is the way she is. For the most part she has actively kept me away from her family due to the underlying yet overwhelming toxicity there and for that I'm grateful; as I got older I became more and more aware of the dysfunction.

However, all my life my mom has been complaining that I always choose my dad over her (and in a way I kinda do sometimes...). I've never been able to tactfully explain to her why it's just too difficult for me to be around her.

Obviously there's a big fat N that she's refusing to accept or acknowledge, but she's also very neurotic, highly aggressive (especially with strangers), pompously opinionated, and has always had very erratic and bizarre behavior.

What's worse, I can't enjoy the fact that my mother brags about me like other kids can. I was one of those ""baby geniuses"" growing up and I still have a pretty above-average intellect; my mom is very proud of that, which is great, but she has always tried to go out of her way to basically ensure that I am smarter than anyone else's kid in the room, to the point where she tried to coerce me into applying to Stanford University (I refused and she eventually gave up, she just wanted me to do it so she could tell people her kid applied to Stanford) and was angry when I chose my current school over Colorado State University since their vet school ranks higher than ours. Because of this, she tends to tell people that I was accepted to Colorado State and mentions their accolades BEFORE she tells people where I actually go to school.

I am 20 years old and she still can't get over this ""stage mom"" thing. She finds every possible excuse for bragging rights. I work as an undergraduate research assistant, but she tells people that it's an internship and acts like she doesn't know the difference between an internship and just a job even though I've explained it multiple times. A local meat stand was hiring their summer work and she called them POSING AS ME (thinking she could get away with it because I was in the room with my headphones on but there was no music playing so I heard every word) asking how I would go about applying before she even told me that they were hiring. A local horse stable was hiring and she showed me the Craigslist ad (she likes to job hunt for me because she can pick out the more hoity-toity jobs) but I informed her that they REQUIRED someone with English riding experience and experience working with Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods, none of which I have (I've ridden Western all my life and I've only had Paints) and she lost her shit because ""you never know unless you try"" and ""you aren't even giving it a chance"" and ""you're so close-minded"". The worst thing though is when she meets people through her work and brags about me to them and the next thing you know she's calling me up giving me a link to a website where I can apply to work in a research lab that this guy's girlfriend's cousin's brother owns because she basically told them ""Oh she would LOVE that!"" without consulting me.

Despite all of this, I love her. She tries to be a good mom and I do have good memories with her. She pays for my cell phone, part of my tuition, and she'll be helping me pay the rent for my apartment next year (all of which she sadly uses to manipulate me). My boyfriend doesn't like her because of all the shit she's put me through but thankfully it's never driven a wedge between him and I and I would never choose my mother over my boyfriend. I'm perfectly fine with him not liking her because I didn't expect him to from the get-go and I will never ask that of him.

Am I crazy though? How will I know when it's the right time to cut contact? I really don't want to do that...Ugh, sorry if this is all a big jumble but I always have a hard time stringing words together on this site."
6g4kd9,1,2017-06-08,Incredibly poor internet in Corporate Housing. Can I pay for it myself?,theHoopster,AskTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTechnology/comments/6g4kd9/incredibly_poor_internet_in_corporate_housing_can/,"Hello Reddit.  I'm currently in corporate housing for a summer internship.  The company is providing the housing but, due to a miscommunication, I am not in the same housing as the other interns.  I'm in a much more corporate apartment meant for semi long-term visitors/relocated employees.  While the other interns had to sign a lease and all, I had to fill our zero paperwork and am being giving the housing for free.  

I am incredibly grateful for the housing but the internet is pretty terrible.  It is incredibly inconsistent.  At its peak, I get maybe 6Mb/s.  However, that is incredibly rare.  For most of the time I get &lt; .75Mb/s.  As someone whose life is mainly internet based, I feel like I'm dying.

Part of me wants to go to HR since it is the company that pays for the service.  I want to ask if they can contact the provider to see if there is an issue.

However, I feel it may just be best to pay for it myself the few months I'm here.  My big question is, can I pay for internet while not being on the lease?  My name may be on some documentation they have but I never had to sign anything.

Or would I just be better off calling a service provider, explain the situation, and see what they can do?

Thanks!"

Unfortunately pretty much all of my friends have gone home or to other cities for internships now that the semester is over, so I'm finding myself pretty bored when not at work. Looking for someone to hang out with and get to know over the summer, and if we click I'm open to pursuing a relationship.

I have a tendency to tell incredibly bad science jokes. For example: what do complex analysis and Spanish have in common? I always forget to conjugate.

I'm a physics and computer science major, going into my senior year. I love reading (currently working on House of Leaves), writing (I've written two novels and a stage script, which has actually been published), watching Rick and Morty, and finding stupid videos on YouTube (for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdzCv_9eaoM).

For those who care what I look like, I'm 6'3"", slender, and I work out regularly. Anyways, I'd love to hear from you. Let's chat and see if we click. Maybe find a time and place to hang out. Grab coffee or visit a museum. Something like that."
6g54c9,1,2017-06-08,Should I text an ex I haven't talked to for a long time because she saw my twin brother and thought it was me?,confused_doctogineer,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6g54c9/should_i_text_an_ex_i_havent_talked_to_for_a_long/,"So today my twin brother who's in Boston into my ex who also goes to school in Boston, who I haven't talked to for almost 2 years. I'm currently in Cincinnati for an internship (obviously she doesn't know that). They pretended not to see each other. My brother told me and our friends about it in a group chat thinking that was the end of it, but no. She tweeted this:

""It's been two years and you still can't even say hello to me when you see me around Boston, wow 😂😂""

Now I have my reasons for not talking to her. She has tried to reach out to me, but honestly I don't really want to be friends with her and the girl I'm currently dating (for almost two years coincidentally) probably wouldn't be a fan. I just don't want my ex to feel like she has any sort of control over me, especially because of how our relationship ended. I could just text her but part of me doesn't want to give her that satisfaction. 

I think this whole situation is really funny, but what should I do?"

I hope that a kind soul reading this can help me out. I recently found out that i am being let go from my internship job which bearly paid rent or food but it kept me and my boyfriend going. 

Last night we finished the last of our supplies from the fridge and the last can of beans between us this morning. I tried to order us a meal but the credit card declined and when i called up i found out its maxed out. I am in the process of applying for social walfare for the time being but getting a payment will take a week or two. I am not aware of any services in Dublin that offer a free meal unless you are with homeless services and homeless services is not for us since we still have a place to live. (I called up)

I was hoping that a kind stranger would be willing to purcharse a gift card for our food delivery service justeat.ie so we can get some kind of food to get us going through the weekend and i can figure out what to do next on Monday.  

http://www.justeatshop.ie/gift-cards/

I believe in paying to forward so the next time I am not down on my luck and pass the kindness forward. If anyone can do this for me Id write and mail them a hand written thank you note since its all i can offer at the moment.

I hope that its not too much to ask for something like this and if you have any other idea of helping me out other then the gift card let me know the reason i linked those is because i think it be the easiest way for someone to help out but if there is another way let me know since its hard to think hungry :( ."

[Sorry for the wall of text, I need to vent, and I want to give context.]

We knew each other in high school, but never really talked, I left school early at 17 and a year later I start talking to her online, things progress, we start going out, things started off well, until we started spending a lot of time together.
I was raised Mormon and left a few months into the relationship, I felt guilty doing so many things because of my upbringing, I hardly did any PDA, felt awkward to hold hands, I regret asking a lot of things, as she was my first, but she had been with other guys, I made her feel like shit... but anyway

Time went on and I was at a college for art and design, and it was a scam, I fell into a horrible depression, my anxieties got worse, I got more germaphobic, then my sister tried to kill herself, I got worse, my parents divorced, things got worse, My mum ended up getting in a relationship with a lady, and I got a bit angry.

all the while me and my girlfriend got more and more distant, we had arguments about gender all the time, I kept trying to help her out, but I think due to her anxiety and self-hate she just kept denying it and getting angrier... time carries on and I graduate college, can't get a job, no place even consider offering internships, and I got really bad, I lost patience all the time, my girlfriend would cry all the time, self-hate, wake up with panic attacks due to a boss that called her useless and worthless, and I know I was not the best in dealing with them, but I wasn't the worse either, I listened, talked hugged and tried to calm her, but some nights I just could not deal with staying up till 3 am helping her while I needed to wake up early. Over time things got better, but then she had an internship for uni in another city, I felt miserable, knowing she would opt out of it for me I shut up about it and said I feel sad you are leaving, but happy you are going, she got mad that I wasn't super excited for her, but at that time I was hardly excited for myself, just kept grasping and physical things to try to be happy over. We skyped and it was messy, she would keep saying I should find someone smarter than her all the time, I had little to no patience, and just blew up a few times...

I was so boring to her, we just stayed in the same room all day every day, I didn't want to do anything, I just sat at a computer and tried to cope, tried to numb the fears in my mind.

this year we moved out of my parents, and into a flat with friends, I work in a warehouse now, and I had finished work, and then went straight home, packed up everything, it took hours, I was moving things at work and at home from 7:30 am till 7pm, I was exhausted, I wanted to do all the work so she didn't have to, we set up our room, and I went to sleep, she wanted me to be all over her, (she had also mentioned I don't take my time in bed, or make her feel appreciated, but I felt guilty still at this time, and I didn't feel much)

a week before the break-up, I felt my whole mindset change, I had the motivation, I had feelings, I wanted to do things, go places! have fun! but it was too late, she broke up with me, she wants to be friends still, and I am pretty sure she is fooling around with a guy she met at university, and I am going insane.




 TL;DR rocky relationship, felt like it was getting better at the end, but to her, it wasn't, broke up, wants to be friends, and she has a friend I am sure she is not ""just friends"" with.

So sorry for the wall of text, I know I could write it better, I just feel I am going insane. I don't feel I can tell this to any of the flatmates."

mid 20's masters student here, who switched countries to study. Just finished my first year of my INCREDIBLY demanding and challenging masters program. I have never worked as much as I had to for this program ever in my life for anything. 12 hour days processing and assimilating information are very common. Colleagues are super smart. Grades are tough to get.

Essentially, I have been working my ass of for the past 12 weeks, for the masters exams, the thesis, and other out of the course projects. I started my internship the next day after my thesis defense. Students are taking days off, summers off, etc, but I have been running after it, not giving up, trying to (and largely succeeding in) do something.
However, this internship that I started is an absolute dud. It bores me. I am micromanaged. The work is not something I envision doing. It doesn't pay well. It's on the other side of the town. On the other side - there will be oblique opportunities, I may make some friends, I will get paid below minimum wage, I will have a good research lab stamp on my CV.

The question is - is it worth sacrificing 2 months of my life for this? The answer is no.

What I am really scared of is, quitting this, and bumming out over the summer because I am burned out. Knowing me, I know this won't happen. But I am still scared - as there is NO ACCOUNTABILITY apart from myself.

To fill my time, I have a list of activities that can occupy me for a much longer time than I even have. But I'm afraid of not checking a single box off. Another issue is, that all my friends/colleagues are leaving to do whatever it is they are doing! I'm not an incredibly social guy - I have difficulties forming relationships - and have not any other friends, really. I'm scared to not see people for months and essentially self sabotage.

I need your ideas to Get Disciplined! What would you guys do? Is is a good idea to quit my internship - to work on personal projects and potentially earn much more money, knowledge, and life experience?"

I took a deep breath, stomping the shock and now coiling dread back into some hidden compartment in my body.
“Did, did you do this?” my voice was shaking, the syllables on a scale of shifting frequencies, a song of fear and confusion.


I could feel the eyes of the dead angel burning into my back, two irises concentrating with accusation. *Where were you Peter?*


He scoffed, sliding a cigarette calmy from the carton and bringing it to his lips where it lit instantly. The devil took a long drag as he pocketed the box, expelling a plume of smoke that hung in the still air.


“Were you down on Earth?” he asked.


I had been. Over the past several decades I had grown bored manning the gates, roping in a young intern to keep watch while I reincarnated as a human, one I had carefully, and painstakingly designed inside the now neglected creation chambers, and enveloped myself in the experience of man, of life. It was like roleplaying, that’s what people called it, and it felt good to trade drifting nimbus for solid earth under my feet. It felt more real than the monitored climate and mandatory pleasure of the heavens above. And later, it was difficult to tear myself away from earth, from the act of biting into an apple, and discovering, no, it wasn’t just sweet, and impossibly ripe, but sour, and might conceal a gluttonous worm burrowed into its core. That there was dimension to pleasure, the good moments made momentous because of the bad. And I would have to rip my feet from grimy pavement or dog shit-decorated lawn and hurl myself in front of an oncoming car, or jump from the top of a towering skyscraper, or blow out my brains in the middle of a crowded square with a revolver procured from a gruff and stinking salesman. And the beautiful stink of that world, the dimensions would dissolve into oppressive light, and I would feel the clouds curl around my feet as I walked the familiar steps from Purgatory to the Promised Land, feeling the potential of boredom, become a monotonous reality once again.


I had designed 92 humans, and died 92 different ways, turning death into it’s own artwork as I imagined up glorious endings as I painted new beginnings. Today I had been a teenager pulsing with hormones. I had felt mad, watching a world that felt overly-saturated, and foreign and teeming with possibility. I had taken my life by clambering into a zoo enclosure with a broken pride of emaciated lions, screaming as giant incisors tore through my flesh, hoping that the pain might last forever and that there wasn’t just the nothingness of eternal happiness waiting for me as black claws ripped open my chest, and the roar of primal rage filled my ears.

“You were weren’t you, Peter?” Lucifer laughed, a baritone chorus.

He took a step towards one of the pillars flanking the gate, peeling gilded paint from the ruined entryway and inspecting it.


“I’ve been watching you for a while. I mean, not from down there or up here, but right by your side. It’s definitely become a hobby of mine too. As much the watching as the, you know, being,” he said. “But you keep to yourself. You meddle as little as possible. I like to sow chaos, to send cars careening through storefronts, or ploughing through crowds outside of concerts. To arm the lone gunman, to set fire to their monuments. It’s fun ruining what they hold so dear.”


He looked up, flicking the stripped paint into the swirling clouds at his feet and taking another drag.


“You need to start telling me what happened here,” I said, talking through a new plume of smoke. “Start, fucking, talking.”


“But I don’t wear others’ skins,” he said ignoring me. “I don’t manufacture an experience, an escape. I walk down there as myself, and wear my evil, and my status honourably. You hide Peter. It’s pathetic, and endearing. You hide until that final moment where you dash your life on the rocks, a grand display to draw a crowd, to create chaos that you don’t have to worry about cleaning up.”


I noticed something flapping against my leg, and looked down to see my standard-issue white robes fluttering in the wind. A gust was picking up, and around me clouds were beginning to gray. I watched as debris - blood-stained fluff, crumbled golden mortar - swept past my sandalled feet.

For me, it'd be:

Little Sloan - Selfish and whiny teenager who literally had no plans for her life. Don't even care if her storyline didn't get resolved.

Percy - He wormed his way into Izzie’s graces after she came back far too early from her cancer surgery. Also stole cases from her and then bad-mouthed and mocked Stevens for being trusting.

Shane - When it became clear that Brooks was better suited for the area of medicine he intended to pursue, Ross became darker and sabotaged Brooks when he could, leading to her death.

Sadie - An annoying intern who had no clue what she was doing. Rather than learn from her mistake, she was allowed to stay because of who her dad was and continued to struggle to keep up with her class.

Lucia - Made it clear that she wasn’t happy with Callie’s choice to marry Arizona and didn’t support gay rights.

Alana - Rather than save the hospital, she shut the ER down and made it a nightmare for the doctors to work. Tried selling Grey Sloan to a company that had made doctors at other hospitals miserable. The tough and unapologetic attitude didn't help at all.

Stark - Stole credit for all sorts of ideas. He even pushed off a patient’s concerns because he was busy with something else, a concern that could have turned out lethal had Meredith not listened and gone with her gut instinct.

Jason - Woman beater who posed as a charming, idealistic man.

Reed - Stole cases and broke up relationships. Also worked her way into surgeries by playing Alex and slept with Mark at the time that he dated Teddy.

Minnick - Besides an extremely cocky and arrogant attitude, she ran away from Edwards after the death of a child. Rather than help Stephanie and be a teacher, she ran off to cry.

Catherine - Encouraged and teased Webber into sleeping with her while he had a sick wife in a nursing home, manipulated her way into owning the hospital and forced April into signing a post-nuptial agreement, without even being happy that her son had found love.

Eli - Too cocky and tried too hard to prove his dominance over Bailey, spewing some incredibly cringeworthy lines. He also loathed the fact she was a strong, opinionated woman in a position of power.

Burke - His attitude and overbearing nature were hard to handle, especially when he was with someone as independent as Cristina. He also dumped her at the altar, need I say more?

Hahn - Always wanted to make it seem like she was better and smarter than everyone else, and for the most part treated everyone poorly.

Izzie - While she certainly had her moments, Stevens' personality traits did nothing to make her likeable overall, including the fact she seemed to relish in creating drama and feeding gossip.

Leah - Continually disrupted people’s lives and was clearly unstable. Made a pointless return last season.

Maggie - Calls dibs on a man and expects him to fall in love with her. She has potential to get redeemed if they stop writing her as someone who acts as one of Meredith's kids.

Derek - Arrogant, possessive and placed himself on a pedestal. Also gave Meredith the silent treatment often and would prioritize his work over his family.

Callie - While Arizona is far from a saint, Callie almost always refuses to listen to other people and prefers to act behind their backs. Trying to gain Sophia's custody to move in with Penny was the final nail on the coffin for me.

Jo - Severely underdeveloped. Hasn't even picked a specialty yet.

DOUBLE EDIT: 

Rebecca/Ava - Out of all the love interests a character in this show has ever had she's easily the worst.

Amelia - Had a great storyline during Private Practice but most of her development was ruined once the character joined Grey's.

I'm aware this is a long list, but I'm curious to know everyone else's opinions. Do you agree with my options or was I too harsh?"

I'm a 19 year old full time student and just recently got my first paid internship/job.  I will only hold this over the summer and as such expect to make roughly $7400-7600, which will be my only income all year.

I am single, live in Virginia, and my parents claim me as a dependent.  However, I understand that because I will make more than the limit of $6350 that I must file my own tax return.  

What I'm having trouble figuring out is why I'm being taxed roughly ~9% on each of my paychecks (about $50 a week).  From what I've gathered the standard tax deduction is about $6300, so I should only be taxed on ~$1200 of my income.  My employer has already withheld $80 total from 2 paychecks, but according to this calculator from the IRS:
https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/

""your anticipated income tax for 2017 is $116. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $414 withheld for 2017 resulting in an overpayment of $298 when you file your return""

Can anyone help point me in the right direction to figure out what's going on?  I'm a complete beginner and am very excited to have my first internship and learn about the 'real world,' so any help is greatly appreciated!

FIDLAR is a skate punk/garage punk band from Los Angeles, California. The band is currently signed to Mom + Pop Music in the US, Wichita Recordings in the UK and Dine Alone Records in Canada.

The band's name is an acronym for Fuck It Dog, Life's a Risk, a skate mantra gleaned from singer Zac Carper's former roommates. Originally, FIDLAR went under the name 'Fuck The Clock', as referenced in their song 'Cheap Beer'. Founding members Carper and Elvis Kuehn met while working at a recording studio in which Carper was employed as an engineer and Kuehn was an intern. The two started recording songs when the studio was empty and posting the finished products online. Three years after recording their first songs, they stepped on stage together with The Black Lips and went on tour with The Hives.

In 2011, they released their debut EP, DIYDUI, produced by Lewis Pesacov. In 2012, FIDLAR were named one of Stereogum's 40 Best New Bands of 2012

The summer job is considered a rite of passage for the American Teenager. It is a time when tossing newspaper bundles and bussing restaurant tables acts as a rehearsal for weightier adult responsibilities, like bundling investments and bussing dinner-party plates. But in the last few decades, the teenage summer job has been disappearing. In the summer of 1978, 60 percent of teens were working or looking for work. Last summer, just 35 percent were.

Why did American teens stop trying to get summer jobs? One typical answer is: They’re just kids, and kids are getting lazier.

But one can rule out that hypothesis pretty quickly. The number of teens in the workforce has collapsed since 2000, as the graph below shows. But the share of NEETs—young people who are “Neither in Education, Employment, or Training”—has been extraordinarily steady. In fact, it [has not budged more than 0.1 percentage point since the late 1990s](http://ift.tt/1IWfsow). Just 7 percent of Americans teens are NEETs, which is lower than France and about the same as the mean of all advanced economies in the OECD. The supposed laziness of American teenagers is unchanging and, literally, average.

********

[FRED](http://ift.tt/2t2HSsc)
********

A better answer is that teenagers aren’t spending more time on the couch, but rather spending more time in the classroom. Education is to blame, rather than indolence. Teens are [remaining in high school longer](http://ift.tt/2s54bjD), [going to college more often](http://ift.tt/2t2JRN2), and taking more summer classes. The percent of recent high-school graduates enrolled in college—both two-year and four-year—has grown by 25 percentage points. That is almost exactly the decline in the teenage labor-force participation rate.

********

**Teen Participation Rate vs. Share of New High School Graduates in College**

Atlantic
********

With tougher high-school requirements and greater pressure to go to college, summer classes are the new summer job. The percent of 16-to-19-year-olds enrolled in summer school has tripled in the last 20 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rise in summer school may be directly related to the fact that parents and high schools are encouraging students to take on more classwork, [according to Ben Steverman](http://ift.tt/2rVD7V4), a Bloomberg reporter who covers teen employment. He finds that the percentage of high-school grads completing at least four years of English, three years of science, math, and social science, and two years of foreign language has sextupled since the early 1980s.

********

**Share of Teenagers Taking Summer Classes**

[BLS](http://ift.tt/2s55tvl)
********

The second reasons why teens work less today is that, for a variety of reasons, employers are more reluctant to hire them. First, the rise of low-skill immigration in the last few decades has created more competition for exactly the sort of jobs that teenagers used to do—like grocery-store cashiers, restaurant servers, and retail salespeople. Second, older Americans stay in the workforce longer than ever before, and many of them wind down their careers in the sort of jobs that used to be the province of 16-year-olds in the summer, like office secretaries.

Third, the number of federally funded summer jobs, where students take temporary jobs with their local government, has declined. At the same time, the [the minimum wage has grown](http://ift.tt/2t2YOin), which may have discouraged bosses from taking on young inexperienced workers who are only “worth” hiring at a salary that’s become illegal. Together, these policies have reduced the number of temporary paid jobs for teenagers in the public and private sector. Fourth, companies have caught on to the fact that if they want to hire teenagers, they don’t have to pay them, at all: There has been [an extraordinary rise in unpaid internships](http://ift.tt/1ix7TJb) over the last decade. Although these teenage interns are clearly working, they don’t count as workers in government statistics, because they’re not getting paid.

The third big-picture explanation for the demise of teen summer jobs is cultural. Teenagers are exquisitely sensitive to the social norms of their peers. If they see cool older teenagers scooping ice cream during their freshman summer, they’ll really look forward to a job scooping ice cream during their sophomore summer. But any social feedback loop can spin both ways. Recently, the cultural norm is shifting toward summer classes and unpaid internships rather than summer jobs. Since the mid-1990s, the share of teenagers who say they wish they were working has fallen by about 50 percent, according to the BLS. That suggests—although it cannot prove—that summer jobs have lost some of their social status, as the norm has shifted away from working.

********

**Share of Non-Working Teens Who Say They Wish They Were Working**

[BLS](http://ift.tt/2s55tvl)
********

It’s important note out that it’s probably white adults who feel the strongest [nostalgia for summer jobs](http://ift.tt/2qXgWtu). Here's a look at the teen participation rate for the last two full years for whites, hispanics, and blacks. Each July and August sees a 10-point jump in the number of white teenage workers; a 5-point jump in the number of hispanic teen workers; and hardly any movement among black teenagers. (There is evidence that Asian teens are [more like white teens](http://ift.tt/1IbJofU) in this regard.)

********

********

Compare that to 1978 and 1979, the statistical peak of the teen summer job. In July and August in the late 1970s, 30 percent of white teens flooded into the labor force, along with 20 percent of hispanics. Again, black teen participation hardly budged.

********

********

Putting these two graphs together, two things are clear. First, the summer-job bump has declined for all ethnicities in the last 40 years. Second summer jobs are the province of the white and wealthy. Children of richer families are more likely to take part-time in summer jobs, according to [a report](http://ift.tt/1GhPp8n) from the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. But black and low-income teens are less likely to work, not only because their neighborhoods have fewer opportunities, but also because their families have fewer connections to companies with internships and part-time jobs. Altogether, summer jobs may be yet another vector through which privilege becomes inherited from one generation to the next.

Is there any good reason to be nostalgic for teen summer jobs? Don’t they teach kids responsibility, [“soft skills,”](http://ift.tt/2t2VvI1) and a humbling tolerance for the tedium of office life? There are several studies that show summer jobs for teens pay [a long-term dividend](http://ift.tt/2s4OusQ) in [higher earnings and reduced crime](http://ift.tt/2rWf1t0). But there are even more studies hailing the benefits of [high-school completion and college attendance](http://ift.tt/2s4Ow3W), [](http://ift.tt/2s4Ow3W)and many teens have to choose between education and work. (It will be interesting to see if the summer job has a resurgence in the new low-unemployment economy.)

The mysterious disappearance of the summer job for teenagers turns out to be a perfect parable for the flexibility of the workforce. Many of the jobs that teenagers used to do no longer exist; they’ve gone to older Americans and new immigrants. But rather than use the fallow months to quintuple their video-game time, teenagers are taking the time to invest in their educational future. This is hardly the place to expend America’s finite national anxiety.

6ga277,31,2017-06-09,Stupidest night of [M]y li[F]e,sirjerksabunch,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6ga277/stupidest_night_of_my_life/,"In college, I had been dating Olivia for about 5 months when everything fell apart. It was entirely my fault.  
Oliva was perfect and very out of my league. Super smart, about 5 foot 1 or so, with beautiful DD tits, and perfect toned ass and legs because she had recently quit a college sports team. On top of all that Olivia had a very high sex drive. She would sleep over almost every night, and we would have sex multiple times, including the best morning sex ever. Olivia spoiled me to be honest. She had an IUD, so I never had to use condoms, and she never turned down sex, like ever. On top of that we had a bunch of mutual friends and she was from the same state as me so I know we would be able to see each other over the summer.  
Of course, everything perfect is too good to be true. Olivia had had many more previous relationships than me even though she was a year younger, and she was very against long distance relationships after a previous bad break up. Due to some miscommunication with her parents about travel plans and different obligations at the end of the school year, I ended up in the school area an extra week while Olivia flew back home right after her last final. After that I wasn’t going home right away because I had a short internship in another different state.
I guess, a little about me is in order before the crazy stupid sex begins. I’m a little over six foot in decent shape, a little muscle definition but nothing crazy by any means. Since I live with college athletes and I’m a NARP, I’ve always felt overwhelmed by my super jacked roommates in the body department. As for my dick, it’s pretty average lengthwise, circumcised, and if anything a little extra girthy.   
  
So here the stupidity begins…
Only one of my roommates was still around and we decided to hit the bars on Friday night since we were leaving Sunday. (I should mention at the time my roommate had just started dating a girl but wasn’t super serious about it) We started off at an all you drink happy hour and ran into a bunch of other athletes from school. All them had pregamed and were quite a bit more drunk than us, and they were dressed a little nicer too.   
One of the girls there, Kate caught my eye. Kate was wearing a very tight, striped dress that was super body fitting on her torso and accented the small tits she had, and then flared out from the hips down. She was wearing solid 3 or 4 inch wedge heels which showed off her already very defined legs. Kate was about the same height as Olivia, but with darker hair, and as I said much smaller boobs, but you see that she had quite the ass under that striped dress. Now Kate had reputation as sleeping around quite a bit at one of the fraternities and as being quite the ‘crazy drunk bitch’.  Kate and I also had a short history before Olivia came into the picture. The previous summer, we had left a friends apartment together and ended back at her place watching TV sobering up. Things quickly got heated and clothes came off, with heavy make out session, and me licking Kate’s very small but perky nipples. When I had reached down to put a hand on her pants, Kate had stopped me saying she was on her period and that anyways she wanted to stay friends and not smart anything. 
Back to the bar’s happy hour, I said and gave everyone I knew a quick hug. When I hugged Kate, who I hadn’t spoken to in at least a semester, she held the hug a little longer than everyone and said in her very drunk and happy voice “I’m so happy you’re here.” Now Kate has quite the annoying drunk bitch voice, which I had talked to Olivia about for some reason. The evening continues with heavy drinking as we were trying to get the best value of the all you can drink happy hour special. By the time the happy hour ends, everyone is wasted drunk, myself included. I’m the worst horny drunk every, and Kate’s legs and ass were just teasing me under her dress. Now, the crowd of college students has to decide where to go next. Some vote to go back to campus, while others want to bar hop downtown a bit more. At this point, I exchange a couple texts with Oliva, who is back home and says her phone is going to die, but that she wants to talk later that night and tells me to have fun. Olivia has always supported me going out more, since when we started dating I was very anti going out (still don’t know how I convinced her to date me). So I’m thinking ok, cool I’ll have some fun and see some bars I’ve never been to.   
For some reason even though it’s a Friday night a lot of the bars are dead. Maybe it’s because all the college students went home, but eventually I end up in an Uber with Kate and some of the other athletes heading back to campus. Kate is sitting in the middle, very loud drunk bitch mode, but also very touchy feely drunk slut mode. I can tell she’s only wearing a black thong under her dress, and notice she puts her hand on my thigh. At this point, sincee its still earlyish, someone (me) gets the bright idea to go back to my house and play some beer games. I text my roommate, who had left earlier and ask him to grab a rack and I’ll pay him back. We get to my house and quite a bit of upperclassmen that are still left on campus show up.   
SEXY STUFF starts here   
Like any good college house, we have a small bar and when I’m not playing beer pong, I end up sitting behind the bar on a barstool, choosing some songs to play and generally just scrolling through FB on my phone. Olivia still hasn’t texted back but I don’t notice. I start to pay more attention to Kate, who while being very annoyingly drunk loud, she is also kinda dancing by herself, moving closer and closer to me. Now dancing was not the vibe of the gathering, and her legs in the wedges she was wearing were more and more attractive to me. Kate ends up kinda leaning against me behind the bar, (people cant really see our legs) and basically sits down facing away from me straddling my right leg. I can feel her bare legs and warmth of her pussy on my leg through my jeans, its very distracting. She kinda rubs up and down just making small talk, and I’m trying my hardest to not get a boner. Eventually I can feel I can’t hold it any longer, and a semi-boner is definitely starting to emerge. Thankfully, all the beer I’ve drank means I have to go pee, so I excuse myself to Kate, and walk to the bathroom upstairs. Kate gently grabs my arm as I walk away and tells to “be quick”. I go pee and debate a quick wank in the bathroom, to get rid of the boner, and clear my mind. I know thinking about Kate sexually is stupid, but she is clearly trying to get with me. The wank idea goes out the window when, stupid Sarah another loud drunk bitch, pounds on the door, and demands that I vacate the bathroom, because she has to “PEE LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER” cool Sarah thanks for the public service announcement.   
I go back downstairs to find that most guests are heading out, and that Kate has taken over the music from my phone. Great. I go back over and change the songs I don’t like, and Kate drunkenly complains. Frustrating, but its my house I’ll play the music I like. Kate suddenly announces she also has to go to the bathroom, and walks up the stairs. Her legs going up the stairs kill me, and I catch a glimpse of her ass, under the dress. While Kate is upstairs, everyone else decides to leave and get some drunk snacks, so I head up to intercept Kate. At this point I’m in drunk, horny mode, and I’m either gonna wank it in my room or get Kate to join me. So I’m on the landing outside the bathroom when Kate gets out and I tell here everyone has left. I reach out and grab her waist and pull her close to me while reaching down for a kiss. She attacks my face right back, and I can’t help but reach down, lift up her dress and grab a frim piece of beautiful perky, athlete butt. Now I’m like a foot taller than Kate, and she’s standing on her tip toes as I lean down to kiss her. Kate suddenly, pulls back and says “Wait don’t you have a girlfriend????”  
“Yeah, but she doesn’t need to know.” Comes out of my drunk mouth. Shoot me please. WHY did I ever say that????  
At that Kate, just attacks me. What I really want to do is bend her over something, like my bed, pull her thong down, and fuck her while she is still in that dress. Kate of course has other plans. This struggle to figure out how we’re gonna fuck, turns it into a hate fuck for me. Kate has always been the obnoxious drunk girl at every party, and I just put all my anger into the sex.  
  
We stumble into my room, and slam the door, Kate is rubbing my dick, which is rock hard through my jeans, and I reach down, and pull her tong off while pushing her onto the bed, and slipping a finger inside her very warm and wet pussy. Kate however, wants nothing to do with the foreplay, and starts quickly pulling my jeans off and pulling my dick to her pussy. “Woah there slow down!” I think. I do my best to stall, reaching up to grab a handful of boob, and kissing up her neck to her mouth. Kate thinking I want more boob action (I really didn’t, just wanted to flip her over and fuck her in that dress, while staring at her beautiful ass and legs) pulls her dress and bra off, and tells me to put a condom on. Sure. Haven’t use done in ages since Olivia spoiled me. At this point alarm bells should have been going off in my head. Why do I even have condoms in my room if I don’t need them with Olivia??? No idea, they were still there.   
  
I slip the condom on and Kate grabs my dick and guides it into her pussy. Now, Kate knows how to fuck I’ll give her that even in missionary. She is pushing back in the rhythm, and agressivley, kissing my body and even rubbing her pussy to get herself off. I must say her pussy was very, very tight. But drunk me has a magical whiskey dick, which means I will never come If I’m drunk enough. Kate mean while I begging me to fuck her harder and give her my cum all over her boobs. Wanting to switch it up from missionary, I pull her off and lay on my back. She gets on top and rides like a crazy cowgirl. Just no stops, rubbing her clit, and she cums hard. Now at this point, I should have come by now and Kate asks if she’s doing something wrong. I just explain I get real bad whisky dick and there’s nothing she can do about it. 
  
BOOM  
  
Now the realization hits me of what I’ve done. I get up and go to the bathroom, thinking “holy shit holy shit holy shit what do I do now?” After I calm myself down, and think who else knows, I go back and tell Kate she has to leave right now and that I’m very sorry. I text Olivia that I have to tell her some bad news, I could not bring myself to lie, and from there the roller coaster ride that was the break up started. Olivia and I still talk a couple years later, and even though Olivia still likes me I hurt her way too bad to get back together. Kate and I ended up being FWB for a couple months after because at that point no one else would get with me, wince Olivia told everyone what happened. But breaking up with Olivia led to more random, sexy hookups which hopefully I’ll share here in the future.   

Feedback on my writing is much appreciated. it’s my first time sharing this experience.

Most of the time you don't get to do what you want with your life. I'm sorry that you've applied to 30 internships and you haven't gotten into a single one. Maybe even though you love that field, you suck at it or it's overpopulated. I'm sorry that you've got an MBA that you completed in a joint program with your B.S. and now you can't get a job paying $80,000 right off the bat like you feel you deserve.

Pick something else. Forget about your dreams, suck it up and get a fucking job. Because at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what your job is as long as you're making money and the people are tolerable.

It's what you do outside of your job that makes your life worth living. You want to feel like you're contributing to the world? Fine, go volunteer on the weekends. You want to find love and happiness? Get on match.com and get to dating. Do you want a family one day? Take the crappy job in the company you hate now so that you can work your way up the totem pole enough to be able to afford a house and kids by the time you think you'll want them. SET ATTAINABLE GOALS. ADJUST YOUR EXPECTATIONS. WORK HARDER.

If you're miserable with your current circumstances, you need to figure out how to deal with them. I've been through as much as the rest of you. I've made shit money. I lived in the ghetto. I've worked two part time jobs and gone to school full time. Then I worked a full time job and went to school full time. I've been raped. I've been abused mentally, physically, and emotionally by multiple people in my life. I've been dumped. I've moved across the country and known no one. I've dropped out of college (twice) and gone back to finish. I've battled mental illness for YEARS. WE ALL HAVE SHIT THAT MAKES LIFE HARD. But that does NOT mean that we are entitled to anything. 

Yeah the boomers fucked us, but we can't do anything about it now. So you're just going to have to learn to deal with it and make the best of the cards you were dealt. That's the only way you'll find happiness."
6gabsn,3,2017-06-09,ArrayFire vs. OpenCV?,EntangledAndy,MLQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions/comments/6gabsn/arrayfire_vs_opencv/,"Greetings,

I'm currently working at an internship where my boss and I want to build an application that can process images obtained from various cameras placed at different locations in a facility. I've been researching different frameworks and libraries that work with the CUDA environment, and this brought me to ArrayFire and OpenCV. Does anyone here have any particular recommendations for or against using either of these two libraries for computer vision development? Is there a different framework we should try instead?

Thank you.

[edit]: I should also mention that I'm a complete beginner when it comes to Machine Learning, as I've only had some minor exposure to the field through reading I've done on the subject out of curiosity. "
6gapew,12,2017-06-09,This One Takes The Cake,RivyGucci,RealLifeLegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealLifeLegends/comments/6gapew/this_one_takes_the_cake/,"A few years back, My girlfriend (now ex) and I had a few jobs over the summer that we figured would earn us a good amount of money in a short period of time (around $750-900 each). The plan was to go dog sit for a family friend of my ex while doing catering jobs for the next two weeks. My ex also had an internship close by so the majority of the work would be done by none other than yours truly. 
 
We get to the house and I meet the family for the first time. The owners were an older couple, probably in their fifties, who were going on vacation and wanted us to watch their corgi for them. They were like vegan hippies in a way. Only ate organic shit, no meat. Their fridge looked like the inside of a forest...if that paints a better picture.They told us about the dog, what she likes, doesn’t like. When/what to feed her, when to go on walks, etc. 
 
So after all the bullshitting, the couple leaves  and my ex and I settle in. Time goes by and we have our first catering job which was a wedding reception inside the banquet room of a museum about a half hour away. We get there, both dressed accordingly, and spend the next three hours setting up. 
 
Right before the event begins, the manager comes up to me and this ditzy, loopy, older gentleman server and told us we are tasked with moving the wedding cake from the front of the reception to the kitchen to be cut and plated when the time came. I was nervous , this being my first catering job and all, but it’s a cake. How hard could it be?
 
The reception so far is going well. I’m doing a great job running food, making sure everyone is happy, and following directions from the managers with ease. Before you know it, the time comes and we have to move the cake. Now the cake wasn’t too elaborate, just a three layer cake with your generic wedding shit riddled on it. The table it was on was about waist-high tall and circular. John (the older server) and I approached the cake. Being cautious, I looked under table to make sure everything was sturdy. I wiggled each leg and they are as solid as could be (not a good idea). I get back up to begin the moving process. 
 
We tried to lift the the cake up from the bottom but couldn’t get our fingers under it without getting frosting on our hands. Me, thinking outside the box, told John we should just lift and carry the whole table to the kitchen. He nodded and we began to lift.
 
All of a sudden, the legs collapsed and the table tips over. The cake slid off and...SPLAT! It’s completely destroyed and the whole reception of 300+ people are staring in silent shock. I guess when I was fucking around with the legs, I must have loosened something by accident.
 
The Bride began to cry and you could see the smoke coming out of the Grooms ears.I slowly walked out of frame and John, the son of a bitch that he was, started licking the frosting off his fingers all while not being phased in the slightest bit of what just happened. 
 
I apologized profusely to everyone. I was overwhelmed with shame by potentially ruining a wedding. Some people were very understanding and sympathetic , some, not so much. My ex, however, wasn’t too comforting, but then again, she never really was. 
 
Towards the end, the Groom came up and made his speech per tradition. 
 
He goes on about, “ How much he loves cake and how, in college, he dreamed about eating it on his wedding day…” 
 
“Top 10 worst nights of my life.”, I thought to myself.
 
The next day the catering company contacts me and basically says,
 
“Don’t come back for anymore events! You’re done!” 
“You almost ruined the company's reputation!” 
 
I asked them about John and they say, “He has been working here forever and that it wasn’t his fault.” 
 
Dicks.
 
For the remainder of the two weeks I just chilled with the corgi, cooked a shit ton of meat, mowed the grass, and accepted the fact that out of all this time, I’ll only be taking home $40...
 
**TL;DR: Was a server at a wedding and was tasked with moving the cake. I dropped the cake. Potentially ruined the wedding, got fired and missed out on good money.**

###^(BASIC BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION)

**Name:** Eva Perez

**Alias:** Hive

**Age:** 19

**Appearance:** Eva is a young woman with tan skin, dark brown hair, and brown eyes. She's kind of thin (but fairly toned - she tries to work out regularly), and stands at about 5'5"". The only physical feature that really makes her look unique are the insect-like wings she can sprout, given to her by her powers, but she usually keeps them retracted. While she's on duty, she wears a bee-inspired [costume](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/55/f3/d1/55f3d16f262683b54d4ca517818881a7.jpg) with a [rebreather](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5b/Breathing_mask.png/revision/latest?cb=20110925154328) and [goggles](https://guideimg.alibaba.com/images/shop/105/02/11/0/large-yellow-lens-motorcycle-goggles-protective-riding-sunglasses_840210.jpg) to cover her face. When she's not being a superhero, Eva wears a lot of [trendy](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0f/23/bb/0f23bb665d92bcf07696ab88b5352a39.jpg) outfits, and likes to keep things [simple](https://i.warosu.org/data/fa/img/0110/75/1458554260045.jpg) but [fashionable](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-irV6HYkWKgc/VV1VQH21kfI/AAAAAAAAKXg/7IGSD1J3toU/s1600/neckbreakinstyle-black-and-gold.jpg).

**Mentality/Personality:** Eva is pretty much the epitome of the well-meaning but overly idealistic teenage superhero. She's smart, and is a very sweet and kind person, but can be kind of impulsive and rash sometimes due to her lack of experience. She's actually kind of shy and can be mildly socially awkward. Eva is also kind of a nerd, and half the reason she uses her powers as a superhero is because she read a few too many comic books and thought it would be a fun idea. In short, a good ten-point word to describe her would be ""quixotic"".

**Background:** The only daughter of a pair of Mexican immigrants, Eva had a pretty normal upbringing, but was always a little bit different. She was very smart, blowing her peers away in school, and couldn't keep her hands off of tools and toys. The little grocery store her dad ran owed some money to one of the local gangs, and when he couldn't pay them back, they tried to kidnap the then-14 year old Eva to hold as ""collateral"" until he could. Unfortunately for them, the life-or-death scenario triggered her meta gene, and she quickly managed to escape while swarming them with every dangerous bee, wasp, and spider in the general vicinity. She kept her powers hidden after that, but all the while practiced with them and used her smarts to try to make a superhero costume and gear for when she was ready. Five years later, she's finally been able to finish that dream, and is one of Platinum Bay's newest heroes - although that hero has to balance crimefighting with keeping her grades up so she won't lose her scholarship.

**Alignment:** Neutral Good

**Affiliation/Reputation:** Neither Eva nor Hive are household names or anything, but she might be recognized by some whether in or out of costume - she's gotten some minor media coverage as Hive for stopping a few bank robbers and muggers, and got some attention after doing well enough in school and being skilled enough to get a full scholarship to Platinum U.

**Resources:** She's a college student who works as an underpaid intern at a research lab, and has all the resources that brings - a crappy bike, a dorm room at Platinum University, and a rather meager salary. She's at Plat U on a scholarship and got a full ride, which gives her a bit more monetary freedom than most in her situation, but she still isn't made of money and had to save up for ages just to be able to make her current costume.

**Equipment/Weaponry:** Her costume projects a thin force-field, which she calls her ""Exoskeleton"", that can protect her from bullets ranging up to an average rifle round. Her gloves have ""Stingers"" built into them. Half taser, half blaster, these can either fire baseball-sized bolts of energy or discharge that energy on contact through a punch or strike. Either way, the effect is the same - the victim gets a nasty but nonlethal burn, and gets potentially loaded with more than 50k volts of electricity (a bit stronger than a high-tier taser, and more than enough to knock a normal person on their ass). Each stinger needs a 15 second cooldown to recharge after each use, but she has two, and makes the most of that by timing her shots and charged attacks carefully. Their shocks stack, so if she got both of her hands on someone and stung them at max power, they'd get pumped full of over 100k volts. On lower-tech notes, the pouches at the sides of her costume's thighs have three canisters that each contain about a dozen killer bees for when she needs to make a swarm fast for backup, and her costume's gas mask/rebreather is indeed functional, allowing her to venture into areas where smoke or poison inhalation would be an issue.

---

###^(POWERS AND SKILLS)

**Intended Tier:** Beta or Gamma

**Insectoid Physiology:**

 * Due to her mutation, in addition to her two main powers, Hive has a very different body structure than most humans. Her skin is tough enough to shield her from low-level attacks (although her costume provides most of her defense). Much like the insects she models herself after, her speed, reflexes, and proportional strength are also far greater than a human's. Most prominently, she has a pair of large wings on her back, although she can fold them into her body to look more normal. Finally, her senses are greater than a human's - her hearing, smell, and eyesight are about four times as strong as a regular person's.

**Bug Manipulation:**

 * This somehow extends past insects, and also encompasses arachnids, worms, and other simple creatures that are commonly called ""bugs"". Hive has a natural affinity for bugs, and can command them to do her bidding en masse. She can see through them while controlling them, which lets her use them as tiny scouts, and has both fine and gross control (she can control both single/few bugs and large swarms). Big swarms are harder to control for long periods of time and leave Eva feeling mentally drained afterward, and they have to be a reasonable size (she could do hundreds or even thousands of bugs at once, depending on their size, but she couldn't gather up all the flies in the city or anything). She can sense and control any bug within a 150 yard radius. Finally, the use of this power is limited by realism - she can only control bugs she can find or access. This means that she mostly sticks to bees, flies, ants, roaches, spiders... things that are common in the city. The only exotic or really dangerous bugs she can usually access are the killer bees she farms, which she usually carries a few dozen of at a time while in costume.

**Size-Changing:**

 * Eva can shrink down to two inches tall at her smallest, still keeping her usual form and proportions. She retains all of her powers, and is as strong and fast as she is at full-size, which makes shrinking useful for stealth, being hard to hit in fights, precision, and surprise attacks.

**Skills and Specialisations:** Eva is good at repairing tech and making things, but she isn't a master at it or anything. She's also very knowledgeable about insects, bugs, and biology in general, and is planning to become an entomologist once she graduates (which is fitting, considering her powerset). She's also taken up beekeeping as a minor hobby, and keeps a hive of [Africanized honey bees](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/wm/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/38/mj/p038mjcr.jpg) (or killer bees, as they're more commonly known). Thanks to her parents being immigrants, she can also speak both Spanish and English.

*     **Weakness:** Things that can shut down tech (technopaths, EMPs, etc.) can render her Stingers and Exoskeleton useless, which takes away a lot of her offensive power and makes her not too much tougher than a regular person. Things like wide swathes of fire or lasers can render any swarms of bugs she calls in useless (being literal insects, they go down fast).

---

###^('ATTRIBUTES')

**Strength:** Eva can lift around 10 tons, due to her proportional strength being increased - definitely superhuman, but low for her tier.

**Agility:** Eva can react at 75ms and run/fly at 450 mph.

**Intelligence/Wisdom:** She's nowhere near the level of a meta with enhanced intelligence, but Eva is very bright, especially about science and tech - she even got into Platinum U on a full scholarship. She's smart enough to make her own gear if given the resources, and knows a lot about entomology in specific. However, despite her knowledge, she's still young, impulsive, and not too wise yet.

**Combat Training:** Self-defense classes, and some training she's been doing at a local boxing gym, but she's not too impressive in this regard.

**Defense/Recovery:** Alpha tier outside of her costume. In it, she gets bumped up a bit higher, able to tank most pistol and some rifle rounds (so Beta in costume, I guess, and she'll usually be wearing it). She also, as a quirk of her physiology, can't get sick or poisoned.

**Offense/Danger:** Not much of a threat to large crowds or property, but she's pretty dangerous in a fight (albeit untrained). Aside from her increased physicals, she's very unpredictable and hard to see coming due to her speed and size changing, and her Stingers can pack a mean punch against those who can't handle them. Also, if she could get her hands on more dangerous bugs like bullet ants or poisonous spiders to control or work into a swarm, her threat level suddenly rises from ""inexperienced and gimmicky superhero"" to ""potential bringer of painful, unseen death and pestilence"".

~~I'm sorry about how annoying the bug control power probably is going to be to balance, and I'm definitely willing to rework/nerf it if need be, or give more specifics. I'd rather not cut it entirely, but I'm cool with doing it if it's just that hard to work with.~~"

Hi! This is my first post here so if I use any of the acronyms, etc incorrectly, please let me know! Also, I'm sorry if this is formatted weirdly; I'm on mobile! :) 

Anyway, I recently discovered this sub and was reading through a few of the posts, which got me thinking about my own mom. She isn't nearly as bad as most of the parents talked about here, which makes me feel lucky, but I am concerned she could be exhibiting N behavior. The more I thought about it, the more I kind of realized that any possible N behavior seems to have gotten worse the older I've gotten (I'm 21 btw), so if it is that I want to catch it before it gets to the degree that some parents mentioned here are at. 

My mom has always been controlling and very obsessed with appearances. I wasn't allowed to pick out my own outfits, room decorations, hairstyles, etc until around middle school, and even then they were all still very tightly controlled. One example is that in elementary school while most other kids just wore t-shirts and jeans or something similar to school everyday, I always had to wear dresses or skirts and blouses, etc and always had to have my hair done in some way and heaven forbid if it didn't have a bow in it. 

When I was in middle school she began (or at least this is when I noticed it happening, it could've started long before then) going through my room under the guise of cleaning it. I'm not sure what she was looking for or expected to find but it made me feel very invaded, like I didn't have any kind of space that was just mine. 

She's always been incredibly self conscious and blames her weight gain, and supposed inability to lose weight, on her pregnancy with me. She started in on the diet and exercise talk when I was probably 7 or 8 even though I've always been pretty healthy. She passed on those insecurities to me which culminated in a very long battle with anorexia and an ongoing battle with anxiety and depression. Even when I developed Trichotillomania as a way of coping with my anxiety, instead of talking to me or taking me to any kind of professional, she just gave me makeup to cover up the fact that I had very thin, sparse brows and next to no lashes. 

She, along with the majority of my family, are very religious. Not to a weird extent necessarily but just enough that anyone who has a differing opinion or who doesn't believe in God, etc is inherently wrong. I've never really cared about religion myself and honestly don't care if there is a God and when I insinuated this one day, she nearly started crying and got very angry and upset with me and said that she must've just failed at raising me. 

When I was 18 and away at college, I got my nose pierced which she still says is ugly and disgusting every chance she can. Same goes for my tattoos, which she only knows about because they're in areas that are hard to have covered up all the time. 

I've always been really artsy and am currently at college double majoring in Video Film Production and Studio Art with a concentration in drawing. I've already had internships and know what path I'm going to take once I graduate. I went into these majors knowing that the career options they lead to are competitive and unstable but I honestly feel pretty good about where I am. But I can tell she has no faith that I'll ever mange to be successful in them even though short films of mine have already been in various festivals and competitions, a few of which I've won. Same goes for my art. 
Adding to this, I've also always been very into makeup and enjoy doing unconventional, definitely not wearable or everyday looks. I've shown her pictures of a few and every time, she just tells me it's weird and ugly and she doesn't understand why I ""wasted my time doing that just to wash it off."" 

Like I mentioned earlier, I'm 21 but the ""I want grandkids!!"" comments have already started. I've never had any interest in having children, at least not for a good long while, which she knows but she still mentions grandkids whenever the opportunity arises. She says she deserves them and it's her right to have them. 

Those are the only major things I can think of right now but if I need to expand on anything, please let me know. 
Also, small side note: my dad has always been incredibly supportive of me and whatever it is I've ever dreamed of doing. He's always encouraged me to think outside of the box and to be my own person and always thinks the short films, drawings, or makeup looks I show him are wonderful. He's my very best friend and honestly, I have no clue how he and my mom ended up together. 

TL;DR: My mom has always been controlling and puts down my interests and I've been thinking about it recently and I'm concerned that she may be an N, or at least heading down that path. "
6gawdt,1,2017-06-09,Graduating High School In A Few Days... My Retrospective.,RazzyTaz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6gawdt/graduating_high_school_in_a_few_days_my/,"I'm Black 17M (18 in July.) Sorry for the long wall I just need to release my thoughts.

 It feels weird. I was excited to get out if high school a few days ago, but now, I don't know anymore.

 My freshman year I had plenty of friends, we'd hanged out and do shit and have fun. We lived in a Mostly Rural/Suburbia place, with farmers and hunters, and even an FFA (Farmer For America, they made delicious pork rinds and had a tiny farm on campus lol.) We even had a day where hunters were allowed to not go to school just to hunt for the day. It was probably the best year of my school life.

 My family decided to move to a bigger city, leaving my friends and everything I knew behind. I was excited to be in a new place and went from a school with 500 - 700 kids to one with +3,000, but I ended up becoming a loner, I would talk to people, but that's as far as it went. I would eat alone, and I just shut myself from the world. I just lost the ability to socialize, I was quiet, and when I became loud it would surprise the hell out of them.

 I'm a big guy (280lbs, recently loss 16lbs!) My family forced me to play football. I fucking hate football, it's not my thing, I'm half Jamaican and ""Soccer"" is what I enjoyed to play and watch along with other sports. They bribed me with a pup I named Leo, totally worth it. I was a Linebacker, gained muscle, met people, but again even on the team I stayed a loner.

 When that was over it was already my Senior year. I had contacts in my phone I never used, I didn't date anybody, I'm not confident, but only because of my weight, so I've been focusing on that for a while. One thing that I really regret was that a sort of friend of mine really pushed me to join the Rugby team, I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD ONE. I don't like football. Never did, but rugby was the shit. It was my first time playing and I loved the hell out of it. If only I had knew my sophomore year I probably would've gotten a scholarship lol.

 I knew what I wanted to do with my life, I wanted to become a 2D animator, long hours, but it can be a fun process. My family is okay with this, but they want me to get a back up career or degree. I agreed, but I wasn't sure what to do. Not only that, but I had to figure out how I was going to afford art school. There's no way in hell I was going into a rabbit hole of debt, especially fucking art school debt. I'm trying to be an artist not a fucking doctor lmao. I've been trying to figure out what I was going to do since Junior Year, and outside of my grades, this was the thing that stressed me out the most. I'm not living in a fantasy world, I knew I had to be realistic, 20k to 50k a year or even a fucking semester was INSANE. There were other routes, but I needed structure. 

 I've always been told, whether it was High School or College or Wherever, that everyone meets that one teacher/person that can change your life for the better. For my mom, it was a high school teacher, for my brother it was his speech therapist. For me it was my Senior Math Teacher,  Mrs. B. She's a math teacher, by day, and a Real Estate Investor and Owner of her own Financial Service Business the rest of the time. She had other merits, like computer engineering and other things, but that's not the point. I wanted to learn how to invest and get into real estate as well as be apart of the stock market. So I talked to her and she offered a paid internship to
learn how to do just that. If things go well I can definitely go to school where I want.

Another great thing is that I realized if I wanted a good college I could go to Canada, I can straight up get a great education for how much it cost for $20,000 total for all 4 years ($3,000 if you live in Canada.) That's how much it would cost for half a year in the states at an art school!

 I have a lot of regrets not making real friends, becoming quiet again or asking out people. Not losing weight, mostly just the social stuff.

 So why do I feel so weird? I'm not sure. When I look back my high school time wasn't that bad I was even apart of this, I guess association or society where we built a greenhouse from the ground up, and worked with community, and as a group it was all our idea and doing as students. We worked to get support to get grants and such from large corps like Lowes to small businesses across the city. It's an amazing achievement, we even get to wear medals and such as recognition at graduation.

 All though I feel like loser for not having friends at the end, sitting alone in group photos and lunch, I ended up doing things a lot of people don't try, I played Football and Rugby, Helped do a lot of digging, building, and cleaning on the greenhouse. I also was apart of the School's TSA (Technology Student Association.), and built a video game using 2D Animation. I made a ton of associates who, while were not friends, they do recognize who I am. And I took the first steps to reach my goals by talking with my teacher about having her be a mentor to me and how I can go to the college I want.

 I graduate in 4 days. I don't have to worry about grades anymore. I can focus on myself and I'm going to Community College either this fall or coming spring. I can focus on my weight, and my mentorship. I can make an effort to meet new people and socialize. Also I need to get my license lol.

I've had tons of family problems and fights over the years, ending in blood and distancing, and I think we just need space for a while, I plan to move out a some point in the next couple years. I don't want to end up like my brother, stuck here, working low wage jobs with no goals. I want to travel, draw, animate, own homes. I have the motivation and drive to change myself. Its all I've ever had. I was suicidal at one point in Middle School, and that pushed me to change even more, to want to do more.

I don't know what to fully expect, but I feel better about my future than I did a year or two ago.

 Compared to other stories I've heard I think I did a good job, yeah, I wish somethings were different, and I was pretty depressed,  but I feel like when I look back (even now) I can say at least made an effort to do something with myself instead of completely shutting away from the world.

I'm a software developer, i did a one year long internship in Antwerpen, learned a lot and improved so much that i was offered a great job in México(thats where i come from) in a pretty popular american company.

A year has passed and i'm already considering if there is a possibility to go back to Belgium because of how much i love it. i'm way better than when i was living and working in Antwerp regarding my developer skills...

But i have a question: i did an aiesec internship and that's how i got the permit to live in antwerp for an entire year and i was wondering if anyone knows if that helps to get an actual working visa?

Thank you for any information you could provide to me!"

6gcz17,22,2017-06-09,BREAKING: CNN to release Trump/Comey Tapes,TheBrodigalSon,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6gcz17/breaking_cnn_to_release_trumpcomey_tapes/,"""A source familiar with the investigation"" meets Rachel Maddow to give her the bombshell the MSM has been desperate for. 


The sound of gravel crunching under the tires of the Prius  couldn't drown out her galloping heartbeat. The grimy and long abandoned buildings loomed over her, derelict sentinels silently watching in the fading light.

Rachel Maddow checks her GPS, the screen flashed 341 Washington Avenue. ""ok I....think this is the place."" Rachel mutters to himself. As he gets out, the first thing she notices is the smell. A combination of cat piss and wet trash saturate her nostrils, she can feel the quinoa and fetus salad she had earlier rising in her throat. ""Stop it Rachel."" She thinks, ""You can do this, you have to see this through. Its far too important, and it's real this time."" 

Apprehension filled her as she replayed her conversation with un named source. ""Make sure you come alone."" That had been the last thing he had said over the phone. 
Her hand instinctively reached into her bag, and gently caressed the can of sustainably farmed, non GMO, organic pepper spray.  She didn't normally carry it, and hadn't listened to the clerk at the sporting goods store as he mansplained how to use it. His presence had been like a slap in the face. ""This is ridiculous."" She had thought while making her purchase. ""He's fucking a white male, they couldn't find somebody more diverse to work here? On my way back I'm going to stop in here and tell the manager that he literally raped me when handing me muh receipt."" 

An almost imperceptible movement catches her attention. Pivoting to her left, she sees a haggard looking man cautiously stepping out from a darkened doorway. ""Jesus Christ."" She gasped. ""You fucking scared me!"" The man regarded her for a moment, before speaking. ""You should be scared."" He said. ""America is on the brink of destruction, and I can prove it."" Rachel felt almost dizzy with anticipation. ""How bad is it, really?"" She asked. ""It's worse than you can possibly imagine."" He replied. ""It's true, it's all true. The Russians, the death camps for minorities and lgbyqrf$'s, the pussy grabbing, pissgate, deportations. It's all on the tapes."" 

Rachel could feel herself beginning to smile. ""I knew it. I FUCKING knew it. And that bastard had the nerve to call us Fake News. I'll have the last laugh, I'll show him. Everyone knows it was Hillary's turn, now she'll get her chance."" The man reaches into his trenchcoat and produced a battered manila folder. ""Two of my operatives died to get this information, I just want you to know that."" He growled. And she could smell stale whiskey on his breath. ""But the truth must come to light. There is one condition, however. And if you don't do exactly as I say, I can't let you have this."" 

Rachel eyed the envelope greedily. ""Anything, name it."" She breathed. ""Alright."" He replied. ""The contents of this tape are of the upmost sensitivity. For this reason, this tape absolutely cannot be played until the time is right. We have reason to believe that Trump rigged this tape with a self destruct mechanism, it can only be played once, and it must be played live for the entire nation to see. Assume everyone you know has been compromised. Trust only Wolf Blitzer, everyone knows that CNN is the most credible news source. You must take this tape to CNN headquarters, and play it during Wolfs show. It's all been arranged."" 

Wordlessly Rachel took the envelope and returned to the Prius. She probably would have had a nicer car, but Gender Pay Gap meant that she only made 275k per month. A paltry sum for a journalist of her talents and reputation. ""Fucking white male privilege."" She thought. ""After this story breaks ill get a new car."" 

Fifteen minutes later she arrived outside the CNN building, leaving the Prius idling in the Fire Lane. She dashed inside, past the security guards. The receptionist looked up from her halal lunch wrap. ""Sir! Sir! You need to sign in! SIR, you can't go through there!"" Rachel barely heard. Reaching the elevator, she frantically mashed the button for Wolfs floor. He was going live in 2 minutes, she could already hear the CNN breaking news alert theme playing. ""Fuck fuck fuck come on!"" She screamed at the elevator. When the doors finally opened she burst out into the studio lobby. ""Wolf! Wolf! I need to speak to Wolf Blitzer!"" She yelled. She saw a security guard moving towards her, could hear his radio squawking out her description ""White male, approximately five feet, two inches. Dark hair. 130lbs. Last seen heading for the 19th floor."" She sprinted for the hallway, she couldn't stop now. 

Suddenly she felt a strong hand grip her shoulder. ""Don't you fucking touch me!"" She yelped, struggling against the mans hand. ""WOLF! WOLF IVE GOT IT, Get OFF of me REEEEE!!!"" She screamed. At that moment, Wolf Blitzer walked out of a conference room. ""Let her go."" He said quietly, his voice dripping with menace. He cut an imposing figure as he strode towards them. His 5'9 frame sending the security guard scrambling backwards. 

""Cutting it close Rachel."" Wolf said. ""The nation can't wait much longer, its about to implode as we speak. Let's get this tape out, if it's even half as good as I think it is, Trump will be arrested by dawn."" Breathless, feeling as if she were in a dream, she followed Wolf to the production room. ""Activate the Emergency Broadcast System."" Wolf thundered at an intern, who almost tripped over a discarded pussy hat. 

The big screen in the corner glowed to life as the EBS blared across the country. Every Starbucks in the country was suddenly silenced, as the customers and employees stared at their screens. ""My fellow alternatively citizenshipped residents of America."" Wolf began. ""My esteemed colleague Rachel Maddow and I, are coming to you tonight with Breaking News. We have received an exclusive copy of the Trump Files from a source that is extremely familiar with the thinking of current and former officials. We believe that the contents of this tape, will provide damning and conclusive evidence, that Trump both engaged in collusion with Russia, and derailed an investigation led by Former Director Comey. We would ask you all for your undivided attention, as we are about to play, for the first time, this exclusive tape. 

Wolf placed the cassette into the Sony Walkman that the tech guys had set up. His fingers trembled as he read the masking tape label. ""Trump Investigaton, Eyes Only. Classified Covfefe"" written in sharpie. ""Got you now you bastard."" Wolf whispered, looking over at Rachel. He could see tears starting to form behind her problem glasses. ""You want to do the honors?"" He said. Silently, Rachel guided a trembling finger towards the Sony. It hummed to life as she pressed the PLAY button. Voices could be heard in the background, faintly at first, but steadily growing louder. Rachel's breath was quickening, she could feel her cock beginning to twitch under her pantsuit. She could see that Wolf was already fully erect. 

A familiar voice began to come over the speakers. The presidents voice. Rachel noticed that Wolf had unzipped his fly, his cock was out. He was stroking it furiously. She looked down, and was only slightly surprised to find herself doing the same. ""Director Comey, if you wouldn't mind, I need a moment of your time."" The Presidents voice was unmistakable. Rachel's breath was coming in ragged gasps now. This was it. She could feel it. ""I want to talk about loyalty."" Trump said. ""Yes Mr. President."" Comey replied. ""I need to know that you will be loyal to the office to which you were appointed, and to the country you serve."" Trump said. ""Mr. President, I'm not prepared to make that kind of..."" Comey trailed off. ""Director Comey, you need to answer me, I have proven my loyalty to the People, and I need you to do the same."" said President Trump. 

Rachel found herself close to cumming, she couldn't ever remember her cock being so hard. She wondered if it would ever be that hard again. Wolf was sweating profusely, his member looked like a button on a gray fur coat. It was the first election he had managed to get since 1974 and he wasn't going to waste it. 

""Mr. P..p..puh President, it w w would  be inappropriate for me to g g give.."" Comey stammered. College campuses and art studios across the country had ground to a halt as CNN played on every channel. All other channels, of course, had been declared racist and banned three weeks ago. 

""GIVE! GIIIVE!!!!!."" Trump roared over the tape. Down the hall, someone fainted in the genderqueer bathroom. 

""YOU KNOW NOTHING OF GIVING!"" Trumps voice was like an entire pride of lions. ""I AM PREPARED TO GIVE EVERYTHING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! THEY KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER GONNA GIVE THEM UP, NEVER GONNA LET THEM DOWN, NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND DESERT THEM. NEVER GONNA MAKE THEM CRY, NEVER GONNA SAY GOODBYE, NEVER GONNA TELL A LIE AND HURT THEM!""

Realization began to dawn over Maddow. ""No, this can't be, he couldn't..."" She looked over just in time to see Wolf streaking towards the window. He ran towards it like a man possessed. Crashing through the glass, he hung in space for a split second before plummeting to earth. 

The knowledge that she had just been RickRolled by the president hung over her like a cloud of choking chlorine gas. ""First the tax returns and now this!"" She wailed. She began to hear a sound, like 1000 starving crows. It was faint at first, but growing louder. Vaguely she realized that she had shit herself. She staggered to the elevator, and emerged a few moments later on the street. Her Prius was long gone, it had been culturally re-appropriated by some vibrant youths. She never even realized she had stumbled onto the train tracks. The impact of the train was so sudden that she never even felt it. By the time the paramedics arrived, she was dead. Bleeding from her eyes...bleeding from her...wherever. Strangely, the train was never located. Witness statements indicated that the train never applied its brakes.

However, in order to enroll during the summer, it costs around 1.5 grand. That's essentially the money I earn throughout the whole internship this summer. So what's the point of even signing up for that class? I feel like it's just better to not get the credits and just be happy that I'm gaining work experience. If anyone could shed some light on whether enrolling in CSE 496 is necessary or not to earn credits, that would be much appreciated. Thank you."
6gd8o6,22,2017-06-09,The Funeral of Metropolitan Iakovos,StavrosMcGee,OrthodoxChristianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/6gd8o6/the_funeral_of_metropolitan_iakovos/,"As a few of you might know, last week the GOA Metropolitan Bishop of Chicago passed away, Metropolitan Iakovos. His funeral was today. I have no one in my real life to share my experiences with (although one of my best friends, who is Catholic, was very sympathetic), and this and Instagram are as close as I'll get to a blog, so I figured I would ask you all to gather around and read my observations. 

The Divine Liturgy before the funeral started at around 7:30. I was significantly late, finally getting to the cathedral by train &amp; cab by 9:00. There was already standing room only at that point. There was a police presence all up and done the block and the Archons were stationed on the steps to welcome us all in. I had brought my raso to see if someone would give me, a nobody, permission to chant, and to my great honor, I got it. I waited until between the end of liturgy &amp; beginning of the funeral when the priests went to vest and I knocked on St. Gabriel's door with my robe in hand. The Metropolitan of San Francisco just happened to be walking by and I knelt down and held it up, asking him to bless it. He did, and then in English ""who are you, my son?"" I just said ""student"" in Greek because I didn't feel like now was the time to explain I was an unemployed college graduate, and he smiled and I went to the cantor's stand.

There were 15 people there at the cantors' stand, all priests, monks, and seminarians save for two elderly congregants. They both thought I was a priest and tried to get me to stand up at the cantor's stand but I explained I wasn't and they laughed and said we'd stand in back. I was right behind a floral arrangement, so I had to at point peel back the leaves to see. An older priest next to me was asking me to name every bishop. We had bishops from all over there: the OCA, Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the US, a younger bishop from France, the Albanian Autocephalous Church, and other metropolitanates in the archdiocese. Each bishop read part of the service, alternating between Greek &amp; English. One bishop from memory said his portion in Albanian, and everyone from the cantors' stand was looking around in order to guess the language.

The funeral was shorter than I expected. I was thinking it would be 5-6 hours but it was only from about about 10:30-12:45. Archbishop Demetrios was there as well, and he read His All Holiness' personal thoughts on His Eminence, and then he spoke from the heart, having known him for 70 years when they were both at the Athens Theological School. The Metropolitans of Denver &amp; Boston spoke as well, as did Fr. Stamatios. I did feel at one point that I was going to tear up, but everyone around me was so stoic and the entire message throughout the service was that in Christ's there's hope, so I kept it together. 

The coming together after His Eminence's passing was also quite noticeable. There had to be 100 priests there (but I'm terrible at estimating the size of crowds). Every single priest that I know was there, vested in white and gold to show rejoicing, not mourning. Every bishop gave their last sendoff. They each kissed the hand and the gospel that His Eminence will be buried with, and then the foreign religious representatives, then the priests, then we of the psaltiri/cantors' stand, then the congregation. 

Everyone was in surprisingly good spirits when I went behind the iconostasis to get my blazer. There were no tears. To my surprise, bishops were coming up to talk to *me*, which was flattering. Metropolitan Savvas and I talked and he asked me about school and this internship with the Archdiocese I'm waiting to here back from, &amp; my ethnic background because my surname isn't Greek, and he laughed and said that according to a DNA test he had done, he was 52% Italian. Everyone was supportive of each other, even to me, and I definitely thought I shouldn'tve been there since the other two lay cantors that day were like in their 80's, but no, on the contrary.

For those of you who don't know, Metropolitan Iakovos was the son of Asia Minor refugees and hid a Jewish lady and her daughter with his mother in their  apartment in occupied Athens when he was 14-18 (he never mentioned his connextion to the Holocaust before &amp; I definitely asked him about his life in Athens before he moved to the US), was the head of Holy Cross Seminary, and he founded the first Orthodox charity in the US to help AIDS victims, just to name a few of his accomplishments.

I met him when I was 14 and I started volunteering at the cathedral's soup kitchen to get service hours for my incoming freshman year. I saw him every Thanksgiving for eight years as well on major holidays. I was actually going to go to a concert of Asia Minor music on the 30th that he was hosting for the Fall of Constantinople. He fell ill the next day. I regret not going. His Eminence was the one who got me back into photography and off of iPhone photos for good. He did know who I was but towards the end of his life, he was blind. Last Thanksgiving, he asked me who I was and we got to chatting again and I told him I had brought my camera and asked if he wanted a picture with the volunteers. He nodded his head no and say ""ba! [which means ""no"" in Greek] As long as it's not an iPhone camera. No iPhone photos, they're very bad. Only a real camera, no iPhones, no iPhone photos."" It was in that moment that I realized ""yeah, you know, iPhone photos really *are* bad. I actually like photography a lot."" I told him it was the DSLR I brought to Transfiguration Monastery when he asked if I could be the photographer for vespers that evening, which I was honored to be able to do. We had a good laugh about it. He also was the one who told me not to fear applying for an internship in Constantinople. I confided in him that I was afraid of Islamic terrorism &amp; dying there if I stayed for longer than a week, and he told me never be afraid. He himself had been going once a month that year to discuss policy at St. George's. I never did follow through, but I took those words to never feel travel at heart. I have been back to the Patriarchate once since then. 

After the funeral ended, a lot of people conversed on the church steps. I saw someone from my high school, from college, my first tutor of chanting, childhood parish priests, family friends, and volunteers. It was a beautiful turnout. I had some bad intel that the mayor would be there, but the city's reps were lowkey and wore nametags. I didn't recognize any of them. I don't think they were directly from City Hall; I think they were sent from the offices of some of the aldermen. On top of that, there were two Catholic bishops (wore wore a magenta vestment, one wore a red one. I think the latter might've fallen asleep at one point, but they they did kiss His Eminence's hand like we did whereas the Anglican rep just quickly crossed himself by the casket and walked off real fast), an Anglican rep in a magenta raso, &amp; a Malankara Orthodox bishop. 

Archbishop Iakovos called him a «Θεοπρεσβευτής», a ""God Ambassador."" That sums his Eminence up quite well. Ζωή σε μας.

I want to be far away from everyone/everything.   I don't feel I can be happy anymore.  This is not at all what I wanted in life but I'm so fearful of change.

Sorry for the long rant.. I am so totally alone i have to let it out to strangers.

I spent the past semester interning at the company, and last month (May 3rd), one of my supervisors told me that they'd have a position opening up in a few weeks and that they wanted me to fill the position. As a result, I vowed to quit smoking then and there, so the last time I smoked was almost exactly 38 days ago (probably around 3am on that Wednesday). 

I basically smoked daily without any real breaks from December 2014 until January 3rd of this year, and then I quit from Jan 3rd until around February 4th in case the internship drug tested me (they didn't). I smoked multiple times a day, but usually just smallish one hitters until May 3rd. In those 3 months, I went through *maybe* 12g at the absolute most, but probably closer to 8-10.

My metabolism is average at best and I'm not in the best of shape, but I've been consistently passing [these](https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Marijuana-Single-Panel-Tests/dp/B00E5O5EV2) drugs tests with increasingly darker lines since at least around May 23rd. At first they were suuuuuuuper faint, but by the 28th or so, they started to get pretty dark. I've been taking them almost daily, including the first pee of the day, and I haven't failed once. 

Tonight, after drinking a decent amount of water to dilute the pee a bit (still yellow but on the lighter side), the test line was almost as dark as the control line.

I'm praying that the company didn't request a 20ng/ml test from the lab because I'd probably be fucked, but assuming it's 50ng, I should be good, right? I went from being calm and confident that I'd pass to psyching myself out by spending the past few hours reading about people failing drug tests.

tl;dr haven't smoked in 38 days, smoked about 10g from early Feb to early May, consistently passing 50ng home drug tests for about two weeks and am stressing that I still might fail a pre-employment drug test today."

I used to feel motivated (and excited) to look out for internship opportunities and learning new things online. However, I have suddenly lost that drive...
 
I have also lost that energy to connect with other people. It doesn't help that my ex boyfriend and I belong to the same social circle, so  I can't exactly behave like myself when I am talking in the group chat that we have online.
I feel like I used to genuinely be happy with myself. I felt like I knew what I was doing, I was truly happy with the quality of my life. Now I just feel alone, useless... I don't picture my future to be as wonderful as I used to.

I am a closeted 23 year old and i have this crush on a guy in my workplace who seems to be straight, because he has a girlfriend. However, I just noticed that he always stares at me, like everytime I glance at him, his eyes are already at me. though we're not in the same office, we pass by each other within the company premises, and I also notice that he acts a bit awkward when we pass by each other like in the hallway or something. He's so masculine and really doesnt look gay but my gaydar really senses him, like you know, it takes one to know one. LOL. Recently I have been trying to not look at him just to avoid seeing him staring at me again. There is also one time we passed by each other in the cafeteria and he's with his girlfriend, and he's talking to her but his eyes are on me which is really weird. It's realy confusing and hard for me as we always see each other at work. So I just want to know your opinions as this has been getting in my head already. Sometimes I just want to confront him already but I am really not the type of person who makes the first talk especially if we do not know each other personally. Do you think there's a possibility that he's gay? His stares are not the type of stare that straight guys do like if they want to punch you in the face or something. And honestly, I know myself that I dont really look like a guy that gay guys would be attracted to, as I have a baby face and doesnt look my age. I sometimes was being mistaken for an intern. lol  Maybe u guys have experienced the same thing so I just wanted to know how I can handle this. "

I just finished my first year of college, and throughout it I've noticed some things that have changed in me that I don't remember being in high school. First, I use to have a very good memory. I was always good with birthdays, names, faces, dates, etc. In the past year I've seen myself becoming very, very forgetful. Even forgetting my own mother's birthday, and my girlfriend's as well, forgetting that I work on certain days, forgetting even that I had just done something and went to do it again. It never happened to me as a kid or even throughout high school.

Something else that has changed in me is my complete inability to focus on anything for more than 10-15 minutes. In school, at work, I use to absolutely adore watching movies as well, but now I'm constantly pulling my iPhone out and losing interest and focus on what I'm doing. It's caused my grades to drop severely and has gotten me scolded at my office internship job a few times. I could be staring my boss or professor in the face while he's talking, but my mind is having these sporadic, nonsense trains of thought that I have no control over. And again, this never used to happen to me, I was a high-ranked student, around 60 out of a class of 500.

Finally, the major thing I've noticed in my changing is I just don't care anymore about most things. I don't care that my grades are dropping, I haven't even registered for classes this fall. I don't care if I get scolded by my boss or if someone gets mad that I forgot a birthday or something, it just doesn't bother me anymore. I use to care so much about people, and people's feelings, but recently I just haven't cared at all. I've noticed myself not helping people with things, not holding doors, even little things like that I just don't care enough to help people.

After seeing all this in myself, I want to change but I just don't know what to do. I've been told to start working out, get my energy up but that hasn't worked in the month that I've done it. I've tried just changing myself and trying to care more, but I can't keep it consistent. I just don't know what to do. Any suggestions?"
6gglzy,39,2017-06-10,How do I [24/M] handle this situation with my coworker [24/f],UCLAfan0,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6gglzy/how_do_i_24m_handle_this_situation_with_my/,"To start off, let me say that I'm a helpful person by nature. I volunteer a lot, help friends and family, etc... but others have told me that I need to learn to put myself first and they have pointed out times that I have been taken advantage of. 


I have been working at my firm for 2.5 years now and I'm quickly rising through the ranks. 6 months ago we hired the girl in my title. While book smart, she isn't very good thinking on her feet and her social cues are way off. The social stuff honestly has me wondering sheltered, drugs, or honestly mild autism. She says and does very inappropriate things at times. 



She instantly began struggling and I was assigned to be her go to person for 1 month. It was hard, juggling my work and hers, but I thought I put her on a good path after the month. Since then I have been told by management she is regressing and they will have to think long and hard about her future come the fall. This upsets me as over the month I became friends with her. I just really don't understand her issues. Some days she is on and others it's like she forgets everything. 




So for the past 2 months, while not officially her go to person, I have been helping her again. She has lead to me having to work longer/weekends to get my stuff done. But I really didn't mind as I like helping and we were friends.



Well our firm had a party about a month ago where things get wild when the bill is tens of thousands of dollars. I walked in on her and an intern girl making out in front of 2 other coworkers. As a male, I wanted to stay, watching 2 hot chicks make out is a dream, but at a company function I did not want to be associated with this at all, so I went back to the bar. At the bar I sat with another female intern who I was close with. She knew as soon as I sat down what I walked into (idk how). She then tells me how the girl in the title is sleeping with one of those guys who is watching her make out. I go no way.... As the guy is married (and probably the person im closet too at work) and she is engaged. This other girl then proceeds to show me texts from the girl admitting to cheating and screenshots etc... 


Shocked, I still shrug it off. None of my business and I don't want the drama. And the intern who told me is no longer with the firm and is back at school.



Fast forward to Wednesday evening and a few of us from work go to the bar to watch the NBA finals. Eventually the people dwindled down to me, the guy who was cheating, and the girl who I help/cheater. Instantly they both corner me with accusations that I know of their affairs and who have I told. At first I deny deny (I figure the girl who told me eventually told one of them she told me...). But eventually I cave and tell them both that it's getting pretty obvious and soon people beyond me will figure it out. That I'm not telling anyone, but they need to either think about their personal lives and career and stop, or to do a better job hiding it if that's their desires. The guy understands where I'm coming from and is just very concerned that if anyone else knows or have I heard anything. He is also a tad bit upset I didn't tell him I knew a month ago......


The girl on the other hand is calling me names, a liar, saying I get off on knowing secrets, that I can't be trusted etc... whole time the guy is telling her to shut up while he tries to calmly talk to me. Eventually I can't take her anymore and realize I don't have to put up with this and I leave. 



Next day he tells me he thought about what I said and appreciates my concern. Her on the other hand calls me over to help her. I do thinking I'll at least get an apology. Nope. Then Friday same thing. And I help her.  I think she may be trying to fish if I'm cool, because she kept coming over to my cube to shoot the shit. Which she has never done before. I remained short, but professional.


Deep down I'm mad. I've never been talked to like that before. Especially in a public place and in front of another mutual person. Then she still has the balls to have me help her the next two days and I do it.... now I'm mad at myself. Am I wrong to tell her I'm done helping her? I have 0 obligation to. The problem is I know if I don't she will be fired in the future. And that weighs on me. But it just really boils my blood that I'm going out of my weigh for a person who called me every name in the book.

I come from a pretty poor family, and with the help of the Internet I've managed to go back to school after dropping out, lose 130 lbs, start lifting and overall have more success than I've ever experienced in my life. 

I'm about 1 year from graduating university with my degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering. After working my butt off for years, I'd say that I'm a pretty competent software engineer. This is evident, by the fact that I got invited to intern back at the same robotics lab I interned at last summer and get paid for it. My passion is programming robots, science, and space.  

Ever since I've been a kid I've always wanted to be a scientist, and my ultimate goal is to acquire my Ph.D. no matter what. I'm 27 right now, and about 4 years ago something finally clicked where I finally decided to develop the discipline to try and become the best version of myself. It's been a long journey and last January I finally found my passion, programming robots. 

I managed to pick it up fairly quickly due to becoming obsessed with something useful for the first time and really enjoying the challenge. I managed to land a research internship last summer, and for the first time I found a place where i felt like I belonged. I had never experienced this before; for most of my life I've always felt like a burden on my family. I worked really hard and had an amazing time. I was exposed to amazing and super smart people and it was really inspiring to be part of a group of people working on cutting edge technology. 

This February I was invited to come back and work with them again this summer, and it was honestly one of the best feelings ever. It was hard evidence for me that I was good at something. 

I go to school in the bay area as well and have really focused a lot on networking and improving my social skills. Through this, I have been rewarded opportunities like never before. I got a few job offers a couple of robotics start ups and now I'm in a bit of a dilemma. 

More than likely I'm going to get offered a Ph.D. position at the university I'm interning at, and I think I'm going to take it. The thing is, this is the only place where I have extensive experience programming robots and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a very competitive grad school application and could probably go to most schools for grad school. I could also start my career and get paid multiple times more than I could being a Ph.D. researcher. I've never had the opportunity to make so much money (for me), and so I think I'll be happy getting paid what most grad students get paid, but at the same time I'm young and can always go to grad school. Maybe I should work full time after I graduate and make a lot of money and enjoy myself before I start a Ph.D. program. 

At the same time, I feel a sense of loyalty to this lab. I really enjoy being a part of a group where we are all working towards the same thing. Almost like I finally found my tribe in a way. Every day I come in to work, the day flies by and next thing I know the day is over! 

I'm not sure what I want to do after I acquire my Ph.D. because there are awesome opportunities everywhere. My lab has many connections with NASA so I could be a part of NASA robotics, or go into academia and do research. I do really enjoy teaching people as well as solving hard problems and doing things that haven't been done before. I'm honestly not sure what path to take, but I think my gut is telling me to stick with the group of people I've bonded with. These are people that could be friends for life. 

I feel a bit bad talking about how lucky I am, but I feel really grateful at this point in my life. Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this. "
6gif56,155,2017-06-10,"[Meta] On Rule #0 and suggesting ""Meme Mondays""",tajjet,ProgrammerHumor,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6gif56/meta_on_rule_0_and_suggesting_meme_mondays/,"Hi everyone,

I'm /u/tajjet, one of several new mods. We're a few days in to our roster change. One thing the mod team has discussed internally is how strictly to enforce Rule #0:

&gt;For a submission to qualify it must satisfy at least one of the following:

&gt;0. The content disregarding the title and superimposed text must be directly related to programming or programmers. [\(\*\)](https://redd.it/2y7lfl) [\(\*\)](https://redd.it/30tio4) [\(\*\)](https://redd.it/320wna) [\(\*\)](https://redd.it/3ft1rr)
&gt;1. The title or superimposed text must substantially enhance the content such that it can stand on its own as an analogy to programming. Note that programming here is interpreted in a narrow sense, an analogy to something related to programming, feelings about programming, reactions to programming etc. is not considered sufficient. [\(\*\)](https://redd.it/392xgy) [\(\*\)](https://redd.it/39t2jf)

The intent of this rule is to prevent low-effort content in the formats of reaction gifs or image macros. Such content is upvoted mostly by newer users and prevents higher-effort content from gaining the attention it deserves. Please see the meta posts indicated by asterisks on the rule above if you'd like to see more reasoning as to why Rule #0 exists as it does today.

Here are a few recently popular posts that were removed for violating Rule #0:

0. [Internship season](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6fnsz5/internship_season/)
1. [When someone tells you not to use underscores in variable names](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6frb9h/when_someone_tells_you_not_to_use_underscores_in/)
2. [Developers know the pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6fmqr3/developers_know_the_pain/)
3. [Waiting for a programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6ftksd/waiting_for_a_programmer/)
4. [Perhaps I'm too young?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6fm209/perhaps_im_too_young/)

These posts violated Rule #0, and we will continue to enforce the submission rules as they stand. However, judging by the scores those posts received and the reaction to their removal, posts in these formats are popular.

I'd like to suggest ""Meme Mondays,"" allowing programming-related image macros or reaction images every Monday. This would allow posts like those above to have an audience on our subreddit on Mondays, but limit them as usual during the rest of the week so that high-effort posts aren't crowded out.

As a result, we would more strictly enforce Rule #0 during the rest of the week. Since we now have a larger mod team, posts are already less likely to slip through the cracks. Overall, we think this idea will strike a good compromise between allowing popular content and encouraging high-effort posts.

Please let us know in the comments what you think of this idea. Any suggestions on how to improve Rule #0 are also welcome.

Thanks!"

6gj0pk,2,2017-06-10,Semi-recent graduate looking for general debt/refinancing advice,Jaeyx,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6gj0pk/semirecent_graduate_looking_for_general/,"Hello, so quick run through of background info. I graduated from UConn with an Actuarial Science degree in December 2015. Due to a lack of internship experience, and impending student load payments, I pretty much accepted the first job I was offered (August 2016). 55K salary, had to move to NH. Associate financial analyst position. Basically accounting/budgeting stuff. Mechanically not much of a challenge for my degree, but definitely had/have a lot to learn about corporate environment and accounting and what not.


Edit: Guess I could add I passed 2 actuarial exams while in college.


Anyways, on to the debt. I graduated with about 70K in student loans. 40K federal (interest ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%. 4.62 average), and the rest personal cosigned by a relative averaging 8.24%. My federal ones are in ""graduated repayment"" (ie less now, increased every 2 years) since I set them up prior to getting offered the job. Personal are level. Once I got the job up here, and sign on bonus, I purchased a car. Loan is another 15K at 6%. 


So, down to the month by month. After deductions and 401K up to maximum matching are deducted I take home $791/week. So averages $3,400 per month. 


Expenses:


*$65 Cable


*$66 Cellphone


*$60 gym (Rock Climbing)


*$35 electric


*~$200 Food


*$263 Personal student loans


*$285 Federal student loans


*$271 Car payments


*$1140 Rent


*$150-$175 Misc (gas, rent insurance, pet stuff, ect)


Average monthly expenses: $2900


Average saved $500


Banked: $11K


So, most of these financial decisions were made over a year ago. Looking at them now and how things have panned out, I see the clear issues (especially after lurking around here for a few weeks). My rent is way more than I should be paying to live alone. Unfortunately I had to move to a new state on short notice, and gave up on finding a roomate after a few months, since I was able to pay the bills. Wish I kept looking for one. Then there's the car. After junker to junker I just wanted something that would be a long long long term car. So went for something new that wouldn't leave me negative in monthly payments. In hindsight, I should probably have gone for a 10K rather than 18K vehicle. (Although if my rent were halved, I'd be okay maybe). 


That's the gist of it though. My current job had a clause where if I left in the 1st year, I had to return my bonus (5K). So now that I'm approaching my 1 year, I've begun applying for positions back in CT. Problem is, I'm not going to find something before I have to resign my lease. Which means when I do find something, I'll likely have to take a hit to break the contract. Plus side is I will be able to live back with parents for 3-400, rather than $1,140. The other problem is that I can't really go roomate hunting when I could end up leaving at pretty much any time... don't want to screw someone over. I think I'm kind of just stuck with the high rent until I find a new job. So overall, I think I got slightly greedy, but not so bad that I can't make payments. Just enough that paying back debt is a lot slower than it needs to be. Not too worried about getting through it in the long run, but I'd appreciate any advice in the matter. The most obvious line I see is that I now have a year of credit history, it's time to see if I can get these interest rates dropped. They are pretty huge compared to most of what I see talked about on here. I'm just not sure the best way to go about it. Or how to in general. The personal student loans and the car loan are the biggies, but the federal I might have to leave as are due to the graduated payment plan. I use that if I consolidate. I don't know if I can get lower interest rate without making them non-federal anymore? Any advice would be appreciated, going to stop this wall of text now though!"
6gj2cx,30,2017-06-10,Lonely in a new city,thelastbarista,ABCDesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/6gj2cx/lonely_in_a_new_city/,"Background: I grew up and went to school on the West Coast, and just moved to the midwest for work. For reference, I'm male, since I know that makes a difference in experience when moving on your own. 

I just moved to a new city for work, and man it is tough. This is my first big move that I'm doing entirely on my own. When I went to college, I moved just one state over and my parents helped me move in. I didn't have to worry about a support system, since everything is insular in college. My friends were basically given to me - I could just walk up to other freshmen and make friends that way. I loved it, I was great at that. I met my best friend my first day of college. I was really lucky, because I've heard horror stories from other people about trying to make friends in college.

After undergrad, we all dispersed across the country. I ended up back in my hometown for grad school. Once again, I wasn't really out of my comfort zone - I had a few scattered friends left from my childhood, so I could meet up and hang out with them periodically. And of course I had my parents around. I was able to focus entirely on school, with worrying too much about my social life.

I relocated to Minneapolis last month for work, and I underestimated how hard this would be. I thought to myself, I've moved before and I've experienced hardship before. I work minimum wage for 2 years to put myself through grad school. I can do this.

It's harder than I imagined. I'm writing this from the AirBnB I've been cooped up in for the past month, because my apartment lease doesn't start until mid July. The hosts have been gracious and welcoming, but I can't help but feel I've over-stayed my welcome. I mean I'm paying for everything so I shouldn't feel that way, but still. It's uncomfortable to live in a stranger's home for so long. I didn't anticipate that.

I work for a fantastic company that does inspiring work, but my job role is not what I thought it would be. I hate to use the phrase, but it feels like a bait-and-switch. I was promised a lot of great things about this job, and was promised a great deal of latitude in personal development. So as soon as I got here, I started signing up for trainings and events. After attending a few, I get a harsh email from my manager telling me I am not permitted to attend ""any trainings, symposia, etc"" because of my contracting status. I was shocked at first. How can any decent manager deny those kinds of opportunities to their employees? They must know how stifling that is to a young professional! I have managed before (albeit in retail), but I am fully aware of how demoralizing that kind of talk is. I was very aware of how I spoke with my employees, because I never wanted to discourage their aspirations. 

It frustrates me, because I had this same status in my previous role (with the same company), and was treated just like a regular employee. I even got to travel for work, as an intern. This is not the case in my new role. In fact, I'm commonly referred to as a ""resource"". I've worked in companies and know that's just terminology, but I have a fucking name. Call me by that. I know it's hard to say for y'all American folk, but make a fucking effort to say my name, and say it fucking correctly, please. I feel like I'm treated like dirt here, which I am extremely unhappy about. I didn't schlep 2000 fucking miles to have my new manager claim to be to busy to even speak to me or entertain any notion of career development. 

I've had a lot of varied experiences in life, both good and bad, so I know the bad will pass. I am doing my best to be patient. I play guitar when I can to destress, and exercise frequently. I read. I watch Netflix. But I have rarely felt this lonely in my life. I'm doing my best to network and meet people at work, but I miss having friends I can go to a bar with and drink with and discuss life. It will come with time, but the interim sucks. I have no good friends in this city. I have one family friend, and they live 40 minutes away.

I know this is a wall of text, and I apologize. Sometimes, I write these things to myself. I guess I could use some advice, or even someone to commiserate with. 

And since I'm an eternal optimist (which may be why all this is so hard), I will end with this: I love Minneapolis. I picture myself living here for a long time. It's a beautiful city, and while the winters are harsh, I will take it in stride and learn to cope. The downtown is eclectic and interesting, and I've been spending my weekends exploring the city. The people here are cordial and kind, and the amount of goodwill I've experienced makes me want to cry sometimes. I look forward to spending many years here and getting to know this beautiful city. 

TLDR: Feeling boxed in, was promised one thing at work and getting something completely different, and feel like I have no support system. Yes whiny millennial blah blah, so if you see it like that then please don't read or respond. But honestly, I'm 25 and not that experienced in life, so I'm willing to expose myself as naive if it means I can get some words of advice and maybe a few kind words. I could really use some motivation right now. "
6gj5ah,28,2017-06-10,Zellner's theory of the crime,super_pickle,StevenAveryIsGuilty,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/6gj5ah/zellners_theory_of_the_crime/,"Obviously, the blood needs to be explained.  Zellner goes through great lengths detailing that Colborn *could not* have planted the blood, because he was at a meeting by 8pm and did not have time.  For some insane reason, she didn't bother checking Ryan's alibi too.  Ryan was at Teresa's house with her friends and LE.  Avery has submitted an affidavit recalling something he totally blanked on 12 years ago- he bled in his sink around 7:30pm on 11/3, before leaving for Menards.  The next morning, he noticed the blood was gone.  Zellner details the blood will coagulate within 30 minutes, so the window to transfer the blood from the sink to the Rav-4 is 7:30pm-8pm, and we know Ryan was 45 minutes away during that time.  Ryan couldn't have done it.  So Zellner failed to explain the blood, and her entire theory falls apart.  But let's entertain the rest of it anyway.

&gt; The killer was familiar with the Radandt and Manitowoc County pits

How was Ryan familiar with the Radandt and Manitowoc County pits?  He lived 45 minutes away.

&gt; Once Mr. Avery departed, the killer began to drive the RAV-4 onto the Avery property.  When Mr. Avery spotted the RAV-4' s tail lights...

How is he spotting tail lights if the Rav-4 is driving towards him?  Did Ryan reverse the entire way through the quarry?

&gt; the killer entered the trailer, intent on finding an item of Mr. Avery's with his DNA that he could use to plant DNA in the RAV-4 to connect Mr. Avery to Ms. Halbach's murder. In the small trailer, the killer noticed fresh blood in the bathroom sink.  

How fucking lucky of him!  And very lucky he remembered to bring his pipette, despite not planning on finding blood.

&gt; The killer recognized from his scientific background that if this blood was in Ms. Halbach's RAV-4, Mr. Avery would immediately become the only suspect.

Lol good thing for that science background, no one else would've been able to deduce that!

&gt; He then hid the RAV-4 in the vicinity of the Kuss Road cul-de-sac.

And then walked home?  So he drove the Rav-4 45 minutes to Avery's property, happened to arrive at the exact moment Avery was bleeding in his sink and heading to Menards, got in there to steal blood from the sink and plant in the Rav-4, hid the Rav-4 at Kuss Rd, walked 11 hours home, and no one noticed he'd ducked out for half a day?  And by the way, I know Chuck and Steve were out, but no one else on the property was seeing a Rav-4 drive up, park in front of Avery's place, someone break into the trailer, run out with a pocket full of blood, and drive off?

&gt;  On November 3, the killer learned vital information from law enforcement during his police interview. He quickly realized that law enforcement was focused on Mr. Avery and not on him. 

How did he learn that on Nov 3?  LE *wasn't* focused on Mr. Avery on Nov 3.  Is Ryan prescient?

&gt;  He was not asked about the scratches on his left hand 

Is there any evidence he had scratches on his left hand at all, let alone on Nov 3?

&gt; or why he knew Ms. Halbach's voicemail password

He didn't know her voicemail password.  He and a friend guessed her online account password.

&gt; The killer, who drove the RA V-4 into the Radandt Pit in the late afternoon of November 4

She has him planting the car while the yard was still open?  Is Ryan *invisible* or something?

&gt;  The killer led law enforcement to Ms. Halbach's vehicle later in the evening on November 4. The killer represented to law enforcement that he would be willing to search the Avery property...

What is the point of this step?  Why is he bringing Colborn to the car on Nov 4, if he just plans on sending Pam to find it the next day?  What does this accomplish, other than giving Zellner a way to tie the license plate check into her crazy theory?

&gt; When the killer looked into Ms. Halbach's vehicle, he called out, ""it's hers,"" because he recognized her personal items in the vehicle in addition to her vehicle itself. 

But... he planted the car, right?  I mean, he's had possession of her car since the murder and put it there himself.  Why is he so surprised by seeing her personal items in the car that he must call out, ""It's hers!""?

&gt;  As the leader of the search team, the killer had unrestricted access to the Avery salvage yard and surrounding properties

Um, no.  Ryan was on the ASY three times, to coordinate civilian search efforts with LE (communicate where they were searching, what they had found, etc).  He was not given free reign to wander around the property as he pleased.  

&gt; the killer still was in possession of the burned bones and the electronic devices of Ms. Halbach. Access to the Avery property allowed him to plant the bones and electronic devices of Ms. Halbach in Mr. Avery's burn pit and burn barrel.

So he brought a barrel full of cremains and burned electronics and just wandered around the property planting things without any one of the hundreds of people there noticing?  This is ridiculous.  When did he plant the license plates, by the way?

&gt; When the killer damaged the vehicle, he did not want the parking light found anywhere other than the Avery property because if any pieces of the parking light were found elsewhere, the State's entire theory that Mr. Avery was the killer and the RAV-4 never left Mr. Avery's property would disintegrate. 

What?  Why?  That wasn't the state's theory.  The ""state"" had search dogs track a scent from Avery's trailer, through the quarry, past the deer camp, and in the back entrance of the yard.  Their theory is that Avery was driving the Rav 4 that route, Zellner's theory is that Ryan was.  Finding broken tail light along that route wouldn't damage the state's theory at all, as they contended Avery drove the car through there.  And how does Ryan know what the state's theory will eventually be, anyway?  How does he know tail light pieces will cause it to ""disintegrate""?  Oh right, he's prescient.

&gt; He recognized the need to retrieve the parking light because leaving it, or any pieces of it, in the field would show the RAV-4 left the Avery property contrary to Mr. Kratz [sic] theory that the RAV-4 never left the Avery property. 

Again, entirely untrue, and again, assuming Ryan's knows what the state's eventual theory will be before the state even knows Teresa is missing.  **The state would just assume Avery broke the taillight driving that route, this makes no sense!**

&gt; Ms. Halbach reported to friends that Mr. Hillegas continued to check her out despite being broken up for years

And this means he was abusive?  wtf?

&gt;  According to Mr. Pearce, a friend and colleague of Ms. Halbach, Ms. Halbach had been in a verbally and physically abusive relationship prior to or during her internship with Mr.
Pearce. Ms. Halbach interned with Mr. Pearce in 2003 during her senior year of college when she was still involved with Mr. Hillegas. 

Except she wasn't.  Ryan and Teresa dated ""end of high school, early part of college.""  This is an utter lie.  Even if Pearce is correct in saying Teresa was in an abusive relationship in 2003, Teresa was not dating Ryan in 2003.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas committed perjury at trial when he described Ms. Halbach's relationship with Mr. Bloedom as platonic and never romantic or sexual in nature. 

Or he didn't know about it, or it's not even true, as our only source is BC.  But Zellner can't admit that possibility, because it destroys her jealousy motive.

&gt; Mr. Bloedom refused to sit for an interview with Mr. S Kirby, but when he was told that current postconviction counsel planned to name a suspect in Ms. Halbach's murder, Mr. Bloedorn immediately blurted out, ""You mean Ryan Hillegas."" 

And?  I'd like to see the date on this interview attempt, as it was obvious after Zellner's motion she intended to accuse Ryan, so of course Scott would ask that.  Even in January 2016 she was tweeting about ""whoever deleted voicemails is the killer"", and Ryan has been falsely accused of deleting voicemails all over the internet, so it's not surprising Scott would be able to guess who Zellner was gunning for.

&gt; Mr. Czech was married to someone else at the time

I just think it's shitty of Zellner to imply Teresa was having an illicit affair with a married man behind his wife's back.  BC and his wife were already separated and in the divorce process when he and Teresa had a fling.

&gt; For some unknown reason, Mr. Hillegas called Mr. Czech on November 3, 2005.

The reason isn't ""unknown"".  Ryan and Teresa's friends were calling all of Teresa's contacts, trying to find her.  How would this fit in to Zellner's loony theory anyway?  Ryan kills Teresa, keeps her body and car in some unknown place for a few days, and calls BC to tell him about it?

&gt;  Mr. Hillegas intentionally diverted investigators by reporting that the damage to the driver's side bumper and parking light of Ms. Halbach's RA V-4 occurred months before her disappearance and that she had filed an insurance claim for the damage. 

Actually, they ask Ryan, he checks with her family, and reports back to investigators.  He didn't know what happened.  I look forward to seeing Exhibit 59, but there's no reason to think he ""intentionally misled investigators.""  In fact, it makes no sense.  Zellner has painted Ryan as an incredibly cunning man- prescient, invisible, omniscient.  Surely he would realize that investigators could check with the insurance company and catch his lie.  If he were in fact *intentionally* misleading them and *knew* Teresa never filed a claim, he would most likely tell them ""Oh Teresa damaged that a while ago but never got around to the insurance claim.""  Hey maybe he's another idiot/savant!

&gt; She goes on about gaps in Ryan's cell phone records, I won't reprint the whole thing

This is all meaningless.  Most people aren't on their phone all day every day.  She even points out the ""suspicious"" gap between 10:44pm and 7:52am.  You know, that window of time when most people are always calling each other, not sleeping.  In fact, you know who wasn't on the phone for hours after meeting with Teresa?  Avery.

&gt; On November 4, from 4: 15-7:25 p.m. [...] It is during this time period that Sgt. Colborn called dispatch to confirm the license plate on Ms. Halbach's car

No it isn't.  The Colborn call was most likely Nov 3, based on trial testimony and the order of calls on the CD.  I know, I requested my own copy of that CD, and it was track 3, one of the earliest in the investigation.

&gt;  Mr. Hillegas had access to Ms. Halbach's Cingular Wireless account and knew her usemame and password

*To her online account*.  Ryan and Kelly guessed the password *to her online account*.  Not to her voicemail box.  

&gt; Mr. Hllegas called Ms. Halbach's phone at 6:42 p.m. on November 1, 2005.

Why, if he knew she was dead?  What was the purpose of this call?  Zellner says the call only lasted 4 seconds so he couldn't have heard the message that her voicemail was full.  So ""he was checking to see if the voicemail was full"" is ruled out.  He obviously didn't stay on long enough to be deleting her voicemails from his phone- and we know no one did from her phone- so was he going to a payphone to delete her voicemails, but still making a 4 sec call to her for some other reason?

&gt; Scratches are visible on the back of Mr. Hillegas' left hand in footage taken prior to the discovery of the RAV-4 on November 5, 2005

I would **love** to see Exhibit 60.  As she says ""footage"", I assume she's referring to [this image](http://i.imgur.com/whjch5a.jpg) from news footage.  There is no way an expert would say with certainty those are fingernail scratches, as opposed to writing on his hand, dirt, scratches from searching wooded area **looking for the good friend he lost**, etc.  I certainly hope Exhibit 60 is much clearer and definitively proves fingernail scratches if Zellner has her experts saying that.

&gt; Additionally, the burning of the body would allow him to move or plant the bones and divert the suspicion away from himself, because he was likely to be a prime suspect due to his prior abusive relationship with Ms. Halbach

First of all, Zellner has not proven anything close to an abusive relationship between Ryan and Teresa, and second, where is Ryan burning this body and storing the Rav-4 undetected for 4 days?

&gt; After hearing Ms. Halbach's voicemail was full, Mr. Hillegas, who had no trouble accessing Ms. Halbach's Cingular Wireless account, would be able to delete some of her voicemails in order to prevent family and friends from becoming concerned by a full voice mailbox

What?  She just said the 4 seconds Ryan spent on the call ""undermined"" his claim he heard the voicemail was full.  And again, **he did not have access to her voicemail**.  He guessed her *online* password.

&gt; When Mr. Avery called Ms. Halbach's phone at 4:35 p.m. on October 31, his phone call went directly to the automated message which indicated that the voice mailbox was full

Oh look, another thing Avery forgot to mention for 12 years.  Which I'd consider ""undermined"" by the fact that Teresa had just checked her voicemail at 2:13pm.  But it was full by 4:35pm?

And why is Ryan deleting these messages so weirdly anyway?  We know he didn't use his phone or Teresa's phone to do so.  Zellner claims ""at most"" ~5 minutes worth of voicemails were deleted between 10/31 and 11/2.  At most another four minutes were deleted before 11/3.  If Ryan's goal is to ensure Teresa's voicemail never becomes full so no one suspects her missing, why doesn't he just delete *all* the voicemails when he runs to a payphone and calls, instead of needing to call every day to delete a few minutes at a time?  Idiot/savant again?

&gt; The killer could have deleted Mr. Czech's text message without leaving proof that he entered the phone. 

First- what?  What evidence is there that Mr. Czech's message was deleted?  The phone was burned, we don't know what texts were on it.  And why would it be deleted?  What purpose does deleting a text from a phone you're going to burn serve, and why is Ryan concerned with deleting BC's text?  Not to mention, we know the phone was powered off and never connected again by at least 4:35pm on 10/31.  So Ryan's risking turning the phone on (with people calling Teresa all the time, this might result in it ringing and tower data being recorded) just to delete a text message from a phone he's going to burn?  What is Zellner even talking about at this point?

&gt; A human remains detection dog gave a trained alert in the wooded area south of the Kuss Road cul-de-sac, where a suspected burial site was discovered. Many dogs converged on this suspected burial site. A shallow ditch had been dug wherein plastic similar to a tarp was discovered. Sgt. Colborn persuaded everyone it was not a burial site, but no evidence supported that conclusion. 

First of all I'd love to see the evidence that it was Colborn who determined it wasn't a burial site.  According to Zellner, Colborn believes Avery did it and was just called by Ryan for some weird reason to go visit the car on 11/4.  What reason would Colborn have to divert attention away from a ""burial site"" he knew nothing about?

Second of all- is she suggesting that Teresa was buried there at some point?  So when Ryan was hiding the car there after stealing Avery's blood to plant with the pipette he luckily remembered to bring, he also dug a grave, buried Teresa, and dug her up the next day to surreptitiously burn her on Radandt's property for 5 hours in a burn barrel that he would later lug undetected through security check points and plant in Avery's pit?  Jesus.  At this point, he deserves to get away with it.

&gt; The killer returned to the Avery property with Sgt. Colborn in the evening on November 4, 2005, under the pretense of helping Sgt. Colborn search for Ms. Halbach's vehicle.

Again, **why?**  There's no warrant, so the search would be illegal and couldn't be used in court.  Obviously Ryan is planning on having Pam search the yard to find the Rav-4, because her search will be legitimate.  What purpose does bringing Colborn to it the night before serve, *at all*?  How does he even hook up with Colborn?  Obviously Pagel has been his point person on the investigation.  There's no indication Ryan had even met or talked to Colborn.  Please, someone, explain to me how and why Ryan would call Colborn and bring him to the car.  The only thing I can think of is that Zellner desperately wanted to work Colborn's plate check into her theory.

&gt; His words ""It's hers,"" shouted out when he looked in the vehicle and clearly recognized her personal effects, established that he was a close friend of Ms. Halbach

And again, **he put the car there**.  Why does he need to check the personal effects to ensure it's her car, and why is that surprising him so much that he needs to exclaim that it's hers while Colborn is on the phone?

&gt; At 7:20 p.m. on November 3, 2005 Chuck called Mr. Avery about seeing headlights in the area where Ms. Halbach's vehicle was found. [...] The headlights were from Sgt. Colborn's personal vehicle and he had a friend of Ms. Halbach with him to search the Avery property...

Jesus Zellner you literally just finished saying the car was planted after the 11/4 flyover, now you're saying Colborn was there looking at the car on 11/3.  Get your shit together, this is a big case.  I put more work into proofreading my reddit comments than she does into proofreading her brief.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas misrepresented his identity when he became the leader of the search.

What?  Ryan was interviewed by CASO and gave his full, real name on 11/4.  The next day he shows up to search and gives a fake name (cleverly using his real name except changing ""h"" to ""k"")?  Was he also wearing a fake mustache, to make sure they wouldn't recognize him from literally the day before?  And why did he use his real name when signing in and out?  Wasn't he worried that might blow his cover as ""Ryan Kilgus""?  Sounds to me like whoever he talked to from DOJ simply wrote his last name phonetically and spelled it wrong.

&gt; At that time, Mr. Hillegas provided addresses for where Ms. Halbach donated blood and plasma and addresses of her doctors including a cardiologist, an OB/GYN, and a dermatologist. Mr. Hillegas also provided a phone number for Ms. Halbach's pharmacy.

Yup, every stalker knows their victim's preferred blood and plasma donation center.  That's way more likely than him getting it from her family or day planner.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas directed Pam to search the Avery property and gave her the phone number of the direct line to Manitowoc Sheriffs Department in case she found anything.

Maybe it bothers me more than it should, but why doesn't Zellner check any of her facts before submitting this shit to the court.  Pam was given *Pagel's* phone number, with Calumet County, not Manitowoc.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas gave other search parties only maps, but he gave Pam a camera in anticipation that she would be the one to find the RAV-4. 

That directly contradicts Pam's testimony, where she states she *asked* for a camera, and *Scott* gave it to her.  So now Teresa's roommate and mom's cousin are in on the frame job too, and lying to cover for Ryan?

&gt;  Mr. Hillegas moved into the house shared by Mr. Bloedorn and Ms. Halbach while the searches were ongoing in order to maintain tighter control over investigators' access to Ms. Halbach's belongings and home

Or to be with his best friend during a really hard time.

&gt; This access to the salvage yard would give Mr. Hillegas opportunity to then plant the bones of Mr. Halbach, and her electronic devices, on November 6 and 7, now that the investigation was already focused on Mr. Avery

Explain to me how he brought a barrel of cremains and burned electronics past the checkpoint, and managed to dump them in three different spots without detection.  Zellner's experts claim the body was burned and transported in a burn barrel, and I'm pretty sure a 50 gallon burn barrel doesn't fit nicely under Ryan's shirt.

&gt; On at least one occasion, Mr. Hillegas also accessed the Avery and surrounding properties using a fake name. (Ryan ""Kilgus"" Map, P-C Exhibit 67, STATE 1_3783)

Again, the ""fake name"" that sounds almost exactly like his real name is ridiculous, and a search map is not used to access the property.  It seems like he or someone from the search team turned in a map, and the person taking it wrote ""Ryan Kilgus Group"" on it, mishearing Ryan's name.

&gt; This would also explain why, despite previous searches of the Avery and Janda burn barrels, bones were not discovered until November 8, 2005. 

The burn barrels were collected and transported to CASO on Nov 6.  Ryan did not access the property until Nov 7.  So even if he had cremains tucked under his shirt, the burn barrels were already gone and he could not have planted cremains in them.  Get your dates straight, Zellner.  You were the one who said the devil is in the details.

&gt; On the afternoon and evening of November 4, 2005, Mr. Hillegas received twenty-two phone calls from a number or numbers with no identifiers. It is reasonable to conclude that law enforcement officers were calling Mr. Hillegas in connection with conducting an illegal search of the Avery Salvage Yard using Mr. Hillegas to access the property. 

No, that is not reasonable to conclude.  Zellner hasn't explained why Ryan would call Colborn to conduct an illegal search of the yard, just to have Pam conduct a legal search the next day.  She has failed to explain a connection between Colborn and Ryan.  She has failed to explain why this illegal search would require 22 phone calls.  I contend it is much *more* reasonable to conclude that Ryan was helping with the search, calling numerous people who knew Teresa, and was getting a lot of calls.  

&gt; On November 5, 2005, with information obtained from law enforcement in twenty-two unrecorded calls on November 4, 2005. Mr. Hillegas directed Pam to search Avery's Auto Salvage.

Wait Ryan is the one who planted the car.  Why does he need 22 calls with LE to know where to direct Pam?  Why did Pam then testify that it was her suggestion to search ASY?

&gt; Pam located Ms. Halbach's vehicle on the Avery salvage yard - among 4000 other vehicles on the forty acres of uneven  topography - within thirty minutes of her arrival, a true statistical improbability

Improbable until you look at a map of the salvage yard, and realize the Rav-4 was parked along the first row of cars one would search upon entering the yard.

___

IN CONCLUSION.  I have seen truthers say it's OK for Zellner to publicly accuse Ryan of both abuse and murder because she was only trying to show that other suspects were reasonable.  Yet there is nothing about this theory that is reasonable.  We have Ryan killing Teresa, somehow determining that ""B Janda"" was ""Steven Avery"" and deciding to frame him for murder, being in two places at once, storing Teresa's body and Rav-4 for 3 days, somehow being both at Teresa's residence and Avery's at the same time, breaking into Avery's trailer at the perfect time to find fresh blood (which he wasn't planning on finding but brought a pipette for anyway), reversing up to Avery's trailer as Avery saw taillights instead of headlights, not being seen by anyone while he stole this blood, going to Kuss Rd to dig a grave and bury Teresa and hide the Rav-4, walking 11 hours home, going back the next day to dig up Teresa's body, burn her for 4+ hours in a barrel without detection, move the Rav-4 to the salvage yard without detection, for some reason deciding to show Colborn where the car was (maybe he just wanted to show off what a good job he did hiding it?), instructing Pam to go search the yard and lie about it in her testimony, using a fake name (and fake mustache?) to access the property a day after meeting investigators and giving his real name, planting bones in burn barrels a day after burn barrels were collected and transported to CASO... Zellner never explains the license plates or bullets in this theory either.

It's completely fucking preposterous and does not overcome Denny.  She has not established motive, as she has not established Ryan was either abusive or jealous.  She has not established means or opportunity, as her theory has Ryan being prescient, invisible, and in two places at once.  And she has not provided any evidence connecting Ryan to the crime.

6gj5dn,23,2017-06-10,Zellner's theory of the crime,super_pickle,MakingaMurderer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/6gj5dn/zellners_theory_of_the_crime/,"[Read along here](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Motion-for-Post-Conviction-Relief.pdf).

Obviously, the blood needs to be explained.  Zellner goes through great lengths detailing that Colborn *could not* have planted the blood, because he was at a meeting by 8pm and did not have time.  For some insane reason, she didn't bother checking Ryan's alibi too.  Ryan was at Teresa's house with her friends and LE.  Avery has submitted an affidavit recalling something he totally blanked on 12 years ago- he bled in his sink around 7:30pm on 11/3, before leaving for Menards.  The next morning, he noticed the blood was gone.  Zellner details the blood will coagulate within 30 minutes, so the window to transfer the blood from the sink to the Rav-4 is 7:30pm-8pm, and we know Ryan was 45 minutes away during that time.  Ryan couldn't have done it.  So Zellner failed to explain the blood, and her entire theory falls apart.  But let's entertain the rest of it anyway.

&gt; The killer was familiar with the Radandt and Manitowoc County pits

How was Ryan familiar with the Radandt and Manitowoc County pits?  He lived 45 minutes away.

&gt; Once Mr. Avery departed, the killer began to drive the RAV-4 onto the Avery property.  When Mr. Avery spotted the RAV-4' s tail lights...

How is he spotting tail lights if the Rav-4 is driving towards him?  Did Ryan reverse the entire way through the quarry?

&gt; the killer entered the trailer, intent on finding an item of Mr. Avery's with his DNA that he could use to plant DNA in the RAV-4 to connect Mr. Avery to Ms. Halbach's murder. In the small trailer, the killer noticed fresh blood in the bathroom sink.  

How fucking lucky of him!  And very lucky he remembered to bring his pipette, despite not planning on finding blood.

&gt; The killer recognized from his scientific background that if this blood was in Ms. Halbach's RAV-4, Mr. Avery would immediately become the only suspect.

Lol good thing for that science background, no one else would've been able to deduce that!

&gt; He then hid the RAV-4 in the vicinity of the Kuss Road cul-de-sac.

And then walked home?  So he drove the Rav-4 45 minutes to Avery's property, happened to arrive at the exact moment Avery was bleeding in his sink and heading to Menards, got in there to steal blood from the sink and plant in the Rav-4, hid the Rav-4 at Kuss Rd, walked 11 hours home, and no one noticed he'd ducked out for half a day?  And by the way, I know Chuck and Steve were out, but no one else on the property was seeing a Rav-4 drive up, park in front of Avery's place, someone break into the trailer, run out with a pocket full of blood, and drive off?

&gt;  On November 3, the killer learned vital information from law enforcement during his police interview. He quickly realized that law enforcement was focused on Mr. Avery and not on him. 

How did he learn that on Nov 3?  LE *wasn't* focused on Mr. Avery on Nov 3.  Is Ryan prescient?

&gt;  He was not asked about the scratches on his left hand 

Is there any evidence he had scratches on his left hand at all, let alone on Nov 3?

&gt; or why he knew Ms. Halbach's voicemail password

He didn't know her voicemail password.  He and a friend guessed her online account password.

&gt; The killer, who drove the RA V-4 into the Radandt Pit in the late afternoon of November 4

She has him planting the car while the yard was still open?  Is Ryan *invisible* or something?

&gt;  The killer led law enforcement to Ms. Halbach's vehicle later in the evening on November 4. The killer represented to law enforcement that he would be willing to search the Avery property...

What is the point of this step?  Why is he bringing Colborn to the car on Nov 4, if he just plans on sending Pam to find it the next day?  What does this accomplish, other than giving Zellner a way to tie the license plate check into her crazy theory?

&gt; When the killer looked into Ms. Halbach's vehicle, he called out, ""it's hers,"" because he recognized her personal items in the vehicle in addition to her vehicle itself. 

But... he planted the car, right?  I mean, he's had possession of her car since the murder and put it there himself.  Why is he so surprised by seeing her personal items in the car that he must call out, ""It's hers!""?

&gt;  As the leader of the search team, the killer had unrestricted access to the Avery salvage yard and surrounding properties

Um, no.  Ryan was on the ASY three times, to coordinate civilian search efforts with LE (communicate where they were searching, what they had found, etc).  He was not given free reign to wander around the property as he pleased.  

&gt; the killer still was in possession of the burned bones and the electronic devices of Ms. Halbach. Access to the Avery property allowed him to plant the bones and electronic devices of Ms. Halbach in Mr. Avery's burn pit and burn barrel.

So he brought a barrel full of cremains and burned electronics and just wandered around the property planting things without any one of the hundreds of people there noticing?  This is ridiculous.  When did he plant the license plates, by the way?

&gt; When the killer damaged the vehicle, he did not want the parking light found anywhere other than the Avery property because if any pieces of the parking light were found elsewhere, the State's entire theory that Mr. Avery was the killer and the RAV-4 never left Mr. Avery's property would disintegrate. 

What?  Why?  That wasn't the state's theory.  The ""state"" had search dogs track a scent from Avery's trailer, through the quarry, past the deer camp, and in the back entrance of the yard.  Their theory is that Avery was driving the Rav 4 that route, Zellner's theory is that Ryan was.  Finding broken tail light along that route wouldn't damage the state's theory at all, as they contended Avery drove the car through there.  And how does Ryan know what the state's theory will eventually be, anyway?  How does he know tail light pieces will cause it to ""disintegrate""?  Oh right, he's prescient.

&gt; He recognized the need to retrieve the parking light because leaving it, or any pieces of it, in the field would show the RAV-4 left the Avery property contrary to Mr. Kratz [sic] theory that the RAV-4 never left the Avery property. 

Again, entirely untrue, and again, assuming Ryan's knows what the state's eventual theory will be before the state even knows Teresa is missing.  **The state would just assume Avery broke the taillight driving that route, this makes no sense!**

&gt; Ms. Halbach reported to friends that Mr. Hillegas continued to check her out despite being broken up for years

And this means he was abusive?  wtf?

&gt;  According to Mr. Pearce, a friend and colleague of Ms. Halbach, Ms. Halbach had been in a verbally and physically abusive relationship prior to or during her internship with Mr. Pearce. Ms. Halbach interned with Mr. Pearce in 2003 during her senior year of college when she was still involved with Mr. Hillegas. 

Except she wasn't.  Ryan and Teresa dated ""end of high school, early part of college.""  This is an utter lie.  Even if Pearce is correct in saying Teresa was in an abusive relationship in 2003, Teresa was not dating Ryan in 2003.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas committed perjury at trial when he described Ms. Halbach's relationship with Mr. Bloedom as platonic and never romantic or sexual in nature. 

Or he didn't know about it, or it's not even true, as our only source is BC.  But Zellner can't admit that possibility, because it destroys her jealousy motive.

&gt; Mr. Bloedom refused to sit for an interview with Mr. S Kirby, but when he was told that current postconviction counsel planned to name a suspect in Ms. Halbach's murder, Mr. Bloedorn immediately blurted out, ""You mean Ryan Hillegas."" 

And?  I'd like to see the date on this interview attempt, as it was obvious after Zellner's motion she intended to accuse Ryan, so of course Scott would ask that.  Even in January 2016 she was tweeting about ""whoever deleted voicemails is the killer"", and Ryan has been falsely accused of deleting voicemails all over the internet, so it's not surprising Scott would be able to guess who Zellner was gunning for.

&gt; Mr. Czech was married to someone else at the time

I just think it's shitty of Zellner to imply Teresa was having an illicit affair with a married man behind his wife's back.  BC and his wife were already separated and in the divorce process when he and Teresa had a fling.

&gt; For some unknown reason, Mr. Hillegas called Mr. Czech on November 3, 2005.

The reason isn't ""unknown"".  Ryan and Teresa's friends were calling all of Teresa's contacts, trying to find her.  How would this fit in to Zellner's loony theory anyway?  Ryan kills Teresa, keeps her body and car in some unknown place for a few days, and calls BC to tell him about it?

&gt;  Mr. Hillegas intentionally diverted investigators by reporting that the damage to the driver's side bumper and parking light of Ms. Halbach's RA V-4 occurred months before her disappearance and that she had filed an insurance claim for the damage. 

Actually, they ask Ryan, he checks with her family, and reports back to investigators.  He didn't know what happened.  I look forward to seeing Exhibit 59, but there's no reason to think he ""intentionally misled investigators.""  In fact, it makes no sense.  Zellner has painted Ryan as an incredibly cunning man- prescient, invisible, omniscient.  Surely he would realize that investigators could check with the insurance company and catch his lie.  If he were in fact *intentionally* misleading them and *knew* Teresa never filed a claim, he would most likely tell them ""Oh Teresa damaged that a while ago but never got around to the insurance claim.""  Hey maybe he's another idiot/savant!

&gt; She goes on about gaps in Ryan's cell phone records, I won't reprint the whole thing

This is all meaningless.  Most people aren't on their phone all day every day.  She even points out the ""suspicious"" gap between 10:44pm and 7:52am.  You know, that window of time when most people are always calling each other, not sleeping.  In fact, you know who wasn't on the phone for hours after meeting with Teresa?  Avery.

&gt; On November 4, from 4: 15-7:25 p.m. [...] It is during this time period that Sgt. Colborn called dispatch to confirm the license plate on Ms. Halbach's car

No it isn't.  The Colborn call was most likely Nov 3, based on trial testimony and the order of calls on the CD.  I know, I requested my own copy of that CD, and it was track 3, one of the earliest in the investigation.

&gt;  Mr. Hillegas had access to Ms. Halbach's Cingular Wireless account and knew her usemame and password

*To her online account*.  Ryan and Kelly guessed the password *to her online account*.  Not to her voicemail box.  

&gt; Mr. Hllegas called Ms. Halbach's phone at 6:42 p.m. on November 1, 2005.

Why, if he knew she was dead?  What was the purpose of this call?  Zellner says the call only lasted 4 seconds so he couldn't have heard the message that her voicemail was full.  So ""he was checking to see if the voicemail was full"" is ruled out.  He obviously didn't stay on long enough to be deleting her voicemails from his phone- and we know no one did from her phone- so was he going to a payphone to delete her voicemails, but still making a 4 sec call to her for some other reason?

&gt; Scratches are visible on the back of Mr. Hillegas' left hand in footage taken prior to the discovery of the RAV-4 on November 5, 2005

I would **love** to see Exhibit 60.  As she says ""footage"", I assume she's referring to [this image](http://i.imgur.com/whjch5a.jpg) from news footage.  There is no way an expert would say with certainty those are fingernail scratches, as opposed to writing on his hand, dirt, scratches from searching wooded area **looking for the good friend he lost**, etc.  I certainly hope Exhibit 60 is much clearer and definitively proves fingernail scratches if Zellner has her experts saying that.

&gt; Additionally, the burning of the body would allow him to move or plant the bones and divert the suspicion away from himself, because he was likely to be a prime suspect due to his prior abusive relationship with Ms. Halbach

First of all, Zellner has not proven anything close to an abusive relationship between Ryan and Teresa, and second, where is Ryan burning this body and storing the Rav-4 undetected for 4 days?

&gt; After hearing Ms. Halbach's voicemail was full, Mr. Hillegas, who had no trouble accessing Ms. Halbach's Cingular Wireless account, would be able to delete some of her voicemails in order to prevent family and friends from becoming concerned by a full voice mailbox

What?  She just said the 4 seconds Ryan spent on the call ""undermined"" his claim he heard the voicemail was full.  And again, **he did not have access to her voicemail**.  He guessed her *online* password.

&gt; When Mr. Avery called Ms. Halbach's phone at 4:35 p.m. on October 31, his phone call went directly to the automated message which indicated that the voice mailbox was full

Oh look, another thing Avery forgot to mention for 12 years.  Which I'd consider ""undermined"" by the fact that Teresa had just checked her voicemail at 2:13pm.  But it was full by 4:35pm?

And why is Ryan deleting these messages so weirdly anyway?  We know he didn't use his phone or Teresa's phone to do so.  Zellner claims ""at most"" ~5 minutes worth of voicemails were deleted between 10/31 and 11/2.  At most another four minutes were deleted before 11/3.  If Ryan's goal is to ensure Teresa's voicemail never becomes full so no one suspects her missing, why doesn't he just delete *all* the voicemails when he runs to a payphone and calls, instead of needing to call every day to delete a few minutes at a time?  Idiot/savant again?

&gt; The killer could have deleted Mr. Czech's text message without leaving proof that he entered the phone. 

First- what?  What evidence is there that Mr. Czech's message was deleted?  The phone was burned, we don't know what texts were on it.  And why would it be deleted?  What purpose does deleting a text from a phone you're going to burn serve, and why is Ryan concerned with deleting BC's text?  Not to mention, we know the phone was powered off and never connected again by at least 4:35pm on 10/31.  So Ryan's risking turning the phone on (with people calling Teresa all the time, this might result in it ringing and tower data being recorded) just to delete a text message from a phone he's going to burn?  What is Zellner even talking about at this point?

&gt; A human remains detection dog gave a trained alert in the wooded area south of the Kuss Road cul-de-sac, where a suspected burial site was discovered. Many dogs converged on this suspected burial site. A shallow ditch had been dug wherein plastic similar to a tarp was discovered. Sgt. Colborn persuaded everyone it was not a burial site, but no evidence supported that conclusion. 

First of all I'd love to see the evidence that it was Colborn who determined it wasn't a burial site (reports say it was Ertl).  According to Zellner, Colborn believes Avery did it and was just called by Ryan for some weird reason to go visit the car on 11/4.  What reason would Colborn have to divert attention away from a ""burial site"" he knew nothing about?

Second of all- is she suggesting that Teresa was buried there at some point?  So when Ryan was hiding the car there after stealing Avery's blood to plant with the pipette he luckily remembered to bring, he also dug a grave, buried Teresa, and dug her up the next day to surreptitiously burn her on Radandt's property for 5 hours in a burn barrel that he would later lug undetected through security check points and plant in Avery's pit?  Jesus.  At this point, he deserves to get away with it.

&gt; The killer returned to the Avery property with Sgt. Colborn in the evening on November 4, 2005, under the pretense of helping Sgt. Colborn search for Ms. Halbach's vehicle.

Again, **why?**  There's no warrant, so the search would be illegal and couldn't be used in court.  Obviously Ryan is planning on having Pam search the yard to find the Rav-4, because her search will be legitimate.  What purpose does bringing Colborn to it the night before serve, *at all*?  How does he even hook up with Colborn?  Obviously Pagel has been his point person on the investigation.  There's no indication Ryan had even met or talked to Colborn.  Please, someone, explain to me how and why Ryan would call Colborn and bring him to the car.  The only thing I can think of is that Zellner desperately wanted to work Colborn's plate check into her theory.

&gt; His words ""It's hers,"" shouted out when he looked in the vehicle and clearly recognized her personal effects, established that he was a close friend of Ms. Halbach

And again, **he put the car there**.  Why does he need to check the personal effects to ensure it's her car, and why is that surprising him so much that he needs to exclaim that it's hers while Colborn is on the phone?

&gt; At 7:20 p.m. on November 3, 2005 Chuck called Mr. Avery about seeing headlights in the area where Ms. Halbach's vehicle was found. [...] The headlights were from Sgt. Colborn's personal vehicle and he had a friend of Ms. Halbach with him to search the Avery property...

Jesus Zellner you literally just finished saying the car was planted after the 11/4 flyover, now you're saying Colborn was there looking at the car on 11/3.  Get your shit together, this is a big case.  I put more work into proofreading my reddit comments than she does into proofreading her brief.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas misrepresented his identity when he became the leader of the search.

What?  Ryan was interviewed by CASO and gave his full, real name on 11/4.  The next day he shows up to search and gives a fake name (cleverly using his real name except changing ""h"" to ""k"")?  Was he also wearing a fake mustache, to make sure they wouldn't recognize him from literally the day before?  And why did he use his real name when signing in and out?  Wasn't he worried that might blow his cover as ""Ryan Kilgus""?  Sounds to me like whoever he talked to from DOJ simply wrote his last name phonetically and spelled it wrong.

&gt; At that time, Mr. Hillegas provided addresses for where Ms. Halbach donated blood and plasma and addresses of her doctors including a cardiologist, an OB/GYN, and a dermatologist. Mr. Hillegas also provided a phone number for Ms. Halbach's pharmacy.

Yup, every stalker knows their victim's preferred blood and plasma donation center.  That's way more likely than him getting it from her family or day planner.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas directed Pam to search the Avery property and gave her the phone number of the direct line to Manitowoc Sheriffs Department in case she found anything.

Maybe it bothers me more than it should, but why doesn't Zellner check any of her facts before submitting this shit to the court.  Pam was given *Pagel's* phone number, with Calumet County, not Manitowoc.

&gt; Mr. Hillegas gave other search parties only maps, but he gave Pam a camera in anticipation that she would be the one to find the RAV-4. 

That directly contradicts Pam's testimony, where she states she *asked* for a camera, and *Scott* gave it to her.  So now Teresa's roommate and mom's cousin are in on the frame job too, and lying to cover for Ryan?

&gt;  Mr. Hillegas moved into the house shared by Mr. Bloedorn and Ms. Halbach while the searches were ongoing in order to maintain tighter control over investigators' access to Ms. Halbach's belongings and home

Or to be with his best friend during a really hard time.

&gt; This access to the salvage yard would give Mr. Hillegas opportunity to then plant the bones of Mr. Halbach, and her electronic devices, on November 6 and 7, now that the investigation was already focused on Mr. Avery

Explain to me how he brought a barrel of cremains and burned electronics past the checkpoint, and managed to dump them in three different spots without detection.  Zellner's experts claim the body was burned and transported in a burn barrel, and I'm pretty sure a 50 gallon burn barrel doesn't fit nicely under Ryan's shirt.

&gt; On at least one occasion, Mr. Hillegas also accessed the Avery and surrounding properties using a fake name. (Ryan ""Kilgus"" Map, P-C Exhibit 67, STATE 1_3783)

Again, the ""fake name"" that sounds almost exactly like his real name is ridiculous, and a search map is not used to access the property.  It seems like he or someone from the search team turned in a map, and the person taking it wrote ""Ryan Kilgus Group"" on it, mishearing Ryan's name.

&gt; This would also explain why, despite previous searches of the Avery and Janda burn barrels, bones were not discovered until November 8, 2005. 

The burn barrels were collected and transported to CASO on Nov 6.  Ryan did not access the property until Nov 7.  So even if he had cremains tucked under his shirt, the burn barrels were already gone and he could not have planted cremains in them.  Get your dates straight, Zellner.  You were the one who said the devil is in the details.

&gt; On the afternoon and evening of November 4, 2005, Mr. Hillegas received twenty-two phone calls from a number or numbers with no identifiers. It is reasonable to conclude that law enforcement officers were calling Mr. Hillegas in connection with conducting an illegal search of the Avery Salvage Yard using Mr. Hillegas to access the property. 

No, that is not reasonable to conclude.  Zellner hasn't explained why Ryan would call Colborn to conduct an illegal search of the yard, just to have Pam conduct a legal search the next day.  She has failed to explain a connection between Colborn and Ryan.  She has failed to explain why this illegal search would require 22 phone calls.  I contend it is much *more* reasonable to conclude that Ryan was helping with the search, calling numerous people who knew Teresa, and was getting a lot of calls.  

&gt; On November 5, 2005, with information obtained from law enforcement in twenty-two unrecorded calls on November 4, 2005. Mr. Hillegas directed Pam to search Avery's Auto Salvage.

Wait Ryan is the one who planted the car.  Why does he need 22 calls with LE to know where to direct Pam?  Why did Pam then testify that it was her suggestion to search ASY?

&gt; Pam located Ms. Halbach's vehicle on the Avery salvage yard - among 4000 other vehicles on the forty acres of uneven  topography - within thirty minutes of her arrival, a true statistical improbability

Improbable until you look at a map of the salvage yard, and realize the Rav-4 was parked along the first row of cars one would search upon entering the yard.

___

IN CONCLUSION.  I have seen truthers say it's OK for Zellner to publicly accuse Ryan of both abuse and murder because she was only trying to show that other suspects were reasonable.  Yet there is nothing about this theory that is reasonable.  We have Ryan killing Teresa, somehow determining that ""B Janda"" was ""Steven Avery"" and deciding to frame him for murder, being in two places at once, storing Teresa's body and Rav-4 for 3 days, somehow being both at Teresa's residence and Avery's at the same time, breaking into Avery's trailer at the perfect time to find fresh blood (which he wasn't planning on finding but brought a pipette for anyway), reversing up to Avery's trailer as Avery saw taillights instead of headlights, not being seen by anyone while he stole this blood, going to Kuss Rd to dig a grave and bury Teresa and hide the Rav-4, walking 11 hours home, going back the next day to dig up Teresa's body, burn her for 4+ hours in a barrel without detection, move the Rav-4 to the salvage yard without detection, for some reason deciding to show Colborn where the car was (maybe he just wanted to show off what a good job he did hiding it?), instructing Pam to go search the yard and lie about it in her testimony, using a fake name (and fake mustache?) to access the property a day after meeting investigators and giving his real name, planting bones in burn barrels a day after burn barrels were collected and transported to CASO... Zellner never explains the license plates or bullets in this theory either.

It's completely fucking preposterous and does not overcome Denny.  She has not established motive, as she has not established Ryan was either abusive or jealous.  She has not established means or opportunity, as her theory has Ryan being prescient, invisible, and in two places at once.  And she has not provided any evidence connecting Ryan to the crime.

So even *if* her intent was simply to suggest a reasonable alternate suspect that could've overcome Denny requirements, she failed miserably.  All she did was publicly accuse a man who lost a good friend of both murder and abuse, with zero evidence.

Shame on her."

6gjop1,1,2017-06-11,Does a Graduate Degree Open Doors in pharma?,hellodan92,pharma,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharma/comments/6gjop1/does_a_graduate_degree_open_doors_in_pharma/,"I have been going through multiple job search, but so far, I wasn't successful. I have a degree in pharmacology at McGill and my school wasn't very supportive in holding recruiting events..so i graduated without actually securing any meaningful internship. 

I've sought abroad as a result, using personal connections to get internship at pharma association in Korea and went through some services job including customer services, and even in education, teaching kids SAT in Korea. 

Now I feel that I really need to set my career going in the pharma instead of exploring other areas. 

My concern is two things. 
1. My cGPA is too low. It's sitting at 3.2. It doesn't qualify for most of the grad programs I want to get into in Canada. 
2. I am unsure what benefit Graduate Degree would bring. To me it seems, getting another bachelor in engineering is time and cost efficient. 

Can anyone in the pharma industry confirm to me what are the benefits of master's degree? If I absolutely need one to enter the field, do i need to go all the way to a phD? Is the salary worth the effort and time I put into the graduate program? 

I would appreciate any kind of input here...

Thanks in advance!"
6gk3nq,11,2017-06-11,Director of Engineering seeking sales experience in preparation for starting a software company,otx,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/6gk3nq/director_of_engineering_seeking_sales_experience/,"Hi all,

I have a somewhat different situation from many people who are new to sales, and I'm looking for some advice to orient myself efficiently so that I can gain the experience I need without taking short-cuts, but without wasting time.  I'd really appreciate advice from some of the sales vets here.

A little about me:

  * I am preparing to start my own company
  * I am a Director of Engineering at a telecom hardware startup.
  * I've had face-time with customers involving pre-sales activities (field trials, exploratory meetings).
  * I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from one of the top engineering schools in the world
  * I've worked at several startups through IPO and/or failure, and several of the major corporations that you know
  * I have worked as a marketing intern at a medium size, successful IC manufacturer as part of an entreprenuership followship that also included a mentorship arrangement with venture capitalists and other training along those lines
  * I have over 20 years of technical experience
  * I am a musician, and former amature fighter (e.g. I can handle being on stage, and I know how to relax and perfom under intense pressure and chaos) 
  * There are no good sales mentors at my company, and our sales cycle is very long and complex

On thing that I learned and firmly believe from the venture capitalists from my entreprenurship fellowship is that the best CEOs have a background in sales.  To that end, I am looking to get experience prepping, pitching and closing sales so that I am prepared to sell my company to investors and customers alike.

My instinct is that I want to be in direct, face-to-face contact with as many prospects as possible.  I want experience prepping for sales meetings, getting my foot in the door, reading the customer's disposition, ascertaining their needs, overcoming objections,  closing sales and anything else I don't even know I need experience with. That suggest to me direct, door-to-door sales.

From my standpoint (and this is one thing that I want advice on), I don't really care what field I'm in as long as its helping me gain experience with customers.  I don't care how much money I make (I already make a lot), except in as much as it is indicive of my success as a salesman.  

One idea I had was just to volunteer my time to a charity that I believe in and do door-to-door solicitation for donations.  The problem I have with that is that I don't think I'll get the kind of mentorship I will need to grow quickly.  I know that a good mentor will be instrumental to increasing my performance quickly.

I also need to do this as a side gig: I work full time as a Director of Engineering right now.  I realize that I'm going to need to put in hours, and that not putting in a full week's work is going to slow my progress, but in my mind, some work is better than no work at all.

So the main questions:

  * Do you have any suggestions for sales jobs that will be somewhat flexible with my hours and give me face-time with customers? Does the charity donations idea sound like a good idea?
  * In what kinds of jobs do you think I will get the best training in working face to face prospects?
  * Where will I find the best sales mentors?  Do you have any advice on how to go about finding them?
  * Is there anything else you think I should know or pursue?

I'm really excited about the idea of getting in the trenches and having doors slammed in my face :-) (its probably the fighter in me).

Thanks for reading my long post, and thank you in advance for your advice!

I Feel So Lost,itiailwgp,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6gkdg5/post_college_depression_i_feel_so_lost/,"After four years of getting through classes and stress and then successfully defending my thesis and graduating with honors, I thought post graduation was going to be awesome..Maybe I'd have a job or an internship or at least know what I wanted to do but instead I'm living at home, unemployed, stressed out of my mind and ridiculously sad. 


And it doesn't help that everyone around me seems to have started their careers or is traveling and living it up while I'm stuck at home without a job, a car, friends, or even a room to myself. 


I want to leave so badly but I can't. I have no money after paying my way through college and I can't even get a call back for part time work. I feel like a failure. 


I have so many uncertainties in my life that it's getting so hard not to worry. The girl I love is in another city and probably doesn't love me in the same way... I don't have a car so I can never get out of the house.. All of my friends from high school and college are many hours away.. I'm unemployed and living at home....the list goes on. And it all contributes to my confusion and discomfort.


Im unhappy. I'm confused. I'm lonely. And most of all... I'm lost. Lost in my own emotions and my own uncertainty. "

6glmff,0,2017-06-11,CMV: higher education is largely pointless and somewhat harmful,karlnordenstorm,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6glmff/cmv_higher_education_is_largely_pointless_and/,"Disclaimer: I am not talking about science or technology.

* Proposition 1 - Universities optimize for placebo effect, not real learning.
How can you tell if a course risk management was good? The real way would be assigning seats to applicants by lottery and then measure the skill level before and after for both the students and those who did not get to enter. Even then there are confounding factors - maybe the value is in contacts you get, not the assignments and lecturer. To measure the quality of education would be a lot harder than testing drugs, but is given less attention.

My experience rather is that universities optimize for placebo. They try to look legit by using opaque language, and they like to make you FEEL enlightened. 

* Proposition 2 - The educated class does not realize higher education is a fraud, because that runs against their self interest

A regular teacher, journalist or bureaucrat does not want university to be a waste of time. If it is - that would mean she and most of her friends had wasted years. It is hedonically rational for the already educated to be irrational about education.

* Proposition 3 - The reason for higher education is not to gain skills, but to get a proof of competence and commitment.
I believe a 3-year-education for becoming a kindergarten teacher is essentially worthless. Yet it is rational for an employer to hire the person with the education. The person with education has a proof he/she is smart enough and committed enough to the field to go spend 3 years getting a degree. 

* Proposition 4: University is psychologically harmful
Studying a field for 3 or 5 years creates sunk costs. Humans hate the feeling of having wasted resources. If you discover being a lawyer is not your thing two years after graduating the sunk costs mean you are likely to keep you in the field. Universities usually do not provide realistic tests of what it feels like working in the intended career - ergo huge risk of being trapped by sunk costs in dissatisfying work.

Another thing - if people are expected to spend a couple of years on education before getting into a profession, that creates big hurdles for experimenting.

* Proposition 5 - Reading books and interacting on reddit is more effective than universities. EDIT: for some persons. For others internships, for others just reading. The point is that universities are sub-optimal for most people. Having many established ways of getting into any professions would be an improvement. So you could do it by just reading on your own and then pass an exam, or by performing well in some contest.

* Some educations I consider fraudulent:
 Pedagogy: It mostly makes you a bit more erudite. You read about psychological experiments, the history of the school system. It does not teach the nuts and bolts of how to design tests that are easy to then correct, or how to maintain order. If scientifically tested there is no way a degree in pedagogy would make you better at teaching than spending 3 years working as one. 
 Management: The content in the courses is at middle school level. What you actually spend your time doing is writing fancy reports and practicing for presentations.
 Theology: The people who go to church want priests who are polite, sane, good at telling stories and who share their basic beliefs. Priests seminar sorts out some cranks, but that is it. Why do priests actually get long educations? My guess is so they do not look stupid.
 The humanities: Just go ahead and read and write and paint! How can it possibly be rational to pay to have somebody tell you ""read War and Peace"", write an essay on War and Peace and then discuss it. You do not need permission to do this on your own.

6glpjv,2,2017-06-11,23T4F - Lilith Fairchild: High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6glpjv/23t4f_lilith_fairchild_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

**(Note: Today, I'm looking for a partner in crime. Someone who's either as twisted as I am - switches are always appreciated - or can be turned to the dark side. If that sounds like you, welcome aboard!)**

- *The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?

- *The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The New Kid*: This is just too easy... Some poor little lost thing, torn away from her comfort zone, perhaps from some country where their grasp on English is less than fluent... Let's just say that I've always wanted a pet.

- *The Competition*: All right, to be honest, I've never been what one could consider a *sporty chick*. Tossing a ball around and pretending I'm hot shit? Fuck. That. Boxing, on the other hand... Working up a sweat and *clobbering* some pretty little thing? Sounds like my kind of evening. And you'd be surprised what kind of things happen happen in the locker room afterwards... **Bruised skin, bloody lips and perhaps a lost tooth or two. Not for the faint of heart.**

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful summertime employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *The Jock:* All right, I know one or two guys are reading this. Well, I don't top dudes, and if you want inside my ass, you've got to be *hot* shit. I'm talking chiselled-from-marble, fuck-happy *and* able to go toe-to-toe with me at my worst. Four therapists haven't been able to pull off that last one, so I doubt you can. If you're some needledick pillowhumper who's looking to feel a thick rod rearranging his colon, find a dude. On the other hand, if you think you can pin me, drill me *and* tame me, well... I'd like to see you try. 

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

Contact me.",After_Credits,AfterCredits,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterCredits/comments/6gm0ni/tldr_need_help_with_content_want_to_help_contact/,"Hello all!  I need help from anyone interested.  As you know, I've tried to expand the content that the site serves (trailers, stills, reviews, etc.).  Cataloging stinger info is and always will be the #1 goal of the site.  However to truly succeed, I need to expand the content that is provided.  As of right now the majority of site visits come from Google searches from people looking to find out if they need to stick around during or after the credits.  Oftentimes, the site is actually FIRST in search results, which is great!  It means that the site is succeeding in what I originally set out to do.  I am very proud of this accomplishment and never want that to change.

This means that almost all weekly traffic is during the weekend however.  Which doesn't help the bottom line, ad income wise.  The site is finally doing well enough ad wise to break even and actually have a little cash in the kitty for future expenditures.  It's not a lot, but it's nice to have a small cushion for the slow periods when there are almost no ""popular"" films in the theaters.

The long term plan was to continue posting information for upcoming films; trailers, stills, interviews, etc.  As well as reviews and anything else that I found that our audience might be interested in.

Unfortunately, life happens and I just don't have the time I used to dedicate to this site as I used to.  I'm keeping up fine with stinger info, but barely much else.  My wife and I had our first child a year ago and we decided that me being a stay-at-home dad would be the best option for us, for now.  You would think that more time at home would mean more time to dedicate to the site, right?  Nope!  Things have been busier than ever around here!

So this is where my request comes in.  If anyone out there is interested in helping out with providing content, please reach out to and we'll talk.  I'd first like to focus on the ""mega posts"" and reviews, but I have a slew of ideas and aspirations for content, but need help to make this happen.  I have access to most all publicity material from the major studios and that access would be shared.  I could potentially have access to screeners (both in the theater and digital), but to get that the site needs more original content.

As of right now it would pretty much be a unpaid intern type of situation, although I will do my best to share what I can from the ad revenue; as I do want to be fair about this.  I would love for it to be a paid ""official"" position eventually.  I currently live in the Chicago area, but this ""intern"" wouldn't have to be.  We can collaborate via Skype, email, etc.  So location is not important.  Although within the United States would be preferred just because it would make the publicity and (future) screener access easier for this person.  It would be helpful if you know a little about web design and making online posts, but it's not required; I could show you how I do things.  I'm pretty flexible and willing to make this a true partnership.  You would get all the credit for what you do, I'm not looking to be in the spotlight or to have you be some sort of invisible partner.

So if anyone out there is interested, please reach out, I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

Basically a tech industry guy hires one of his interns (or similar title) to come do some networking at his house because he's impressed by the intern's skills. Intern and boss's daughter flirt, and it escalates. At some point the intern plants a device on the boss's work computer which gives him access to all sorts of sensitive information - about the company's upcoming release of a BIG project and the boss's family. 

Then after the boss finds out about daughter and intern flirting, he breaks it off and kicks him out. Cue intern freak out. All the automated things in the house go crazy and the family can't figure out what's going on. Bossman calls someone who comes out and helps them delete their online profiles and rips all the wiring from the drywall and destroys any electronics in the house.

I've been following this sub-reddit for a while but this is my first post here. So I met this girl a couple of months ago through friends. The first couple of times we went out (in groups), we had a lot of fun together and she seemed to be into me (two of my girl friends told me the same). Immediately after that I asked her out and she said yes. But then she rescheduled twice because she was ""busy"" (she actually is really busy with her internship, but I don't believe that was the reason) and I stopped asking. We kept seeing each other (always with other friends with us) and she keeps giving me mixed signals - she is either very touchy and keeps asking for me and wants to dance with me, or some days she outright ignores my advances. Yesterday we were out together again and she was touching me and being playful with me all the time and we ended up walking with my hand on her lower back and so on, but today it's like nothing happened. So this is really annoying me cause I don't know if I should just move on or what...It's hard to confront her and talk to her about it alone cause we always go out in a group...

After complaining to AirBnB, they tell me that listing it as an entire home doesn't actually mean the host isn't living there, despite the definition they give on their website.

They offered a refund, but my reservation is for over a month and any other place I can book now is 2-3 times the price.
 
The AirBnB rep said she talked to the host and that she agreed to only be here 1-2 hours a day, but it's not clear how true that is given that all the current facts have not been true.
I'd like to get what the actual terms are in writing, but the AirBnB rep is making that difficult. She also refuses to let me speak to her supervisor.

What can I do? I need a place for me and my younger sister to stay. I start my internship tomorrow.

EDIT: 
6/14

Hey guys, so I finally got this sorted out but after some ridiculous back and forth with Airbnb customer service -
 I ended up getting a refund and credit, which is still so much less than what I have to pay for my new place given the nature of my long term reservation and it being so last minute, but I'll take what I can get at this point. Thanks for all your feedback/advice. I ended up having 4 different case managers because the host called them and lied (saying that I had falsely claimed that she was in the house). What a disaster of a situation though - I'm honestly horrified at how Airbnb handles customer service after this incident. "

After the class ended, we met again on a few other occasions because she's in my brother's group of friends. We played basketball and pool together a few times.

In a pool night near the start of this semester, she came up to me and told me we were in the same class again (this time it was Bio). I was surprised since I couldn't recall she had ever initiated a conversation with me. Fast forward to the Bio class, I was struggling with the concepts, so I couldn't talk much to her, plus she wasn't sitting near me because her best friend was in the class too. We still greeted each other when we met and talked for a bit more than before, but that was it.

Now that the semester is ending, I finally caught up with the material and realized that I had a crush on her. So I walked up to her at the end of our last class to ask her, only to find out that she was late for another (our class ended late that day, and she had a final for her next one). So I only stopped at asking what she would be doing for the weeked and had to let her go. She told me she would be preparing/moving for an internship for the summer.

That was Wednesday. On Friday, I texted her saying that I would like to take her out for a bite, to which she replied ""Sure! But I'm super busy this summer."" I wrote that I could understand, but she hasn't replied since.

Do I still have a chance with her? What should I do next?"
6go9v3,24,2017-06-11,Honest opinions of Nashville?,Jand95,nashville,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/6go9v3/honest_opinions_of_nashville/,"I apologize if there's already a million ""Nashville?"" threads. I live in South Carolina and got the chance to visit Nashville over Memorial weekend, my first time in TN. It was already on my shortlist, but I have to say I was pretty impressed with what I saw after finally getting to see it in person. I was surprised by all the cranes and development going up everywhere. 


I'm considering moving to Nashville to start my adult life. My girlfriend would be coming with me. I'm 23, African American, and have a degree in Communications. I went to school in Charleston, SC. She has a degree in psychology. I've lived in South Carolina my entire life, except for last year when I lived in DC, or technically Nova, for an internship. Now I'm back in SC, but ready for a new experience.


I was eager to get back to DC, but the job search has been difficult, even with my network and connections. I'm looking at Atlanta and Charlotte as well, but growing up 2 hours from both cities, I'm very familiar with both of them and was hoping to get away from home for once and go somewhere new.


I know Nashville isn't a walkable city, but I still find it more urban and walkable than Charlotte. I'm not into country, but I loved the city energy. I'm not anti-chain or anything, but I was impressed with all the local places that I saw. Tried Hattie B's it was really good. Almost tried Pancake Pantry but the line just became too much. Went to Biscuit Love instead, which was also good, and free. 


I also really liked the pedestrian bridge, how green the city is, and the booming job market. And the cost of living isn't ridiculous. It's my understanding that locals don't really hangout downtown, but downtown/Gulch still seems like a cool place to go to a rooftop bar (which I've read theres quite a few) and just hangout, grab a drink, and relax for the evening. I didn't encounter many of those in DC, for as big as it is. Nashville seems to be on the up in a big way and I want to move to a growing healthy city.


Nashville isn't too small, like Charleston, but also not Atlanta and DC massive either. 1.8 million people actually doesn't sound that bad when comparing with 5.7-6 million. And the city felt bigger and more urban than it was. 


I'm just concerned because while I've been getting good feedback on another city website, I've been scanning this subreddit and have seen more negative anecdotes. I've read a couple other threads of others curious about moving here and I saw a lot of ""Nashville isn't as cool as it seems, there's better places"", ""you probably wont like it here"", ""it's too expensive and you don't get much"", ""it gets old after 2 weeks"", ""you gotta drive 40 minutes"", ""the mural culture is fake, restaurants are overrated"", etc. That worries me as this will basically be our starter city, if I we commit to it. I have a google doc full of job openings, ready to start applying, but there's just something on my shoulder telling me ""hold up a sec."" 


The only real negatives was the drivers. The traffic was fine, but the drivers were giving Atlanta a run for their money. As someone who has driven 75 and 85 in Atlanta and 395 and 495 in DC, Nashville was an eye opening experience. The lack of public transportation and more cohesive walking environment also kind of stinks as I got used to the Metro train in DC, and walking many places in DC and Charleston. Felt good not having to drive 24/7. And having to feed the parking meters everywhere was annoying. I wanted to explore some areas, but had to keep scraping up coins, then had to keep an eye on the timer to make sure I made it back to my car in time. 


Nashville is also a little far inland from what I'm used to. I've never lived more than 4 hours from the coast. She has lived on an island her entire life (except for college, which was on a peninsula lol), so it'll be an even bigger transition for her. And this is just a nitpick, but the horde of powerlines and giant business signs everywhere make some areas tacky. But again, it's a nitpick.


The overbuilding of luxury apartments is also annoying. Some places are charging $1300+ to live next to rusty warehouses, and there's not even a grocery store nearby (ps what's with Kroger's stranglehold, and why are they so ugly?). That baffles me. I'm not trying to fret over it too much though as that's gonna be a problem wherever I go. 


So can I get an honest assessment of Nashville? Like I said, it feels unique, feels about the right size, and there seems to be so much going on and much coming (Topgolf, nice!), and the job market and health of the city is strong. And Tennessee is a very pretty state. After reading comments on here though, and my second guessing nature in general, I'm just afraid of making a mistake and then we're stuck, or moving to Nashville then hating it like a month later and wanting out. I don't want that. I want to be proud to call it home. I'm still interested in LA, and Chicago I'd really like to give a look, and I haven't given up on DC, but of Nashville, Atlanta, and Charlotte, Nashville is the most intriguing of the 3 to me.


Thanks everyone for your time. Sorry for such a long post by the way.

*ps I've been keeping up with the Preds. Rooting for you guys all the way and I'm very excited for the game tonight. It's amazing."
6gobdq,4,2017-06-11,Learning from this morning's relapse.,Bromely,pornfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/6gobdq/learning_from_this_mornings_relapse/,"Story: After a week or two of near-daily relapses, I managed to keep a streak of 10 days until this morning. This is one of the longer and more successful streaks I've had in a while, and also one of the most liberating and eye opening. 

What helped:
* I managed to get most of my streak because my mother had been home for 8 of those days. I find that when I PMO, it's typically when I'm home alone, with little to do. Interesting enough, today has been the first day since Friday of the previous week that I was truly by myself with no expectations.
* Distractions: following the last bullet point, I managed to avoid potential urges by either reflecting on them in a meditative state, or by engaging in something else (listening to music, playing video games, etc.).These factors combined gave me a very low chance of relapsing on a given day.
* A sense of purpose: knowing that I would start an internship was a big factor in making sure I was prepared for anything, especially as I would be in a new environment that breeded unfamiliarity.

During the process, things learned::
* Although I cannot clearly stated why I started watching, the final effect is that it keeps me from feeling ""negative"" emotions; namely boredom, depression, and a lack of personal and emotional security. Yesterday had been pretty intense, but given what helped, I managed to ride through them for the day without too much difficulty. 
*Personality-wise: somehow, I find myself being more sarcastic and emotional on a daily basis, compared to the apathetic, solemn silence while on porn. I've started enjoying assessing/criticizing things, especially the music I listen to.
* Physical: perhaps a little more facial hair?

Current mood:
* A little anxious, especially after a small to decent binge (I couldn't really explain this). Especially as I continue my work tomorrow.
* Somewhat apathetic, feeling as though I'm putting up a front to prevent vulnerability and being upset over small details (despite feeling it regardless).

Looking forward:
* I can distract myself on the weekdays through my internship for the next 8-9 weeks, seeing that I can leave the house early and come back relatively late enough to prepare myself for the next day. Afterwards, I have to distract myself for 3 weeks before traveling for 3.5 months (which, I believe, will make me safe then).
* Weekends currently are and will be a problem (for many people, I assume), especially when my mother isn't home. I could think of outdoor options if I'm able to (movie? hanging out with someone? attending an event?), although I'm relatively bounded to the house.

Thanks, if you've bothered reading all of this. I'm wondering whether or not relying on distractions this much is helpful, considering that there may not always be something I can shift my mind to."

6gp073,13,2017-06-11,[Remorse] I let my married boss come onto me and I don't know why I didn't stop him. [tough love],olive1072,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6gp073/remorse_i_let_my_married_boss_come_onto_me_and_i/,"Two years ago, I was an intern in a lab and I didn't have much experience, so I worked very closely with my mentor. He was much older but was so funny and hardly seemed far from a millennial with his humor so we got along instantly. I'm not sure exactly when it began but after giving him my phone number so I could ask for instructions in lab when he wasn't there and I began receiving messages late into the night. First it was friendly conversation but it seemed wrong to me right away... he would talk to me until midnight. But I didn't want things to be awkward so I ignored my apprehensive feelings and tried to pretend everything was fine. I would convince myself he was just being nice and I was so lucky I had a mentor who would be so thoughtful about me. I also knew I really needed his letter to get into grad school. Eventually he professed his romantic feelings to me but promised nothing would ever happen. I remember feeling numb and scared and even physically ill but again I was focused on not letting things get awkward and pretending everything was fine. I only had five weeks left of working for him and thought I could surely survive. 

Things got so much worse so quickly. What began as touching my shoulder or back at work turned to trying to finger me between my tightly pressed legs in my car and pressuring me to go to a conference with him. I was horrified but I somehow I felt like I couldn't stop him. I wouldn't say no. I didn't say anything. He would tell me if I wanted to go to grad school I needed to be a different bolder woman and if I didn't go to this conference I didn't have what it took. So I went. And ended up in his hotel room. 

I went back to my senior year of college and all the numbness was suddenly gone as I returned to my old life. I was in such agony and guilt but couldn't tell a soul. I wanted to die. Ironically having him being the only one who knew and who I could talk to about it made me super attached. I lost friendships and relationships and became so withdrawn and still I didn't tell him to leave. I tried but I could never cut him off. And he was extremely persistent. He would blow up my phone and even message my friends if I didn't reply to him. It was so messed up. I even felt like I loved him even though I hated what had happened because of him. 

I did get into grad school and being 800 miles away has helped. I have since cut him off and have blocked him on nearly every sort of media and have finally begun to heal. But I still don't know why I was so weak to let it all happen. I know I was so paranoid about having him like me so I could have a letter of recommendation or whatever but I would have never believed I would have let all this happen over that. I thought of his wife constantly and felt so much guilt and pain. My own parent had an affair and I knew precisely how it hurt the other. And I still didn't cut him off... As far as I know she still doesn't know.

I don't feel an ounce of attachment or romance or missing him. I still feel as awful and ashamed as I did my senior year but I have had to let some of it go in order to function. I suppose it is past and I might never know why but insight and tough love would be appreciated. Thank you for reading "

I've looked up stuff online about ""what to know when moving out"" but I think it'd be more practical to get advice from actual people's situations. Things like what age you moved out, maybe a reason why (if you're willing to tell), and what it's like. What are some things that people don't really think about when they move out that ends up being important? Financially I don't think I'll have an issue and I'm getting a good degree from college so it should get easier as the years go on. I'm really just new to this and would love some advice.

10 Things I Hate About You

6gpljn,6,2017-06-11,"Other guys, what would you do if you were working at a family company where they didn't want to include you?",crosscurious227,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/6gpljn/other_guys_what_would_you_do_if_you_were_working/,"I'm 22 and I'm working as a telecom technician for a small family business owned and ran by my dad and his dad. I feel like they don't really care about me or want me there because they always nag me about being lazy/not ambitious, saying I need to put in more of an effort to learn the trade, etc.

The thing is though, I'm always trying to be enthusiastic and learn more about the trade so that I can be a bigger asset to the company and thus make more money. I'm always trying to ask questions and learn more (I even ask for reading material or homework to study during my free time), but they never want to do any training with me. Frankly, I have an above average IQ and could easily pick it up if they actually invested some time and effort into getting me started. I love solving puzzles and figuring things out. I've always been a stereotypical nerd. This profession would therefore easily suit me. To be honest, when I actually get a chance to do work on my own without being shadowed, I actually enjoy the intellectual challenge it presents. They never let me actually do anything hands-on, though, and treat me like I'm an idiot who needs constant hand-holding and under-estimate how much I'm already capable of doing. I know a ton more about telecom than your average person off the street and yet I'm being paid minimum wage. I feel like I'm worth more than that, and could still do a lot on my own (though not as much as they would like: I'll admit I have room to grow). I'm starting to get bored and frustrated with this situation where I'm underutilized and underestimated, though I try not to show it and just plough through stoically anyway.

Basically, I'm sort of a grunt or intern type position still even though I've been working part-time during school months for 3 years and full time during school breaks and summer for the same amount of time.

I don't know what the problem could possibly be since I'm pretty much the epitome of a good employee. I have a great work ethic (people even say this), am mature for my age (people also compliment me on this), don't complain, am easy-going, maintain a friendly and positive attitude, etc. I show up to work on time and act polite to everyone.

Normally I'd just say screw it and quit, but I find myself in a very awkward position because this is a family company. I can't afford to burn bridges because I still live with my parents (this is california and housing is stupidly expensive, especially with what I'm being paid). I'd still rather be doing this than working at McDonald's or something stupid like that, though, and it's not like there's a plethora of jobs out there in this messed up economy.

I've tried talking to them about this before but nothing ever changes, despite the fact that they say they sympathize and want to work on it. I'm starting to wonder if there's some kind of resentment going on here. I don't always get along very well with the rest of my family, but I don't outright hate them or anything remotely close to that. IDK, maybe they see things differently.

Maybe they're just humoring me but don't want to give me a real shot?

Anyway, what do you think I should do? I feel like I shouldn't still be making a measly 10 bucks an hour when I'm 22. I want to start getting my life on track and make enough money to move out and be independant, but I can't do that, and not even my own family wants to help me get there it seems."

6gpq7e,1,2017-06-11,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6gpq7e/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
6gpx3c,143,2017-06-11,Me [30 F] recently discovered fiancé [39 M] was cheating on me with handjobs and eventually sex with a massage escort. Now I'm single and panicking.,strongwomansoftheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6gpx3c/me_30_f_recently_discovered_fiancé_39_m_was/,"Without going into detail the title pretty much is what happened. Now I'm 30 and single and I'm panicking!  I never thought I would be single at this stage in my life. I have a good career, great friends, and I *thought* I was on my way to being a wife and mother.


Now that THAT is shot to hell I've been thinking things like ""Assuming it takes me minimum of a year to get over this, who's going to want to date a 30+ Asian woman?"" ""Who wants to get married and start a family with someone in their mid 30s?"" ""What man out there is willing to date a woman in her mid30s when there's so many 20-somethings that will date him?""


I feel like an untouchable. The one where you ask ""Hey are you married"" and when I say ""No"", people feel sorry for or ask ""Whats wrong with you?""


I'm even caught myself considering going back to that scumbag because he says he'll change and that prospect is much more promising than trying Tinder at 30 years old. I know.... it sounds so desperate and pathetic but that's where my panic has gotten me. 

Anyone out there have advice for me??
  
  ---   
  **TL;DR**: Freaked out because I'm single at 30 and thinks there's no way I'll have a family now. 

---
**EDIT**  In case anyone is interested in the whole story.... Here it is...


My ex and I have been together for 4 years. And throughout those 4 years, we've had our ups and downs but overall we treated each other with respect, had great times, and overall seemed like a great relationship. We were the couple everyone thought would make it and people were envious of us.


So last Sunday, I found a phone number I didn't recognize while I was paying his bills. When I googled it, the first thing that came up was TheEroticReview. I confronted him that night but of course he denied it and said he would call Sprint tomorrow to check. I believed him that night, but the next morning, I texted the number. Oddly enough, I actually got a reply. I pretended I was an escort asking questions about a client and sure enough.... she confirmed that she's seen my ex.


I left the apartment that night and spent two nights in a hotel. The whole time I kept asking for the truth and every time he said ""'Thats it, thats all"", it never was. For 3 days, his story got worse and worse until FINALLY he admitted to attempting to have sex with the massage prostitute.
I went through hell looking for an explanation and this is what I got.


Before we got together he was with this girl Jenny. Jenny cheated on him with his best friend. His best friend came to visit my ex from Seattle and while my ex was at work, the best friend and Jenny had sex. My ex found out by finding a condom in his trash. After he confronted Jenny, she told him she did it bc he would always become easily stressed and take it out on her and she was tired of it.


After they broke up he started getting massages regularly. Most of them ended with happy endings. He did this almost once or twice a week for 5 months.


He told me he and Jenny had been over for a year but he lied. It had only been five months after they broke up when we started dating. He stopped going to massages/handjobs after we met and he pretty much used me to replace the wound in his heart. He thought I would just be a rebound but he fell in love. Everything was going great until 2 years into the relationship, my ex lost his job because the company shut down his department. He went back to making sushi and minimum wage and he was so stressed out and depressed. He took his stress out a lot on me. During this time I started baking more to try and sell baked goods on the side for extra money. I was going to school full time, worked home health care full time, and I was baking. I used an app called WeChat to sell baked goods. This one guy was really nice to me and we ended up being good friends. Since my ex was emotionally distant I started telling this guy more and more about my day.


Long story short, I started talking to this guy more than to my ex. Nothing ever happened, I never sexted, I never even met in in person but I knew I was pulling away emotionally. So I came clean. I told my ex that I realized what I was doing and it was wrong and gave him the choice to leave me if that crossed the line with him but that I loved him and we would both work on ourselves.


He stayed with me but I guess he said after that he kind of shutdown. He said that really broke something inside him and he couldn't believe he was pushing his gf away again because of stress and he started getting massages again (without handjobs).


Then the company that originally laid him off had openings, and they reached out to him to see if he would come back to the company. When he went back to the company and our financial issues weren't as horrible, he said he stopped going to get massages because he wasn't as stressed anymore.




It was good for a while again and during this last year, he started his internship at the hospital and couldn't work full time and do the internship at the same time bc the stress started giving him heart palpitations. So for his health, I started working two jobs and supported both of us. I paid all the rent, my bills, and his bills. Whenever we went out, I paid for everything. He said after this he completely lost his identity. He had been so independent for so long and he didn't know how to handle it. So he got more massages and eventually he started getting handjobs again. He said the handjobs were always from older ladies until one day, the older lady offered him someone different and this was a young, good looking, girl. He admitted that he was so excited bc unfortunately, through all this, I had gained like 30 pounds and didn't look like when we first met. And this girl had my old body. At first it was just handjobs, then one day she offered sex and he said yes. He said he put the condom on but as soon as she got on top of him and tried to put it in he went limp bc all he could see was my face. He panicked and got out of there as fast as he could. He promised himself never again and hoped I would never find out.


But I did and when i confronted him, all he could think was, I can't lose this.... Shes the one. So he continued to lie and lie and lie. Until finally I told him it was over, and thats when all the truth came out.
I honestly don't know what to think other than I think he's really sick. Like I think he has an addiction.... and seriously maladaptive coping mechanisms. I think that I was the drug that replaced the handjobs and he had rode that high until I fucked up. After that I wasn't on a pedestal anymore and he went back to the only thing he knew for stress relief.... massages.


Obviously, I've kicked him out of the apartment, packed all his shit, and told him there's no way we are ever getting back together. ESPECIALLY since he asked for my parent's blessings for marriage A WEEK AFTER he cheated and they said yes! So now I'm in the most awful place where I'm 30, newly single, and I have to tell my parents that I'm not getting married after all, even after I LITERALLY PAID FOR EVERYTHING FOR A WHOLE YEAR. I'm so ashamed of myself and I'm struggling in dealing with this new path I'm on.....

**TL;DR** Ex [39M] has anxiety/stress driven massage fetish that ruined our relationship and led to cheating."

6gqbf0,9,2017-06-12,Suggestions for a CS major looking to move into cyber security,LuKenneth,security,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/6gqbf0/suggestions_for_a_cs_major_looking_to_move_into/,"Hi all,

This is my first post here, allow me to introduce myself. I am 21 years old, with one year left to graduate from a private university with a major in Computer Science. My school's curriculum often leaves me unsatisfied. It's the same old Java class year after year with a few tweaks. So I often do some of my own learning outside of the classroom. I'm very passionate about learning new things, and my most prominent self-taught topic has been mobile application development, which has landed me 2 internships at the same company summer after summer as a mobile dev.

I've been dabbling in the topic of cyber security for a couple weeks now, and I'm quickly realizing that this is where I'd like to take my career. I love the idea of helping people by finding vulnerabilities before the bad guys do. I love problem solving and challenges. There's a certain level of critical thinking required with this that I don't get to see in typical software development. I've been reading a book called Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking by Georgia Weidman, and I love it. 

What I'd like to know is, where should I go from here? 
Do you have any other good book recommendations? Or maybe courses?
I am currently auditing some cyber security courses on Coursera, as my university does not offer any.
What is your opinion on all these certifications I've been running into on the Internet? I'm seeing many different CompTIA stuff and I've been looking at Cybrary.it 
Would certifications be worth it?

Looking for some guidance, any help or friendly conversation is welcomed and greatly appreciated!"

A couple weeks ago i started Grey's and became absolutely obsessed. First three seasons were so good. I'm on the first episode of season 4 and I feel like it already feels different?  Burke left and I'm honestly shocked. At times he was pretty arrogant and an asshole but i still liked him. After watching him and growing attached to his character for three seasons and everyone else I just feel sad. Plus with all these new interns... and George is STILL with callie  which I thought would have been resolved by now bc she deserves better than a guy who cheats. I liked George until he cheated. It seems Meredith and Derek aren't going to work out which is so frustrating after three seasons of watching them together. 


Anyways... is it worth It? Does the show get worse? "
6gqgm2,0,2017-06-12,Looking for resources to become proficient in Java,PauLWaFFleZ,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/6gqgm2/looking_for_resources_to_become_proficient_in_java/,"So I'm currently a Computer Engineering student and I'm trying to find ways to make my resume look better for internships. I've figured out that an easy way to have a lot of languages in your skill set. I'm just looking to learn enough about Java to where I feel comfortable enough to put it on my resume. I would be willing to bet that when recruiters and etc look at your resume, and you say you know X language, then that basically means that you took in class for that language. Doesn't mean that you've read a whole entire book from cover to cover, just that you know enough about the language to do intermediate level stuff. So anyone know of something that can give me a college level course amount of knowledge?"
6gqixi,20,2017-06-12,I did some napkin math on the financial viability of Apollo,PM_ME__DANK__MEMES,apolloapp,https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/6gqixi/i_did_some_napkin_math_on_the_financial_viability/,"    # Conservative estimate of the total hours put into Apollo

    $HOURS_PER_DAY = 4
    
    $MIN_HOURS = 965 * $PERC_OF_TOTAL_DAYS * $HOURS_PER_DAY = 1,930 hours
    
    # Dollar amount needed to break even given an earning potential
    $BREAK_EVEN_MIN_WAGE = $MIN_HOURS * $10 = $19,300

    $EXPECTED_YEARLY_PROFIT = $EXPECTED_USERS_FIRST_YEAR * $IAP_PRICE * 0.7 * $CONVERSION_RATE = $15,6978

**Conclusion**  
**TLDR** Even if Apollo were to be released today, /u/iamthatis will not be able to recoup initial development time costs (at minimum wage) after one year of revenue.

I started using the latest beta from a friend and it's underwhelming for something that's been in development for over 2.5 years. It got me wondering so I used extremely conservative estimates to project the financial outcome if Apollo were to be released to the App Store today.

My conclusion is that even if /u/iamthatis values his time at minimum wage (as in he could just as easily be flipping burgers at Mc D's), it is unlikely that Apollo will succeed from a purely monetary standpoint. He'll end up short *at least* 15,000 users or roughly $5,000 in the red if he releases Apollo now and does no further development.

He might have grand notions of making the best Reddit client, but there is massive competition from already-existing apps like narwhal for pro and iPad users and Reddit Official for casual users. From what I saw Apollo doesn't really have much of a value proposition right now besides loosely adhering to the default iOS interface elements.

I don't claim that he couldn't have gotten some intrinsic benefits from working on the app for this long especially as a hobbyist side project. However I think he should seriously consider the opportunity and financial costs of working on Apollo.

---

For clarification the calculations above basically do this:

1. Estimate the minimum number of hours /u/iamthatis has worked on Apollo = 1,930 hours
2. Estimate the net income needed to break even with development costs:
  * Working at min wage ($10/hr) = $19,300
  * Working as an intern ($30/hr) = $57,900
  * Working as a contractor ($100/hr) = $193,000
3. Estimate the number of total users needed to break even:
  * At min wage: 92,212 users
  * As an intern: 276,636 users
  * As a contractor: 922,121 users
4. Estimate the number of users and net revenue in the first year given the current Reddit market:
  * Projected users: 75,000 users
  * Projected profit: $15,6978

Projected profit ($15,6978) &lt; Working at min wage ($19,300)"
6gqk3t,5,2017-06-12,"3.0 GPA, non-target state university",TheRaven1992,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/6gqk3t/30_gpa_nontarget_state_university/,"Let me start out by saying that I fully understand the uphill battle I will face trying to gain entrance to, by any standard of decency, a worthwhile law school. 

I come from a very unconventional background, first generation college student, grew up lower class out in the country, and never really understood the world until I was 18 and headed off to college 

During my years in school, I experienced hardship that greatly offset my GPA. My very first semester my mother passed away from lung cancer, this left me essentially an orphan due to my father passing away when I was 14. I managed to pull myself together from that bad semester I had and graduate with a bachelors of science in business administration, minor finance, with 3.2 - 3.4 every semester. No excuses for the low GPA, just relaying my experiences. 

After college I had trouble finding employment due to lack of internship experience, due to lack of money from not having any parental support. I enlisted in the U.S Army and have about a year and a half left until I fill full my obligations that I pledged.

I recently bought some LSAT study material but am completely overwhelmed with the logic games and am nervous since this is the one part of my application I still have a chance to make strong.

Boston University is my dream school, I fell in love with the savvy culture and renaissance style architecture when I visited. I also believe it would be a good fit for me personally.

6gqrex,15,2017-06-12,I [30F] just broke up with my fiance [39M] because I caught him cheating on me with handjobs and eventually sex with a massage escort.,strongwomansoftheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6gqrex/i_30f_just_broke_up_with_my_fiance_39m_because_i/,"My ex and I have been together for 4 years. And throughout those 4 years, we've had our ups and downs but overall we treated each other with respect, had great times, and overall seemed like a great relationship.  We were the couple everyone thought would make it and people were envious of us. 

So last Sunday, I found a phone number I didn't recognize while I was paying his bills. When I googled it, the first thing that came up was TheEroticReview. I confronted him that night but of course he denied it and said he would call Sprint tomorrow to check. I believed him that night, but the next morning, I texted the number. Oddly enough, I actually got a reply. I pretended I was an escort asking questions about a client and sure enough.... she confirmed that she's seen my ex.  

I left the apartment that night and spent two nights in a hotel. The whole time I kept asking for the truth and every time he said ""'Thats it, thats all"", it never was. For 3 days, his story got worse and worse until FINALLY he admitted to attempting to have sex with the massage prostitute. 

I went through hell looking for an explanation and this is what I got. 


Before we got together he was with this girl Jenny. Jenny cheated on him with his best friend. His best friend came to visit my ex from Seattle and while my ex was at work, the best friend and Jenny had sex. My ex found out by finding a condom in his trash. After he confronted Jenny, she told him she did it bc he would always become easily stressed and take it out on her and she was tired of it.


After they broke up he started getting massages regularly. Most of them ended with happy endings. He did this almost once or twice a week for 5 months.


He told me he and Jenny had been over for a year but he lied. It had only been five months after they broke up when we started dating. He stopped going to massages/handjobs after we met and he pretty much used me to replace the wound in his heart. He thought I would just be a rebound but he fell in love.
Everything was going great until 2 years into the relationship, my ex lost his job because the company shut down his department. He went back to making sushi and minimum wage and he was so stressed out and depressed. He took his stress out a lot on me. During this time I started baking more to try and sell baked goods on the side for extra money. I was going to school full time, worked home health care full time, and I was baking. I used an app called WeChat to sell baked goods. This one guy was really nice to me and we ended up being good friends. Since my ex was emotionally distant I started telling this guy more and more about my day.


Long story short, I started talking to this guy more than to my ex. Nothing ever happened, I never sexted, I never even met in in person but I knew I was pulling away emotionally. So I came clean. I told my ex that I realized what I was doing and it was wrong and gave him the choice to leave me if that crossed the line with him but that I loved him and we would both work on ourselves.


He stayed with me but I guess he said after that he kind of shutdown. He said that really broke something inside him and he couldn't believe he was pushing his gf away again because of stress and he started getting massages again (without handjobs).


Then the company that originally laid him off had openings, and they reached out to him to see if he would come back to the company.  When he went back to the company and our financial issues weren't as horrible, he said he stopped going to get massages because he wasn't as stressed anymore.  

It was good for a while again and during this last year, he started his internship at the hospital and couldn't work full time and do the internship at the same time bc the stress started giving him heart palpitations. So for his health, I started working two jobs and supported both of us. I paid all the rent, my bills, and his bills. Whenever we went out, I paid for everything. He said after this he completely lost his identity. He had been so independent for so long and he didn't know how to handle it. So he got more massages and eventually he started getting handjobs again.
He said the handjobs were always from older ladies until one day, the older lady offered him someone different and this was a young, good looking, girl. He admitted that he was so excited bc unfortunately, through all this, I had gained like 30 pounds and didn't look like when we first met. And this girl had my old body. At first it was just handjobs, then one day she offered sex and he said yes. He said he put the condom on but as soon as she got on top of him and tried to put it in he went limp bc all he could see was my face. He panicked and got out of there as fast as he could. He promised himself never again and hoped I would never find out.


But I did and when i confronted him, all he could think was, I can't lose this.... Shes the one. So he continued to lie and lie and lie. Until finally I told him it was over, and thats when all the truth came out.


I honestly don't know what to think other than I think he's really sick. Like I think he has an addiction.... and seriously maladaptive coping mechanisms. I think that I was the drug that replaced the handjobs and he had rode that high until I fucked up. After that I wasn't on a pedestal anymore and he went back to the only thing he knew for stress relief.... massages.

Obviously, I've kicked him out of the apartment, packed all his shit, and told him there's no way we are ever getting back together. ESPECIALLY since he asked for my parent's blessings for marriage A WEEK AFTER he cheated and they said yes!  So now I'm in the most awful place where I'm 30, newly single, and I have to tell my parents that I'm not getting married after all, even after I LITERALLY PAID FOR EVERYTHING FOR A WHOLE YEAR. I'm so ashamed of myself and I'm struggling in dealing with this new path I'm on.....

Some nights get so quiet and dark that I think I should go back to him because I think he'll change and thats better than being alone forever. Crazy... I know... 

So question is.... What do you guys think.  How would ya'll handle this situation?  I'd appreciate the feedback.

TL;DR - Ex [39M] has anxiety/stress driven massage fetish that ruined our relationship and led to cheating.  What the fuck do I do now?"
6gquay,5,2017-06-12,Just got a job as a front-end developer for the first time. Could use a bit of advice!,kronokat,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/6gquay/just_got_a_job_as_a_frontend_developer_for_the/,"**Warning long post! Scroll all the way down for the TL;DR**

Hi guys. I used to work as a video editor for a few years, then did graphic design for another. I decided to teach myself basic front end web dev/design (html/css/js) and recently managed to land a job as a jr. front end developer in a fairly small company. It goes without saying that I'm still fairly inexperienced in this field.

The web development team prior to me joining consisted of 2 interns and a full-stack guy (the team lead). I was looking forward to getting some guidance or mentorship from the team lead. Unfortunately, he left the company just a few weeks after I started, so now I'm pretty much the sole web developer in the team (plus the 2 interns).  

Things have been OK so far though. So far, I've only worked on 2 projects. 

The first was a fairly simple micro-site with a bunch of article/product  pages. I was told that it was going to be a fairly static website, so I opted to use Jekyll to put the site together. It turned out pretty good, and updating the site has been pretty easy thanks to Jekyll.

**Question:** I used Jekyll because it's what I'm familiar with. But what do other people actually use to make static sites in general? Would just using some basic PHP includes be sufficient? Or do they use CMSes for this sort of thing?  

The 2nd project I worked on is a Wordpress site made by the interns for a client. I have just a bit of Wordpress experience; worked on a simple site for a friend, modifying a starter theme and using ACF plugin etc. I don't think the interns received much guidance on this project (probably because the team lead was already planning on leaving), so the site ended up a complete mess. It looks mostly fine on the outside, but when I saw the code, I was shocked.

It turns out they weren't using page templates of any kind. They were basically pasting all the HTML for every page into the WYSIWYG editor. This project includes a directory page listing over 100 pages (all using the same layout, with just minor naming/image changes for each page). For each page, the interns copy pasted the same HTML code into the WYSIWYG editor and manually edited the content in there. Not to mention that a lot of the CSS was inlined (plus an unbelievable amount of **!important** for god knows why), scripts were all over the place etc. The simplest updates to this site took hours to do because of how convoluted it was. The interns weren't really at fault since they've never even used Wordpress before, but it puzzles me how they were given such a major task to work on with no real guidance.  

I decided to rework parts of the site by making custom page templates, chucked in a bunch of advanced custom fields, and used loops to display pages etc. This took a while but at least the site is a lot easier to update now.  

I've been told that the next project will involve us revamping one of the sections of a bank's website. This part of their site seems to be mostly article/information/video content. Our designer has shown me some of the initial website designs, and as far as converting the layout into HTML/CSS, I believe I can do it. However, I am lost when it comes to actually managing all the content they provide us, and making a working search engine for the site (one of the requirements) that can filter stuff by category etc.  

The only CMS I'm familiar with is Wordpress, and I'm not sure what we're using for this project (most likely not Wordpress I think). 

**TL;DR - I'm a self-taught front end developer with basic HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery knowledge. I am now the sole web developer in my company and my questions are:**

1. What should I use to make simple static websites apart from Jekyll? Just static html/css files with some basic php includes?
2. What sort of a solution am I looking for to be able to create a content-heavy, dynamic website with semi-frequent updates? Am I looking for a CMS of some sort, or are there other options? Again, I'm only familiar with Wordpress at this point.
3. Is making a website search engine that can filter content/pages based on custom defined categories difficult? Is this a back-end thing or a front-end thing? I always assumed that this would be made mostly trivial with the help of a built-in CMS function or something, but I'm honestly not sure. How do I go about doing this?
4. I'm fairly comfortable with the basic HTML/CSS/JS stuff (though I'm still trying to learn more JS). What do you suggest I start learning next? Something like React?

Thank you in advanced for any help you can give me. Any additional advice or tips for a beginner like me is also greatly appreciated."

I'm French, and in the Netherlands for 3 months. I despise my sister.


She's a perfect human being.


I tried talking to friends, but they all say ""why do you hate her? She's perfect, she's so nice"".


I tried talking to my parents. They know it's the cause of my depression but they can't really do anything and they hate it when I talk about it.


I don't want to talk to my sister about it, it wouldn't solve anything. It's her general behavior that I hate, not her behavior towards me.



I have a therapist in France but not in the Netherlands.


I tried some subreddits but no one give a fuck.



---



I really want a small community I can talk to, listen to everyone's problems and talk about mine. 


If I had a good internet connexion at home, I'd play MMORPGs and the like and make friends online, or something like that.



I'm lost.



#EDIT : here's the whole thing.


---


Well, first of all, thank you everyone for your interest in my boring life.
Let me explain why I truly despise my sister. I'll try to give deeper explanations than ""she's just perfect"".
First of all, I'm going to give some context on my life.


I'm 20, and I have been raised by the best parents I could ever ask for. Supportive, not rich but still ready to buy us things from time to time, etc. Perfect parents in my opinion.
My sister is two years older than me, and from as long as I can remember, I've been jealous of her for stupid reasons. For instance, when we were kids, in elementary school, she managed to have a 20/20 (perfect GPA or whatever you call it in English) for the semester, and the best I did was like 17. I know this sounds really... Superficial, but I remember getting jealous because I would never be as intelluctual as her and whatever.

Anyway. During junior high &amp; high school, I can remember plenty of times I was jealous for petty stuff. Jealous, envious, I need to watch that Simpsons episode again. One time she got to give math lessons to a girl in the neighbourhood and earned plenty of money. Then she worked in a camping, then at another stuff. People from around our village came ringing to our door to ask her to do jobs and pay her. I remember her proudly showing me the 50€ bill she had earned by working while I wanted to have some pocket change but never managed to find a job.

Of course, during high school, I always tried to get better grades than she had two years prior. But I never managed to reach her level.

I chose science for my high school diploma while she chose literature, only because I wanted to stop walking into her footsteps.


When I was on my first year of Uni, she was doing her third year of bachelor's in Japan. I went to a city 400 km away from my parents', but when I came home, people only asked me how my sister was doing in Japan. My self-esteem was very hurt.

Then I went to Japan for two weeks, during the summer vacations, with my parents and my grandma. I think this is the mot depressed I've ever been. I hadn't seen her in almost one year. When we met her, she was super proud to be really bossy, to show us the way to go while in town. My parents were full of admiration in front of her and I was disappearing, fading away. As my grandmother put it, I was living in her shadow.

She was really proud of herself, she knew this country more than the natives. My parents were really impressed, really proud of her. I remember, when we came back to the AirBNB, I cried into my pillow every night and swore that the next day I'd throw myself under a bus. The only thing that kept me alive is that I don't want to die with people remembering me as what I am, while she continues living and people like her more and more. This sentence probably doesn't make sense in English, tell me if you want me to explain more. 

Anyway.I somehow survived to our 2-week trip to Japan. Then I started dating one of my sister's friends, went on an internship, spent one year without seeing her as she was living on the other side of France now. We met for 2 days in june, then she went on an internship in Ireland, working in Italy, had classes in San Francisco, visited friends in Seoul, had lessons in Belgium... I had the feeling that everyone was praising her. She was really impressive, living abroad and speaking fluently almost a dozen languages; On her FB page, she keeps posting things like ""5 countries in 4 weeks ? Challenge accepted."" Meanwhile, I tried my best to have my diploma, struggled with depression, had some mild heart disease, went on an internship. I had very mediocre grades, like 11/20, while she had validated everything with 18 so far. She is a very intelligent person, but she also works very hard.

I know grades don't matter, I know we study completely different things. But please understand that having such grade while my sister was doing VERY good, even in another field, was pretty bad for my self-esteem.

Anyway, I spent yet another year without seeing her. She traveled around the globe, Iceland, US, whatever. Had an Erasmus grant. My family kept saying, ""whoa, she's so amazing. It must be so hard! Do you realize? She has classes during the night because they're during the day in France!"" 

Meanwhile, I was diagnosed with depression during my bachelor's, had 55 hours of class per week, wanted to give everything up because I felt it was too hard for me. But when I saw my uncles, my aunts, my neighbours, all they said was ""ah, I'm glad you're doing good, your poor sister, it must be so hard for her"". 

Each one of my friends who knows her knows that she's an amazing human being. That she's really impressive, that she works really hard in addition to being a very intelligent person. 


Besides working, she takes part in plenty of activities. Trekking, sport, drawing, whatever. The only thing I can do and she can't is *music*. I'm pretty good at this, but not enough to make it my job. I wouldn't want to anyway. But the day she starts learningm usic, it will be the day my life is completely over. The day she will have beat me in each and every domain.

I studied bioinformatics and I was pretty proud of being able to code, but guess what, her master's in translation gave her lessons about basically everything my classes covered regarding informatics.

I'm a geek and have a lot of video game culture, my life kinda revolves around gaming, but she wants to translate video games. I know she will. I feel hurt.

On this week-end, I saw her for the first time since last year. I had to move to the Netherlands for an internship, so she came. Her pretext was that it was to see me, but I'm sure it's because she wants to add yet another country to her portfolio. I bet 100€ that in a few years she'll speak fluently Dutch too.

We went to visit Amsterdam, with my roommate who's a good friend.


I felt like in Japan again. Each time she suggested a path to take through the town, it was objectively the best one. Each time I said something, she had to add ""ah, yeah, reminds me of Roma"". When I talk about my University, she feels forced to say that hers is the oldest one in Europe. Each time I talk about any opportunity that I've had, she will casually remind me that her life is a thousand times better than hers.


----


Anyway, this is what I think of my sister, more or less. I could go on for hours, but you have to uderstand that to me, she's just a perfect human being. Yesterday, I finally blocked her on every social media because I felt like she was rubbing her perfect life in my face. I feel like a dumber Frank Grimes in front of a clever Homer Simpson.

I'm envious, but not only. I'm also full of admiration. And more importantly, I really feel like living in her shadow. My friends like me until they know her, then I'm just ""her brother"". My family asks about her before they realize I exist. My village, my hometown, my department, the whole country is full of admiration towards her.


My parents know that I struggle with this feeling. I've started seeing a therapist, but didn't have the time to go deep in the problem before I moved to the Netherlands, only to take some Cymbalta which didn't help yesterday when I almost broke down crying at my workplace.


---


I have no goals in life. I want to compelte my bachelor's then my master's, to earn a lot of money, to have a bigger house than hers and that's all. My only goal in life is to beat her for once. And that's really unhealthy."
6grufb,6,2017-06-12,Not allowed to take old company equipment?,hozzerford,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/6grufb/not_allowed_to_take_old_company_equipment/,"This year I have been lucky enough to get a summer internship at a company that revolves around their website/newspaper/databases/etc, just general IT stuff. For the first couple of weeks I've been on IT support, taking care of simple issues for other employees. In my downtime I'm often sorting out the store room into two sections - equipment to keep and equipment to bin. When I say bin I mean schedule some tech recycling company to come and pick it up. 

There are loads of old monitors, laptops, hdds, RAM sticks, phones, etc that are considered too old or worn out to continue using. I was thinking this is great, I'm sure they won't mind if I take some of this stuff, it will probably save them money on collection! 

Unfortunately, when I brought this up with the head of IT, I was told that due to strict laws they can no longer give their employees equipment in case something goes wrong (his example was a monitor going faulty, causing a fire and burning a house down). He also mentioned it was due to some EU laws.

Does anyone have more information on this? Is there a way for me to get round this by acting as a charity or something?

EDIT: I work in the UK, I should have added that as soon as I started talking about laws.

EDIT 2: A few people seem overly aggressive about this, I tried to word this post so it seemed as if I wasn't using this company for just its equipment. I genuinely enjoy working here and would love to do so after my studies. I have no intention of stealing from them.

UPDATE: I was having a friendly chat with the head of IT security, he's been around for a while and is highly regarded, and he said that if I wanted anything specific I should make a list and he'll run it by finance and see what he can do. Legend."
6gs3xq,3,2017-06-12,Need to talk. Never felt so lonely. Jealousy is killing me.,Riz_aux_capres,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/6gs3xq/need_to_talk_never_felt_so_lonely_jealousy_is/,"First I'm sorry in advance english is not my native language, so you will certainly see a lot of errors, grammar mistakes and bad traduction (and I wil be happy to be told so I can correct them) but I didn't found a similar subreddit about depression in my language. 

I don't know If I'm depressive or If It's just a bad period. I can't talk about It to my parents, or my friends, or even my bf because.. because I don't want to and they can't do anything about It. And I don't want them to bother about me. And I don't want to go see a doctor or a psy because.. It's frightening, I feel lame and I don't have money to spend on this ""small"" problem.

So, It will be a long story, or just medium, but I need to write this somewhere and be understanding... I don't really search an answer, because I 'know' what the possible answers are but some are beyond my control. Well. 

I love my family, my parents are like my bestfriends, I really did share a lot with them, they even know a lot about ""my prblems"", but Itry my best to smile everyday and be strong. But I'm not, I'm deeply unhappy. My parents got divorced last october. I don' live with them anymore since 5 years and I live alone 400km away from them. I did visit them when I have the time for 1 week or 2. But well, I knew they didn't get along very well since a moment but It was not my affair. I wanted them bot happy even If It means them apart from each other. I heard about this on the phone and I feel like something broke inside me. I'm an adult (25) so I understand and I think like them, It's best this way, because now they feel better and they can live their new life. But me... I'm an only child so I had only them for me, my home when I grow up... Solded of course, my room, my home Iwill never see It again. I have two home now is what you could say but... My childhood is not in them. 

Christmas was an epreuve. I just want to cry. I'm really attached to my family  and having to choose beteen christmas with mom or dad... It was painful and It will be till the end. I know they love me either way, no matter ""my choice"" but.. Why did I have to choose ? Please I just wanted a last christmas with the three of us together. And It will nerver be possible ever again. But It's better this way, I just have to accept It right ? I want them happy. And they want me happy but I can't.

That's the first part, the next part is that I moved 400km for my studies in videogame art and creation in 2010, they have always encouraged me, and I'm grateful. I did the 3 years of that school , did the obligatory internship and got my diploma, and meet my boyfriend there. It's been 5 years now that we are together. And It's there that all escalate quickly. After my internship, I remained unemployed during...3 years ? More or less. The sector of video game is young and so It's really difficult to find something. Like really (in my country anyway). Seriously, I gave up after struggling for nothing for too long and in distress and last ""hop"" I gave my cv to something totally unrelated at videogame because I needed to enter the world of work and not be a supplementary pressure on my parents shoulder (I know It's not really the case but It's tiring to not be independant and saw all of your friends and relative and people that come out of nowhere got what you want the most in the blink of an eye while I'm here trying seriously my best and getting nothing). Oh maybe they were struggling too you will say ? Since 3 years ? No, 6 month at worst. Well, don't misinterpret me, I'm happy for them, but not for me at all.

So I was recruited for this big fast food company wouh... I'm happy they did recruit me, If they didn't I think I would have just locked myself away. But It's during my time here that my parents divorced... And It was too much. I quit and take a month for me to go see my home one last time and my parents.

With this, we have a lot of project with my bf, great project, video game together, create our company an appartment, a cat ect... But It's been 4 years that I'm waiting for one of this thing to come. It's not his fault, nor mine. His other school project did well and he and his team are going at a lot of convention to sell their game, they had a lot of contact, they are doing podcast ect... It's great. But It's without me. He is doing all I want to with him, with other person, and he's succesful with It and I'm just..behind, doing alimentary work that are killing me. The worst... He did create a company... With them... I think another thing broke inside me this day ahah. What the fuck I amdoing with my life ? I don't want to have a lot of money, I just want to live my fucking life and be a little happy about It. But I regret everything. The jealousy of other that are more succesful than me, and they ARE MY FRIENDs are killing me the more I try to go out the water. I'm so happy for them seriously, but I want them to be proud of me too. I'm just this failure of a friend. I don't enjoy the time with them anymore because I feel out of place. They have a job, not the best, but a job they love and in relation with their studies and I'm just here, serving people in a restaurant. And the worst with that, is that I got this job because of a friend who boosted me. And now I want to quit too ? I'm just thankless and lame.

My parents and my bf are telling me that I just need to be a little patient, that thing will change soon because of the project I have been working on. It will pay they say... It's been 4 years that they are telling that It will pay! That i'm only 25 so I have time ! Seriously... I'm not this patient, I'm not this strong. I don't know how I can go to work everyday since that day. I cry everyday, I don't sleep, just mourning, telling me I'm just shit, because I am. Jealous of such great friends ! I'm destroying my couple because of that stupid jealousy too. Inconsciously or consciouly I don't know anymore, I'm trying to force my bf to leave me. I just give him pain, and he is giving pain too. I'm waiting for him because only him can give me something nice ! But me ? What can I give him ? If he wants an artist, he can finds some way better than me when he wants ! The paradoxe with that, is that I love drawing, and I like most of my drawings and character... But It does not lead me anywhere. Loving your work is just more painful ahah I'm desperatly searching for attention anywhere but I whereI need It I don't have It. Feel like my friends don't care at all about what I'm doing. Even my bf and my parents. Thay don't follow what I'm doing or stay silent or show me artist better than me. My heart is a mess, like this post. Courage to who read It seriously.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have an interview tomorrow, but i don't have any trust in me. And this friend who said to me ""If you got an interview with this company after your phone interview It mean that you will got the mission for 90% sure"". Thanks seriously..If I fail I will seriously broke entirely. Because I got an interview last week (like for a great company that I would loved to work with), the interview lasted 1hour, extremly positive, like, even me I was confiant ! And no... They took someone more experienced even If they are less available... I don't want to kill myself yet (even If I did have some though), but I'm tired. Everyone is moving, but not me. 

You could say that I just have to see somewhere else, work abroad. But I can't. I can't because If I leave where I am now, It mean breaking with my bf because I know a distance relationship won't work and he can't go with me since his project is advancing. And despite all of that, I love him and I see the future with him. And sometime I don't know what's better... If I was not with him, a lot of project would die, but I could return to my parents, and live a calm life maybe. So I'm at the point where all I could do is fucking wait; again. And put a mask on so I'm not worrying anyone with my lameless problem. 

I just want someone out of this to talk and who can understand this pain. I have a roof, friends, love, but I'm not happy. I think If the interview goes well tomorrow I would be relieved a little... And If not... I will need to step up again even If It's more difficult everytime. How are people doing It ?  Maybe the problem is just the pressure for not having someone to talk to ? I don't know. It's alaready difficult to not be decouraged by other artist and going on, but when the jealousy is spreading within my friends, how do you counter that ? I don't want people to pity me, nor to blame me (seriously I hate me already), just someone that say to me ""I understand"".

I am done telling myself that I want to stop slowly gaining weight and that I should start really losing weight. I am tired of thinking about how things will change in a few months and that I don't need to worry about this right now. 

I want to start today and make the change. I want to be under 170lb by my birthday in September. I have the MFP app and am ready to go at it with the CICO. I am a very active person (my internship is not helping that right now). I walk at least an hour everyday between walking to workout and going to and from work. I do the body weight routine from r/bodyweightfitness three times per week and I try to run stairs at least 2-3 times during the week as well.

My problem is food. I overeat all of the time and it affects my emotions and has been getting me down. I am looking for the tools to help me with those times. Additionally, I am a college student who is going to be eating meals that I will not be able to prepare for the foreseeable future. Does anyone know how to deal with this issue when tracking food.

I believe in CICO and want to make this change in my life to. I am fairly fit but am tired of overeating and feeling that I am overweight. For those reading, thanks for your time :) You are all great here and I can't wait to be part of the community.

6gs7sf,6,2017-06-12,Is starting a Macc in the spring a bad idea?,sabinmightyfist,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6gs7sf/is_starting_a_macc_in_the_spring_a_bad_idea/,"I graduated spring 2017 with a BS in accounting (no prior internship experience. I told my schools career office that I was planning on applying to a master program after graduation and they recommended that I don't apply for an internship and focus on graduating. The internships available to my university were only winter ones in which I would've had to push graduation off by a semester). I was planning on attending a Macc program this upcoming fall semester but due to family emergencies I won't be able to attend during the fall. Realistically I won't be able to start the program until the spring semester. Is it a bad idea to start a Macc program during the spring semester? My concern is I'll miss out fall recruiting and be  disadvantaged compared to other students who started during the fall. Relevant info ( I attended a small state school with no big 4 presence, 3.84 GPA, 5 years of retail sales experience, fairly outgoing, applying to a university with big 4 exposure). Thank you for any input!"
6gsqwh,12,2017-06-12,Split on Big4 and Internal Audit at Fortune 150,Bezdbefazed,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6gsqwh/split_on_big4_and_internal_audit_at_fortune_150/,"Hey everyone. This is something that's been driving me insane over the course of the past year, and that's sticking to internal, or hopping over to public. 

Context: I recently graduated from a very well respected university with a great accounting program. A lot of us feed into the Big4 regularly. I've built strong relationships with recruiters from Deloitte and KPMG over the past few years and have had many discussions of future employment, but no internships with them. I did however receive an internship offer from a fortune 150 company in their internal audit group which I am currently working at the moment. I've been told multiple times that this internship will lead to a full time hire after I complete my masters in accounting (also getting that from the same university).

The people are great, I love the managers, and the staff have already accepted me as one of their own. It's been great being here so far. That being said, I do know the chief audit exec had multiple years of experience working in a Big4 firm and another internal audit group prior to receiving his offer here. I would really like my career to extend far into this organization. I'd like to see myself in high managerial positions (not strictly accounting related) in the future. Should I sacrifice working in this fortune 150 to work in public to get that Big4 sticker? 

When it comes to the salary, I believe I will be paid around 55-60k as a full time hire as internal. This can progress upwards of 80-90k over the next 5 or so years. There seems to be a lot of upward mobility in this company as well, especially for those working in the internal audit department. 

Would it be wise to voice these concerns to the chief audit executive as well? He is the one who hired me and had been very helpful throughout the entire internship. I already am beginning to see him as a mentor. 

As of right now I love my internship. Have no offer to any Big4. Still have to complete my masters and will be getting my CPA even though I am sticking to internal. I do see receiving a CIA in my future if I stick to internal as well as my CISA and CM. But only if I am staying in internal. 

Thoughts opinions? 

Thanks everyone, could really use the advice. "
6gssdr,2,2017-06-12,Corporate card bill I was unaware of from past internship sent to collections - not showing up on credit report,BigLurchForPresident,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6gssdr/corporate_card_bill_i_was_unaware_of_from_past/,"Last Summer, I did an internship with a large company and was issued an AMEX credit card for some corporate and travel expenses. I was responsible for paying the bill each month, and I would file an expense report which would reimburse me for allowable expenses. On my last day, I handed the card in and they cut it in half. I thought that I had paid it off in full before leaving.

On Friday, I got a call from a collections company stating that I had a debt of ~$300. The original unpaid expenses were ~$105 and there were four fees at $40/each plus interest.

I checked my credit report and there are no reported debts from AMEX, but they are in the 'Inquiries Shared Only With You' section and has been requesting every month. My credit score is still great, but I'm worried that if I just settle the debt it will go on my credit report and reduce my score. I have a 780 that I've worked really hard to build.

I had no idea that there was any debt outstanding on my card. I lived in a different apartment before starting my internship, a different apartment during my internship, and two different apartments this school year. I also didn't have access to my corporate email upon leaving so any email sent to that address wouldn't have reached me. My phone number hasn't changed, and the debt collector was the first call I received.

I was driving when the collector called, so I asked if I could speak to them next week when convenient and they said yes. I told them I was unaware of any debt on that card and they made a note of that. I didn't give out any personal information in case it was a scam, but they were very specific with their details. They didn't say what the charges were, but the only thing I can think they could be is that I might have accidentally used it after leaving via my Uber app.

My top priority is keeping this off my credit report. It would also be great if I could avoid paying the penalties that caused my debt to triple, but that objective is secondary. Is there a reason that it is not showing up on my credit report? Is there a way I can get the penalties removed/reduced? Should I deal with AMEX or the collection agency? How can I make sure that this doesn't end up on my credit report?

Thanks in advance for any help, PF."
6gsww9,9,2017-06-12,Welcome to the Sharpe &amp; Steele Detective Agency!,Cereborn,CTWLite,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTWLite/comments/6gsww9/welcome_to_the_sharpe_steele_detective_agency/,"Welcome to the homepage of the Sharpe &amp; Steele Detective Agency. You may have found us from our Jabber Account, or perhaps our Jack'd-in profile, or maybe you saw our advertisements somewhere on S.L.U.M. (Simulated Life in Urban Metropolis). We are here to work for you.

Are you dissatisfied with life in [Alporte]? Are the city police a bunch of crooked thugs beholden to the interests of major corporations and crime lords, more likely to break your ribs themselves than to stop anyone else from doing it? You're not alone. And if you are tired of waiting for a broken system to get around to pulling you out of the gutter, head on over to Sharpe &amp; Steele, where we are ready and able to do what needs to be done.

##ABOUT

Sharpe and Steel Detective Agency was founded by Anton Sharpe and Ivy Steele 6 years ago, and it has quickly become the most trusted name in private investigation and security.

There is no case to big and no case too small. Wandering spouse? We have our eyes and ears at your service. The patriarch of your porn empire died under mysterious circumstances? We're on the case. We'll handle stolen jewels, hacked cars, stolen identities, and cult-member rescues, to name a few. We have the best detectives in the city, and they will leave no alley un-scrutinized.

But that's not all. We are also available for private security and protection, cyber-asset retrieval, forcible reacquisitions, or other services by request. **Sharpe &amp; Steele Detective Agency does not engage in murder, intimidation, or racketeering.**

##KEY PLAYERS

**Violet Corsair** (security). Violet prides herself on being the muscle of the operation, or rather, the titanium. She is a big believer in trans-humanism, and has had her body significantly rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements after surviving a horrific train crash four years ago. Both legs and her left arm have been replaced with robotic counterparts. She also has artificial lungs and an augmented heart, which gives her tremendous stamina. The parts of her body that are still natural are kept in top condition. She keeps a disciplined exercise regimen and maintains a sculpted physique.   
**Attributes:** - Robotic limbs, toned and muscular form, nearly bald head, and dark skin. Often wears a form-fitting kevlar suit.

**Cash Cardinal** (security). Cash is the other half of Sharpe &amp; Steele's power duo. Partly mutated from birth, he has always cut an imposing figure. At 220 cm and 160 kg, he is a behemoth of a man. While it seems like he could destroy anything with his bare hands, he is proficient with almost any firearm. He is smarter than most give him credit for. He's a expert in ballistics, and it is said that he can track any illegal weapon within 24 hours.  
**Attributes** - Enormous size, grey skin, short horns on his head  

**Turner Bright** (surveillance). This quick-talking former combat-sniper has always dreamed of work in the PI business, so he buys into it completely. He is almost always seen wearing a trench coat and never passes up an opportunity to light a lady's cigarette. He is also a crack detective with an extremely keen eye, on account of the fact that his eyes have been replaced by Mk-221 EagleEyes^TM. He can spot the brand of a lady's shoe from four blocks away and can catalogue details at a glance.  
**Attributes:** Trench coat, red hair, and deep crimson eyes (he could have gotten them in a natural colour, but he thought this looked cooler).

**Abner Crane** (intel). Abner suffers from an unfortunate and severe degenerative spinal condition that even the modern age of bodily enhancements is unable to fix. He is paralyzed in 95% of his body and confined to a magnetic wheelchair. He can speak only using a voice synthesizer. However, his intelligence level is staggering. He can find his way to any corner of cyberspace and crack any firewall. He spends most of his time operating his avatar in S.L.U.M., which is essential for the agency's information stream.  
**Attributes:** Pale, wheelchair-bound. His S.L.U.M. Avatar is usually tall, muscular, and well-dressed. 

**Sophia Katherine Snodgrass III** (intern). Sophia comes from a wealthy family. A very wealthy family. She was given her choice of workplace to intern at, and she chose Sharpe and Steele, much to the chagrin of her father. She is inexperienced, but enthusiastic. She is particularly quick to hop on any case that she perceives as having a feminist angle (she loves busting philandering husbands. But her innocent look and bubbly, bordering on ditzy, demeanour has made her useful for intel gathering. She also has a crush on Violet, but we're not supposed to mention that.  
**Attributes:** Blonde hair, 3D tattoos, lithe frame, owns a wide variety of boots

**Anton Sharpe** (co-owner) Anton is a dyed-in-the-wool true detective. He has a mind for logic and can often solve problems that other people don't even know they are looking at. He is the driving force behind Sharpe &amp; Steele and he lives for his work, spending long hours on the beat until the job is done.  He doesn't put as much effort into personal care. He is typically ungroomed and unkempt, and his clothing is usually dishevelled or laughably out of date. In spite of this, he is known as a ladies man.   
**Attributes:** Perpetual stubble, square jaw, grey eyes, gruff, masculine presence.

**Ivy Steele** (co-owner) Ivy shares Anton's keen intellect and devotion to her business. Apart from that, their personalities could scarcely be more different. Ivy is a slender picture of elegance, always seen wearing classy evening dresses or form-revealing casual wear, and augmented hair that is always seen changing colour and style. While Anton digs into the streets, Ivy is more prone to flit through the elite neighbourhoods and wheedle the high society types for information.  
**Attributes:** Slim, well-dressed, often seen in an ostentatious hair colour, grey eyes; airy, feminine presence.

**Jerusalem** (support). This is an intelligent robotic spider that is used in surveillance. The personality matrix Abner designed for it is flawed, and it is often willful and foul-mouthed.

##Location

Offices are located  on the eastern side of the business district, across the street from Kara's Game Corner. [View in map](http://imgur.com/QScwqbD)

 ***********************************************  

Anton Sharpe and Ivy Steele are co-owners of Sharpe &amp; Steele, but the two are never seen in the office at the same time. The common belief is that their personalities clash so much they simply can't stand each other. This is not the case. The truth is that the two are actually one person.

Ash, as they are known in freebooting circles, is one of the pioneers in a new and controversial wave of personal augmentation. The Reboot Sequence is a series of 9 biomechanical implants that, when activated together, will change a person's physical sex. They will reconstruct hard and soft tissue, alter hormones, affect hair growth, and even change bone structure. The transformation is so seamless that the subject in question would never be suspected of being other than their apparent sex, except for the very subtle signs of Rebooting one must be trained to look for. Communities who do this on a recreational basis are known as freebooters, and Ash is the leader of the [Alporte] chapter of freebooters. They are small in number and meet in secret, for the technology they use on themselves is quite sensitive, and still highly illegal."

I just graduated from university (did a Bachelor in Law and did a Master in Corporate Law). I have some experience as I started a profitable company during my studies (I ran a letting agency and was able to grow it really well and worked 1 year after my studies still on it). I also have an internship as a business developer in a ridesharing startup in an emerging country (which I am still doing now).

Right now, most of my peers are doing either 1/ The bar exam (in Europe which I really do not want to go back to)  or 2/ Going to PwC, EY, and the big firms. 

This sounds incredibly dull to me and I'd like to move to a fun city and have a more interesting job. However, being an expat at 25 is tough: companies do not really see value in you (I think I've read somewhere you need 5 years of experience).

Should I just go to the normal route and postpone my expat dreams for a few more years?

Thanks a lot!

6gtops,3,2017-06-12,I [19/M] am having issues with my mother letting me out with friends.,raml100797,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6gtops/i_19m_am_having_issues_with_my_mother_letting_me/,"To give a small ""prologue"" of my issue, I was born with a rare Heart Condition that has resulted in me having two open-heart surgeries to repair my condition. As a result, my mother has been very overprotective of me since birth, and I normally spent my youth indoors watching shows or sporting events, playing video games or listening to music on a mp3 player. 

Today, I'm 19 (going into 20 in a few months), still living with my mother, starting my sophomore year in university, and I'm trying to get a chance to hang out with my normal group of friends. The issue is that when I try to let my mom know that I want to go, she tells me ""no."" I try to explain to her who I am going to be with (which for the record, she's met my friends), and what we plan to do (normally it's eat out from a restaurant or hang out in one of the dorms playing video games or card games or watching a show or anime together), yet she tells me no. 

I try to be rational with her, to which she either gives me one of the following responses: ""I have/had a very bad feeling/dream that something bad will happen to you"" (to which I try to assure her that it was only a dream or I'm more than capable enough to take care of myself in a social outing), ""I don't like most of your friends"" or ""Some of your friends give me a bad vibe"" (to which I assure her that my friends are people like me, a geeky/nerdy person that's into their studies all while enjoying shows, anime and video games), or ""Well, if you feel old enough to do that, then you might as well move out and live on your own, and if something bad happens to you, you better not call me!"" (In this scenario, I live off of disability because of my condition and I can't really afford anything with the check I get, not to mention the check I get is enough to pay the rent where we live in). When I am with my friends during my regular class days, she tends to call me every 2-3 hours asking me where I'm at, who am I with and so forth, which sometimes I cannot answer her since I'm in a ""no phones"" zone like a classroom or a lab doing work. 

I understand that my mother is trying to look out for the best for me, but I do not want to be overprotected in this manner. Ironically, I have gotten scolded by her that I'm too naïve and that I'm going to be eaten alive by the world if I don't ""wake up and smell the coffee."" Right now, I'm in summer vacation until late August, and all I've done is stay indoors applying for scholarships, playing video games, watching anime or sporting events, or messaging friends (which is what I've done for some years now). I feel that my life is going around in circles with not much progress being done. The only time I don't feel this way is when I have classes and I attend them. 

I currently do not have my drivers license (the financial situation in my house is tough to the point that I haven't been able to afford classes to learn how to drive), nor a job (Getting a job with the minimum wage in my state means I come off losing money from what I earn monthly and I lose my health insurance that covers my cardiology visits, which I am currently pending another surgery to change a valve) and being in my house all day is driving my sanity to the ground. Not to mention, it isn't as easy as me to leave my house since I live in a pretty bad neighborhood (there's constant shootings between criminals and cops). 

I do not know what to do with this issue, and I am very concerned because while right now I'm 19, what if this continues when I'm 24? When I'm 29? I want to pursue my career, which will require me to do volunteering hours and internships, and I want to meet new people, to which I hope I meet someone special enough to be in a relationship with.

 I do love my mother very much, but I'm tired of being told ""no"" and I wish that my mother would cut some strings on my life and have a bit of trust with me and the people I choose to be with. I'd appreciate any sort of advise as to how to approach this issue and how to get my mother to understand that I want to have independence little by little. I just want her to understand that I want to be a normal, funcationing adult that wants to get his life going, without the massive amount of overprotectiveness. 

(As a note explaining why I haven't decided to move to the dorms in my university, what I receive for financial aid from my university is enough to pay for my classes and a few books. I would not be able to pay for in-state tuition.) 

TL:DR- My overprotective mother isn't letting me go out with friends I have already introduced to her and I am getting tired of being rejected in regards to going out, I need advice as to how to deal with this situation. 

Edit: Forgot to add [F/57] in regards to my mother in the title. "
6gtrio,9,2017-06-12,"Extremely inexperienced in love.. me (27F) with (32M), is this abuse or just life?",bosie9,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6gtrio/extremely_inexperienced_in_love_me_27f_with_32m/,"I always pretend to be a really tough person. I almost never rely on my friends for help, especially not regarding relationships. This is a whole can of worms by itself... but I just tend to keep things bottled up and now I feel like I've lost sight of what is acceptable and appropriate, and it's too late to turn to them because they think I'm just a really strong person (and I'm not.)

For some background on my love life, I had minor (~3 months or less) boyfriends when I was a teenager but nothing serious until I was 21. I got into a relationship with my boss when I was an intern, and he was 41. It was an extremely chaotic, stressful relationship. He was extremely controlling, got really jealous and angry all the time, and eventually I had to quit my job because it was affecting my work and reputation and health. Towards the end of the relationship, he got physically aggressive with me more than a few times and also hit me full on once. This was a pretty traumatic experience and I stopped dating for a really long time.

My current boyfriend now, I met when I was 25, so it's been 2 years now. I let him know early on that I was really guarded because of my past relationship and he was really, really sympathetic to that and let us move really slowly. I trust him a lot and always trust that he wants the best for me.

But I can't help but feel like he and my ex have *some* similarities, but I can't tell if this is just how relationships are to some extent, and I can't tell if I'm overly sensitive or these are warning signs that I'm avoiding, OR if this is just all ME and my issues and he's being normal.

I do find myself watching out when he gets angry and trying everything not to provoke him further if he gets mad. When he gets mad, he tends to stand up and pace or sometimes walks right up on me and tells me to repeat myself. I am scared of angry people in general, but he is also 6'4"" so when he does stuff like that and I just feel totally immobilized and I freeze. But later he always apologizes, brings me my favorite flowers, and makes me feel better. But then I remember that my ex used to do that too, it's just that he was a LOT worse. My current boyfriend is not a controlling or jealous person, so it's sort of different but maybe their anger is somewhat similar.

He has also *never* put his hands on me but to be honest, he has threatened me a few times. Like I remember one time he said- say that again, and I'll pop you right in the mouth- and kept daring me to say it (which I didn't.) And he apologized for this as well, saying wifebeaters and abusers disgust him and he has never hit a woman and never will. But in that moment I was really scared and didn't want to find out. He swears he would never though and to his credit, he never has. Not even grabbing me or pushing. His other bad habit is throwing things though.. BUT he is a baseball player so I figure that's just the way he deals with frustration and anger since that's all he's ever really known. So I don't know.

I guess it's all the fear in his anger that I'm confused about, really. Like is this just a part of the normal up and downs in a relationship? Is this my own shit that I need to deal with? Or am I still blind to warning signs? I feel like my compass is all messed up from my first relationship and I can't tell what's right and what's wrong since my ex was SO bad. My ex used to always swear and curse and call me names too, and my current boyfriend never curses or calls me names. That's a good thing, right?

Sorry for the wall of text. I just feel like a totally naïve teenager in regards to love sometimes. Am I missing something? I love him so much and am pretty much willing to forgive him for anything... I used to consider that the ultimate form of compassion and loyalty, but is that wrong?

***
**Tl;Dr** I've only had one ""real"" boyfriend before my current one, and he was 20 years older, when I was 21. He was really controlling and jealous and mean to me so I feel like I never really knew what a kind, loving relationship was... I am really in love with my current boyfriend but sometimes wonder if my compass is ""off"" because I feel like they have similarities.. but maybe I'm seeing things that aren't there and making a big deal out of nothing. How can I tell? Am I being too dramatic? Is this normal but I'm making it abnormal? What is ""normal"" if this IS abnormal?"
6gtrq8,3,2017-06-12,Love &amp; Timing,kee77,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6gtrq8/love_timing/,"So, I started seeing a guy in late February. We went to the same college, he hadn't really dated during undergrad and decided to give it a chance (he was a senior this year) starting then. I had been dating and in a few different relationships since starting undergrad (I was a junior). Also, he's bisexual and I'm gay.

We hit it off. I mean, to the point where we see each other every other day or more and when we don't see each other, we're texting. It's not feverous, but it's genuine interest and care for the other that manifests as such consistency. We met on Tinder, I had reached out to him. He's generally not a forward person, I usually take the initiative. We went on I think three official dates, first for coffee, then to a midnight showing of a movie, then watched tv in his room and made out. Then just started being seen by others as ""dating/hooking up."" I'm the one who is a serial dater. He has hooked up with one person since we started seeing each other, and asks me routinely (like once a month) if I've hooked up with anyone else since. I've hooked up with three or four guys. I've thrown up in his room, given him the clap and been treated with him, and accidentally locked him out of my room while he was in the bathroom in the middle of the night (he closed the door that locks, I fell asleep). This is to say what I've put him through. Then, while I was at home before starting work this summer, he confessed these feelings he's said he's had for several months.

He's from a major city a several hundred miles away from the major city we went to school in. After he graduates, he goes back because he couldn't find a job where we were. I stay in that city for an internship and to finish my last year.

We're still talking, but he recently confessed that he loves me. Loves me to the point that he sees a future with me, and he thinks if he commits to me it will be indefinite. Says it's like ""sleeping with my childhood best friend,"" it comes so easy. That stresses him out, he worries that this isn't the time for such a serious progression. He's seen many high school friends go down that path at this age and doesn't want it right now. He believes relationships follow a very linear progression which ends in marriage, which he sees for us but he thinks it's too soon. 

We're still talking and he's concerned that if we drift, I'll be angry and won't want to give him a chance at rekindling in the future. 

I'm confused because he seems incredibly genuine. He has these feelings for me but sorta wants to make sure that I'll still be interested on the off chance that we're both available in this undetermined amount if time until he's ready for his future. I'm not so much upset about that as him defining this as ""love"" yet not wanting to work through our current circumstance in some way and his instead preparing for us to drift apart. That doesn't spell love to me and makes me think he's going to drift (because I too love him, and I don't see myself allowing us to lose contact).

I'm not sure if I should emphasize that I don't want to drift, or if I should tell him we should stop talking, or if I should just follow the current course and see what happens. I don't personally want a committed relationship at this very moment, I just know that a few years after I get settled wherever I am after graduation (hopefully the city of our college) I'm gonna probably want something. If he and I were to stop talking I would probably try to just be single for a while (I'll probably do that regardless). I want him in my life, but I can't stand the idea of being ""just friends."" He's asked me to come visit him in his city in the fall if he hasn't moved back to this city by then, he's planning on visiting this city at the end of July/beginning of August. Help?"

All this thing was making me weak and I drifted away from my goals and started doing all the things that give me support to withstand these feelings of shattering.

I came across this community and the idea that why we shouldn't talk. just 2 days ago, I asked her to leave me as she was continuously telling me explicitly that she wanted to move on from this relationship and blocked her and now she is messaging me on skype, which I rarely used didn't care to block her there, that she is feeling lonely and weak and missing me. What should I do now? I want to consolidate her, comfort her as I always did."

Experienced mild headaches in the mornings for the last 2 days, but would always subside by noon (I always speculated this to be heat migraines)

Had chills last night and a runny nose; woke up today with headache and sore body, decided to sleep in. Woke up afew hours later with a swollen feeling in my throat (swollen lymph nodes? I don't know how to physically examine myself to tell)

Currently: no fever, no runny nose, no vomiting nor GI problems, loss of appetite, and a sore body all over. Like every sleeping position hurts; shoulder and elbow joints on my right side aches. I've been having the 'burning dry' feeling in my eyes, I've been bedridden the entire day

Other side info:

- haven't been to the doctor yet, will plan to do so tomorrow

- yes I've been exposed to mosquitoes, but no bites in the last 3-4 days or so (which coincidentally is the incubation period for alot of the mosquito-borne diseases here in Delhi)

- no GI problems despite the drastic change in diet in the last 3 weeks

- I'd say I'm decently hydrated throughout the day and I consider myself moderately fit

- family history of gout (I doubt this is that)

Will update on my condition tomorrow morning, if you guys can give any speculation as to what I have, that would be greatly appreciated!"

What is the best UK bank account for foreign withdrawals in Europe ? I (EU resident) will have an internship in the UK this summer and I am also planning to use the card in my country (hopefully without high fees).

Thanks 

Edit: I'll live in Cambridge


Second edit: I was thinking to go for Metro Bank, but saw this on their site: 'You can only open a Current Account if you're 18 years old or over and a UK resident.' and.. I will be living in the UK for only 2 months, so I am not sure if I could make an account."

6gvfff,3,2017-06-12,Cal Poly Pomona (CS) vs. SJSU (SE)?,wutsdasqrtofdisapt,CalPolyPomona,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPolyPomona/comments/6gvfff/cal_poly_pomona_cs_vs_sjsu_se/,"Hey all. I know there are a bazillion threads like this out there, but  thought I'd reach out for a bit more information. For clarification, I do not intend to put down CPP at all and I am very genuinely asking these questions because I see CPP as a strong candidate for me to attend.  
  
I (transfer student) was accepted to SJSU (Software Engineering) and was wait-listed for Cal Poly SLO (Software Engineering) as well as Cal Poly Pomona (Computer Science). I recently got my acceptance from Cal Poly Pomona and am still waiting on Cal Poly SLO, though I am not counting on it. My original ranking was:  
  
* Cal Poly SLO  
* SJSU  
* Cal Poly Pomona  
  
However, I am now more seriously considering Cal Poly Pomona because I want to be closer to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena (recently got my foot in the door for potential internships). I've felt that CPP has the third ranked CS/SE program out of the three schools, but it's proximity to JPL and it's ""polytechnic"" classification is making me think twice about this. I've also got to admit, since CPP waitlisted me and SJSU accepted me right away, I get this irrational feeling that CPP must have higher ranked students and thus, I want to be associated with a more exclusive student-body (does that make sense?).  
  
I have a tutoring gig lined up for the Fall at SJSU and have already submitted housing apps and all that other stuff on time since I was accepted right away. Since I was just accepted to CPP, I would have to play a ton of catch-up and I'm not sure if it will be worth it in the end.  
If I end up getting accepted to Cal Poly SLO, I would go there without thinking twice. I know they have an excellent program and I live nearby, so I would not need to take out many loans and could graduate almost debt-free.  
  
I am having a tough time comparing SJSU and CPP since I know almost nothing about CPP's environment and it's programs/reputation. Could anyone offer insight as to what CPP's CS program is like (courses, impaction, internships)?  
  
Thanks! Maybe I'll be seeing you broncos soon?
  
TL;DR: SJSU (Software Engineering) or Cal Poly Pomona (Computer Science)?"
6gvn3a,7,2017-06-12,What came first? PCOS or Type 2 Diabetes?,littlesheba16,PCOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/6gvn3a/what_came_first_pcos_or_type_2_diabetes/,"Obviously chicken and egg question here but since people here seem to have a much better handle on PCOS and/or Type 2 Diabetes than myself, I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on the question.

Depending on the answer, does it make sense to get a hysterectomy and hope it takes care of Type 2 Diabetes or do I work towards weight loss surgery? I know some people will say weight loss surgery is the easy way out but I have seen so many people lose large amounts of weight (30, 50, 100+ lbs) and then struggle to maintain. My boyfriend had weight loss surgery and is no longer on any medications. While I hate to see him eat too much and get sick, I truly believe that is the only way I can have portion control. To have the things you enjoy but a way to stop you from eating too much. 

If you were wondering about my background… (but its not necessary to answer the question)

I should start off saying I think most of my genes came from my father, or at least the ones that are dominant in me. Lighter brown, curly hair, greenish/blue eyes, so I figured carrying my weight in the middle section was from him as well considering my mother and sister have very dark eyes, very dark hair that is straight and very thick and are pear shaped. Pretty sure the only thing I got from my mother are short stubby fingers (I called them sausage-link fingers). 

Growing up, I was overweight (and come from an overweight family). I can’t remember a time when I wore a jean size smaller than a 20. I did lose some weight in college when I didn’t have a part time job but then I got an internship and had class so I gained it all back. 

My first period came in 5th grade but until college, it was normal. Not too heavy, didn’t cause any cramps, didn’t really prevent me from living my life. I had PMS cravings and attitude changes but nothing insane. Then, one day in college I bled for 3 months and I went to the OB/GYN who told me about PCOS, started me on Metformin and BC. I didn’t tolerate the Metformin so I just stopped and I stopped the BC after a year or two because I wasn’t sexually active (via intercourse). I spent the rest of college and first couple of years of my professional life with basically a non-existent cycle. My mother had a hysterectomy in her late 40s when I was in college because she would bleed so much.

I moved to a new city 18 months ago and ended up going to the doctor for an issue unrelated to PCOS/Diabetes where the blood work came back as not good. My A1C was 8.2 in March 2016. Six months later in Sept 2016, it was 6.8 which was due mostly to diet changes and exercise. I was prescribed Metformin during this time but it literally felt like water was coming out during a BM so I stopped that. I was also back on BC which they said would help me lose weight. My diet was protein shakes in the morning and I felt I was doing low carb, I wasn’t really on any specific diet. Three months later in Dec 2016, A1C was back up to 7.6 where we decided to go on Victoza (a daily injectable but it isn’t insulin) which helped curbed my cravings for junk and reduce portions. Six months later in May 2017 it was 7.3. But I can definitely say I’ve been eating carbs like crazy so I’m trying to go back to low-carb. 

I had been to the OB/GYN previously where I started the Met and BC but even as a child/young teen, I had to go to the doctor for vaccines and flu type things and the doctor never told me I was pre-diabetic. I went back on the pill in March 2016 and my period has been HELL the last 18 months. So much more pain, even on the pill pack, it comes randomly and doesn’t slow down when it is supposed to (I sometimes have to take 5-7 days of pills with hormones before it goes away, seems like such a lag and I was spotting in the mornings where I felt like maybe there wasn’t enough hormones to get me through 24 hours). There have been days where I just cannot get out of bed to go to work. 

The only health thing I have going for me is that I don’t drink, whatsoever. I’ve probably had a dozen or less drinks in the 8 years since turning 21. 

My goal would be to get off the BC that I’m on now. It messes with my hormones like crazy in a way that I don’t like. I have absolutely zero sex drive (although my commute and high-stress job could be a big part of that) I also don’t need it because my current partner had a vasectomy and I do not want children whatsoever. I know they wouldn’t consider a hysterectomy 7 years ago when I was young but I am going on 29 and I wonder how much longer I have to wait for them to say yes since I really do not want children. I don’t want children because of my childhood (divorced parents and other things) but also because I am selfish and want to spend my money on myself. Also, I’ll be paying off student loans forever so I’ll never be able to afford a child. 

I really want to see an endocrinologist. I’d love to know what my hormone levels are at and work towards a hysterectomy or weight loss surgery.

6gw56o,1,2017-06-12,Arrow season 3 re-write (plus S4 and S5) changes,FreedomvsOrder101,CW_Verse,https://www.reddit.com/r/CW_Verse/comments/6gw56o/arrow_season_3_rewrite_plus_s4_and_s5_changes/,"Alternate story... seasonal changes starting Season 3! 

Season 3

1.) Merlin trains and lives with Thea 

2.) An Assassin breaks into Merlin's home and attacks him, Merlin defends himself to a stalemate against the assailant until Thea thrusts a sword through the assassin's back, Merlin thanks Thea, congratulates her and turns on the lights whilst unmasking the assassin to reveal it to be Sara lance.

3.) Thea is distraught and hates Merlin again. Merlin realises the league will never stop hunting him and now Thea too.

4.) When Laurel finds out Sara is dead she contacts Nyssa to find out who did it. On Nyssa's request Laurel brings Sara's body to Nanda par bat with her. Nyssa and Laurel beg Nyssa's father Ra's to allow Sara into the Lazarus pit but he refuses, Ra's allows Laurel to return with Sara's body to Star city. Instead Nyssa then asks for the right to avenge her instead and her wish is granted. Laurel tries to reason with Nyssa that it was an accident that Thea was protecting Malcolm but her cries are futile. Nyssa travels to Starling city to kill Thea but is met by The Arrow and The Dark Archer Merlin (informed by Laurel) Nyssa is outmatched. Oliver requests an audience with Ra's and upon meeting him. Begs for Thea's life when Ra's refuses Oliver challenges him to fight to the death. 

5.) Malcolm trains Oliver to fight the demons head Ra's al Ghul. Oliver loses this fight and dies. 

6.) Malcolm returns to Star city to protect Thea, Thea refuses to leave and wants to stay with team arrow. Malcolm needs allies to fight the league and protect Thea and team arrow are the only ones who can help. 

7.) Diggle, Roy and Laurel refuse to help Malcolm but will protect Thea, but when the team struggles to defend star city from Danny brickwell and other threats they initially seek the aid of Wild cat but he refuses saying he is retired and always worked alone. After Diggle struggles to hit a van with explosive Arrows in the Arrow suit, Malcolm takes the bow from him and hits the van throwing the bow back at diggle who then realises only Malcolm has the skills to be the Arrow now that Oliver is dead. 

Wild cat suit (example fan art) 
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/178103360243227761/

8.) Malcolm is smug and realises the ironic fashion and humour of him wearing the Arrow's hood and the symbolic nature it represents. Citizens even cheer during his activities as the arrow, providing him perspective on what Oliver did. Black Canary refuses to continue working with Malcolm and when she insists on continuing to take on Danny brickwell Ter Grant aka Wildcat notices her bruises and reluctantly agrees to help her take him down. During a mass brawl Wildcat comes face to face with Danny and lands some solid shots but ultimately it's overwhelmed but the man's brute force beating him severely. Black Canary fights her way through the crowd reaching Danny she screams him into submission beating him in between sonic booms, Danny already somewhat beaten by Wildcat is put down hard by Black Canary, and arrested by Quentin lance of the SCPD. 

9.) Malcolm realises Thea will never be happy and accept him as a father for as long as he is indirectly responsible for Oliver's death and the team resent him for being the only one who can wear Oliver's hood and how he doesn't deserve the honour of it. 

10.) Malcolm decides to seek out Oliver's body at the base of the freezing mountain side, he kneels down and tells dead Oliver its time for the Arrow to return. Malcolm carries Oliver's body and the episode credits roll. 

11.) Malcolm the magician storms into the base of the league of assassins killing his way inside stealthy whilst carrying and dragging Oliver's body behind him, (funny and awsome!) he fights to exhaustion using all his strength and skill to avoid detection, traps and guards eventually he finally reaches the Lazarus pit. He submerges Oliver into the waters and defends Oliver's floating body from multiple league members until Ra's enters and defeats Malcolm, but before Ra's can kill Malcolm Oliver queen is reborn credits roll episode. 

Ra's apprehends both of them. Malcolm begs for his own life whilst Oliver comes to grips with his sanity. Oliver later speaks with Ra's whilst imprisoned and Ra's admits he has never fought a dual against someone as gifted as Oliver and the fact that Oliver was accepted by the pit foreshadows a destiny of ascension and succession to the title of the demons head. Ra's offers Oliver the chance to become the next great Raish al Ghul. Oliver accepts on the condition that Malcolm and Thea be released from their blood debts. 

12.) Oliver trains with the league whilst Malcolm returns to resume his activities as the arrow and inform team arrow of what transpired. Meanwhile Ray Palmer discovers Malcolm Merlin is alive and is the Arrow (using his X-ray facial capture software) and so he pledges to bring him to justice. Malcolm and the Atom fight. Malcolm defeats Atom and captures him, he drags Ray's metallic ass to team arrow and Ray swears he will bring them all to justice unless they can all prove Oliver is alive, Felicity does so asks for Ray's help in saving Oliver from the league of assassins. 

13.) Team arrow attempts to save Oliver in combination with Ray. They together fight the league but stop their attack when they discover Oliver is fighting against them alongside Ra's and his men. And so they retreat and reflect on the shock of what happened. 

14.) Little do team arrow know but Oliver is under the mental suggestion of Ra's from his exposure to the Lazarus pit and the Vituru drug. Oliver thinks he's working with the league in order to save Starling city. 

15.) Malcolm realises this and with the help of Ray, Cisco, Caitlin and Barry they synthesise an antidote to the Vituru drug and when Oliver arrives in Starling city to carry out the league's plan they ambush him to cure him, with the Flash Injecting Oliver with the cure. 

16.) In the midst of an epic battle between Ra's men and team Arrow/Flash and Ray. Oliver reclaims his sense of self. And turns on Ra's fighting him to exhaustion and an almost second defeat from Ra's but together with help from the rest of the team they all overwhelm Ra's and brutally Oliver kills him. Nyssa is stunned by Ray's less than lethal laser weaponry and detained by Quintin Lance and the authorities. 

17.) Ultimately Nyssa escapes police custody in star city and takes Sara's body from the city morgue and plundges it into the Lazarus pit. Meanwhile Malcolm appears wearing the demons head ring alongside several league members and Nyssa draws her sword as the credits roll.

Finally Oliver never leaves the island during his flashbacks all his hair growth in the pilot it's all real and all the threats he faced all occurred on the island until he departed. 

*******Post season 3, Added notes S4 and S5: *********

Btw 
*I would have had Thea become a proto version of Cheshire during her time training with Malcolm in season 3 several hints towards her becoming that charcater. She'd wear a Green Japanese dojo jiu-jitsu suit when first revealed to be training with Malcolm. 


Seasons 4 

I would have Anarky be the main villain of season 4 and instead of being written as a crazy joker like idiot that twirls sticks I would have had him be a 17 year old cyber hackivist and secret anarchist who works at Oliver's mayoral campaign office as an intern developing his obsession with Thea, and seeing a mentor figure in Felicity. 

Damien Dark successfully kills Felicty during the limousine attack riddles her corpse with bullets like sonny in the godfather and thankfully Laurel lives. Damien Dark is taken care of midway through the season killed by rage fueld Oliver, who continues his new found killing streak back into season 5. Curtis takes over Felicity's duties as tech expert. 

Later after dark is killed, Oliver regrets returning to killing and the city begins to fall into chaos allowing Anarky to thrive spreading hate online and gathering an army of loyal followers. Whilst Anarky's Anarchist youth try to burn down the whole city Oliver has to fight his way through hoards of teenagers without killing trying to offer hope to the citizens of Star city. 

Meanwhile Anarky hacks his way through Arrow caves firewalls and discovers Oliver queen is the green arrow and where their base of operations is. After tricking Oliver and Diggle out of the base on a red herring. Anarky arrives at the arrow cave and tortures Curtis cutting his eyes out. Oliver returns to find Curtis distraught and goes after Anarky with the will to kill. 

He takes on Anarky's goons brutally breaking the arms and legs of crowds of rampaging teenagers until he gets to Anarky himself and puts an arrow in his knees and arms but is stopped from killing by receiving a call from Curtis begging him not to kill him and have him face justice. Anarky is apprehended by SCPD and prosecuted by Laurel aka black Canary to life in prison. Curtis has the camera lens contact lenses developed into fully functional synthetic prosthetic eyes. Saving his vision plus a few upgrades, zoom 8k definition, internet and news feed etc also  it's the idea that saves the company from bankruptcy by helping millions around the world regain their sight. From then Curtis would be a true Mr Terriffic with eyes everywhere accessing CCTV and news all over the world, with Hyper fluorescent purple hued robotic eyes. As a result of Felicity's death Oliver inherits enough money to buy back some shares in palmer tech and pursues reclaiming his company with Thea becoming very Moira like in her pursuit of reclaiming their family company and mansion, Thea having run a successful night club since her late teens. 


Cheshire- First half of Season 4 Thea would be working for Argus as an assassin with Laila knowing about it. The money she earns she would pour into her continued pursuit of reclaiming palmer tech and rebranding it Queen consolidated. Later she would fight Roy at one point whist he tries to stop her from carrying out an assassination. Eventually she would become Artemis a much better version than the awful one we got in S4/5.

Spartan- Black T-shirt, black ballistic vest, thick black metallic gauntlets, knee pads and elbow pads. Ballistic face mask that Oliver wears in season 5 with a metal ridge on top of head 'Spartan' like with handgun on hip. And M4 assault rifle in his hands always! Plus Plenty of ammo pouches. A kite shaped ballistic shield on his back and a small club on left hip. A true Spartan! 

Wild dog- would later fight Wildcat, Carries a large wooden baseball bat. I'd have him be even more scrappy than depicted, an unpredictable mess of a charcater but somehow is of more use than not. A loose cannon, reckless and dangerous, yet very capable. 

Curtis- I would have made the T- spheres more realistic in there ability to fly, more drone like, less CGI floating cartoons. Curtis carries a Taser flick baton (for melee) and a medical bag plus science kit, essentially he's team Arrow's Doc / crime CSI / Tech exp. 

Black Canary- because she should never have died! District attorney by day Canary by night bagging and tagging criminals with Oliver queen as the true power couple of the DC CW Arrowverse. 

Roy- Captured by HIVE and experimented on, cloned. 

Season 5- 

Oliver's team would have been Curtis, Wild dog, Artemis (as Thea) and Black Canary. Dinah drakes part would have been carried out by the real black Canary into her part and be the full time girlfriend of Oliver queen with their long history and back story coming full circle in season 5's ending.

Wildcat takes vigilante's role as the primary anti-hero of S5 (alive, has 9 lives survived Danny brickwell). 

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/178103360243227761/

Roy- 
At the beginning of season 5 Prometheus would fight Roy and Roy would get his arm cut off by a swing of Prometheus sword. Cisco would build Roy would become captured by an unknown organisation and disappear not returning until near end of season 5 with his arm missing Curtis would create a superpowered prosthetic arm for him by seasons end.

I am looking for an engineering (preferably aerospace)  internship this summer in the Bay Area. I am currently 16 years old and going to senior year next school year.  I know this is kind of late but I have been searching for an internship for the past year and haven’t been able to find a suitable one. I have a strong background in both math and science and am willing to learn and work hard.

6gw9e1,3,2017-06-12,23T4F - Lilith Fairchild: High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6gw9e1/23t4f_lilith_fairchild_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

**(Note: Today, I'm looking for a partner in crime. Someone who's either as twisted as I am - switches are always appreciated - or can be turned to the dark side. If that sounds like you, welcome aboard!)**

- *The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?

- *The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The New Kid*: This is just too easy... Some poor little lost thing, torn away from her comfort zone, perhaps from some country where their grasp on English is less than fluent... Let's just say that I've always wanted a pet.

- *The Competition*: All right, to be honest, I've never been what one could consider a *sporty chick*. Tossing a ball around and pretending I'm hot shit? Fuck. That. Boxing, on the other hand... Working up a sweat and *clobbering* some pretty little thing? Sounds like my kind of evening. And you'd be surprised what kind of things happen happen in the locker room afterwards... **Bruised skin, bloody lips and perhaps a lost tooth or two. Not for the faint of heart.**

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful summertime employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *The Jock:* All right, I know one or two guys are reading this. Well, I don't top dudes, and if you want inside my ass, you've got to be *hot* shit. I'm talking chiselled-from-marble, fuck-happy *and* able to go toe-to-toe with me at my worst. Four therapists haven't been able to pull off that last one, so I doubt you can. If you're some needledick pillowhumper who's looking to feel a thick rod rearranging his colon, find a dude. On the other hand, if you think you can pin me, drill me *and* tame me, well... I'd like to see you try. 

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I'm trying something different today: I’ll be playing a bitchy, mean 18 year-old futadomme with more than a few destructive habits. Everything above was in-character, by the way. ;)*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.* **Detailed replies get priority!**

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, dubious consent, impregnation (one-night stands only), cumplay, sweat, spit, spanking, facesitting, modification (piercings, tattoos, etc.), humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, ageplay (18+ only), blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), scat and watersports.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon,*

If you prefer to speak to a representative, please follow the signs to Reception.*

*Yellow Rose Industries is a world-renowned developer of human augmentation and prosthetic technologies, as well as a philanthropic organization serving the people of [CITY] and the world.  The brainchild of young genius Aciano Mercier, Yellow Rose Industries was established by his parents, Ximena and Cédric Mercier, only ten short years ago.  Since that time, the corporation has produced countless new technologies from counter-pollution apps to neural network-integrated augmentative surgery systems.  While Yellow Rose is owned by his parents, it is Aciano Mercier who acts as CEO.*

*Over the last decade, Aciano Mercier’s name has become synonymous with revolutionary technology and humanitarian movements.  Born deaf and destitute, Mercier quickly developed an obsession with reading and math, and as a teenager earned degrees in electrical, materials and bio-engineering.  His rise to fame and fortune came after a TIDE Magazine interview following the sale of his patented BioLens material, which is now used in myriad applications from ocular augmentation to aeronautics.*

*Despite being known for his company’s technological innovations, Mercier is regularly identified by the external coil of his rudimentary cochlear implant.  When asked why he hasn’t upgraded this implant or opted for augmentation, Mercier has said that the implant serves to remind him where he came from, and that there are others he should help before himself.’*

""…well that’s an embarrassing introduction,"" Aciano said, grimacing.  He tore his gaze from the tour drone to glance back at his small entourage.  ""That’s not… a direct quote, is it, Krishna?  Tell me that’s paraphrased..?""

""I can double-check, sir,"" his assistant said, nodding as she jotted on her tablet.  Krishna Bhola was petite, pretty and highly intellectual – and it was very unlikely she needed to double-check anything.  ""Mm.  It’s from your V^3 press conference three years ago.""

""…damn.  *Can* we paraphrase it?""

""I’ll make a request to the writers.""

""Why?"" interrupted his chief of security.  Faizah Darling was a boss battle in the shape of a woman – a former soldier and Olympian, before an injury and subsequent augmentations had disqualified her.  She took special care to find and eliminate any security threats – possibly because she wished to reserve the special pleasure of Aciano’s torture for herself.

""Because it makes me sound like a total—""

""I think it’s nice.  Besides, you’re the one who wanted a damn tour.""

""Yes, but for transparency, not to… *fawn*.  I’m not opening a tour so I can tell people how great I am.""

""No.  The tour just *reveals* how great you are,"" Faizah said with a  smile she knew would irritate him.  ""Don’t think you’re gonna get around that.""

Flushed, Aciano looked to his last hope – Eric Ever, former cop, security consultant and Aciano’s personal bodyguard.  

""…whaddyou think?  It’s a lot more about *me* than it is about the company, isn’t it?""

""You are the company, Aciano.""

""Nooo..."" he whined, and briefly feigned death.  ""Krishna, can we at least add something to balance it?  An unpopular project?  What about Edifice Eden?""

""The low-income ocean-front housing development that only pissed off rich people?  Of course, boss, I'll tell them to say you're a modern-day Robin Hood.""

She took to her tablet again, smiling coyly, while the other two laughed.

*‘Please follow me,’* said the tour drone.  Aciano pulled his implant’s transmitter from behind his ear and put it in his pocket.

6gxvxd,8,2017-06-13,Need advice from veteran faptronauts,chinonextdoor,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6gxvxd/need_advice_from_veteran_faptronauts/,"Hi friends:
This is my very first reddit post and please tolerate with me.

So I grew up in a very conservative family in Korea. Both my parents are very well educated (phd) and they work as academia. They have very high expectations on me since I was little. I spent my entire childhood and early teen going to piano practices and getting extra tutoring in math, physics, writing......(you name it). My parents are very strict and basically banned all forms of entertainment from me. I was virtually never exposed to video games and TV drama. I also went to a very prestigious magnet school, with kids from similar background. I had friends in school but no social life outside. By the time I was 15, I had absolutely no idea what sex is, let alone porn and masturbation.

Then, in 2012, my parents decided to move to Illinois. I came along and enrolled at a local public high school. I was very happy at first since the school was so much easier and more relaxing than in Korea. People were nice to me and respected me for my intelligence(I dominated AP Calculus and AP physics freshman year). However, this did not last long. In a few months, I realized how weird I was and became depressed. I found out that I was no longer cool just by being a good student. I felt lonely because of the cultural and language barrier. I was unable to make friends due to my accent and lack of social skill. In the mean time, with my spared time and energy, I began to explore the sexual culture around me. I was first awakened by the attractive girls at my school. Then, I learned the notion of sex and masturbation from internet and started jerking off to bra ads on YouTube, gradually moving on to hardcore porn.

Things really started getting bad my senior year, when my parents went back to Korea and left me living by myself. I was stressed out by the college applications and classes I was taking at a local university, including OChem and upper division math. I was also worried that I may not get into an Ivy League school, given the competitiveness of college admission. I was in desperate need of support but could not get it from my parents. As a result, I turned to porn. I began to watch porn on a daily basis. I would masturbate multiple times a day to just briefly get away from my stress and depression. However, this only resulted as me being more depressed afterward. Gradually, I became dissatisfied with the pleasure being so short and started doing longer Jerkoff sessions. This ultimately became a time suck and I began to fall short on sleep and study time. I ended up getting my first B first semester senior year. Luckily, I still managed to get into a top engineering program at an Ivy League School , despite being rejected by Princeton and MIT. 

After coming to college, I became even more depressed. I no longer felt like a top student as I used to since everyone in my class was smart. Most people in my major are nerdy and self-centered. No matter how hard I try, there are always plenty of people around me who are more smart, hardworking, and earning better grades, better research opportunities, better internships. As an introvert, I didn't make any friend and my self esteem was gradually shattered. On the other hand, I was indulged in excessive fap to get away from all the shit happening in my life. I began to masturbate 2 times a day on average and my taste in porn had got more and more extreme. I started to get lazy and procrastinate on work and eventually also stopped going to the gym(I was quite built). My social anxiety also grew to the point that I was afraid of talking to anyone, even the cashier at dining hall.

In terms of romance, I had not gone on a real date, or kissed a girl even though I am actually decent looking. I became jealous every time I see people kissing or holding hands, and then I would turn to porn for some comfort.

At this point, I just wrapped up my second college year with 3 C's. I also didn't apply for any internship this summer because I was scared that more rejections would farther destroy my self esteem. I have no motivation to workout, to study, to read good books or even to get out of my bed. I FEEL LIKE A LOSER, A REAL DAMN LOSER, A DISGRACE TO MYSELF AND TO MY PARENTS. I had even considered suicide a few times but was not brave enough to carry it out.

Recently I discovered NoFap and decided to give it a try. My first attempt lasted a week but I relapsed yesterday. Seeing all the positive feedbacks from successful faptronauts was definitely encouraging. PLEASE GIVE ME SOME POSITIVE ADVICE ON:1. how to avoid feeling horny and relapse 2. how to re-establish self esteem 3. how to gain back that motivation 4. When and how should I start real romantic relationship with women in college

I am about to take the train in two days to go and work as an intern in your beautiful country.  
I have, however, a few questions:  
  

* Some tickets on bahn.de come without any price, making me unable to order them. How am I supposed to deal with that? Because I will have to take either the bus or the train to go everyday to the city I work in. I don't know about the pricing because of the aforementioned issue.  
* Since I'll be 40 kms away from Stuttgart, I'll ask here about the mandatory visits (apart from the Porsche and Mercedes museums and the stadion), considering I don't have any way to move without using public transportation.  
* Are there good websites like WG.de to find evening german lessons? Something like the american Craigslist?
* I know you guys speak good English, but what about the average 40 year old German?  
* Anything I should be aware of that you would recommend/advise against by experience?  
  

Thank you a lot for your answers!"

6gzq5t,3,2017-06-13,'' The APECA '' : Did we just met a Ghost ? Complete detailed story ( with links ) of our encounter with a ghost in an haunted place.,Magisterfunf,Ghoststories,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/6gzq5t/the_apeca_did_we_just_met_a_ghost_complete/," Hey everyone, being kinda new to reddit, I thought I'd get invested in the community and shared what was probably the only one true ghost seeing/haunted hosue experience from my late highschool years. 
So, let me say this first. I think of myself as one of those very rational, logical person who doesn't believe stuff until I saw them hand on hand. Never believed ghost stories of any kind thinking the human mind is far than enough to explain most of the things, but anyway, here comme the story that may have me starting to believe there might be stuff we yet cannot fully understand. I'll give the maximum of info and links to document and back up this expirience as much as I can ( most of it will be in French tho' since I'm a frenchman )
So here's the story. Back in in maybe 2010 ( approximatly ), I'm a highschool student, 1 year from graduation in Reunion Island, wich is an Overseas French Region ( basicaly France, but in the tropics ). There I made a bunch of good friends, 3 in particular with whom I started to play Airsoft not so long ago ( Airsoft being military simulation with fake gun that airpropells plastic bb's ). Receveid my replica as its called some six month ago at the time and already had played  multiple games - here goes a photo of the bad boy :

http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/imgs/heckler-and-koch-hk-g36.jpg 

One night, my friends and I, being on a school break, decided to go camping in that abandonned place wich we already played multiple time at, the place wich where everything went down, the infamous '' APECA '' 
Link for the '' APECA '' : 
 http://www.midiazot.fr/lapeca-ancien-foyer-de-redressement/
https://www.clicanoo.re/Societe/Article/2013/11/07/La-nouvelle-vie-de-lApeca_267857

So here's the thing. In the area I used to live in ( now live abroad for studies ), and being minors at the time ( Was 17 at the time ), there was this great, abandonned place where we could engage, 30mn away in car.
This place used to be one of the most feared and cruel instituion for problem child in my country. It was build in the 30's. APECA used to stand for Guilty and abandonned Child protection association ( Do you feel the creepyness of it already lol ? ) 

Link for videos of the place :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC2nHjyPPJg

 This place used to be feared as much as local monsters and parent didn't hesitate to used it as a fake threat, just so to imagine the thing.
They used to say that Children that went sent there had no choice but to get out '' straight '' and '' disciplined ''. A lot of ex-interns described the place as a saddistic place, often comparing it to a '' bagne '' ( French for forced labor prisons located overseas in France ). 
The place was notorious for it's many, rigids, very christians keepers, who to me looked like the kind of religious nuts you don't won't to mess with unless you want to get wiped while scraching floors. More than 80's after, the place was closed, for unknow reason to me and was to this day a bunch of gutted, abandonned, junked and trashed old era buildings. 
The place was loved by airsofters who could engage in CCB ( close quarters and urban fights ) etc.
The place really was a junkyard and I would'nt even be slightly surprised If the buildings were filled with asbestos fiber or all kind of toxic lead paint.
Other than that I'm sure it was used as a hanging spot for all kind of drug addicts ( never found a needle tho' ) or people who wanted to do some graffiti ( wich, some of them are really cool, but insainly creepy in this context ). 
The place was supposedly closed to the public and used by the fireman department for all kind of exercise or even training dogs camps. 

So, now, here's well it all gets creepy.
Since the first day I went there, people started telling me tales of how the place was haunted and how you should never be play there at night. 
According to the rumor, one of the intern childs had commited suicide and the main building years ago, leading to it closing shortly after. According to those rumor, and I've heard both versions, an orphan child could not bear the cruel treatment there and decided to slit his wrist in his room at night. One other guy told me he actually was possessed and stuff and he cutted himself in front on his keepers there. Honestly I was not believing any of those stuff since we didn't like all the older people, that didn't liked used either for being underage while playong airsoft ( wich normaly require you to be 18 ). But when they told me some veteran players didn't even want to come down here I should have smelled something bad. Those guys weren't fucking around ghost haunted place for a reason.
So, the thing is, I've done my research and couldn't find any reports on why the instituion closed. 
But back to the main story. So one night, after planning the thing for a week, all packed up and with ammo etc we decide to go camping there on the roof of that main building.
Here's how it went down. We were 4, me, my buddy Antoine ( who made the video about airsoft ), another edgy dude named Nelson and finaly a new add to our crew, Tom. 
Both me and Tom were kinda new to the sport but both Antoine and Nelson had been playing for a while and had kickass gears.

So that night, in good spirits, we go. Antoine's sister and her boyfriend drops us at the place while they were going partying nearby. Antoine's parent were in an hotel maybe 2km from our place, wich will be important later on.
So we're there maybe at 3pm and we drop our stuff and immediatly start playing for a good 2 hours. 
Now let me describe how creepy this place and let me tell you, it only gets worse at night, very much worse. I really advise you look the videos about the place ( mainly airsoft footage ) to see what I'm talking about. 
So the place is composed of a main building, designed like a long, horizontal line. Not too thick but streches for at least 500 meters and goes up on 3 levels. First level you have open spaces and some largers rooms. Second level, the place is riddle with tight fitting rooms all over, lined up one after another. The third floor was maybe some classrooms and commons bathroom for everyone and in he middle, an open roof. 
In addition to this building you had the right ( based on the entrance ) a smaller building wich clearly was classroom and stuff like that. In between a creepily small basketballcourt surrounded by big walls, which is now a junkyard with car  remains ( how it got there befundle me ). 
Surrounding the whole place, good amount of thick forest ( wich was really nice in game, multiple environnement, etc ). Everyting inbetween was just magnificent open spaces.
 
What made the place so creepy was the fact that i seemed to came out straight from a horror game. 
Just picture an insane asylum, layers and layers of rooms forming a long concrete alley. Walls tagged everywhere, dangerous junks, glass chards everywhere but mainly a lot, and I say, A LOT, of plastic BB's from the airsoft games. You could also find some blank piece of ammo, already fired. 
The whole place was beyond humid, just moss and even plants on the outsides balconies and on the roof. If you had told me this was a psychiatric asylum, I would have been believing you with no difficulties.
So here we go, having fun for 2 hours and all until we take a break after we all get tired of not seeing each other since the place is so big and you're so frightened by getting it that you just end up camping at a spot. Around 5pm, while the sun was dawning, we decide to set the camp. First we tried to set it in the auxialry building but, for some reasons we decide to go on the right corner at the end of the main building on the 2sc floor, wich, has you can guess, was a fucking mistake.
We found ourselves some wood, install the camping tents, tried helplessy to make a goddamn fire. Was great. 
Then, as intended, we decide to play a game at nightfall, One-for-All, in the almost complete night.
That's when shit started to go down.           
Try to imagine te setting, you're alone, in the almost complete dark. With only a shitty lamp that you almost can't use since it would reveal your position asap. 
I'm here, in the main building, starting to get kinda cold, praying for not getting shot.
Another thing is that you can't move carelessly there at day so you just can imagine how easy at night it is to not get scratched or hurt yourself.

One thing I'll say is that we were playing on a full moon, on purpose. We already had done a game at night elsewhere and on full moon it was almost okay, but not so much there.
So, imagine being there, where your everymove make noise ( because of the bb's mostly ), in this creepy place. It was tense as fuck. That's why we were loving it. But I gotta say the place creepyness did had up.
So we play for at least 45mn without encoutering each other. I shot a few times to please my fantaisies even tho' I knew there was no one.
Now that's when things went down. 
I'm at the second floor of the building, in a room after following the sound of what I believe was my friend. Tought I heard footstep so I went up there to check.
Then All of a sudden I hear this strange buzzing sound, like a flock of bees coming out of nowhere. I kinda freak out but stay focused. I decide to peak my head and then I see a shadow, think it's my teamate, I shoot instantly.
Let me tell you that at the time, and after carrying 45mn, it felt like lifting a block of lead since it's one of those big assault rifle ( like the design but was really unconfortable and heavy for my size ).
I'm like, it's my chance but somehow I knew I fuck up since, knowing those friends I would have got shoot in a matter of second being so slow. 

I shoot, but nothing but I still see this shadowy figure and hear this weird buzzing sounds. 
The thing is this. Despite being a full moon and the building being riddle with windows letting light go through, it's still increbly dark and I shot on intution. I can't identify exactly what was in front of me but ho boy, let me tell you it was not one of my teamates. 
Two second after shooting like a mad man I hear no reaction, no '' Ow Ow, stop, you got me. I'm hit '' So I go for another 2 or 3 burst, but still nothing and then I decide to us my flashlight. This shit fucking vanished, like their was nothing there and It was a light optical illusion. 
So, at this point, I'm 100% sur I hit someone and my first reaction is to get pissed off.
At this point I'm just to tired to play the fucking game and I decide to quit and go to the fireside. Even tho' I wasn't caring for shit, the buzzing noise was still there, I just bounced thinking it was some weird electrical thing or resonance whatever. 

30mn later my other friend also quits and are tired, we decide to end this here and maybe catch up later.
The night goes on without problem and we chat, have a good times, disscus girls and all type of stuff, eat some marshmallow and do the stupid '' chubby bunny '' stuff since it was trending at the time lol. Maybe around 2 am everything is dead quiet and we're in our tent or outside contemplating the sky and still chatting. 
Myself I was in my tent chatting with Antoine about things that went down, his girlfriend broking up with him etc.
That's when shit went sideways. 

Still chatting peacefully when a buddy outside, Nelson who was himself chatting with Tom on the edge of the balcon, started making hand signs to me like something was going down. My tent was open so he looked at me and was doing military hands signs ( we learned it since it was usefull to communicate in team matches ).
Both him and Tom looks frightened as fuck, despited him not being the easily scared type.
He tell me to listen carefully without making a noise. 
I don't understand and I reply '' What's up man, what are you doing ''. But I feel like something's not right. So Antoine and me, we stop talking a starts listening.

At first I was hearing shit but the surroundings, crickets and stuff, but soon I understood.
The motherfucking buzzing noise, it was the motherfucking buzzing noise that I heard earlier. Not only that but there were fricking footsteps with it this time. 
And let me tell you one thing. We weren't the one to be afraid of a rat roaming around or wtaer splashing on something metallic. But on the other hand, we could really easily recognise footsteps on those floors.
There was someone, or something walking in those hall covered with the fucking buzzing noise. 
You know how I can tell those were footsteps and not some random noises ? Because of the floors covered with bb's and glass that's cracks and make a specific noise when stepped on. We knew that noise cause we made the same when playing in dead silence. 
Steeping noise. Frickin steeping noises. At 2am when everybody was here. 
The creepiest thing was that it was progressing, slowly, but surely. I didn't have to tell them what it was since they knew exactly what it was like me. 

At first I tought, a crackhead, a junkie or a hobo, I don't know ? Who the fuck roams around in a abandonned building at 2am on a monday night. 
Silently, we all got up and those three took their replicas ready to fire at anything that would come.
And let me tell you one thing, those weren't real, lethal firearms but getting good burst of those at close quarters would leave a slight wound on anything thing alive if not protected. Any airsofter know how this can hurt you and why you should wear masks and heavy clothing. Some scars on my arms can attest that lol.
So here we are, scared as fuck to be attacked by some kind of creep at night. I mean, we loved to play tought guy but against an aggressive dude with a knife or something, god know what could have happened.
So know, best of my luck, I don't even have batteries on my rifle after playing all day, so I made myself a makeshift Thor Hammer ( lol ) with a stick and a block a compress wood used for wooden pallets that we broke down for the fire. I only was relaying on my friend who had top notch gears that was spitting a serious amount of plastic bullet. Anyone who would have come there would have gottent his face riddled with plastic.

So...3mn passes and the fricking noise continue to progress to a point that it's now stepping up the stairs really near from us. We're now cornered in a corner, on the second floor with almost now visibility of the inside and the stairs themselves shitting ourselves. Only way out is by jumping and it was fairly high and too dark to safely land. 
I start to disscus really quietly with Nelson and Antoine who were in position of firing even with very little visibility in the room ( our fire was almost extinct ).
We know something is not right and I advise that we take action and shoot whatever is bitching in those stairs.
Even tho' this, for two minutes the footsteps continue climbing, very slowly and we start to realise we may have fucked up coming here at night. 
Finaly Nelson, me and Antoine decide to go head on, go in the inner building, right next to the stairs, while Tom decided to stay next to the tents. 
I start warning whoever was there that we would shoot them if they don't bounce. Nelson finaly use his powerful flashlight strapped to his gun but....Nothing...we're litteraly about to shit our pants at this points.
No more footsteps. But still that buzzing sound. 
And then It shooted, it fucking shooted, right in front of us, no more than 3/2 metres down in the stairs.
Someting fucking cried, in front of us.

I think I never myself shooted in fear like this. We all went crying out loud.
Let me tell you that the next thing we did was fucking getting the hell out of this cursed place. In a matters of seconds we went back, running like hell, screaming next to the tents.
I didn't even thought about it and freaking told everyone to jump the hell out of there.
Jesus, even thinking about it again give me chills. That fucking thing cried, something we didn't even understood. Imagine like, a loud, hellish cry, coming straight from a horror story. Nelson jumped first, without even thinking, guns in hand. Antoine just behind him in the same way.
Tom was panicked the hell out and started crying. He jumped to but in a mure sluggish way and feel badly, rolling on his back, but was fine. I jumped at the same time, but god damn me, I went and hurt my right leg by landing badly.
It was crazy, we were acting purely on instinct and we fucking left all our stuff, wich let me tell you was quite fucking expensive. 
Thank god they landed ok but not myself. 
Next thing you know we just ran for our life on a straight line to the exit of the place for at least 500m.
Thank god, Tom seeing I twisted my foot helped me even tho' that, honestly, at this point I could have runned the whole thing myself.
You don't understand what's an andrenaline rush until you've been in this kind of situation.
I could tell I had twisted my foot fairly well but Boy Ho Boy, I didn't gave any fuck and run on it like my life depended on it. Also, you've never seen a chubby boy like Tom run so fast xD 
Honestly, I wish I could have told you I looked back or ever peaked into the building at my right but whatever I could have seen was probably gonna get my ass so I just ran for it only looking to the exit. 
Thank god no one ended up dead or hurt except for my right foot.
We waited outside the entrance for at least 30mn while waiting for Antoine sister who luckily was still at the club with her boyfriend. In the end we slept at his parents hotel ( was a great house in the forest, we slept in the living room ) and took all our stuff the next day in broad daylight hoping it would be okay. Everything was there, nothing move from an inch since we jumped from there.
We took back our stuff and got quickly as possible from there.
To this day, his parents still fought we were high or something dispite not being the case lol.
In the end I couldn't walk on that leg for a whole month and Antoine slightly broke part of his replicas canon in the process.

But anyway...
Never, ever, went back to this place. Nowadays it seemingly was completely destructed after years and years of being used as a junkyard. They've built a plant warehouse on top of it. I'm glad this forsaken place got demolished.
In the end...the rationnalist I was, and still kinda his, don't know what went down there.
That cry, it was like nothing I've ever heard, like a pure cry of despair, of horror. And nothing was there, no way that was some type of echo or what else I know. That cry, those footstep were reals as they possibly could. And that goddamn buzzing sound, what was that ??

So far, my only logical explation are those.
Could have this been an elaborate, very very sophisticated prank ? That would have necessitated enormous logistics, sounds, light and shadow manipulation.
Furthermore only the 4 of us knew about the plan that night.
And let me tell you that you only needed to see the fear is those 3 faces to understand they were controling nothing. And I know those guys, they would never have pushed the joke this far, especially when I would mean getting hurt like I did and letting precious gears unprotected for a whole night. We all were equally terrified and dumfounded that night. Even Nelson who was your average metal lovers, really edgy and '' dark guy '' pretending to like the occult and ghost etc just fled, running for his life in front of the goddamn thing. 
So...crazy elaborate prank done by some local kids ? I don't know. I know we never saw any kind of video about it on the internet the following month.
So...I don't know...Know I honestly remember this with a smile as it was a fricking night I'll never forget and we laugh about it but...In the end, to this day I've accepted that maybe, maybe, we've haven't fully understood the limit of what's possible.
Like, that buzzing sounds, afterward we made some research and could it be some of those electronic wave type of thing ? Honestly, I don't know. One thing you can be damn sure of is the fact that I'm never ever fucking with any type of haunted house xD.
Hope you liked my story. Have a dreadful night =D       "

6h0dhf,4,2017-06-13,Meraki AP and MacBook Pro/Air,itguy2,meraki,https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/6h0dhf/meraki_ap_and_macbook_proair/,"Recently we have had some overloading of our MR32 AP'S with an influx of interns. We were getting reports of multiple dropped connections per day.

We put in place some MR53's which as helped with this. However, we have noticed a significant difference in ping latency on MacBooks running OSX.  


Sitting right next to someone with Windows 10 or same model MacBook running linux, their average ping response to a wired server is &lt;10ms.  On a MacBook running OSX, the average latency is ~30ms.  (Also tested on pings from android phone and was under 10ms average as well).


This test is done with 200 pings to get a good sample. We did the test with one of the new AP's prior to people being on it while it was wired up on my desk. Same results with only 1 client on it. Didn't seem to be any issues with interference or signal strength. 

When doing the pings wired on a MacBook with OSX, the ping times are under 1ms. 

We've been working with support, but wanted to see if anyone else has noticed anything similar, or if you have macbooks on a Meraki AP network, could do some testing/comparison and see what the difference is."
6h0eq1,1,2017-06-13,"Just got a promotion, not what I expected, need advice on looking for new job and next steps.",pfthrowaway2627,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6h0eq1/just_got_a_promotion_not_what_i_expected_need/,"So I'm in my mid 20s and work for a small State finance authority. We are different than most state agencies in that we are off budget entirely. For all intents and purposes, we operate as a private sector business would and are entirely unaffected by changes in State budget. We are a financial authority (essentially a bond bank) and I began working here as an intern nearly 5 years ago making $20/hr ($41,600/yr) with limited benefits. After a year, I was hired full time as a Financial Analyst making ~$50,000/yr. with great benefits, including a pension plan, which I pay 7% of my salary into. Not even including the additional benefits, that was a 20% raise, with benefits, probably closer to 35-40%. 

Since this time, I have received small annual raises based on performance (really just COL adjustments given company-wide for all employees who have satisfactory reviews), and nearly 4 years later I am now making about $54,000/yr. Never had a bad review or been written up for anything. I know that four years is a long time to go without a promotion, but as I mentioned, we are a small company. Only 14 employees. There is very little room for upward mobility, so promotions do not happen often. Over this time, my responsibilities have increased significantly. In addition, our Senior Financial Analyst (only other FA) was let go about 18 months ago for performance issues. I had to pick up the majority of his work. It took the company 14 months to finally hire a new FA, and when they finally did, they choose to hire someone part time. So it is pretty obvious that I was doing a great job handling the extra work load. In addition, the company paid for me to go back to school to get my MBA in corporate finance, and I graduated in December with a 4.0. When the cost of school is added into my compensation, I was really sitting around $65,000 per year for the two years I was in school. 

I had been told for the last year or so that I was in line for a promotion to Senior Financial Analyst this year. Due to the small size of our company, there is no where else to go above Senior FA other than to replace my boss, who is the Director of Financial Services. That's not happening anytime soon. You would expect given this hierarchy, and the fact that it takes 4 years to get a promotion here, that a promotion would need to be fairly substantial or else no one would stay here. I got by far my best annual review of my career a few months ago and I was told yesterday that I did indeed get the promotion to Senior Financial Analyst effective July 1. Great news, until I was told what this raise would entail. All employees will be given a 2.5% COL adjustment effective July 1, and with my promotion, I will get an additional 2%. So 4.5% total, but realistically, my raise is only the 2%, as I would have gotten the 2.5% regardless. So after it’s all said and done, I will have worked for 4 years, received my MBA, taken on a greatly expanded role in the company, gotten stellar reviews, and will receive just a $1,000/yr raise and a title change to show for it. I will be sitting at about $56,500/year after the raise.

To make matters worse, when the previous Senior FA was still here, we were really close, and he and I spoke openly about our employment. He was making about $77,000/year, had no graduate degree, and was let go for poor performance. With this in mind and given my recent performance, my increased responsibilities, and my graduate degree, I was about 99% sure that this raise would be substantial… at least on par with the 20% I received going from intern to FA, which would put me closer to the $65,000 level of compensation that I was technically receiving while I was in school. Realistically though, I was expecting an even greater raise to a level more in line with what our previous FA had been making, about $75k. Clearly I cannot use my knowledge of his salary as leverage to negotiate a better raise, but it certainly helps make my decision here crystal clear. I need to start looking for another job. Which sucks, because I love working here. My boss is great, the hours are good, I enjoy the work…but this raise makes me feel totally cheated and undervalued. 

Now, I could go to my boss, tell him everything I just told you (less the part about knowing how much the previous Senior FA made), present industry data that shows that the average salary for an FA in our area with 5-years of experience and an advanced degree is about $81,000, and plead my case for a better raise. My boss and I are very close, get along great, but I know that this would be a bad idea. I worry that all of the sudden, they will be looking to replace me because they think I’m a flight risk. I think the obvious choice is to come to work every day, continue to excel, and start looking for other employment. Once I have an offer in hand, I can then use that as leverage to re-negotiate my salary or just choose to jump ship if I really love the offer. But I am concerned about how to navigate applying for new jobs without tipping my current boss off of my intentions. How can I use him as a reference in this situation without telling him that I am applying elsewhere? I know 100% that he would give me a stellar recommendation, but I also know that he would be very upset to hear that I am leaving after being promoted. I worry that I will burn bridges. Public finance is a bit of a niche sector, and if I want to stay in my City, which I do, then I need to maintain good relationships, as everyone here knows everyone else in the business. I am also concerned about the immediate turn around after a promotion. I’m thrilled to be able to show the advancement on my resume, but doesn’t it look shitty to only hold a new position for a month before you suddenly up and leave? Will prospective employers see this as a lack of commitment? I also have concerns over my pension, which does not vest until September of 2018. Currently my pension account has about $14,000 in contributions in it that I have paid over the years, which I could roll over into a 401k or other retirement plan at my next place of employment, but in doing so, I have essentially just turned that retirement account for the last 4 years into a 0.00% yield checking account. I lose the 4 years that I could have invested that money. Finally, my employment contract dictates that I will have to pay them back for a portion of the grad school costs if I leave employment within 18 months of graduation. As it stands now, the amount owed under their policy would be about $10k if I were to leave in the next few months. This would drop to about $6k if I left after New Years, and would be $0 by about this time next year. Does anyone have any experience negotiating having a prospective employer pay for this cost as part of taking a new job? Basically, just any advice anyone could offer on my situation would be appreciated. I know I am fortunate enough to still have employment, so it’s not like I’m hurting here, but I would be doing myself a disservice by sitting here and watching my salary stagnate.

TL:DR – Get stellar reviews, receive MBA, substantial increase in responsibility, and finally get long anticipated promotion after 4 years. It’s only a 2% raise. Only position higher than me is my boss, so I have zero upward mobility. Previous employee in my position made $77k, I am now making $56,500 in his same role. Feeling severely underpaid and underappreciated. Time to look for a new job, but have some concerns, and just need some general advice on what others would do, or if anyone else has been in a similar situation.

Thanks!!

My current assignment is to set up an approval workflow for quotes at the company. I have a couple questions that I can't seem to find the answers anywhere on Google. 

It appears the simplest way to send out an approval email is through the template ""Request manager approval for the selected file"" after clicking the ellipses on the file needing approval. Most of the options appear to be dynamic, making it appear that this is the easiest template to use to send the approval/denial workflow email.

6h0y4a,12,2017-06-13,Arrow season 3 re-written,FreedomvsOrder101,FlarrowPorn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlarrowPorn/comments/6h0y4a/arrow_season_3_rewritten/,"Alternate story... seasonal changes starting Season 3! 

Season 3

1.) Merlin trains and lives with Thea 

2.) An Assassin breaks into Merlin's home and attacks him, Merlin defends himself to a stalemate against the assailant until Thea thrusts a sword through the assassin's back, Merlin thanks Thea, congratulates her and turns on the lights whilst unmasking the assassin to reveal it to be Sara lance.

3.) Thea is distraught and hates Merlin again. Merlin realises the league will never stop hunting him and now Thea too.

4.) When Laurel finds out Sara is dead she contacts Nyssa to find out who did it. On Nyssa's request Laurel brings Sara's body to Nanda par bat with her. Nyssa and Laurel beg Nyssa's father Ra's to allow Sara into the Lazarus pit but he refuses, Ra's allows Laurel to return with Sara's body to Star city. Instead Nyssa then asks for the right to avenge her instead and her wish is granted. Laurel tries to reason with Nyssa that it was an accident that Thea was protecting Malcolm but her cries are futile. Nyssa travels to Starling city to kill Thea but is met by The Arrow and The Dark Archer Merlin (informed by Laurel) Nyssa is outmatched. Oliver requests an audience with Ra's and upon meeting him. Begs for Thea's life when Ra's refuses Oliver challenges him to fight to the death. 

5.) Malcolm trains Oliver to fight the demons head Ra's al Ghul. Oliver loses this fight and dies. 

6.) Malcolm returns to Star city to protect Thea, Thea refuses to leave and wants to stay with team arrow. Malcolm needs allies to fight the league and protect Thea and team arrow are the only ones who can help. 

7.) Diggle, Roy and Laurel refuse to help Malcolm but will protect Thea, but when the team struggles to defend star city from Danny brickwell and other threats they initially seek the aid of Wild cat but he refuses saying he is retired and always worked alone. After Diggle struggles to hit a van with explosive Arrows in the Arrow suit, Malcolm takes the bow from him and hits the van throwing the bow back at diggle who then realises only Malcolm has the skills to be the Arrow now that Oliver is dead. 

Wild cat suit (example fan art) 
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/178103360243227761/

8.) Malcolm is smug and realises the ironic fashion and humour of him wearing the Arrow's hood and the symbolic nature it represents. Citizens even cheer during his activities as the arrow, providing him perspective on what Oliver did. Black Canary refuses to continue working with Malcolm and when she insists on continuing to take on Danny brickwell Ter Grant aka Wildcat notices her bruises and reluctantly agrees to help her take him down. During a mass brawl Wildcat comes face to face with Danny and lands some solid shots but ultimately it's overwhelmed but the man's brute force beating him severely. Black Canary fights her way through the crowd reaching Danny she screams him into submission beating him in between sonic booms, Danny already somewhat beaten by Wildcat is put down hard by Black Canary, and arrested by Quentin lance of the SCPD. 

9.) Malcolm realises Thea will never be happy and accept him as a father for as long as he is indirectly responsible for Oliver's death and the team resent him for being the only one who can wear Oliver's hood and how he doesn't deserve the honour of it. 

10.) Malcolm decides to seek out Oliver's body at the base of the freezing mountain side, he kneels down and tells dead Oliver its time for the Arrow to return. Malcolm carries Oliver's body and the episode credits roll. 

11.) Malcolm the magician storms into the base of the league of assassins killing his way inside stealthy whilst carrying and dragging Oliver's body behind him, (funny and awsome!) he fights to exhaustion using all his strength and skill to avoid detection, traps and guards eventually he finally reaches the Lazarus pit. He submerges Oliver into the waters and defends Oliver's floating body from multiple league members until Ra's enters and defeats Malcolm, but before Ra's can kill Malcolm Oliver queen is reborn credits roll episode. 

Ra's apprehends both of them. Malcolm begs for his own life whilst Oliver comes to grips with his sanity. Oliver later speaks with Ra's whilst imprisoned and Ra's admits he has never fought a dual against someone as gifted as Oliver and the fact that Oliver was accepted by the pit foreshadows a destiny of ascension and succession to the title of the demons head. Ra's offers Oliver the chance to become the next great Raish al Ghul. Oliver accepts on the condition that Malcolm and Thea be released from their blood debts. 

12.) Oliver trains with the league whilst Malcolm returns to resume his activities as the arrow and inform team arrow of what transpired. Meanwhile Ray Palmer discovers Malcolm Merlin is alive and is the Arrow (using his X-ray facial capture software) and so he pledges to bring him to justice. Malcolm and the Atom fight. Malcolm defeats Atom and captures him, he drags Ray's metallic ass to team arrow and Ray swears he will bring them all to justice unless they can all prove Oliver is alive, Felicity does so asks for Ray's help in saving Oliver from the league of assassins. 

13.) Team arrow attempts to save Oliver in combination with Ray. They together fight the league but stop their attack when they discover Oliver is fighting against them alongside Ra's and his men. And so they retreat and reflect on the shock of what happened. 

14.) Little do team arrow know but Oliver is under the mental suggestion of Ra's from his exposure to the Lazarus pit and the Vituru drug. Oliver thinks he's working with the league in order to save Starling city. 

15.) Malcolm realises this and with the help of Ray, Cisco, Caitlin and Barry they synthesise an antidote to the Vituru drug and when Oliver arrives in Starling city to carry out the league's plan they ambush him to cure him, with the Flash Injecting Oliver with the cure. 

16.) In the midst of an epic battle between Ra's men and team Arrow/Flash and Ray. Oliver reclaims his sense of self. And turns on Ra's fighting him to exhaustion and an almost second defeat from Ra's but together with help from the rest of the team they all overwhelm Ra's and brutally Oliver kills him. Nyssa is stunned by Ray's less than lethal laser weaponry and detained by Quintin Lance and the authorities. 

17.) Ultimately Nyssa escapes police custody in star city and takes Sara's body from the city morgue and plundges it into the Lazarus pit. Meanwhile Malcolm appears wearing the demons head ring alongside several league members and Nyssa draws her sword as the credits roll.

Finally Oliver never leaves the island during his flashbacks all his hair growth in the pilot it's all real and all the threats he faced all occurred on the island until he departed. 

*******Post season 3, Added notes S4 and S5: *********

Btw 
*I would have had Thea become a proto version of Cheshire during her time training with Malcolm in season 3 several hints towards her becoming that charcater. She'd wear a Green Japanese dojo jiu-jitsu suit when first revealed to be training with Malcolm. 


Seasons 4 

I would have Anarky be the main villain of season 4 and instead of being written as a crazy joker like idiot that twirls sticks I would have had him be a 17 year old cyber hackivist and secret anarchist who works at Oliver's mayoral campaign office as an intern developing his obsession with Thea, and seeing a mentor figure in Felicity. 

Damien Dark successfully kills Felicty during the limousine attack riddles her corpse with bullets like sonny in the godfather and thankfully Laurel lives. Damien Dark is taken care of midway through the season killed by rage fueld Oliver, who continues his new found killing streak back into season 5. Curtis takes over Felicity's duties as tech expert. 

Later after dark is killed, Oliver regrets returning to killing and the city begins to fall into chaos allowing Anarky to thrive spreading hate online and gathering an army of loyal followers. Whilst Anarky's Anarchist youth try to burn down the whole city Oliver has to fight his way through hoards of teenagers without killing trying to offer hope to the citizens of Star city. 

Meanwhile Anarky hacks his way through Arrow caves firewalls and discovers Oliver queen is the green arrow and where their base of operations is. After tricking Oliver and Diggle out of the base on a red herring. Anarky arrives at the arrow cave and tortures Curtis cutting his eyes out. Oliver returns to find Curtis distraught and goes after Anarky with the will to kill. 

He takes on Anarky's goons brutally breaking the arms and legs of crowds of rampaging teenagers until he gets to Anarky himself and puts an arrow in his knees and arms but is stopped from killing by receiving a call from Curtis begging him not to kill him and have him face justice. Anarky is apprehended by SCPD and prosecuted by Laurel aka black Canary to life in prison. Curtis has the camera lens contact lenses developed into fully functional synthetic prosthetic eyes. Saving his vision plus a few upgrades, zoom 8k definition, internet and news feed etc also  it's the idea that saves the company from bankruptcy by helping millions around the world regain their sight. From then Curtis would be a true Mr Terriffic with eyes everywhere accessing CCTV and news all over the world, with Hyper fluorescent purple hued robotic eyes. As a result of Felicity's death Oliver inherits enough money to buy back some shares in palmer tech and pursues reclaiming his company with Thea becoming very Moira like in her pursuit of reclaiming their family company and mansion, Thea having run a successful night club since her late teens. 


Cheshire- First half of Season 4 Thea would be working for Argus as an assassin with Laila knowing about it. The money she earns she would pour into her continued pursuit of reclaiming palmer tech and rebranding it Queen consolidated. Later she would fight Roy at one point whist he tries to stop her from carrying out an assassination. Eventually she would become Artemis a much better version than the awful one we got in S4/5.

Spartan- Black T-shirt, black ballistic vest, thick black metallic gauntlets, knee pads and elbow pads. Ballistic face mask that Oliver wears in season 5 with a metal ridge on top of head 'Spartan' like with handgun on hip. And M4 assault rifle in his hands always! Plus Plenty of ammo pouches. A kite shaped ballistic shield on his back and a small club on left hip. A true Spartan! 

Wild dog- would later fight Wildcat, Carries a large wooden baseball bat. I'd have him be even more scrappy than depicted, an unpredictable mess of a charcater but somehow is of more use than not. A loose cannon, reckless and dangerous, yet very capable. 

Curtis- I would have made the T- spheres more realistic in there ability to fly, more drone like, less CGI floating cartoons. Curtis carries a Taser flick baton (for melee) and a medical bag plus science kit, essentially he's team Arrow's Doc / crime CSI / Tech exp. 

Black Canary- because she should never have died! District attorney by day Canary by night bagging and tagging criminals with Oliver queen as the true power couple of the DC CW Arrowverse. 

Roy- Captured by HIVE and experimented on, cloned. 

Season 5- 

Oliver's team would have been Curtis, Wild dog, Artemis (as Thea) and Black Canary. Dinah drakes part would have been carried out by the real black Canary into her part and be the full time girlfriend of Oliver queen with their long history and back story coming full circle in season 5's ending.

Wildcat takes vigilante's role as the primary anti-hero of S5 (alive, has 9 lives survived Danny brickwell). 

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/178103360243227761/

Roy- 
At the beginning of season 5 Prometheus would fight Roy and Roy would get his arm cut off by a swing of Prometheus sword. Cisco would build Roy would become captured by an unknown organisation and disappear not returning until near end of season 5 with his arm missing Curtis would create a superpowered prosthetic arm for him by seasons end. 

Happy to receive any feedback 

Thanks everyone 👍"

6h1gax,1,2017-06-13,Help finding potential LP's from family offices/HNWI in Greater Boston/Northeast.,Brilligg,VenturedCapital,https://www.reddit.com/r/VenturedCapital/comments/6h1gax/help_finding_potential_lps_from_family/,"I'm starting an internship with a boutique VC firm next week with limited prior experience.   I have limited prior experience but I'm determined to show my value.  Their first project is to have me source family office info and HNWI info in the Boston/Northeast with assets in the range of $50-$100m who we can pitch as LP's to close out our fundraising.  The founders have already flogged their business, personal, and MBA networks so they're trying to look outside the box.

My research here and elsewhere on the web suggests that--

1.) Family offices try very hard not to make their info available/searchable.
2.) There are services that claim to provide this info (CapIQ, RelSci, FINTRX) but reviews suggest differing levels of efficacy for family office info in particular and all of them cost money.  As an intern, the last thing I want to do is say ""let me buy something"" because I can't figure this out.
3.) A lot of time interns are staffed with updating or cultivating this list as their first project and usually the list they inherit is pretty out of date and subsequently jealously guarded.

So my questions are--

1.) Has anybody experienced a similar exercise and found a specific tactic/process that proved useful for cultivating this kind of list?  My thouhgt is to start with private companies that have decent data/online presence in the Boston/NorthEast area and start by researching their management and/or boards.  Then follow the same process for more prestigious private schools (colleges, boarding school, and regional).  Then try to research this list of power players and see what matches up.  Any thoughts on if this will work and/or ways to make it less manual?
2.) Has anyone had experience prospecting family offices/HNI as potential LPs with the above data SAAS tools? Are they worth the money?  Is one better than the others?  If I go this route, I'd like to propose one service with some clear justification on why it will work, but aside from the 30 minute BS demo, I'm not getting a chance to test them out.
3.) Are there any other ways to access this kind of list/information that I'm not aware of?

Any and all advice/suggestions is much appreciated."

At the moment I've created the table and made a connection so it can be displayed in a simple html form on web browser. At the moment I'm trying to send data back to the database. I'm tring to send one column of data back to the database.
In short the project has to have the following requirements:
- Have a backend database as MySQL
- Be able to change the list easily instead of trying to find a folder to change
- Be able to submit data from the Frontend (JavaScript) and send it back to the Database
- PHP will be used to connect the Frontend and Backend

Any help would much appreciated as I'm genuinely stuck and I feel I've been asking for way too much help in work. I've only really ""touched"" on databases in one module in college so I haven't had much experience with them.

6h1usu,17,2017-06-13,RUSSIA! RUSSIA! RUSSIA! A reflection on the current community discussion.,docdurango,Kossacks_for_Sanders,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kossacks_for_Sanders/comments/6h1usu/russia_russia_russia_a_reflection_on_the_current/,"Okay, I admit it: yesterday I read the post on Russia! Russia! Russia! and found myself getting angry at some of the comments. I started trolling.

I thought I'd share some more thoughts today. First, if Russia actually did compromise voter registration rolls, or even (as is likelier) only gained access to them, but did not alter them, we should not be diving into a new Cold War. We should be demanding that Congress, the states, the DNC, etc. build a safe voting system that we can all trust. So far, I see ZERO evidence that our Democratic leaders are pushing in that direction. They'd rather pile on the Russia Express.

Second, the talking heads and silk-stocking reporters who are making hay with Russia! Russia! Russia! are NOT the talking heads and reporters of Ed Murrow's day. If Rachel Maddow gets $30,000 a day, we can be sure that all the others on MSNBC are not far behind. What does a top political reporter at the NYT get? At the WaPo? I don't know, but I'm sure it puts them in the top 10%, and probably the top 2%. They are members of the investor class, not the middle class.

Am I saying that all people in the stock market are evil, as a commenter said yesterday? HELL NO! I'm saying that they have a class interest and a class consciousness. No, I'm not a Marxist in the narrow sense, but here's how all this works: Let's suppose I'm a standout at an Ivy school, or University of Chicago, or Berkeley, whatever (and additionally, that I probably come from a prosperous family positioned in the top 10% bracket). As an undergrad, I absorb the lessons of those around me: I learn what sort of political thinking is out-of-bounds. I learn what sort of economics is out-of-bounds, too. My economics professor teaches his course from a neoliberal viewpoint ... he/she is sympathetic to the poor and POC, but believes ardently in free enterprise and globalization. 

Now maybe I enter an elite journalism grad program (or law program, or foreign relations, etc.). All the thinking I've absorbed as an undergrad gets further affirmation. The important people I meet are rational centrists, with a few sparks off to the left or right, but only enough to further illuminate the center ... the path forward.

I soon find myself at the WaPo, maybe first as an intern. I'm a liberal, for sure. But I know the bounds of proper thought. I know exactly what sort of reporting my bosses will approve, and what sort they're shake their heads at. I want their approval, not their disdain. I want to advance my career.

Next, I get an actual reporting job at WaPo or NYT (after having served a few years at a lesser paper). I am soon friends with a variety of political types, people in the diplomatic corps, people in law and business. These people constitute my peer group. They invite me to really nice parties!  They even invite me to the Hamptons on occasion. Other friends--from my undergrad or grad school days--live in Gramercy Park, or Beverly Hills, or Grosse Pointe, or similar wealthy suburbs.

I marry another budding star reporter or politico. We move into a nice suburb of Washington, D.C., again reaffirming our worldview and class status. We have children. We send them to the best private schools we can afford. Soon, we call on our friends to help them get internships in elite businesses or political consulting agencies.

All the while, I'm a liberal, but my identity is set in stone. I have no interest in the Sanders movement. It seems trite, antiquated, loud, uninformed (because anyone that knows anything realizes that liberalism can't do any more than it's already doing, for Christ sakes! Don't you fools understand that the Republicans will stop us at every turn! That's why we don't actually fight for anything positive; we just keep playing a lame defensive game).

No, wait. It's not just that I have zero interest in the Sanders movement; I actively loathe it. Those Sanders people are criticizing me! Me! And I'm a smart, accomplished, liberal! Those ignorant, shouting people are attacking their betters! Yet it's me and my friends who actually understand how government works. We, the Ignatiuses, the Krugmans, the Kleins, the Weigels. Well, by God, now I'm going to go out and write anti-Sanders pieces ... my bosses will like them. My friends will like them.

None of this is a conspiracy. And yet it results in Russia! Russia! Russia! Here, at last, is a topic that marginalizes the Sanders movement and gives strength--and self-righteous certitude--to the liberal center at a time when it is challenged.
On top of that, Russia sells! The WaPo LOVES ME because I'm pulling readers who are furious with Trump. They love me because I’m calling those nasty Sanders people conspiracy mongers.  My upper-middle class readers, after all, are just as upset with Sanders and his supporters as I am … he cost us the election!  

Plus, there really is reason for hysteria. From my elite perch at the WaPo, I direct that hysteria into the Russia channel and away from a dozen other directions it can take ... e.g., anger at our profoundly UN-secure voting system, or anger at the DNC, or anger at lobbyists, or anger at the Saudis and/or Ukrainian nationalists, who are just as guilty as the Russians in their attempts to cajole and bribe and manipulate. (Oh, yeah, some leaker contacts me with a story about how many Ukrainian nationalists, not to mention Russians, and even Saudis, quietly sought to shape Hillary Clinton's foreign policy, though none of them registered as foreign agents ... but no, I'm not going to pursue THAT story.  I'm too busy with Russiagate!

None of what I write here is meant to say that Trump is for certain innocent of collusion with Russia (though it's worth reiterating that he is not being investigated for that). If he did collude, he MUST be impeached, obviously, and all of us at KFS will approve. But we'll want to see evidence. And most of all, we're going to want a safe voting system.

My guess is that the latter simply won't happen, because centrists don't really believe that there's any grave danger. In their hearts, they know that HRC was a bad candidate who failed to campaign in the Upper Midwest, never formulated a clear reason for her candidacy, had no larger vision other than ""I'm a wonk, and I'm not Trump,"" and who really was guilty as hell in the email thing (question to her defenders: why were you so hellbent to nominate someone who was so clueless about cybersecurity that she ran all her State Department email through a private server in her basement--entirely SANS security--despite being told by the State Department ABSOLUTELY not to do that? If foreign states can break into DNC emails, clearly they had carte blanche to take whatever they wanted from HRC's private email server. And you all are now furious about Russian hacking? The fact that HRC didn't know enough or care enough to protect State Department data is emblematic of a HUGE problem: our electronic data infrastructure can be hacked, including our elections. So figure it out! We need a safe voting system!)

Okay, well, what about the CIA/FBI/NSA? Here's an admission: I (speaking now as myself, and not as a fictive WaPo reporter) do not think anyone conspired to lead us into war in Iraq. I think what happened was subtler and perhaps more dangerous, or just as dangerous. Intelligence analysts wanted to please their bosses. Their bosses, in turn, wanted to please Bush/Cheney. So they gave them biased data ... or even falsified data, but data that they thought no one would challenge (yellowcake, etc.). This wasn't solely because intelligence people tend to be right-wingers ... it's because of the culture in our intelligence agencies. The careerism. The wanting-to-please the powers-that-be. Life in the bubble.

Has the culture at the NSA and CIA changed since then? I doubt it. We're told now that Russia-done-it based on a CrowdStrike report along with some gobbledygook about how evil RT was for giving the left a voice (you know, letting those crazy, out-of-bounds, ignorant people actually speak on television). The relentlessly centrist Obama administration heard what it wanted to hear, and asked 14 additional agencies to confirm the veracity of a report put together by CrowdStrike and a few hand-picked analysts at the CIA/FBI/NSA. That 17 agencies endorsed the report was a half-truth at best ... 14 of them had no capacity to properly evaluate the data. But our fictive WaPo reporter doesn't give a shit ... he continues to report that 17 agencies endorsed the report, since that's how he gets approval and readership.

So, do we know that the CIA/NSA/FBI didn't have other intelligence reports that contradicted the Russia-done-it story? No, we do not know. We aren't privy to whatever contradictory information might have been swirling on the inside.

Do we even know whether the single NSA report leaked by Reality Winner represented all the intelligence that the NSA collected re whether or not Russia hacked into voter registration databases? Absolutely not, as one of The Intercept's interviewees pointed out.

Pardon me for being a skeptic, but I want to see THE EVIDENCE. And if you keep telling me, ""we can't share it because it'll reveal our secrets,"" then I'm going to remain skeptical.

If you want to attack Sanders supporters for being ""dupes,"" or for bolstering Putin, or for pushing conspiracy theories, then I suggest you go back to TOP.

If you simply want to say that ""hey, maybe Trump really is guilty,"" then great.  I can accept that possibility.  I've seen no evidence, but who knows for sure?  But if you simply want to come here to insist that YOU KNOW that Trump did it, and that Russia is some huge huge threat to us, then go somewhere else.

However, since it’s a small company, my boss keeps calling me up to hand out assignments to me. I try to do what I can, but he keeps trying to guilt trip me by saying that it’s a small company, I should be thankful to them for offering me the opportunity being a fresh graduate and all, and wants me to put in 5-6 hours daily.

He called me up this morning and says “boomshiva420, we’re having serious doubts whether you’re built for this company or not. You better start putting in work.”

Fuck man. This leaves me so fucking frustrated. I mean, I get it, small firm, trying to make it big, need all hands on board. As an intern, I’ve been putting 9-12 hours of work, DAILY, just for fucking peanuts. And it wasn’t even intern work, it was proper employee work. It gave me experience, so I don’t complain.
The job they’ve offered is also well below payment standards. I will make about 30,000 INR a month, which is $466.66/month. I am a computer science graduate, just so you know. Not using my degree, since I’m doing digital marketing. But I’m handling it for the entire firm!

6h2vt3,228,2017-06-13,"Former Capcom intern here, I can explain why Infinite's characters look the way they do",mvci_roger,MvC3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MvC3/comments/6h2vt3/former_capcom_intern_here_i_can_explain_why/,"I was with Capcom San Fran’s graphic design and social media team since October 2016 and was let go on happy terms about 3 weeks ago, I have no ill will against the company and wish everyone there nothing but the best.  The main game I was attached to was Marvel vs Capcom Infinite for most of my time there.  I wasn’t given an NDA to sign or anything like that cause I was an intern and really not given anything important that can’t get out.  Ala I can’t tell you anything about which characters will be in the game until maybe about 4 days to a week before they’re officially unveiled.  But what I can do is shed some light on the development of the game and tell you why some of you guys are saying the game is ugly, I just want to clear misconceptions about the game and give some clarity.  I’m only wishing for the best for Marvel vs Capcom Infinite 
  
First off I need to clear up some comments about our situation, a lot of rumors going around that they were horrendously understaffed and had pretty bad working conditions.  We were pretty understaffed in our department is all I can comment on, I would not say we were a skeleton crew but we really could have used maybe 10 or so more guys around.  It caused a lot of communication and organization issues but not enough that I’d call it hellish, definitely annoying though.  Morale was low with some people cause they took some comments on the art design a little personally when it really wasn’t their fault.  I mean how would you feel if you were told to make a painting, then told by the same person to make it look stupid and you have 30 minutes to make it, then once you’re done everyone says it looks bad and you should feel bad when you had no control over your own art. 
  
So why does this game look so bad? Or more specifically why some characters look bad?  Its a combination of multiple things but there are two main points:  **We were told to make the Capcom side look unappealing** and the release schedule had us really strapped for time.   Yeah thats right, someone at Disney specifically told the art department and the advertising department to make the Capcom side look “ugly” so the Marvel side would look better.  Even in terms of story they wanted the Capcom characters to be very irrelevant so the Marvel team gets most of the spotlight.  I can tell you this right now that you will see a lot of Capcom characters losing in battle or just taking a back seat so a Marvel character can do their job for them.  I can somewhat confirm one thing with you guys right now is that Ryu does not do anything in the story mode.  A few designs from the Capcom side of the characters were outsourced but even then every mock up was sent back and told to make them look either “less pretty and more realistic.” or “more like a cartoon character.”  All I really did was stuff for advertisement but some stuff I did was edited by someone else so the Capcom characters were less prominent.
  
Some of you probably already noticed it, just compare Chun Li to Captain Marvel or Dante to Iron Man or Dr. Strange.  The game is acting like a form of advertisement for Disney’s MCU, so those characters are being made to look more appealing than the rest.  There is one exception, **it was specifically stated to give Mega Man characters spotlight and special treatment.**  This confused me for a while but a co-worker pointed out later that Disney is producing a Mega Man game and TV show coming out this year so it all made sense to me. 
  
**So the short of it is that a lot of characters look bad because Disney had specific orders to make Marvel and Mega Man characters look way more appealing and get way more screen time than Capcom characters.** I do want to add though a lot of this for me is hearsay, some stuff is not what I’ve been told but what I’ve heard others talking about.  It may not be 100% accurate but I wanted to give a general idea, I’ve avoided talking about anything too specific because it might be wrong.  
  
Thanks for listening for a minute, I just really wanted to clear up some of the negativity surrounding this game, or more accurately give you guys some clarity on why things are how they are.  Please don’t be too harsh on the art team, they doing what they can with what they’re working with, they’re just victims in the crossfire here.  But by all means be unhappy with how some of the characters look, I agree that Dante, Ryu, and Chun Li look pretty bad, but direct your distaste at the right people. 
  
I'll be happy to answer any questions that I can, but do not ask me about gameplay, design decisions, or which characters will be in the game.  I will tell you right now I was given nothing about any of those aspects and I'm pretty bad at fighting games so I can't tell you anything deep about the game. "
6h2wu7,4,2017-06-13,"""stand-alone"" programs for those interested in pursuing clinical careers-- curious",PretzelCatz,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/6h2wu7/standalone_programs_for_those_interested_in/,"I'm currently about to start an MFT program (and I'm super excited) but it took me quite a while to end up at this point. I graduated with my B.A. in psychology 7 years ago, and subsequently went to a research-focused master's program. My goal back then was to eventually obtain my PhD in Clinical Psychology and become a professor and researcher. My goals have certainly changed! 

Anyway, in those years when I still had the research-focused goal, I spent a lot of time lurking on a certain online forum for future Clinical Psych PhDs/PsyDs (Student Doctor Network, anyone?). The tone of that forum was quite different than this forum. Put bluntly, many of those people were very competitive, high strung, and even arrogant. I never actually posted there, just lurked, because I was terrified of being ripped apart like I saw them do to so many curious students over the years.

One of the things that became apparent right away was the very strong negative feelings nearly all of the top posters had towards programs that were stand-alone programs not attached to universities (e.g. Alliant, Chicago School of Professional Psychology), for-profit schools (Walden, U of Phoenix), and definitely all online programs. Knowing everything I know about the field now, I can certainly understand why they are so against most online programs and for-profit schools, especially for people obtaining doctorate degrees (SO ridiculously expensive, poor internship match rates, etc.). I also understand that for research-focused careers, the ""best"" programs are going to be those affiliated with major universities. What I now find hard to fully understand, however, is why they hold such negative views about certain stand-alone schools for people with a more clinical-focus-- programs that I've since heard only good things about first-hand. I'll use Alliant as my example because I happen to know several successful Alliant graduates of either the Los Angeles or San Diego campus. 

I've been working for a large nonprofit mental health agency since 2014, and my first boss had a PsyD in Clinical Psychology from Alliant. Back then, I was still completely brainwashed by the SDN forum and was honestly scared of what I had gotten myself into. The forum made it seem like anyone who would be ""dumb enough"" to go to one of those schools would be a complete failure in all aspects of life. I was surprised that someone from such a ""joke school"" (according to that forum) had obtained such a high-level management position at a respected agency. And for the record, she was awesome, and I had nothing but the utmost respect for her education and training. Over the next couple years I met several more Alliant grads who also greatly surpassed my expectations. One of these people (who is just an MFT, not a PsyD) is currently the head of a large mental health agency's Clinical Training department and the other is a hugely successful private practice clinician who has written several books.

When I made the decision to pursue an MFT degree I did seriously consider Alliant. It was the closest program to my current job and I knew several very satisfied/successful graduates. Ultimately I chose a different program attached to a university mainly for the lower cost, which is undeniably a big factor. Cost aside though, I probably would have gone to Alliant and would have fully expected to receive a quality education.

I no longer regularly lurk on the SDN forum but I do go back every couple months out of pure curiosity. Sure enough, they're still trash talking Alliant and similar schools at any chance they can get. 

Interesting to note is that none of the Alliant grads I know seem to have any idea that Alliant has such a poor reputation by some (I guess none of them have been to SDN) and it makes me wonder if the SDN forum is just a unique breed of highly competitive people who don't accurately represent the larger population of PhD/PsyDs? 

I totally understand that an education at Alliant may not look the best on that application to a tenure-track position at a top research university, but for people who plan on being full-time clinicians, especially in private practice, does is really matter where you went to school? 

omg, so long-- sorry!

**TLDR:** A certain online forum dedicated to Clinical Psych PhD/PsyDs holds VERY negative opinions towards ""stand-alone"" programs. I happen to know many satisfied and successful grads of these programs. What gives?

I [20M] have been using tinder for a little while and had marginal success (a couple of dates but nothing much beyond that) but matched with a girl [19F] about a week ago now. We've exchanged a lot of messages and have been having regular conversations every couple of days, wished each other look with exams at university, congratulated each other on finishing exams and have sorted out a coffee date for next Tuesday. 

So far so good, the only issue is we both have commitments, I myself have an internship in Switzerland for 10 weeks starting in a couple of weeks and she's travelling to South East Asia for 3 months the day after our date. From our conversations and things I really like her, we seem to have a lot in common and she's really cute and funny and seems to like me; most of the planning and conversation starting has come from her, and naturally I don't want to get ahead of myself but if our date goes well I'll definitely want to see her again.

My issue is the distance problem, if the date goes well being separated for 3 months is going to be an issue. My question is mainly what would people advise here, trying to keep a connection going for the gap or sort of meet up and then leave it until we're in the same place come the start of October? I honestly don't know, I have a good feeling about this and we both seem to want to see each other and talk to one another but leaving as soon as we meet seems like it could be a major hurdle to anything.

Thank you for advice and apologies if this is a stupid question, I'm relatively new to dating and don't want to mess things up with this person."

Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his salvage crew are preparing to clean up after the Battle of New York when the newly-created Department of Damage Control intervenes and takes over, leaving Toomes bankrupt. Upon learning the DDC was created by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Toomes blames him for his misfortune and convinces his men not to surrender the Chitauri technology that they have already scavenged, claiming to have other plans for it.

Years later, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) travels to Germany to help Stark fight Captain America and is given a high-tech new suit. Upon returning to New York, Peter is eager to join the Avengers and make a difference, but Stark claims he's not ready yet. He allows Peter to keep the suit and agrees to keep in touch in case he needs Peter's help again. Peter then begins reporting on his activities to Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) hoping to impress Stark.

Four months later, Peter hasn't heard from Stark since. He attends Midtown Science and Technology School alongside his friends Ned (Jacob Batalon) and Michelle (Zendaya), his rival Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) and his longtime crush Liz Allan (Laura Harrier). Michelle has an obvious crush on Peter. They're all members of the school's academic declathon team, but Peter has recently quit to focus on his ""internship"" at Stark Industries, a cover for his crimefighting activities.

After months of dealing with petty crimes, Peter stumbles upon a group of criminals armed with Chitauri technology robbing an ATM and confronts them. The criminals lose control of the weapon and cause widespread destruction before escaping. Peter's clothes are lost in the process and he has to sneak back home to avoid Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), which he does, unaware that Ned is in his room. Ned thus learns Peter's identity and agrees to protect his secret.

The following day, at gym class, Peter and Ned overhear Liz and her friend Betty (Angourie Rice) talking about Spider-Man. When Liz mentions he's attractive, Ned impulsively claims that Peter knows Spider-Man from Stark Industries. Flash challenges Peter to prove it by bringing Spider-Man to a party at Liz's house later that night. 

At the party, while changing into Spider-Man, Peter sees an explosion in the distance and is forced to investigate. He finds two of Toomes' men, Shultz (Bookem Woodbine) and Brice (Logan Marshall-Green), selling Chitauri weapons to local criminal Alex (Donald Glover) and intervenes. Brice subdues Peter with his Shocker gauntlets and flees in a van with Shultz, leaving the weapon behind. Spider-Man pursues them, but is intercepted by the Vulture, who takes him high above swing-level, triggering the suit's defense system. It deploys a parachute to help Peter escape, but Peter falls into a lake and nearly drowns before being rescued by a remote-controlled Iron Man suit, due to a tracker that Stark put on the suit.

Peter and Stark get into an argument. Peter wants to stop the Vulture, but Stark wants him to focus on his studies and leave the Vulture to the authorities, and claims Peter will be eligible to join the Avengers when he finishes college. Peter refuses to not do anything and retrieves the weapon that Brice left behind. Peter and Ned then crack it open during shop class the next day and retrieve a Chitauri power core modified with Earth technology, including a tracker. 

Shultz and Brice show up in Midtown searching for the weapon, but Peter and Ned evade them and Peter fires a spider-tracker at Shultz. Peter finds out Shultz is in Virginia, and rejoins the declathon team so he can join their trip to Washington, D.C. for nationals and get closer to Shultz's hideout.

In Washington, Peter and Ned disable the suit's tracker and the ""Training Wheels"" Protocol, unlocking a series of new features and weapons including an A.I. that communicates with Peter through his mask, whom Peter names ""Karen"". Liz invites Peter for a late night swim with the team, but Peter is forced to refuse to follow his lead to Shultz's whereabouts. Liz is clearly interested in Peter, too.

Peter locates Shultz and another one Toomes' men, Mason (Michael Chernus), at an abandoned gas station, laying a trap for an approaching DDC truck transporting Chitauri weapons. The Vulture intercepts the truck and uses a phasing device to infiltrate it in order to steal the cargo. Spider-Man intervenes but the suit's gadgets get in his way and he ends up being overpowered and trapped in the truck, while the Vulture is forced to escape without the weapons.

Peter learns from Karen that Chitauri power cores are unstable and realizes that the one he found is still in Ned's backpack. Peter calls Liz, but she's disappointed that he missed nationals and is afraid that Peter's recent erractic behavior is due to drugs. Liz also reveals that the team is visiting the Washington Monument. 

Peter manages to use a Chitauri power core to blow a hole through the truck and escape from the DCC headquarters. He then races to save his friends, but is too late and the power core explodes, leaving Liz, Ned, Flash and several others trapped in a damaged elevator high atop the Washington Monument. Michelle wasn't with them and urges Spider-Man to save her friends. 

Peter manages to climb to the top while evading the police, conquering his fear of great heights, and holds on to the elevator in time for the occupants to get out. The web snaps just as Liz is leaving but Spider-Man manages to rescue her and they share a moment before Spider-Man swings away triumphantly.

That's the cutoff."

Hi there,

I am selling my two tickets to the SF show on Thursday, June 15th. I got some great seats because I purchased right after the show was announced, but I got the opportunity to take an internship in Hong Kong and can no longer attend. Reading this subreddit is making me super jealous, I wish I could go see the boys!

[The seats are Orchestra B11 and B12, which is the second row just to the right of center.](http://i.imgur.com/DKs9FMy.png) I'll sell them at cost to any redditor (I paid about $73 with fees). 

ACT sent me the tickets in PDF form directly to my email when I purchased them, so I will attach those and send them to you when I have payment. Because I am overseas right now, I'll need to take PayPal for them (I don't mind you using the purchase protection, but we'll have to calculate the fees). 

Hopefully one of you buys them so those great seats don't go unfilled! You'll have to tell me about the show haha. "
6h5eww,169,2017-06-14,"The Disappearance of Sneha Anne Philip - beautiful physician goes missing; drugs &amp; alcohol, lesbian liaisons, killed during 9/11 or Switched Identity?",kummybears,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/6h5eww/the_disappearance_of_sneha_anne_philip_beautiful/,"This one is especially bizarre. Movie quality. I recommend you read the full Wikipedia entry. I will quote some important excerpts. I would love to hear from anyone who has looked into this. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Sneha_Anne_Philip

&gt;Sneha Anne Philip (October 7, 1969 – ruled to have died September 11, 2001) was an Indian American physician who was last seen on September 10, 2001, by a department store surveillance camera near her Lower Manhattan apartment. She may have returned to the building at some point that night or the next morning. Due to the proximity of the World Trade Center and her medical training (Philip was a physician employed by Cabrini Medical Center in NYC), her family believes she perished trying to help victims of the following day's terrorist attacks.

&gt;Two investigations were conducted. The first by Ron Lieberman, her husband, and private investigator Ken Gallant, a former FBI agent, initially presumed her disappearance and possible death were unrelated to the attacks but later concluded it was the most likely outcome. A later investigation by New York City police delved into her life leading up to September 11 and found details of a double life, a history of marital problems, possible affairs with other women, job difficulties and alcohol and drug abuse by Philip, as well as a pending criminal charge against her, in the months before her disappearance. This led them to conclude it was just as likely that she had met a different fate.

&gt;Philip was last seen on September 10, 2001. On the day she disappeared, Philip was off from work. According to Lieberman, she was planning to spend the day cleaning up the apartment in anticipation of a dinner visit by her cousin two nights later. She had a two-hour online chat with her mother, during which she mentioned that she was planning to check out the Windows on the World restaurant on top of the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center, where a friend was to be married the next spring. At 4 p.m. she signed off and went to drop off some clothes at a neighborhood dry cleaners, then went to a Century 21 where she used the couple's American Express card to buy lingerie, a dress, pantyhose and bed linens. Afterwards she bought three pairs of shoes at an annex to the store.

&gt;A security camera at Century 21 recorded her during this shopping trip. The taped image and the credit-card records are the last confirmed records of Philip's presence anywhere.

-
**The Private Investigation**
&gt;Gallant (Private Investigator) at first considered the possibility that Philip had used the attack to flee her mounting personal problems and start a new life under a new identity. But her computer's hard drive revealed no evidence of any such plans or contacts, and she had also left her glasses, passport, driver's license and credit cards, except the American Express card, behind. Lieberman kept the account open in case any leads developed from attempts to use it, but none ever did. Gallant and Lieberman eventually concluded that Philip witnessed the attack and, as a physician, rushed to the site to render aid and subsequently perished there, either within the towers or in the ensuing collapse.


-
**The Police Investigation** 
&gt;Earlier in the year, Cabrini had declined to renew Philip's contract, citing repeated tardiness and alcohol-related issues, effectively firing her. Shortly after she had been informed of that decision, she went out to a bar with other Cabrini employees. The outing led to her spending the night in jail. She complained to police that a fellow intern touched her inappropriately during that time. The prosecutor who investigated the case dropped the sexual abuse charge and instead charged Philip with third-degree falsely reporting an incident, a misdemeanor under New York law. He offered to drop the charge if she recanted the original complaint, but she refused and was held overnight pending release.[2]

&gt;After her dismissal from Cabrini, she began spending nights out at gay and lesbian bars in the city, some known for their rough clientele. According to police, she would sometimes leave with women she met at these bars. Police also claim her brother discovered her and his then-girlfriend having sex, which her brother disputed. She got another internship, in internal medicine, at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island, but was running into similar problems there — she had already been suspended for missing a meeting with a substance abuse counselor.[2]

&gt;On the morning of September 10, she had been formally arraigned on the criminal charge and pleaded not guilty. The police report says she and Lieberman fought loudly at the courthouse afterwards about her problems and nights out, which ended with her walking away and leaving him to go home alone and get ready for work. After reviewing it, the city medical examiner removed Philip from the official list of victims in January 2004, one of the last three.


I'm going to leave it there. This one fascinates me. "
6h5jks,11,2017-06-14,Yellow Lines Blues,dontfearme22,CTWLite,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTWLite/comments/6h5jks/yellow_lines_blues/,"He hated this city. Hated how big it was, how grey it was. The long wash of muddy lights that never dimmed. *Clouds are coming in; probably waste from the northside factories again*. He reopened his workcase and checked to see that his air-mask was still there. Little yellow and grey thing, fluid with knotted screwed components and a curve that made it almost pretty. It was a good investment. Rather his heart give out before his lungs. He clicked the case close again and made his way outside. 

Shit, its hot. He would have been sweating, but his morning pills had the wonderful side effect of inhibiting perspiration. He could feel his head jiggle a bit as it sizzled. He popped some painkillers just to be sure. They were yellow, a pukish tint of it. Yellow puke pills in the great big shit-quarium that was Alport. The overnight hostel was nice, the hostess got a good tip for her efforts. The company makes him do this on long runs, stay in the area-scope it out. Get a idea for the local flavor. 

Of course, it was nice when he was doing safety checks at the Riverfront, 3 hours of harassing some intern followed by a few days of tripping and raving. Rows of cybernetic pleasure workers ensuring his brief moment of work was entirely erased from his mind, decent beer, the little things. Here, any workers are holstering an extra limb or two under their leggings. The Industrial quarter is like a giant mountain, a fortress of smoke and metal pillars jutting from the slums, the whole thing generously drenched in a chemical bath that could strip the chrome from his boots. That was the location, the job? Barely better. 

The yellow line was infamous. Back at headquarters, Metro Authority, the running joke was to prank new hires by asking them to sort the T-30 payment forms, T-30 being the Yellow Line, or as anyone who knows, knows, an unholy letter with two prickish numbers behind it, denoting the sisyphean mess of corruption, bureaucratic idiocy, and contradiction that was the Yellow Line. Once it was funny to laugh as some fresh-faced guy or gal would be found whimpering behind a computer, a million tabs of incomplete incoherent forms before them, and a few bottles of piss under the desk. 

That was then, and now he gets the honor of being the next sacrifice. He was Isaac being lifted to the altar, though Isaac was innocent, and he was just one step removed. Unfortunately, that step was showing up to work high and venomous, one confused bender too far. His preferred poison was Lungu, and funny enough, it makes your spit a little on the corrosive side. He felt a memo in his pocket, telling him of his unexpected assignment and a medical bill for Brian's facial reconstruction surgery. oops.

He walked quickly to station 3. It was a ghetto desert. Normally people from well, everywhere else, avoid this area on pain of getting their ass shot, but Metro Workers had a special aura of immunity. It’s an open secret, the authorities links to the gangs, but it carried the unexpected benefit of making metro workers invincible. Bad business. He sported his yellow and grey metro badge with pride like a crest emblazoned across armor. His rubberized soles were plated heels of steel, his polymer gloves the articulated gauntlets by which he clutched his case, his respirator the shining helm. His pride puffed as the world around him sank further into decay with every block. 

Shanties stacked like crushed cans in a trashbag, a light here and a flicker there to remind him people actually lived here. Piles of trash freely occupied street corners, the passing cars drowning among a human glacier, slowly moving up and down the street. Junkies, hookers, gangsters, workers, and mutants. It was like an ancient scene, a bustling market but not under the blue skies of those times but the grey blanket of the world today. Every once and a while, he could feel a hand brush his pocket, try to work the digital lock, and vanish as fast as it came. The job won’t get you killed here but being pickpocketed is a fact of life.

The security card gave a little flash as its sensors slapped against the reader. Doors opened with a blast of chilled sterilized air. He entered the service door adjacent to the main public entrance. Even through a half dozen feet of metal and wiring he could still feel the reek of the masses outside, their aching shuffling glow. *Lets see what we are working with here* He rang up the station head on the wall-mounted communicator, and popped some more painkillers. This time, not to fight heat but the cold of the station. He felt like frozen food in some junkies fridge, abandoned and left to rot. His chin scratched, he loosened his respirator and put it back in his case.

 The station head was a typical slum-type. Muggy, wornout beyond her years, an old boot left in the sun. She was short, stumpy, but thin. Her skin was sallow and patchy. She was someone addicted to trash foods but with the salary to afford plentiful fat reduction pills. A tight old metro suit desperately threw itself over her frame and one of her bootsoles was patched with tape. She was confident about her appearance, strong jaw, high chin. She knew what she was, and she didn’t care. 

“Can I help you?”

 Her throat struggled with the formal request, the educated stilt of someone who had to endure a fair bit of company-provided speech training. 

“Yes you can. I need your payment sheets for the last year and your records on traffic numbers, repair checks, security code updates, the standard package for an inspection. If you could get that together while I do a manual check, that would be *very* helpful” 

She scuttled off. Some brief scrunching on her face told him that they weren’t as organized as protocol dictated, but nobody cared in headquarters, and there is certain no room for protocol out here. It was just routine, a dance, ceremony. Keeping them both busy so that they could both cash their checks and drown their lives in whatever mind-altering substance was in vogue nowadays.

He tried to focus, honestly, he did. He ran checks on the central power line, the great veiny black cords strung along the wall. He did diagnostic checks on the secondary, and tertiary backups. The data cables, the cooling pipes. He threw his case atop a storage block and began to work at it with power tools, unscrewing the security box and feeling around for any accumulations of dried goo that would indicate a cooling leak. He threw gas canisters down the vents to clear out any infestations, and then swept up the mounds of insectile corpses that slowly drizzled out afterwards. Some more painkillers. More diagnostics, more painkillers. Some giant rat tried to steal his screwdriver. Last few painkillers, he tried to rattle out one or two more from his travel case. 

The station head returned. She was dejected. Her eyes were down, but not the sort of weariness that normally weighs these people, a feigned, theatrical depression. Either she was about to lie to him or deliver a soliloquy. 

“I am sorry, I was not able to collate the payment sheets. We had a power outage this quarter and lost our payment data. The other information is uploaded to your travel account.” 

She said. Good try, but he’s dealt with enough stewed station heads to know when they were going to try and hide gang-bribes, and Yellow Line was rife with this shit. 

“That’s interesting, because the backups here are in perfect working order, and their logs don’t have any record of an outage. So, either you are impressively ignorant of your own stations data or you are lying to hide what I am sure are conspicuously odd payments on your registers. Get me fazi?” 

His touch of patois threw her off. She searched his face for intent, silently calculating how to make it out of the trap. He smiled and slid his hand over the cooled steel of the backup box. “So, you have two choices: either I send a fraud warning to headquarters and an army of inspectors and digital analysts rip you a new asshole, or you redirect some of these irregularities to a more responsible source.” He said. Her consternation had distilled to rage, but silent. Her nostrils flared only slightly, but enough to show a tiny shining crack to pure indignation, frustration, anger.

 “I understand. I appreciate your inspection sir.” 

She said. It seemed to take every ounce of her energy not to try and shank him with the screwdriver laying oh too visibly on the ground. 

“Oh, and one more thing.” He said, making a final pitch, “just to be safe, double the payment. A fraud investigation is a very protracted affair as you know.” 

She glared once more and shuffled off to the main office. He packed up his tools, fitted the cover back on the backup box and refitted his respirator before signing off and exiting the station. They would catch the payments in his account, absolutely-but with the amount of Lungu he was going to buy with it, he’d probably die before that happened anyways. He loved this city, and he loved opportunity. He sniffed the yellow slum air once more before strolling back to his hotel.

I am from Hong Kong. Me and one of my friend are heading to University of Perugia for working internship from 18/6 to 28/7. We have bought our airline ticket leaving Italy at 28/7 which the flight departure at 10pm at Fiumicino Airport. Due to some problem we are facing, i would like to stay at Perugia (assume leaving from the University) that day as late as possible without missing our flight. We expect ourselves to arrive to Fiumicino Airport not later than 8pm (for airline process).

So the question is: What is the fastest way to travel from Perugia to Fiumicino Airport? What is the approximate cost for that (for two adult each with a suitcase). Or share any tips about traveling between these two places would also be great.

Other question:

1. Can Italian speak basic English?
2. Any good restaurant/shop you think i must try before leaving?
3. Can chain restaurants be founded in Perugia?

Thank you for the help!! Grazie!!"

So I just graduated from high school and I will be a college freshmen in the fall. I'm very very very interested in becoming a lawyer, and I would love it if you guys could give me some tips. And I also have a few questions:
1. What are some extracurriculars that will make an applicant stand out? I’m love volunteer work (mostly teaching) and MUN, would those be good extracurriculars to be invested in? Also, do law schools like a variety of extracurriculars or a dedication to just one or two?
2. Do you have any tips for getting a 170+ LSAT score? Should I start preparing for it now? Also, I found this equation online that predicts your LSAT score using your previous SAT score. (http://lsatblog.blogspot.kr/2009/02/sat-lsat-correlation-predict-scores.html) From your experience, does this have any precedent?
3. I’m an international student, and I have heard that it is very difficult for international students to get internships in the US, especially with regards to law. Do any international undergrads aiming for law schools have any tips? In my country of citizenship, and the other country where my family is living in, it is near impossible to get an internship with regards to law. So it would be great if I could get an internship in the US :)
4. Will I have a higher chance of getting accepted at a top 15 law school if I am an international student as opposed to American students? Also, are there bump ups or bump downs for certain races like in undergraduate admissions?
Thank you so so much :D And sorry for all these questions."

It was of course then that my younger sister had grown up. And out, in particular - despite still not being old enough to drive, she had a bustline that strained the lingerie available at Victoria's Secret, making even most young women my age seem a bit un-ample.

What surprised me was that wasn't the only part of her that developed above-and-beyond - while her 'special situation' was always something I'd known about since our parents entrusted me with that fact, I wasn't expecting that she was using my never-used Fleshlight (I found it too small), and that she was, as well, finding it too small.

Maybe we could give it a rousing finale together....

In short - looking for someone to play my 'little sister' in this scene (open to a celeb twist/face &amp; body inspiration for this, of course!). If you've got any questions, let me know.  I  basically imagine a lot of groping, kissing, frotting, and DPing a poor sex toy into its destruction for this one.

Following our last post [""Oakland Seeks Mentors""](https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/631m5l/oakland_seeks_mentors/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit), we have gotten many great responses and local additions from the Reddit community into our Oakland Serves team. As a result, we now have a new and improved [website](https://www.oaklandserves.org) as well as new mentors and additional support/fundraising/publicity committee members. We have also published the 4th issue of our quarterly [newsletter](https://www.oaklandserves.org/single-post/2017/06/07/Oh-Why-Bother), with all previous issues accessible [online](https://www.oaklandserves.org/newsletter-1) so that you guys can follow the progress of our program. 



**The Problem**

No matter how good or how bad things are, and no matter how overloaded you are, the fact remains:

* That Oakland has one of the highest drop out rates in the country.  Only 65% of our students graduate with their class.

* That no other program in Oakland is working exclusively to identify and give targeted help to students about to drop out of high school. 

* That students who drop out become ineligible for 90% of all jobs in the country.

* That 80% of students who drop out will get in trouble with the law.

* That 68% of state prison inmates in the nation have not received a high school diploma.

* That almost all serious problems are expensive to solve.

* That it is good to seek wide-ranging sources of financial support, from small donations to large renewable foundation grants to government funding, because a) all honest money helps and b) the more you get money from one source, the more likely other sources will respond favorably to your request.

* That our program is well researched:  Mentoring works. Reducing poverty works.  Improving self esteem works.  Matching social need to social resources works.

* That giving to a good cause makes you feel better about yourself than eating ice cream does.  (Pretty sure that’s a fact.)

* That if you cannot give $100 today, there’s a chance you could give $10 for 10 days over time.

* That if you don’t have any spare cash at all, nor time to mentor, you probably have just a little bit of time to help recruit mentors. Print out our new flyer and post it where it will get some attention.

* That maybe, just maybe, yourself can write to oaklandserves@gmail.com and fill out the form they will find under “Volunteers”.



**DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TIME TO MENTOR?**

Oakland Serves mentors commit to 3 hours of mentoring per week during school days, plus transportation time.   Think you don't have the time to mentor? Maybe you do! Do any of the following describe you? 

* My job has flexible hours permitting me to work at home during non-school hours and thus gives me mentoring hours.
* I am a self-employed person who can set aside Mentoring Hours.
* I am a student who can arrange course time to have Mentoring Hours free.
* I could use my mentoring assignment as an internship.  (Oakland Serves can and will provide placement, supervision, appreciation letters, and recommendations)
* I am a retiree with suitable experience.
* I am a stay at home parent whose children are in school.  I could mentor once a week during school hours if the time is right."

I have been using pornography since I was 14 years old.  I am now a happily married 34 year old man with my 5th child on the way.  Unfortunately pornography has caused me numerous problems over the years, especially 3 years ago.  At that time I was finishing up my masters degree and had everything planned out for the next several years.  1-2 months before I was set to graduate I got caught at my internship site looking at pornography and was subsequently dismissed from my program.  Since then I have dealt with depression, shame, guilt but have also been shown just how supportive my wife can be.  I want to change because I know that this habit hurts my wife, and I can't stand to cause that pain anymore.

I've since recovered in part. I've started my own company which has started to do well and bring in some real money.  The problem is that my company requires me to frequently be on the internet.  The business is mostly online, I advertise online, put clients through an online sales funnel, and conduct most of my business online.  In other words my very way of supporting my family is problematic towards abstaining from pornography.

Since my schedule is often dependent on clients, I sometimes have dead spots during the day.  Maintaining my own business is stressful and I have used distractions (sometimes pornography) to help cope with stress.  I understand exactly what triggers my pornography use: boredom, anxiety, stress but I have a hard time dealing with those emotions productively.

In short, I'm looking for help but I want to give help as well.  I've had success in running ""mastermind"" groups to help attain goals.  These type of groups are usually no more than 5-7 people who regularly meet in order to hold each other accountable, offer support and advice.  I wanted to look here for any interest in having a small, online, mastermind, support group.  We would ideally meet once a week online using zoom (a video conferencing tool)  meetings would run roughly for 1 hour and we would be able to share struggles, offer advice and set goals.  In all honesty it would be very healing to me to use my skills to help others with this problem, but I also need some accountability and support."

I'm 21 and the only female that has worked under him (so I've been told by other coworkers). 

He looks through my purse, has taken my phone, read some text messages and looked through pictures, etc. He has given me hugs and massaged my shoulders and just generally touches me a lot, and asks lots of inappropriate questions about my dating and sex life (I don't really answer, just sit there and awkwardly laugh and say ""i don't know"" or something). 

Recently, he embarrassed me in front of like a dozen male coworkers asking about my sexuality &amp; such, and that pushed me over the edge. 

With the help of my coworker intern friend, we told the CFO (I work in Finance) and she told HR. I've had to go to HR and give ""statements"" and they asked for ""witnesses"" and they're going to start an ""investigation"" and those words sound so legitimate and they freak me out. 

I was so scared to do this in the first place but now it feels so big and so out of my control, so official and involving a lot of people. I am SO scared.

Sorry for posting here, I couldn't find any Potsdam subreddit on the first glance.

I am coming to Germany in a couple of weeks to do my student internship in one of the IT firms here and I'll be staying in Potsdam. I've heard that gyms in Germany charge mostly on a six-month basis, as opposed to gyms in my home country that charge just on a monthly basis.

Can you recommend me a good student gym that either charge each month or where it seems like you can make a deal with the owner? Although I'll be spending six months in Potsdam I don't believe that I'll get back to training straight away as I want firstly to spend some time adapting to the city and the country itself. I'll be great if it's somewhere between Babelsberg and Potsdam Südost, but gyms near the city centre can also work for me.

Thanks!

I should add that I tried the 'ole ""Just moved here from out-of-state and haven't changed my license over yet"" deal at a place on Pico and was immediately shown the door.

So yesterday one of my colleagues at work found an old guitalele (basically, a 6-string ukulele-sized guitar) in the storage room of the school I work at and I decided to take it home with me, because why not.

Now, I've learned a bit of the basics of playing guitar with an actual guitar through some lessons I found on the interwebs. But since I moved abroad for a 5-month internship about three months ago and wasn't able to take mine with me, I haven't even touched a guitar, as I never found the time to just buy a used one and continue practicing on (a combination of laziness and money issues).

Now that I got this adorable guitalele and have some free time on my hands, I got my motivation back and want to pick up from where I left off.
Do you guys think it makes sense to just do my guitar lessons on the guitalele until I get back home to my actual guitar? I mean it's basically just like playing a regular acoustic guitar with the capo on the 5th fret.

What do you guys think?"

6habph,10,2017-06-14,I wish we had never become friends.,TheWhisperedthing,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6habph/i_wish_we_had_never_become_friends/,"I had just been promoted to a front-end runner in my grocery store and was dealing with a horrible break-up that caused me to lose ten pounds and a lot of dignity. I was 18 years old and my co-worker was a tall, flirtatious braggart who leaned towards too friendly. We got along perfectly. We always had the same ideas, he trusted me, we got everything done every single night, and we had a ton of fun. We laughed, talked for hours, pushed each other around - I started to really like him, friend-wise and crush-wise. I was a vulnerable 18 year old and he paid attention to me, of course I was going to fall a bit. I didn't mind his less than stellar looks because I thought our minds complimented each other perfectly.

He was 22 and moved on to teach. I was very proud of him for getting an internship and graduating. I meanwhile reconnected with my ex and we got back together (still going strong) and decided we both just needed to grow individually during those months. Me and my ex-co-worker hung out twice after that - both times a lot of my attraction for him fell.

All he did was talk about himself and how amazing he was doing. He claimed to be the best teacher in the entire universe - no joke. No one understood the profression more than him. Eh, whatever - I can get over a little braggart. We still get along.

I took five classes while working a 25+ hour schedule and failed two and didn't exactly do well in the other three. It destroyed me. I was anxious, depressed, and was pretty much crying every night about it. My boyfriend cheered me up, told me to take less classes and refocus, and that no matter what he was proud of me for trying. In confidence, I told my friend what happened. He was very shocked and...disappointed in me. He later told another co-worker who at the time, I was very jealous of because he was always talking about how he got straight A's and worked 40 hours at one point. They visited me at work another day and were ragging on me about it. ""What happened?"" ""Why did you fail those two?"" ""What are you going to do next semester?"" ""We thought you could do better than that. We gotta teach you how to do better.""

This overwhelmed me. They were talking about me taking five classes next semester! Um, like hell I am! I know I need to improve my time management so I need to start small rather than jumping right back in to a full course load. And they both told me how smart I was and how disappointed they were in me.

The last time I saw him was two weeks ago. He came to brag that he found a great teaching job (coincidentally in the township my family was born, raised, and destroyed in.) and that he wanted to rub it in, not necessarily on me, but you know, he can't help it. ""Ha, ha, you're stuck here and I'm out!"" except...I really like my job. I'm not a manager yet, but I'm a low-grade one who gets to control all the cashiers and make decisions. It's fun and a huge confidence booster for someone who went from never talking to anyone to being the boss. I don't get paid enough and I get annoyed of course, but I wouldn't have ever chosen a different first job...and my managers are very fond of me and think of me very highly despite some of my flaws.
He asks me who the best runner is these days, excluding the manager. I said ""Well, the manager puts me right next to her. She thinks of us as equal."" ...he...laughs? He says he can't believe how far our store has fallen for me to be considered the best, ""no offence or anything! but when I was here and co-worker were here and a bunch of other people who left, you would have been...decent. Okay. But nowhere near the top.""

Oh...okay?

Then he starts talking about how great he is. How glad he is to be out of school. How glad he is to have a different job. And then he asks me about school. When I tell him my plan of only taking two classes, he says yet again how he's disappointed in me because I could've done better. Now, he knows how to read faces and voices so I know he knows that I was very uncomfortable with this because I said sarcastically ""Yeah, thanks...helps very much."" and he just goes on to talk about how he needs to teach me time management so I could be more like him. He doesn't ever say sorry, even though I told him that I didn't need to hear that he was disappointed in me and that anxiety ruined my semester and blah blah blah.

And during the conversation, he says all women are petty. I look at him and he's like ""oh, not you, you're cool."" so I say it's a people thing, plenty of men are petty too. ""Nah, I was raised around women. I know they're all petty...besides you!""

Any little bit of spark was snuffed out. What an asshole. Women don't have some magical gene that makes us petty (besides the ones he approves of, of course) just as men don't have a gene that make them inherently slobs. Some men are, some men aren't - but it's a stereotype that floats around. He wants to hang out in July when we're more free...I haven't yet decided how to tell him no, you're a jerk.

It's just going to be so hard for him to see why I changed my opinion on him so quickly...when I look back, all the signs leading up to this moment point towards this behavior, but I was vulnerable and at the time and chose not to realize, treat it as a joke, or find it endearing. Now he's going to tell stories of what a jerk I was when I got back in my relationship."

Episode Title Inspired by [“Break on Through” - The Doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r679Hhs9Zs)


**Random Thoughts**

- New resident - Sydney Heron - heals with love
- Cristina’s reaction to being hugged is to say “Ow.”
- Of course George is going to strike with the nurses. Of course.
- Alex is such a kiss ass. Sydney isn’t the first doctor whose behind he’s kissed and it won’t be the last.
- Aww, the nurses do care about their patients.
- I like Sydney especially when she’s telling off Cristina. She’s got sass.
- Totally forgot about that almost fight in the bar between the doctors and the nurses.
- And the character I empathize the most with this episode is Izzie. My sisters grew up in a place kind of like where Izzie did - very blue collar and lots of teen pregnancies. In fact, where my family lives there’s a popular meme on Facebook that basically extols the virtues of teen pregnancy. It goes something like “When you’re 35 and changing diapers, I’ll be sitting back and relaxing while my grown son makes his own sandwiches.” It’s a way different mindset than anything I’ve ever experienced and I don’t blame Izzie at all for telling the girl that there’s other options out there for her. 
- The early episodes were allowed to breathe and it is so refreshing. The musical sequences where we watch events unfold in silence are just as impactful as the talking scenes.
- OK. OK. I give. Derek going to comfort Meredith was pretty sweet. 
- I miss when they would all crowd into George’s bed.



**Tearjerker Moment**

- That old lady taking her last breath. I don’t know why it got to me, but it did. Is that what dying is like?


**Quotes**

- “Change your own bed pan Stevens!” “Yeah, enjoy your syphilis, Olivia.”
- “Dr. Yang wanted to be sure that perky little bimbo cheerleader wasn't in here trying to kill a patient. Am I right? Now with all do respect Dr. Burke I know you don't know me very well but I'm pretty good at what I do. And my patient is a 25 year old marathoner and I've told her husband I'm going to try and save her leg. So my plan is to stand here for as many hours as it takes to scrape away every last cell of necrotic flesh. Now when I'm done, if it's still spreading, then we'll take the leg. And if we do then our eager young intern here can hold the saw. Now unlike Dr. Karev, kindness and compassion aren't very high on her list of priorities but a little bone-saw action well maybe that will earn me some respect. Am I right? Now Dr. Yang, you ready to scrub back in?”
- “Anybody want to have sex?” “George.”


**Questions**

- Do you think Izzie overstepped by sharing her personal story with the girl? Do you think she was being judgmental?
- What do you think of Sydney? Like her? Hate her? Indifferent?

Today I worked from 8 am to 10 pm due to an evening training for work. I haven't been able to work out for 4 days now, while I usually train at least 5 times a week. 

While staying busy is recommended most of the time, there is a downside in my opinion.

I was so busy the past few days, that I had very little time to think about her. There were some moments where she popped into my head, but I was able to focus on the things I was supposed to be doing at that time. I felt alright for 3 days in a row. 

When I came home today though, after a very long day, it hit me all at once. I sat down for a minute and had a quiet moment to myself and there she was again. All the thoughts and feelings I had pushed aside the past few days just blew it in my face and I'm having trouble to sleep again.

I know this is a temporary thing, but just wanted to share this experience. It's good to be busy, but it sucks when you get kicked down again when you have some time to yourself. Just wanted to get this off my chest before I try to sleep again. 

Goodnight and stay strong everybody."
6halah,22,2017-06-14,The Inner Sinner Circle,ruesavage,creepyencounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/6halah/the_inner_sinner_circle/,"Hey Guys! Been lurking this board during office hours to pass the time (the fluorescents keep me from getting too freaked out) and remembered a story from years ago that sent a fresh shiver down my spine.

This was around 2006. I had just graduated from a small liberal arts school in New York City with a degree in writing and, like most new graduates, figured I'd be running shit in no time. I'd been mostly going on interviews for assistant positions and the like, so when I applied to an ad for a copywriter and got an interview, I jumped at the chance.

This was 2006 when Craigslist was still a viable job search option instead of a backdoor prostitution cesspool with the occasional nice couch, so I was using it almost exclusively for job hunting. The interview was in a pretty nondescript building in Chelsea. If you're familiar with the city, it was one of those narrow pre-wars around 7th avenue that are usually filled with low-budg modeling agencies and start-up production companies. Of course, I didn't have any of that context at the time and still thought my 3 month internship would my ticket to career success. So yeah.

Anyhow, I go up to the floor as instructed in the email. The company is called (fake name that's similar) The Dirty Glass (more on this to come). It's one of these gift catalogue deals with housewares and tabletop which seemed fun and mostly stress-free (was still a pot smoking hippy at that point and was looking for an easy, laid-back gig. Counter, I know, with my thinking I was hot shit, but I was young and contradicted myself a lot back then).

One other note: As part of my application, I'd been asked to answer three questions about myself in the same sultry ""scandalous"" style I'd plan to use in the catalogue and send along a picture. I didn't really think anything of this, since the catalogue had a particular tone that was sort of a little naughty (not like NSFW-porn-naughty, more like oh-im-a-mom-drinking-wine-before-noon naughty) and didn't realize a picture wasn't part of the standard application process.

So I make my way to office. Now on the office door someone has taped a piece of computer paper printed with the name of the company. ""Odd,"" I think, until I remember that the hiring manager told me they'd recently moved.

At this point, I'm just eager to prove myself to this company and fantasizing about how jealous all my former-classmates will be at my fancy new title when door swings open.

On the other side, the man who greets me is distinctly...gay. No judgment, I'm a gay woman, but suffice it to say my gaydar was buzzing like crazy. This actually puts me at ease. ""Great,"" I think. ""Now I don't have to posture to some douchebag who wants a young secretary to ogle during business hours. This is really about me and my talent!""

As he greets me in the doorway, I peek behind the man and see another girl already sitting inside with her purse. The guy (we’ll call him S), tells me he's just finishing up another interview and invites me in. Again, I'm not thinking this is too weird, mostly because it's a small office (just a single room, I soon find out), but also because I have little to no experience interviewing.

So I sit down next to this girl. Right away, I notice a wine glass on the table. S immediately offers me a glass of wine (mind you, it's 11:30 or so in the morning) and tells me this is not your typical office environment - that people are free to drink, have fun and avoid the typical corporate grind. Again, that alarm bell inside me threatens to ring, but as I said, I'm a little bit of a free spirit (and certainly was back then) so I push it away and, being 22, jump at the chance to drink in the middle of the day.

S quickly rushes through a bunch of standard interview questions with this girl and then turns to both of us. Now he's super animated all of a sudden, explaining how The Dirty Glass website is just the tip of the iceberg as far as what he's trying to create with his company.

Now this is ten years ago plus at this point, but I will try to recount exactly what he told me. Basically he says The Dirty Glass  catalogue will soon be divided into three sections - Section One will be the alcohol and barware section of the site, Section Two will be devoted to food.

Section Three, he tells us, leaning in, is of the utmost secrecy and we're lucky enough to get a preview. Basically, what S is trying to create is a hedonist community where VIP members get access to a black card that gives them special privileges all over the world to eat at the best restaurants, drink the best wine and join in on hedonist activities wherever they can be found. Section Three of the site is therefore devoted to sex toys of all stripes, to be consistent with the hedonist aspect of his offline secret society. Writers will be required to try all the products in their section in order to write authentic descriptions (""How awesome is that,"" I think, when we're still talking about wine and food) so if you're involved in section three, you have to be sexually adventurous.

Now, let me recap. I'm a naive 22 year old sitting next to another twenty-something drinking wine in the middle of the day with a stranger who's pitching me his hedonist fever dream. Why I did not run out of there I will never know. For some odd reason - I think largely because I had just spent the past four years reading Existentialist philosophy and smoking pot - I'm actually entertaining all this as a viable business model!

The other girl, for her part, also seems super on board with the idea. So S continues. As far as the job goes, there's a couple different ways writers can be involved: The first is as a contributor who submits every once in a while. The second is as a staff writer, stationed at the office HQ who gets paid a salary to write for the catalogue and the third is someone with company stakes who is as much of a partner as he is.

S has names for these ""levels"" as he calls them, two of which have now faded from memory, but one I will never forget. The deepest level, as he says, is ""The Inner Sinner Circle."" The Inner Sinner Circle, he tells us, are those who will write for this third layer of his site...The hedonist side. He describes this group as being like a bunch of sex columnists required to use the products they discuss, with one small catch...

They're required to use them in front of each other, in the office. I turn to the girl next to me who is effusively expressing her interest in of all this (again, more on that later). ""Wow,"" I think. I have some competition here (I know I know, don't even say it. SO naive.)

So S goes back into professional mode, concludes the interview with the other girl, shuts the door and turns to me. Now it's just the two of us in this tiny room in the middle of this random pseudo-office building in Chelsea. Immediately, he's animated again and tells me as great as the other girl seemed, he just KNOWS I'm the perfect person for this job. He wants me to go all the way with him. Every level.

At this point, my internal alarm (which has been ringing in a vacuum somewhere) finally reaches my ears. ""What do you mean?"" I ask. ""I want you to be in the Inner Sinner Circle. Would you be interested in that, ruesavage?""

Even at this point, I'm still on board with his weird social experiment and I tell him sure, I would potentially be interested, all the while knowing I have got to get out of here because even if this is a legitimate opportunity, things are getting weird. ""Great,"" he tells me. In order to be part of the Inner Sinner Circle and for him to trust that I'm ready for it, he just requires one thing.

He wants me to masterbate in front of him. Right now.

Okay, now I know I gotta get the f out of this place. So, very calmly while still matching his general level of excitement, I tell him that as pumped as I am about the opportunity, this is not something my girlfriend would be comfortable with me doing. In response, and matching my calmness measure for measure, he MAKES ME CALL my girlfriend to ask her permission. Now I'm on the phone with her, frantically trying to explain his whole ""movement,"" telling her this guy wants me to masterbate in front of him (thankfully, she's my ex now 'cause she barely reacts with more than a ""that's weird"" when I tell her) and all the while he's watching me, refilling my wine glass, waiting for my decision. So I get off the phone and tell him nope, I'm sorry, she says I can't do it. But still he urges me on, more pleading. More insistent.

Now, I will never understand how I did this, but miraculously I am able to convince him that I seriously plan to email him a nude of myself at a later date (I obviously had no intention of actually sending one) and with him still thinking I was interested in being an ""Inner Sinner,"" got the hell out of there.

Looking back, I don't know why I didn't pick up more on the signs that so much was wrong with this situation. I now believe the girl before me was an obvious plant. I'm convinced he'd put something in my wine (he had a fridge with two different bottles he was pouring from) and that had I drank more who knows if I'd have made it out of there the same as I came in.

It took me until months later when I was recounting the story to a professor friend to really realize just how serious things could've gotten. I even wrote to S the next day to politely decline the position with an earnest hope that he keep pursuing his big dream, so convinced as I was that what he was starting was really different and unique.

Months later, I saw the ad I answered pop up again on Craigslist and flagged it, but nothing really came of it and the The Dirty Glass site remained up for a long time. I seriously hope no other young writers found out what was really going on in the Inner Sinner Circle.

So rapey man from my first job interview, let's never never meet again.

6haz91,1,2017-06-14,"I (25F) am looking for advice on dealing with my family, specifically my dad (50M).",Verdant_Shade,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6haz91/i_25f_am_looking_for_advice_on_dealing_with_my/,"**TL;DR is at bottom. Sorry for length.**

My family has its share of problems. I need advice regarding my relationship with my father, which is getting progressively worse.

I will acknowledge that, in general, my two brothers and I have been a bit disappointing. My father also works very hard, occasionally travels for work, and is dealing with the fact that his mother (overseas) is in extremely poor health due to Parkinson's.

**About me specifically:** I have secretly been dealing (properly) with Bipolar disease the past two years and finally spoke with my family about it. Since my diagnosis, my grades have tanked. I work on-and-off, usually in the summer when I have more time. I just broke up with my boyfriend (4 mo) and have only 1 long-term friend--which my father vehemently disapproves of despite his clean lifestyle and good-natured disposition.

I tried smoking weed; I'm done with it. I'm only a social drinker, maybe once a week if that. I connect with my dad over politics, religion, lifestyle... basic things which might normally be a point of contention in other relationships. We even play ice hockey together.

**The problem:** If my dad isn't talking to/at me about his work, hobbies, opinions, then he is just critical. Nothing I do is okay, there's always something that needs my attention in the house, and I am constantly my brothers' keeper (22 &amp; 19).

My house is a wreck. My mother has collected (borderline hoarded) household goods and clothes. It is organized, clean, sometimes useful, mostly stressful hoarding. I need you to picture that. I am going to write out a fight we had yesterday as an example.


**Example:** I left a plate in the living room after eating lunch because I had gotten carried away with a job application to amazon, $12/ hour, for a full-time post. I was thrown out of bed that morning after 5 hours of sleep (Bipolar problems) because my brother needed a last-minute ride to work. I spent the morning gardening for my mom, giving my dog a hair-cut, tracking down that job offer, chauffeuring both my brothers (unusual circumstances to be fair). My dog had a one-hour class, I'm dealing with Lithium withdrawal (headaches, leg cramps). I even tidied up the patio slightly, because that's all the time I had left for cleaning. I have been BEGGING my family the last few days to give me advanced notice for everything. Rides (nope). Chores (boys are NOT contributing. At all.) Company (Nope.) My brothers have a 'revolving door' of friends over every day, and I get no notice. We were having an insurance agent over that evening, no notice. I just found out that we were hosting 3 guests in 2 weeks. Okay, I got notice. TO CLEAN THE ENTIRE HOUSE IN 1.5 WEEKS. ALONE. (mum works full time)

That dish. He saw me cutting the dog's hair, told me to hang out on the patio so we were out of the way, then he came back five minutes later to chew me out for the plate, because the insurance agent (NO notice) was arriving in 15 minutes and THAT made the house unpresentable. I let him have it, I apologized later, he at least gave me forewarning for another agent arriving this evening.

**Problem Cont'd:** As you can see, my family is not communicating. I am getting contradictory instructions from my parents. Mom insists I not do yardwork, dad is upset I didn't do yardwork, and then he is upset again later when I didn't personally oversee my brother completing the yardwork (which he didn't).

If I don't have a job, I need to get one. If I have a job, it takes up too much time/ isn't good enough. He pushes me to take internships I don't qualify for when my GPA is trash and he knows. When I worked out, it was inconvenient. I don't work out, now I get grief for gaining weight (meds contributing!) I don't have enough friends, he doesn't like my friend.

To top it off, my dad, both my brothers, and I now smoke. I am trying to quit and they know that. I--and I alone--am constantly being berated for the habit. Mom, dad, brothers, I get no peace. I'm at wits end. Everytime I clean, spare shit goes back in my room (1/2 of it is books right now) and I get yelled for that too.

**TL;DR** *I am struggling with health/GPA/self-imposed social isolation. At the same time, my family is incapable of communicating with me. I am trying to clean out a hoarding-house in 1.5 weeks alone. I am berated for everything, big or small, to the point of hypocrisy. I am forced to be my brothers' keeper.*

**Moving out is not an option. My brothers and I are on much better terms. Mom is very kind and does what she can. I have mentioned all this to my counselor and she is useless. My psych has been generous enough to get me on Escitalopram aka Lexapro for anxiety/stress.** I really really could use some advice. Please. I don't want to fight over stupid shit and this lifestyle is both embarrassing and toxic."
6hb38v,79,2017-06-14,"Yes, come right on in! No need to knock!",HighgardensLady,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6hb38v/yes_come_right_on_in_no_need_to_knock/,"Hey there fellow drama llamas! This post has been sitting in my email drafts for several months. It never really felt like the right time to post it, but I'm bored at work and FMIL has been nibbling my crackers lately, leaving crumbs all over my metaphoric floor. So i feel ready to share this with you all now! Please bear with me in the rather long intro. 

Orange County, CA circa 2013/2014

I wont lie, my parents had money when I was growing up. Not exactly top 1%ers but my dad worked a high power, executive job for one of the leading aerospace companies for over 30 years, retired and started his own company. My mom had been a SAHM for basically my entire life. We had lived in a 6500sqft house, 7 bedrooms/4.5 bathrooms on 2 acres of land. I was a princess living in a castle on top of the hill, I'm aware I lived a life of privileged. But I was raised by marvelous loving people who taught me to be open and generous with everything I had received. So I was spoiled, but not a spoiled ROTTEN brat! 

Long story short, right before I started dating FDH, my parents told me that my Dads business had failed due to outside circumstances, that we had to file bankruptcy, we were losing our home and that my parents were moving several hours away into the mountains. 

I was devastated. My whole world was falling out from underneath me. My support system was gone. If i wanted to stay in orange county (which i did) I had to do it totally on my own. I had just turned 20 years old, with zero job experience and a brand new degree from a trade school that required a 1-2 year internship to start successfully in that field. I was also barely 19 years old at the time.

After the house sold I spent 6 months sofa surfing with various friends/friends parents for as long as they would let me stay. I never lived with my future IL's but I would stay there maybe 2 or 3 nights a week. I was so emotionally shot, some nights all I wanted to do was lay in bed with him and cry, have him rub my back and tell me ""its gonna be ok"".

Now, if my parents hadnt lost the house and had to move away, I likely would never have slept at their house ever. EVER. Normally, sleeping in the same bed with a boy, in his parents house, WITH the parents home is something that was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY out of my comfort zone. Honestly, it felt disrespectful for me. My parents would never allow a boy to stay the night at my house in my bed with me, it just wasn't done. But this was desperate times and called for desperate measures!

(Thank you all for following along I promise the story gets good now)

One night FDH and I come back to his parents house late, we had gone to a movie or something. We go upstairs, its summertime so its hot as balls, and FDH disrobes down to his boxer briefs as per usual. He always pressured me to sleep in my underwear with him instead of my modest pjs because ""it makes the cuddles sooooo much better"" (I mean hell ya it does but the closet in this room was shared with his 2 bros who DO NOT KNOCK) but I usually declined because i just wasnt comfortable doing that, I was still VERY new on this familys scene. But this night of course is the one night I let him talk me into it. I strip down to my sports bra and undies and basically lay on top of him. Fitting 2 adults both basically over 6ft tall onto a twin sized mattress is NOT easy. We very quietly and politely have sex, and proceed to fall asleep. 

....All is well throughout the night....

7:30am (Saturday Morning) 

Im asleep, basically naked, totally spooned on a tiny twin sized bed with my grizzly bear of a FDH who is also basically naked. Im usually a heavy sleeper, like a Kodiak Bear during hibernation when im comfortable in my own home. But this isnt my home and I am sure as hell not comfortable. 

I hear the door open, which instantly wakes me up but I stay still with my eyes closed, at this point I think its one of his brothers coming in to grab some clothes out of the communal closet (you see where this is going, right?). I keep my eyes closed hoping that theyll just grab what they need and get out. I feel the edge of the already full bed, sag down even more.

OH GOD ITS HIS MOTHER the horror sinks in. WHY IS SHE HERE? IS THIS NORMAL? HALP ME GOD! 

I am laying there, heart racing erratically, im physically willing my FDH to wake up and save me from this weirdness. Who does that? Why would any mother want to come into her adult sons bedroom and watch him sleeping with his girlfriend? 

Thank god he rouses, sees his mom there but to my horror, he doesnt react.

FDH: ""Oh hey mom, morning"" he mumbles sleepily as he cuddles me closer....with his mother right there less than 6 inches away from us. God please strike me dead from the embarrassment!

FMIL: ""oh good morning sleepyheads"" she says sweetly while gazing affectionately at him. This shit is just getting weirder. 

Im basically laying there completely motionless, avoiding eye contact because im in my god damn underwear barely covered by a tiny ass blanket on this too small bed for us who are two large people, and now his mom who I barely know is getting a birds eye view of my goodies. Oh joy. Then it gets weirder.

My FDH is the middle son, hes the largest and broadest in the shoulder and chest than both of his brothers, his chest is also has a nice patch of dark blond hair. I didnt like chest hair until I dated him and god damn its so sexy to me now! Back to the point...

 As his mom is giving him the goo goo eyes, she looks at his chest and lets out a small sigh

FMIL: ""FDH, your chest is so hairy! Neither one of your brothers has chest hair like this!"" She starts stroking his chest hair affectionately ""But youve always been my hairy child."" STILL petting his damn chest hair, curling her fingers in it, stroking it. The chest thats about 4-6in away from my mortified face. 

I have said absolutely nothing during this exchange in the vain hope that if i dont move no one will see me and they wont know i'm still there. 

FDH says nothing in response to what his mom said, he didnt even visibly react. Just pulled up reddit on his phone and began idly scrolling. 

His mom STAYS THERE! She actually started talking to us about random shit, like what she wants to do today, if he wanted to garden with her, if we wanted breakfast? All these things that he basically ignores, generic ""mmhmm""s for responses. Im still paralyzed in fear, at least visibly awake now, but still clutching the sheet to my near nakedness. 

After a long and awkward silence, FMIL seems to get the hint, sighs and says ""well ill just leave you two kids alone now"" and leaves the bedroom door open on her way out. 

I get dressed and leave immediately, like I was moving so fast im surprised i didnt reverse time and go back to before she came in and just GTFO before I have to deal with that weird touchy shit I had just witnessed. 

And thats all folks! I never stayed the night there again after that. I was able to find an apartment of my own with a girlfriend as a roommate. From that day on, anytime he would ask me to stay over, i would just counter that we could go to my apartment that has a king sized bed, and no parental supervision. We had several small spats but never a blow up about what had happened. Honestly, ive never really brought it up to him how much it weirded me out.

Things were good with FMIL for about 2 years after this until FDH and I got our first apartment...then the boundary stomping continued, but thats a post for another day!"
6hb75b,5,2017-06-14,"I [22M] want to start dating again, but don't want to make any potential partners deal with my insecurities",AnotherThrowaway194,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hb75b/i_22m_want_to_start_dating_again_but_dont_want_to/,"Posting this from a throwaway because I don't want this associated with my main account. Less because its embarrassing and more because I hate myself for feeling the way I do about what I do. Apologies for the long post--TL;DR at the bottom is a decent summary.

Alright, a little background. I've had a total of three relationships that I'd consider 'serious'. Relationship 1 lasted all four years of high school, relationship 2 lasted for a year freshman year of college, and relationship 3 lasted six-ish months starting over summer 2016 and going until right before Thanksgiving 2016.

**Relationship 1:** This relationship started at the recommendation of some mutual friends. While we weren't super compatible, I did care for her and it certainly wasn't a *bad* relationship... for the most part. She watched quite a few TV shows/movies, and was fairly open about her celebrity crushes. Now, I'll make it clear that her having the crushes isn't a problem. I know its a totally normal thing, and despite never really having them myself that isn't the thing that made me uncomfortable. Very often she'd bring up (out of the blue) just how hot celebrity x or celebrity y was, and then she'd patronizingly say something to the effect of ""Sorry babe, but if I had a shot with him you'd be old news."" before laughing and going on with whatever else she was doing. When I brought up the fact that her comments made me a bit uncomfortable she would get defensive and accuse me of being ""too sensitive"" or ""not enough of a man to take some criticism"", or something along those lines. Eventually I dropped it, because it seemed to be more trouble than it was worth to actually discuss. This relationship eventually ended before we went to college, on friendly (if not a bit awkward) terms.

**Relationship 2:** I'll preface this by saying that this relationship was a mistake. I realize now that I was manipulated and taken advantage of by someone who was using me to solve their own problems. Anyhow, I started dating this girl around Christmas of my freshman year of college. I knew her from High School, and this relationship had a more organic start than my first. At first things were fine, other than her struggles with depression. It was hard to watch her fight that, and I tried my best to make myself available whenever she needed me. Then after a few months it started. ""Fuck, this guy came in to my work today. Jesus he was so fucking hot. I'd let him have me on the spot if he wanted it."" ""God I just love [Celebrity]. I'd be his wife/girlfriend in a heartbeat."" ""Sorry babe, but if [guy from work] was single you'd be on your own."" Etc. Again, when I brought up that the descriptions and open comments made me uncomfortable I was met with defensiveness, and occasionally anger that I dared to question something that comforted her occasionally when she was struggling with depression. That relationship ended when several unrelated events brought her gas-lighting and mental/emotional abuse to a head.

**Relationship 3:** I worked in one of my dorms with this girl. Had a huge crush on her from the first time I met/talked to her. Worked up the courage to ask her to dinner, had a few casual dates during the end of the fall semester, and then started an actual relationship with her over the summer. I was head over heels in love with her, and while we were taking things a bit slow since she'd never been in a relationship before I was happy. She never once mentioned anything like the other two in regards to celebrity/non-celebrity crushes, but... I always had that feeling in the back of my mind. That feeling that I wasn't good enough. It would only surface occasionally, but when it did I'd spend a good two days trying to force myself back to feeling normal again. She ended this relationship abruptly, saying she was too busy prepping for law school/wasn't likely to ever going to be able to devote herself to a relationship. Four months later she was dating a friend's roommate, someone who had always made me a bit uncomfortable whenever we were around him.

Since that third relationship ended I've made alot of positive changes in my life. I've lost 34 pounds, and while I still struggle with body image issues I'm starting to feel more confident there. I'm eating better, exercising, and landed an amazing internship. Despite all that, I also deal with an almost constant feeling of not being enough for people. I want to start looking for a relationship again... but I don't want my partner to have to deal with my insecurities. I honestly never felt like this before those first two relationships, and I've been thinking lately that maybe I internalized all their comments  unconsciously. I want to fix this, but I honestly don't know how and I don't particularly want to make anyone have to deal with this garbage. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I just can't logic my way out of it. That little seed is always there, and if I don't push it away then it grows into something that gives me days of trouble before I wrestle control of my thoughts back.

**TL;DR -** Two of three past girlfriends were very open/vocal about their crushes (both celebrity and otherwise) and often commented on how they were 'sorry' they'd leave me for x or y guy if they had the chance while refusing to talk about how it made me feel. I think I've unconsciously internalized the feeling of not being 'enough' for someone and while I want to start dating again, I don't want to make my partner deal with my problems."
6hb8sj,1,2017-06-14,[28/m] my [21/f] sister is stuck in a codependent relationship with our mother - I tried to help; now they both resent me. Should I give up?,sisterhelpthrowawa,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6hb8sj/28m_my_21f_sister_is_stuck_in_a_codependent/,"Some background: 

**SECTION SUMMARY: Mom bipolar; very emotionally unstable and historically abusive.**

My mother is bipolar.  I moved out when I was 14 because it was not a livable situation; my Mom's mood swings paired with her abuse of my little sister's loyalty (they both lied together to get me in trouble) led to me running away and then eventually put in foster care.  It got to the point where even school counselors wouldn't talk to me because my mother would lie to them about nonsense.  They had me on lithium for years due to these lies.  Granted - I was a bit of a troublemaker and that didn't help.

**SUMMARY: I moved out at 14; have seen some success; decided to temporarily move back to rebuild my relationships with mom/sis/dad while I focus on self-education.**

I've since put myself through college, paid off my student loans, maintained a career at a prestigious company, and have my finances together.

I recently decided to buckle down and start a business while employed.  I'm a consultant and my current engagement is a remote one.  As a means of both eliminating social distractions and attempting to rebuild my relationships with my family members, I decided to try to move home for a while.

**SUMMARY: Started well, but noticed that mom and sister remain codependent.  Mom is enabling sister to remain stagnant so she has emotional security.  Dad doesn't want drama and remains passive.**

The first couple months have been great - very pleasant and fun.  I did notice that my sister is not making much progress in her life though.  She's 21, doesn't eat normal food (just snacks, cake, pie, etc).  Doesn't exercise.  Doesn't have friends, never kissed a boy.  Got fired from the only job (and an unpaid internship) she had.  Generally unpleasant, sassy, moody, and disrespectful towards others.  I love her, but this is the truth.

My mom was essentially saved by my dad at a time when she was experiencing emotional and physical abuse.  Their bond is tight though my mom sees my sis as her best and only real friend.  It's mutual; and it's easy for both of them.  My mom doesn't want to lose my sister and my sister doesn't want to exert herself in any manner.  Dad has tried to encourage but gave up after it caused a bit of friction.

**SUMMARY: I offered some advice to my sister.  Both mom and sis are now resentful and sour towards me.**

I advised my sister to eat healthy, set goals, and make a list - every day - of the things she wants to achieve that will get her closer to her goals.  It's how I started a successful (by my standards at the time) business in college; it's how I got my dream job; it's how I stay in shape; it's how you *get shit done*.  I said this in a *very* diplomatic manner (in case you're curious about what's worked for me...) without coming off as preachy; I know she's sensitive. Though she took it personally and now both mom and sis are short and unpleasant with me.  It's like they share a mind; when one is upset with me, the other acts the *same exact way*.

**SUMMARY: I tried asking sis what was going on; she shut down in a form of denial and defense.  There's something awfully wrong here and I want to help.** 

I attempted to have a private conversation with sis about how she was speaking with me.  I asked, ""Hey, there seems to be something wrong.  Do you want to talk about it?"".  She denied anything was wrong; I provided an example; she broke down in a defensive, offensive, impenetrable kind of demeanor riddled with sarcasm and passive aggression.  The conversation ended on a pretty negative note with her walking away saying something like, ""you don't know me"".  

So now I'm sitting here with 66% of my family resenting me because I'm trying to demonstrate and encourage some improvements to their lifestyle.  It doesn't bother me that my mother stays at home but my sister is 21.  She's not an emotional pillow.  These are formative years and without proper nutrition, exercise, social interaction and general life experience, she'll remain codependent and will lose any shot she has at a healthy level of autonomy.  

Who knows; I'm not a shrink and maybe I am just as they likely see me - an outsider coming in to evangelize some unwanted religion.  Projecting my values and priorities onto them.  But I believe this dynamic to be *objectively unhealthy* and I'm wondering what you all would do in my situation.  I'll be leaving at the end of the month but I want to leave on somewhat of a positive note and - if possible - a push in the right direction for my sister.  Maybe it's obvious from reading this that I am just being overbearing and should just mind my own business and love them unconditionally, though I think that ship sailed about 13 years ago.

**What would you do?**

I hate the idea of being stuck to one kind of job for the rest of my life and that we only have one life therefore we should choose something that we like. 


I haven't finished my degree because I thought it was a waste of time. Too expensive for such little education. I felt also guilty of taking my parents money even though they believe it is normal to help their kids. I left. Then I did an internship in the field I would potentially be into and well it changed my mind. I don't see myself doing that. My skills and everything I have focused learnt until now was in the fashion industry. I don't know if it was influenced by my parents or not. I do enjoy it all but as a hobby. I just don't like when hobbies become jobs. It's no fun anymore. I know I don't go 100% all the way in things I get into. My parents remind me each time I talk to them. And I do believe I can do better. But I want to move on so I don't go back to things I didn't enjoy so much. 

I became a fashion design teacher. My first job. Well paid but just wasn't satisfying on a personal level and never got paid on time so was pretty difficult to be independent. I needed a change and found a job in another city (finally left my parents). Decent pay too but soon I will be at my maximum salary and it isn't enough to live in my own place (I am currently renting a room at someone's and I am having enough of it). I've settled down pretty well. I love the job because the coworkers are nice, I am free to do my hobbies after work. I have made friends.


But the future scares me. I can't live all my life like that with that job that gives no incentive to go beyond myself. My CV will have that job which is so different from what I studied (even though I haven't finished so I have no degree). I have another opportunity to change field completely however I am questionning all my life over again. I will have to move again. I will have to quit most of my hobbies because this job doesn't have fix hours but if I sacrifice them and I am good enough, I can get so sooo rich. Honestly if I go there it's only for the money but I don't know if I will be happy. There are two kind of jobs. Fix hours, fix salaries or all the opposite. I know it's a life style. I just don't know if I will be okay. I am still young so I don't want to make any mistake. Can I go back to another kind of job ? Probably not. I feel like my CV is all over the place which won't give a good impression for future employers. I also feel like I am wasting my skills but is it right to use that for career ? Hobbies to jobs once again...


I have to make a choice but I don't want to regret any of it. The future is scary.

Sometimes I do envy students that are in uni. It gives them time to not worry before being in the real world haha but I feel like it is a waste of time. What if in the end it isn't what they wanted ? 3 years gone. 3 years have gone for me too.. I am changing so much haha. Experiencing in so many fields and still have no idea what I want. Maybe it would be different if I had a family of my own. I would probably choose wealth for their comfort and I am thinking about the future future  but I don't want to waste my life here.."

There has always been an imbalance when it comes to our ambition levels. I had summer internships throughout college and turned one of them into a job. He lived with his parents for 15 months after grad and didn't have a job of any kind.

I confronted him on several occasions during that time about getting his life together. He initially criticized me because, in his words, I was being overly demanding. Eventually he caved and moved to the city I live in, and has worked as a server at a restaurant for about 9 months now. But he doesn't care to look for a job that requires a college degree, he doesn't care to network, and he won't seriously consider going back to school.

I tried to lay everything out for him last night: This is still bothering me, and I've tried to help you move in the right direction but you don't seem to be getting anywhere. I'll admit I was pretty harsh because I was frustrated. He mostly just listened, then got up, said ""if you wanted to make me feel like shit, you succeeded,"" left the room, and slept on the couch. 

Tonight I've tried to give him the chance to talk about it, and the only thing he's said is ""what do you want me to say?"" Other than that he has completely shut down and refused to engage in a conversation at all. Now he's pretending to be asleep.

I feel like it's not asking a lot for him to take this conversation about his future seriously, and I feel like I shouldn't have to tell him what to say - he is an adult. But am I being overly demanding here? Anyone have advice about how to approach my bf about his future?

6hbxgu,1,2017-06-14,Destressing,Mjhendaddy,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6hbxgu/destressing/,"Hey all, hope everyone is doing good. I have lurked this sub for a few weeks now and it has truly touched my heart. I love how real, kind, and determined the people are here. I'm posting because I have a question I'm hoping someone can provide some insight on. 
So anyways, to briefly sum the situation up, I have been sober for the past 35 or so days. During this time I started an internship which is my first full time job as well as the first job I've actually had to use my brain for. This combination on top of having to learn a million different things from a million different people has been super stressful. In the past I'd simply remedy this with some alcohol or maybe a little pot. I feel like this style of coping has now left me pretty crippled when it comes to naturally dealing with stress. Don't get me wrong, I lift weights/exercise daily and have several hobbies I enjoy which definitely help. I just feel like my innate ability to cope with stress is significantly lacking. My question is, does this ability to innately deal with stress improve? I am absolutely determined to stay sober regardless but I'm just curious if things will get better. Thank you all so much for reading, and all thoughts/advice/insight is greatly appreciated. God bless. "

6hcfgr,8,2017-06-14,The feeling just before the trip,GingerPolarBear,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/6hcfgr/the_feeling_just_before_the_trip/,"The day finally arrived that I get to travel again. I´ll be travelling all around South America for the next year or so. i´ve been wanting to do this trip for years and couldn´t be more happy right now. In an hour my parents and sister are going to drive me to the airport and within 5 hours I´ll be gone. I finished packing last night and my bag is only about 12 kilo, but somehow that is more than enough. I bought a new camera, a new laptop, a new phone and some new clothes. I don´t think there is anything I could be missing anymore. 

It´s a weird feeling though. Except for some arguements I´m perfectly happy at home. I finished by Bachelors degree a few months ago, have very supporting parents, an amazing group of friends, got my sport and family close. And I´ll have to miss all of that during this trip. I´ve been gone twice before, once for an Erasmus semester and once for an international internship, but this is different. 

Something I didn´t seem to have before is the fear of missing out. My group of friends is pretty big and I live in a close knit community anyway. There are so many things going on in the summer that it´ll suck a bit to not be there. It makes me a little sad, because I´ve missed some amazing stuff before, but not on this scale. I´m not sure when I´m actually even going to be back. 

Last Saturday we organized a football (soccer) tournament at my local club for 21 18+ teams. The club is literally only 50 meter away from my house and I joined the club 17 years ago. It's my second home basically. The tournament was amazing, there were about 350 to 400 people and it was sunny all day long. The atmosphere was great and the tournament is actually the main reason why I didn't travel earlier. Two days ago I invited about 20 friends for a goodbye drink and it was as relaxed and funny as ever. 

I'm not even sure what I was hoping this post to be, but I mainly just wanted to express my thoughts. I'm super excited, but also a bit reserved for if things aren't as fun as I hoped them to be. I know that there will be times that will not be as I hoped them to be, but not sure how I'll cope with that."

6he5qr,4,2017-06-15,Post Apocalypse (A short story following the actions of the post office after an apocalypse. It's a pun.),ScwertlDude,PostApocalypticStuff,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostApocalypticStuff/comments/6he5qr/post_apocalypse_a_short_story_following_the/,"The world had suffered; humanity had suffered; the post office had suffered. Most of the staff had survived but the clients had not. The postal staff were close friends and had banded together to form the strongest bastion they could. Using sacks of now obsolete letters as sandbags, they had fortified the single entrance to near impenetrable standards. Soon, however, after the post bunker had been completed, other groups had formed treaties and coalitions meaning that the post boys weren’t the biggest dogs in town anymore but they were players. 

Everyone knew that the current relative peace could not last; soon the emerging settlements would become hostile to one another and while the post office could repel disorganised raids, a fully planned assault would be another matter entirely. As such the postal staff were franticly deciding who to side with in the coming war. That was until one young intern, spoke up with a radical idea. 
“What if we don’t pick a side?”
	“Then everyone’ll come crashing down on our heads, lad,” explained one of the older employees, “We can’t hold off four armies and a fifth of mercenaries; we’d need a bloody miracle to deal with one!”
	“It was just a-” whimpered the intern before being interrupted by The Post Master, descending the grand stairs and walking toward where the staff were huddled around a table of conflicting ideas.
	“No, Hutchins, let the boy speak,” At this, the intern reluctantly repeated his idea. The Post Master pondered this for a moment, several in fact, perhaps more than necessary. “I like it, Jim was it? Well done, Jim! Round of applause for Jim, everyone.” 
	“It’s Dave, actually,” said Jim, to no one in particular. No one heard anyway, as they were too busy staring at The Post Master as if he were mad.

After a short while Hutchins lost his patience. Everyone knew he had; he was calm.
“Are you suggesting, sir, that we play Switzerland in this war?” the Master replied, equally calm,
“Not exactly, Hutchins, but yes true neutrality. Although we will not be idle during the conflict; we will do what we should have done to begin with-” now he was met with a chorus of suggestions as to what they should have done to begin with. These included but were not limited to:
“Run away,”
“Join one-eye’s scavvers”
“Fake our own deaths by blowing up the office”
This chaos continued until Jim guessed the right answer. Unfortunately, once again, no one heard him, this time because they were all yelling over each other and he had a generally quiet voice, so, the chaos continued. When it finally did subside, The Post Master revealed his plan.
	“What are we?” This time everyone got the answer first try. “Yes, WE… ARE… POSTMEN! What is it that the world lost? Order? Government? NO! It lost the ability to communicate; we shall be the ones who end this war before it begins, by helping the leaders of each faction to settle their differences PEACEFULLY. We will deliver notes. We will deliver messages of negotiation. Failing that, we will deliver declarations of WAR!” he felt the need to clarify after his stunning speech that they would not be their own declarations of war.

People were restless. They needed something they could rely on. They needed the DELIVERERS! No that wasn’t it. MAIL MEN! Surely that would be the one, it even alliterated, but no it wasn’t quite right. A master plan is fine, it’s the execution that takes the effort. It would be worth it though, everyone knew. The plan in question was to go to every major settlement and ask for weapons, with which to defend the mail, which in return would be delivered. But you couldn’t just show up without a uniform, people did need something they could rely on. A small cohort of the postal staff had been set the task of designing the uniform and deciding the name of the elite force of couriers that would be produced. One member of this cohort was, of course, Jim, who seemed to always be in just the right place at just the right time; he had taken a break from the shout-fest that was the design room. When he returned, he returned triumphantly, well he tried to. And he deserved to because he had found the perfect uniform. It was the old uniform, preserved perfectly. Hutchins who was also assigned to the design team, took one look and fell into a deep nostalgic trance. He had been a courier in his youth; the boy in front of him was himself, taken from the past and placed here for a reason. That reason was clear now. When Hutchins regained consciousness, he found himself furiously scribbling an up armoured version of the old uniform: a leather plate here… a strap here… a belt…
	“Done.” He declared, proud of his handiwork. 

The uniforms looked, for lack of a better word, awesome. They were serious; Hutchins had deliberately left the text on the reverse of the uniform exposed: POSTMAN. It meant something. And it would mean more. It would mean neutrality. It would mean reliability. And Jim would lead them… Once Hutchins had told him…
	“Are you mad? Look at me! I’m not post apocalypse material! I only survived this long because you took me in!” Needless to say, Jim did not want to lead the Postmen.
	“Come on, lad, at least try on the armour would you?” Hutchins hoped that the promise of making an old man’s day would persuade him. It did. Jim put on the uniform and Hutchins was content. He could die knowing he had made a difference. But he would make far more difference in the days, months and years to come. Jim watched as his tailor glazed over, in another world of thought; Jim went to find a mirror, unaware that he would walk out into a corridor full of his colleagues. Their jaws dropped. Jim walk slowly forward, unsure whether this surreal experience was, in fact a real experience. He continued cautiously towards The Post Master, who stood, smiling at the end of the corridor, holding a mirror. 

Jim didn’t take off that armour all day; He felt like a different man: presence, confidence, Postman. He had picked most of the Postmen. He had one slot left. And now he had to decide. Robert: a hulking mass of muscle with very few academic skills, or Hutchins. Jim decided it was the only logical choice, after all, he had plenty of other muscle.

Despite the fact you may have been expecting a shorter story, this is only the beginning…

The postmen will return in:

I met my GF when she came down from overseas to do an internship. It was electric from the word go and we were head over heels for each other within the first 2 weeks.

There were always red flags that said she might not be stable, but I saw through it to be with her because it just felt so right. Now I'm about to fly to her for 3 months in 2 weeks and she's saying ""I've decided I'm not ready for a relationship, I'm enjoying doing me too much to settle down"".

I've quit my job, moved out of my house, bought my plane ticket, said a lot of goodbyes and here I am with my dick in my hands. We've agreed to try for a month and if she decides it's not what she wants, I'm coming back here and starting afresh. Is it worth trying or am I just pissing in the wind?

I am an intern at a game developer and for several weeks I've been using my own ASUS Republic of Gamers laptop to do my developing. It is certainly powerful enough for the activities in question, however roughly every 5 seconds or so things would stutter when Unity was in playmode.

After some amount of effort, I was able to narrow down the source to a single program. It was the ""ROG GameFirst III Service (32 bit)"" aka ""AsusGameFirstService"".

Googling around, this seems to be a program that attempts to prioritize assets for games, or something to that effect. Apparently there are some games that this program has been known to interfere with (Mount and Blade, etc) in a similar way.

Shutting down the process involves no risk as (unfortunately?) it will restart when your computer does.

Part of my searching indicates that this program is often included in prebuilt laptops/desktops with an ASUS motherboard, so if you are experiencing weird stuttering in your playmode, then doing a quick check in the task manager for this program might be worthwhile to check.

Hope this helps anyone!"

I wasn't sure if this was the right place to post this but my fingers are crossed, so if it's not just ignore me lol. If formatting is bad apologies, I'm on mobile. 

So basically I'm in a pretty crappy situation. I have one year left in my program at college where I'm majoring in English. The problem is I'm majoring in English. I live in a very expensive county outside of a large metropolitan area that has a very competitive job market. Now, I'm a very hard working and determined individual so you'd think it would be easy for me to find a job right? Wrong. Because of living and financial situations I've been unable to keep up with my peers. I've had zero internships and have no experience in my field. My GPA has also suffered greatly because of time constraints. 

But what's the big deal you ask, since I'm only 20 and have a supporting family to pay my bills for me, right? :( Unfortunately that's the wrong assumption. My living situation right now is that I am the sole provider for both myself and my mother. Long story short, my dad is an abusive POS. Fortunately he signed off on leaving me his GI Bill benefits before cutting me and my mother off (she has no income, was a homemaker for 23 years, got no money in the divorce) so I haven't had to worry about rent the past three years. After this next semester those benefits run out. I won't go into specifics because my rent+bills are ungodly expensive and I know what everyone will say about those and I'm aware of my mistake of signing a two year lease (I'm young and naive what can I say). Fortunately, I was able to work my way from a minimum wage position to a salaried position at my lousy fast food job within 6 months of starting and will be able to scrape by without starving to death my last semester. 

My main point of worry is post-graduation existence. I see so many people finding these jobs like it's super easy, but how!? I'm starting to feel desperate to be honest. Unlike everyone else who has had all of the time in the world to have 5+ internships over the span of their academic career I've spent the last three years delivering sandwiches and flipping burgers just so I can make sure my mom has food to eat. I feel like I have no useful skills, and now I'm trapped in a position where I'm required to work 45+ hours a week just to survive. I've tried freelancing to get myself out there, but to no avail. Breaking into freelance writing/editing seems just as impossible as getting a job. I don't want to end up working in fast food management for the rest of my life, I might actually rather die. What are my options? Were you guys able to get jobs with somewhat okay pay and benefits with nothing more than a mediocre bachelor's degree? How did you manage it, and how do you feel about your work now? I know this sounds like a dumb question, but no one in my family has ever had a white collar job so I feel in the dark completely. I feel like this semester is my last chance since it's the last time I won't have to pay rent. It feels like If I don't find something better now I'll be stuck at this miserable job forever. 

Financially, I feel I'll be okay, but barely skating by. I have my ridiculous rent, a car payment, insurance on two cars, bills and food for two people, all on 35K (before taxes...) a year but if all goes as planned I'll be moved to 50k +monthly bonuses by the end of the year if I can stay sane long enough to stay at this job. I mean, from a financial point of view the smart thing would probably be to stay at this job since I have a head start moving towards a good salary at only 20. But is it worth it to sell your soul for financial comfort? I want to do what's best for my mom, but I don't know if I'm capable of being the stoic, selfless person I should be. I've learned a few things at this job such as basic accounting like P&amp;L maintenance, invoicing, some HR (hiring, pay negotiation etc), and things like budget allocation and scheduling, but those all seem pretty useless and inapplicable to ""real"" jobs. Other than that all I can do is read, write, and research fairly well.  Putting together a resume is just embarrassing. How do you make a resume out of nothing haha. I know this was a jumble mess of thoughts, I guess I'm just really scared. If it were just me I'd be okay with living in a destitute hut eating ramen everyday if I got to do work I enjoyed, but I also have to make sure my mom is well taken care of always. I suppose I'm looking for someday to balance that in my currently bad situation. Sorry for the length of this, and thanks in advance for any and all advice/input. 

Tl;dr: 20 years old, sole provider for myself and mother. Make 35k a year as a manager in fast food but miserable, about to have BA in English which seems worthless in a competitive job market and am clueless how to move into the real world job market because entire family never got past high school/mostly joined military, and I've spent whole time in school working so no internships etc. Looking for advice on job market for people who appear less than average on paper/on life/ everything. 

Edit: I want to thank everyone for the advice and encouragement given. I did not at all expect this much feedback, and even had a few people reach out to me personally. And to those who focused on the negative, thanks for motivating me to prove you wrong! This whole thread was a great help to me and has provided me with so many resources and ideas that the future seems much more optimistic than it did when I made this post earlier today. Thanks so much everyone!"

- I love how Cristina literally kicks Meredith out of bed.
- Wednesday Addams and Coach Taylor are in the building!
- Burke likes Addison but not Derek?
- Milton guy freaking Cristina Ricci out with his pink mist talk. Who does that? Oh, let me scare the crap out of you and then bail.
- Bailey refusing to have her baby always seemed out of character to me.
- By doer, Izzie meant doing Alex
- Meredith, wyd? Is it really a good idea to stick your finger there?
- I get that it’s Bailey’s husband but Derek’s arrogance infuriated me here.
- Cristina’s parting words…”Burke, BTDubs, be a coward. Run away.”
- Does it make me a hypocrite that I didn’t sympathize with Milton but totally felt for Wednesday Addams? I don’t blame her for panicking and taking her hand out.
- Aww, Burke hearts Cristina and she hearts him too.
- “The girl with the bomb is Meredith.” Way to kill Bailey’s husband, Cristina.
- Not Coach Taylor! Nooo!
- I didn’t buy Burke and Derek’s camaraderie at the end. They weren’t working alongside each other. In fact, Derek’s refusal to leave the OR was more of a hindrance than anything. In my book, he didn’t earn the privilege of being on a first name basis with Burke.
- And Derek and Meredith still love each other. Yada yada yada. 
- Meredith is gonna have some stories to tell her kids. “There was this one time I was holding a bomb in this guy’s chest…”

6hffwf,5,2017-06-15,My [22F] boyfriend [22M] is really indecisive and it's starting to concern me...,letsthrowthisawayyay,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hffwf/my_22f_boyfriend_22m_is_really_indecisive_and_its/,"Hey r/relationships, I have a question/rant for you.

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year. We both graduated in May and he found an internship that's a ~7 hour drive away while I'm staying back to continue working at my job for the rest of the summer before I start looking for a ""real"" job.

I've been trying to plan for my future, but he's having none of it. I want to know the timeline of when he thinks he'll be ready to move in but every time I ask he's just like ""uhh idk"" and won't really have a conversation about it. All he really told me was he talked to his parents about it, and his mom wants us to wait longer until we move in together... 

His parents are a little older, and very traditional. I think they like me but they live kind of far away so I haven't been around them a ton. His brother and his brother's girlfriend just moved in together a year ago after dating for 4-5 years... and I think that's what his mother expects out of us too. He straight up told me, ""yeah that's not going to happen, that's ridiculous"" when I brought it up, so I guess there's that. But I've read enough of here and r/JustNoMIL to know the dark path this could take...

The thing is, there are two ways this seems to go: he gets hired at his internship and stays the same distance we are now, or he does not get hired and starts looking at jobs in California. He's said repeatedly if he goes to California that he wants us to move in together because cost/distance/etc (we're East coast), and said it again when I brought it up a few days ago. The problem is I'm 80% sure he'll get hired at his internship (which is his dream job in his dream location) but he refuses to talk about what we would do if that happens because he's scared he won't get hired there.

I'm just at a loss. I'm not *trying* to plan my life around where he goes, but there's no jobs in my field where I'm currently living and I really have no interest in moving somewhere alone... We're in similar fields, so living with him would mean both I'm not alone and I'll have a better chance at finding a job I love. He said in an ideal world I would just move to where his internship is but live in a different apartment, which is ridiculous to me because we spend so much time together anyway that one of us would be paying for an empty apartment. I also won't be able to afford $700/mo rent when I'm paying back my student loans. I'm pretty sure it's not even because he doesn't want to move in together (when we were living together for that month he always talked about how great it was) and more because he's afraid of what his parents will say.

The thing is, I wouldn't even mind waiting a little longer if that's what *he* needs. But he won't tell me what he needs and instead defers back to his mom and won't give me a timeline other than ""sometime before the 4 year mark of dating.""

So I guess what I'm asking is: am I being unreasonable? Is he? What should I do?

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend won't talk about the future of our relationship which isn't letting me think about my future."

My middle sister (MS) is 20, and my youngest brother (YB) is 18.  Starting with me, and over the course of our lives, my mother has slowly but surely put all the pieces in place to guarantee that none of the three of us will maintain a close relationship with her after we strike out on our own. I’m sorry in advance for this length, but I just wanted to share a few vignettes explaining why.


I’ll start with me, cause that’s the shortest. My relationship with my mom can be best described as death by a thousand cuts. She’s never done any single super egregious thing, but many little things that built up a ton of resentment over the years. For example: her favorite activity of all time when I was a younger teen was to suddenly ban me from going out, as I was leaving, for really arbitrary reasons. It happened constantly, and I missed out on so many events because I hadn’t finished doing the laundry that day, or my room wasn’t clean, or I had given her an attitude earlier. I blame this in part for why I never managed to keep any close friends in high school, and why I get so anxious about making sure my apartment is clean.


The worst example I can recall is the time I decided to throw myself an informal birthday party at a local ice skating rink. I was a freshman at a high school where I came in knowing nobody, and I have an October birthday. So, I really didn’t know any of the people I invited very well. They were kids I just wanted to become better friends with. It was maybe 15 minutes before everyone was due to show, and right when we were about to leave she freaked out because my bedroom wasn’t spotless. I was grounded, and had to call every person individually to tell them not to come. Most of them were really confused when I explained why, and a couple people who had arrived early were pretty pissed off – and it wasn’t just the kids, it was the parents who’d driven them. Needless to say, none of those people became good friends of mine, and I later heard rumors about my crazy controlling mom that I believe originated that day.


My siblings, though, have it much worse than me. I manage to stay off the radar for the most part nowadays because I learned how to avoid her games, and now all I really have to be upset about is the conversation we’ll have to have in the very near future when I move in with my boyfriend of 3.5 years in July (GASP!!!!! THE SIN!!!!! THINK OF THE SIN!!!!!). I already know to expect some terrible comments but I really don’t know what the fallout will be. Ugh. Anyway…


MS told me a year ago she planned on cutting Mom out of her life the second she graduates, and as far as I’m aware her plan hasn’t changed. This is interesting, because while I don’t think my mom is a full blown narcissist she sure does have a favorite. MS has always been the golden child because she was born too early and almost died, and that’s basically meant that she doesn’t ever face consequences for anything. Like getting expelled from our high school for selling drugs, or getting caught a year later selling drugs again, or even searching for a job (parents do all the calling, not her).

The way they punish her is by taking away her phone and laptop/grounding her, but they ALWAYS cave after a couple days because of how saaaaad she is. They let her go out partying less than a week after she got expelled because “she’s so depressed and she’ll miss her friends when she goes to a new school, we’re being too cruel by keeping her away from them.” Yeah… Like they weren’t the influences that got her expelled in the first place…


Now, all that sounds like a good deal for MS, right? Nope. Because my mom acts like my sister should have learned her lessons, and does not understand that shielding her from bad things actually didn’t make her into a considerate and thoughtful person. Mom doesn’t understand why MS parties all night and never wants to hang out with her, and thinks that by forcing MS to follow ridiculously childish rules that she can retroactively make her learn responsibility. 


MS is almost 21 and goes to college with me, 9 hours from home. Nevertheless, she has a GPS tracker on her phone at all times, that Mom checks and will call her about. Mom also makes her send pictures of the rooms she’s in at random times of day. This summer, she forced MS to come home after she found (with my help) a good internship in her field here, because they wanted to keep a closer eye on her. She has to comply because they threaten to take away her rent and tuition money, and every time they make that threat she gets closer to just letting them do it.


The whole MS situation is sad because it’s way too late to make a difference, and all they’re doing by forcing her to do these things is continuing to infantilize her and prevent her from taking any control over her life. I don’t think any of this will end well for any of them, but as of yet it’s ongoing.


I’m almost done, I swear. So, on to YB, the baby of the family. He has always been the most Pro-Mom of the three of us. He’d always snitch on us older siblings as a small kid, and MS and I learned how to be as sneaky as we are because we couldn’t trust him not to get us in trouble (for things like hanging out with the Neighbor Kid she didn’t like, nothing like actually criminal or bad. MS and I used to be a couple of squares). For a long time, I actually couldn’t really bear to talk to him about her because he’d instantly jump to her defense, even with really indefensible stuff. But recently, the tide has finally begun turning. This is the incident that prompted me to make this post.


YB will be attending a college in the same town as MS and I, but not the same one as us. His is an all-boys school, so his roommate is a dude. Now, Mom and Dad are the type of people who think that because they’re not in the KKK or advocating for the death of gays, that that makes them not racist or homophobic. But they rant about thugs ruining America and gay people spreading confusion, so… I don’t exactly agree with that assessment. 


YB has known the person who’s going to be his roommate for a while now, they’re friends and attend the same high school. YB also knows that Future Roommate is bisexual; he’s out and proud about it on social media, so it’s not really a secret. Mom did not know this, until the other day when she was creeping on people’s FB profiles as she likes to do. She saw Future Roommate’s profile, and scrolled through his pics. He was evidently dating a boy at some point, because apparently one of his profile pics featured him getting smooched by the aforementioned date. Mom. Lost. Her. MIND.

I started getting frantic messages from YB while I was at work. Asking me if I could call him, and when I did he sounded like he’d been crying. Mom had informed him that he wasn’t allowed to have a gay roommate because what if he gets raped??? What if the roommate confuses him into thinking he’s gay too??? The HORROR!!!! Naturally YB is like wtf that’s not how that works, he knows that Future Roommate isn’t into him (YB isn’t his type lol), but Mom won’t hear of it. Now, it’s too late in the housing process to switch roommates, they’d have to wait until after moving in. But that doesn’t matter to Mom. If YB moves in with a gay man, she’ll take away his tuition.


I told him to call her bluff and just do it anyway. He said that the argument kind of ended without resolution, but that she’s been being super cold and mean to him in the few days since. He posted about it on a forum (not reddit) and asserted that she wasn’t actually homophobic, and boy did those commenters give it to him. They gave him a great perspective on what kind of a person our mom is and how he rugsweeps her shit, and it opened his eyes for the very first time!!! He admitted to me that he doesn’t agree with her opinions all the time, and that he has lost a lot of respect for her because of this. I’d never heard him say anything that critical of her before, ever, so this was huge for him.


So, there you have it. My mom says all the time that she dedicated her whole life to us and doesn’t live for anyone but us. It makes me really, really sad to think that she feels that way but that none of her kids feel anything close to that for her. I still haven’t really reconciled who she is with who I wish she was, and I feel like I’ll need to go to therapy at some point just to work out all my feelings on this. And I’ve got the lightest burden of the three of us. I can’t even imagine what MS and YB will have to deal with... 


I love my mom. But I don’t respect a word she says anymore, or any of the decisions she makes. The cognitive dissonance is really messing me and my siblings up, and venting about it like this really helps. So, if you made it this far, thanks for reading.  "
6hg1n7,1,2017-06-15,Negotiating pay increase at job?,skammaks,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6hg1n7/negotiating_pay_increase_at_job/,"I am quite disappointed with my company. I previously worked at this company for 9 months as a temp (contracted through Robert Half – Officeteam. However, my contract with Officeteam has completed and now the company wants to hire me full time. I was so excited. This would mean that I would start earning good money and benefits. (A while back, I found out from my boss that they paid the temp agency $23/hr for my labor. I only received $13/hr. So my total compensation was worth $23/hr. I feel like I was taken advantage of. Why does the temp agency get to take so much money? Meanwhile, I get so little and no benefits/sick time/vacation/etc… 

Anyways, I was promised that I would start working as a full time employee—not as a temp. I was so excited that I would start earning good money and benefits. Earlier I learned that this “full time” employment would be an internship for a specific amount of hours (Let’s say approximately 6 months). I feel like this is an attempt at not paying me any benefits. Nevertheless, I will be receiving a substantial raise of $5/hr totaling $18/hr. However, this is still low compared to what the temp agency set as the wage ($23/hr). After all, $18/hr is only $553.64/wk (post-tax), or $28,789.28/yr (post-tax). If I ask for $23/hr, I would significantly more. More specifically, $681.09/wk (post-tax), or $35416.68/yr (post-tax). 

The issue is that I am considered an intern. I most likely have almost zero negotiating power when asking for a higher wage. So asking for a higher wage when already given a $5/hr raise feels like a scummy thing to do. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not ungrateful or anything. I am grateful for the raise; however, if the temp agency can ask for $23/hr, then I should be able to as well. 

I’m kind of scared to negotiate my pay. It might be too high, but idk. What if they revoke my internship offer and find someone else for less? If I don’t get my desired wage of around $23/hr, can I negotiate for different benefits/perks? (such as tuition reimbursement for grad school, part time work schedule starting in September-due to grad school). What else can I ask for? Is it better to just take the offer at $18/hr? Thank you.   

EDIT: I do data management, Excel reports, Policy/SOP writing and revisions, SharePoint organization, and other administrative tasks.

TL;DR: I haven't dealt with much in terms of web security before, just upload basic sites through filezilla ftp. Where do I start to be able to know more about web security from basics to advanced?

I'm in need of some guidance. I have been making websites for 3ish years now just basic stuff for family and local things, sites that have no need for high attention to detail when it comes to security. Now I am at an Internship that wants to move from one CMS to Wordpress. It's for a University and I have to convince the IT/Security people to allow the department I work for to switch our site over. 

Convincing them shouldn't be the hard part, but they will make me go through a process every time I want to get a plugin approved and other stuff. I'm used to just uploading sites through filezilla using ftp, and I know just enough to do that. I'm not sure what kind of vulnerabilities they will be looking for and want to know more so I can have more freedom to how I develop and actually improve my practices so I'm aware of security measures that need to be taken. 

Where can I start to educate myself on web security and wordpress security so that I know how everything actually works instead of just getting by?"
6hgmx0,6,2017-06-15,I [21M] feel like breaking up with my girlfriend [23F] of 7 months is the only way forward.,freakierchicken,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hgmx0/i_21m_feel_like_breaking_up_with_my_girlfriend/,"This post is going to be a bit ramble-y so check the TL;DR at the bottom if you want. 

So we'll start out by saying this is my first real relationship. It seemed great at first; we were having fun and it was generally a good time.

Due to certain circumstances, after a couple months she had to move in with me (not something I was super stoked about) and that was about 4 months ago. She basically didn't want to live with her roommates and was looking for a place, so I offered. She was still on the hook for rent at the other place so she's basically been rent free here. 

Now as a background - she's from a strict ethnic household, grew up with two brothers and her parents pay for a lot of stuff. I on the other hand was raised by a single mother, never went without but was never as privileged and we had a pretty laid back household. 

The problems started a couple months after she moved in. Look, I'm not perfect. This is my first real relationship (we've talked about the future) but from the get go, we agreed to be communicative, work through our problems, and make an effort in the relationship. 

At this point, she gets mad at me most days. To me, and the people I've talked about it to, it's over small things  like: putting her clothes on the bed when so I can do laundry when she's left those clothes in there for 3 days, cleaning up and accidentally moving her stuff after she cooks huge meals for herself and her friends while I'm at work and cant eat anything, etc. 

I've dealt with severe depression and anxiety for about 4 years now. A lot of times when I'm stressed, I'll tell her like ""hey give me like ten minutes to cool off"" or something like that so I don't accidentally take my day out on her or something. Last night, she had a rough night at work and was basically shouting while telling me about it, stressing me out. I just got a puppy and we've been crate training her. She was stressed out too and I moved her food bowl out of her crate so she would eat it and ten minutes later my girlfriend starts screaming and huffing at me because I ""ruined all the hard work she's been putting in the past two weeks, all of it is out the window.""

Like I said, sometimes I do some kinda dumb stuff but I mean well. I try to be as kind and amicable as I can, and keep things cheery. It's so hard when she's around because she gets so frustrated with things that I say and do that other people I know all do. 

I loved her but now I think I don't. I can't see any way back from where we are. I don't complain about what she does, like leave my apartment trashed (even though she knows it stresses me out), having her friends invade my space (walked in one day and her bff was in my bed - they were watching tv), not telling me when she has stuff over, calling her stuff hers but my stuff is ""ours"", etc.

Other things- 

She never admits she's wrong, even though I have to say it most days or we'll just be fighting all night

She wants me to change everything but never commits to changing herself

She expects me to treat her like a princess (i try) and expect nothing in return (she said this)

Look, I try to  look at the bright side but we've only been dating six months. She has huge issues with me and when I try to explain what I'm going through she blows it off. She's got a summer internship where she'll be out of town every weekday for like three months and then she graduates in December and expects me to move away with her. I've got a little brother and a life here. I'm only 21. I just feel like this isn't viable and I would be stupid to be in this. 

I know I've left a lot of stuff out but I'm kinda having an anxiety attack right now and just wanted to get all this off my chest. If you have questions I'll answer, and if nobody reads it that's ok to, I still put it out there.

TL;DR: girlfriend of 7 months is becoming real controlling, doesn't respect me or want to be equals in the relationship, is real hypocritical and has huge issues with me most days. I feel like I can't be in this relationship anymore and I don't think I want to."

 by Dominic Tierney via Master Feed : The Atlantic

If you’re an embattled head of state, deflecting criticism through foreign adventure carries seductive appeal: Outside threats can cause people to pull together. As King Henry IV [advises](http://ift.tt/2sxqRdE) his son Hal, the future king, in Shakespeare’s _Henry IV, Part 2:_busy giddy minds
   
 With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
   
 May waste the memory of the former days.

What better way to patch over domestic discord than to take on a common enemy?

In the real world, many historians [interpret](http://ift.tt/2t6T4oz) the Crimean War of 1853-1856 as an effort by French Emperor Louis Napoleon to buttress his support among French Catholics by fighting the Orthodox Russians. Karl Marx [wrote](http://ift.tt/2ts2J8m) that the emperor “has no alternative left but revolution at home or war abroad.” In 1857, President James Buchanan sent troops to reassert federal control over the Mormon regime in Utah, and in the [words](http://ift.tt/2t6XDPD) of one confidant, drown out “the pipings of Abolitionism” with the “almost universal excitement of an Anti-Mormon Crusade.” Shortly after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904,  the Russian minister of the interior [said](http://ift.tt/2sxdQAA): “We need a little, victorious war to stem [the tide of] revolution.”

In the summer of 1998, at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Bill Clinton [confessed](http://ift.tt/2t6X88c) on television that his romantic relationship with a White House intern amounted to “a critical lapse in judgment … a personal failure.” Three days later, with his presidency hanging in the balance, the administration announced airstrikes against suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan, following the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Many observers [claimed](http://ift.tt/2sxxdcG) that Clinton had launched a classic diversionary war, or a use of force to sidetrack the media, whip up patriotic sentiment, and boost approval ratings. One journalist [asked](http://ift.tt/2t6O2Z0) Secretary of Defense William Cohen if he had seen the 1997 movie _Wag the Dog_, in which the White House fabricates a war to distract attention from the president’s dalliance with a young girl. Cohen said the only goal of the strikes, “was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from terrorist activities.”

Today, some critics claim that Donald Trump will adopt a version of the _Wag the Dog_strategy, and launch an _actual_major conflict to deflect attention from the growing Russia scandal. In the Daily Beast, Michael Tomasky [outlined](http://ift.tt/2pVz9XT) a number of dangerous scenarios for a “caged and cornered animal” like Trump, the first being that he “tries to start a war,” perhaps against North Korea. Distraction is indeed at the core of Trump’s foreign policy—but its role is far more subtle and broadly applied.

At present, the Trump administration finds itself caught in just the sort of storm of circumstance that could lure it into a diversionary foreign policy. Trump certainly has a motive to busy giddy minds, given the FBI’s investigation into collusion between his campaign and Russia, as well as approval ratings mired in the 30s. Because the president of the United States has a relatively free hand to use force, Trump also has the opportunity to divert attention. (The White House can’t impose its will on healthcare, but it can unilaterally launch airstrikes.)

In addition, Trump has an unparalleled capacity to dominate the news. He may be the most famous person ever to stroll the earth, or at least ride a golf cart. In January, by [one account](http://ift.tt/2lF0Nc1), Trump received more media coverage than the next 1,000-most famous people _put together_.

On top of this, distraction has been a staple of Trump’s political strategy since he declared his intention to run for president. When negative stories arise, his instinct is to seize the narrative with bold, even outlandish, claims—accusing Barack Obama of wiretapping the phones in Trump Tower, for example. If the diversion sets off another firestorm, the solution is further deflection, like a magician whose first trick goes up in smoke and then immediately begins performing a new illusion.

Trump has the flexibility to pursue a diversionary foreign policy because he lacks a clear diplomatic doctrine. In some policy areas, such trade and immigration, he has been consistent. But his positions on issues of war and peace have been highly mutable—he was for the Iraq war and then against it, pro-intervention in Libya before opposing this course of action, and largely indecipherable on Afghanistan. This gives him greater latitude to deploy smoke and mirrors when opportunities arise.

What are the core elements of a diversionary foreign policy? First of all, diplomatic moves should be attention-grabbing, symbolic, and popular, particularly among the base. The smartest diversionary actions also have some substantive merit, precisely so the true agenda is harder to spot. After all, giddy minds shouldn’t know they’ve been busied.

Ultimately, it’s not what the foreign policy _does_that matters, but what people _think_it does: the myths it creates, the stories it weaves, the narratives it reinforces. In Trump’s case, the tale is one of dark enemies and unscrupulous allies. His diplomacy seeks to establish a narrative of America First, a commitment to protect the U.S. homeland even if—or _especially_if—it irritates global elites.

Seen through this lens, much of Trump’s behavior seems designed to distract, however clumsily. Just consider the diversionary tweets. The president has repeatedly picked fights for his own political benefit by, for example, [criticizing](http://ift.tt/2sxgA18) London mayor Sadiq Khan and taking his words out of context to make him appear weak on terrorism. Trump may see Khan, a foreign Muslim, as an ideal foil given the [embrace](http://ift.tt/2t79Dk7) of anti-Muslim attitudes among some in the Republican party.

And then there’s Trump’s diversionary staging. When he decided to withdraw America from the Paris climate deal, he could have given other nations maximum lead time to help them handle the fallout. Instead, he hyped up his forthcoming announcement, leading to frenzied debate about whether the United States would stay or go, as if his sole concern was to boost ratings on a reality television show.

But what about military force? To be clear, there is little cause to speculate that Trump plans to launch a full-scale war solely to distract attention. For one thing, as president, the worst possible time to start a major military campaign is when you’re deeply unpopular. And the political upside is shaky at best. Recent big wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were politically damaging to George W. Bush. Even victory doesn’t guarantee a pay-off, as George H. W. Bush discovered when he won the 1991 Gulf War and then lost his bid for reelection in 1992.

A crisis may arise where there are real national-security rationales for fighting, along with potential domestic gains. Here, the payoff at home would likely enter Trump’s calculus, and even push him over the edge to fight, with the legitimate _casus belli_providing a shield of plausible deniability.

The most tempting use of force may be a seemingly manageable, but still dazzling, kinetic operation, like a missile strike or a raid to kill terrorist leaders. Another option would be to escalate a crisis where an easy win seems available: The key is to find the right enemy, one that’s both widely hated and too weak to fight back. After all, there’s a well-established [“rally ‘round the flag”](http://ift.tt/1JqaXRW) effect, where almost any military crisis temporarily juices the president’s approval ratings. In the wake of Clinton’s airstrikes in 1998, one [poll](http://ift.tt/2t6Xz2q) found that 68 percent of Americans approved of his foreign policy. Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich [said](http://ift.tt/2sxbnWP), “it was the right thing to do at the right time.”

In a hyper-partisan era like today, military operations offer one of the few avenues by which Trump could win backing from both sides of the aisle. In April, the White House launched airstrikes against the Syrian regime, following its use of chemical weapons, and won praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. Trump’s sudden decision to attack Damascus, after years of railing against such a move, struck many as suspicious, or, in Philip Gordon’s [words](http://ift.tt/2oL5wLS), “yet another effort by the president to distract the media’s attention and change the subject from his problems at home.”

But diversionary uses of force are highly risky, and can just as easily exacerbate domestic problems. In 1982, the military regime in Argentina invaded the British Falkland Islands in a bid to overcome its deep unpopularity at home. U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig later [wrote](http://ift.tt/2sxnTWo) that there “was a widespread impression that the junta was creating a foreign distraction to give itself a respite from domestic economic problems, including severe inflation.” Crucially, the regime never intended to wage a war. Buenos Aires was certain that Britain wouldn’t fight for a few islands 8,000 miles away. But Margaret Thatcher was indeed ready for a fight; Argentina lost the war, and the junta was soon kicked out of office.

The benefits of a diversionary foreign policy rarely last. A president may win a news cycle or two, but then people move on. In 1998, Clinton received a short-term political boost from the airstrikes, but the House of Representatives still went ahead and voted to issue Articles of Impeachment. The strikes in Afghanistan failed to kill Osama Bin Laden, and may have brought the Taliban and al Qaeda closer together. The real victor was _Wag the Dog_’s production house, Baltimore Pictures: In the wake of the U.S. attack, video rentals of the movie [skyrocketed](http://ift.tt/2t6RgvS).

In the end, diversion is a fool’s errand, offering fleeting political benefit and inviting very real risks. It’s no substitute for a foreign policy based on protecting national interests and values. Of course, the attraction of a risky wager depends on how weak a president is, domestically. If Trump is looking at near-inevitable removal from office, either at the ballot box or via impeachment, then gambling for resurrection through military action may be tempting even if the odds of success are low. He has nothing to lose—although American soldiers might.

I [19m] am currently attending uni to study compsci while my now ex- girlfriend was studying biology at a school 4 hours away. Before college we both attended the same high school in a small town. While still in  highschool we had a happy, healthy and great relationship. Once we graduated, she started to talk about seeing me every so often on the weekends during the college semester. I though that would be great idea. However as the college semester went on, she started to demand more. Soon I found myself paying 120 dollars every weekend so that she could ride a shuttle to my apartment. I tied explaining that I couldn't afford this while paying rent and going to uni but she said that I just didn't wanted to see her. So then I got a part time to pay for her shuttle rides. 
 
A couple months go by and it's January and I failed my calc class because I was devoting every weekend to her and every time between class working to pay for her shuttle tickets. Since I failed a core class due to this nonsense I decided enough was enough and I told her that I simply cannot have her down every weekend. This did not sit well with her. She said she fell into a deep depression because I was starting to not love her anymore. So I break down and let her come down every other weekend. Everything was fine except the stress of paying for tickets and juggling bills. 

At the end of this past semester I was able to pass calc with flying colors and score an amazing internship so there's that but she ended up failing out of her program. WHAT?!  she never even brought up that she was struggling and all and of the sudden she fail out?! She then wanted to live with me while she went to community college for two years. I thought it would be fine as long as she got a job.  Three weeks go by and she only got one application. Meanwhile I am working overtime at my internship to afford food for both of us and she is a picky eater. I just finally said I'm done and that I am not ready to be in a committed relationship. 

It's been about 2 weeks and she is mailing me an unspeakable amount of love letters asking to come back and texting me passive aggressive text messages about how I have changed and become evil and heartless. I just don't know what to do.  I don't want to be mean and block her or tell her to stop talking to me. I'm starting to feel like the evil person here by just dumping her out in such a hard time for her. 

TL;DR :

Broke up with girlfriend for expecting to much from me and is has been spamming me with message for the past two weeks

I've been commuting to the city every day by the Metro North but finding work as a student has turned up little, even by going to meetups.

Once it loads, you can click and drag to change your view of the 3D visualization). I'm really just looking for any leads as to who I can talk to or where there might be career fairs or recruiters looking for students who are graduating soon/in the city for the summer.

6hhlrs,9,2017-06-15,[Heavy Spoilers] Small Review on Gundam AGE.,koya404,Gundam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/6hhlrs/heavy_spoilers_small_review_on_gundam_age/,"Introduction: 

In Gundam franchise, most I had watched are AU stuff, start from Wing, Seed, Seed Destiny, 00, AGE, Build Fighters + Try, and the latest, IBO, while UC stuff were Unicorn and G:Reco (if counted). So, this only from my view, so take it with grain of salt or sugar.

AGE is first of all, the most serious series ever aimed at younger viewers, as lots of people agreeing on. I'm purely agree on that, as seeing kiddy vibes on both characters and designs. It further cements the original intention with involvement of Level 5, which work on Inazuma Eleven, a sports shows with similar fashion to kids. Surely enough, Sunrise and Level 5 did want to attract more children into Gundamverse, so why not? ""Let test new water back then"" with new age groups.

Plot: 

TL;DR for this show is: 

1st Gen: Revenge. 

2nd Gen: Growth. 

3rd Gen: Reconciliation. 

Why I give TL;DR first? To give bit more contexts on each plot. 

1st, revenge. Flit was gifted by the show's setting with ""came from family of great mecha engineer, Asuno"", similar to G:Reco (Beliri Zenam’s and Aida Surugan’s biological parents.) With that as part of plot points, he's already had this great power and when his home colony gets hit, why not using it as part of resistance? He did it with further strengthening the Feds together with actively participating in combat, alongside with trustful comrades. Of course, by the end of the arc, the Feds had small victory, which further sparks new technology revolution. Although the revenge side of Flit was further deepens with the death of Yurin L'Ciel, as part of casualty and a war child's play, Desil Galette.

2nd, growth. From this arc, we seeing a new character, in form of Asemu, Flit's son. Born and raised in army family within peace interval as the news of wars did pops in some point, his growth was moving towards Flit's recognition as proud soldier and his family. X-Rounder, the deus ex machina, introduced from 1st Gen, similar to recurring theme from older shows (Newtypes, SeeD factors) made himself into complexity. This anxiety was relieved by the best pilot the Feds ever had, Wolf Ennacle, which taught him ""the skills let you live and fight for another day, not some psychic power"". Using Flit's shadows in form of AI flight simulator, he makes into spot of battlefield by able to kills notable X-Rounders pilot within the Vagan. On this point, Vagan almost reached the peak of technology with similar variant on most of the suits except few experimental units. Of course, to make his character grow, casualty is needed, in form of Wolf.
Bit more on 2nd Gen, it introduce rival, which is Vagan and X-Rounder. Where in war we don't get know enemy, but with signature color palette, surely enough helps to recognize them. Moving onto 3rd Gen.

3rd, reconciliation.  At this point, watchers at the 2/3 of the series, so this last arc starts as similar to 2nd one, timeskip. Kio by then was a teenager, which is naively ~~got tricked~~ presented by this gramps, Flit, a pilot combat training simulator with both AGE-1 and AGE-2 combat data combined, making him able to skip combat pilot training within army although he didn't officially conscripted. Therefore, with long peace interval in Earth, he's already disconnected with ideas of what being of ""military family"" as Asemu's MIA. Knowing this news might making him less attached to army and victory, where he become more pacifist later in show, where probably somewhere within his heart, the idea ""wars took my family"" rooted firmly. 

Following the troupe of ""falling into mech suit"" (literally), he's unofficially designated as part of Feds forces. There's still present spy elements within Feds, but what differs Asemu with Kio is Shanalua Mullen, the spy teaching him lesson's: Life. From that point till her death, she teaches him to be more caring to his comrades and enemies, as long as the peace on later he seeking. Towards the space up till his imprisonment within Vagan's camp, he's later learn the enemy's side of life. Both Feds and Vagans did life as human, they live, they die. Only thing differs them are circumstances. Seeing the lives are made for caring, he's willing to share AGE system to enemy as long can save his presumably ""first crush, Lu Anon”, but it ran on short stick. Later enough, fighting with crush's family member will later slows him down on gaining victory with bloodshed, as opposed to hard trained soldiers.

Towards this point, a new enemy is needed to allow the peace to be happen, so we get Sid from Exa DB + Vagan Gear for that. Thus starts the journey of Kio ""No Kills"" Asuno. Completing the Legilis Gundam also serves as endpoint to the rivalry culminated from the 2nd Gen, Asemu vs. Zeheart Galette. With new generation seeking peace while older still being salty towards their own enemy, Kio and Flit confrontation were made into end of the conflict, which Kio still stands for “no killing” manages to talk to heart of his Gramps. Deep in inside, Flit also want peace, but in his own way and clearly Kio didn't want that way as it greatly sparks another conflict in future.

Visuals: 

As part of casual Gundam fan, I'm didn't seeing any problems at all with visuals produced by Sunrise, which they did it consistently and 3DCG. Due to my experience with old Korean 3D mecha story and further recent 3D animated Resident Evil movies, Level 5's Starship Troopers and Appleseed Ex Machina, 3D didn't do much damage to me, as opposed to most 3D hating fans, although most of the mechs fights are hand-drawn. Plus, it makes better in further emphasize on mechanical design.

Music: 
Too bad for AGE, the music didn't do well for me, with none signature track properly placed in my heart, so I'll give a rating of ""good to hear it once a while, only once""/10.

Mechanical Design: 

It's wrong not to say about mechanical design if you're a mecha fans. In every mecha shows, I love mechs. So on AGE. AGE-1 strikes me as RX-78 with Kanetake Ebikawa's touch, as opposed to Tokyosaurus mentions, when comparing to Exia in 00. Sure, it was has the curve from Exia, but it has vibes retaining the bulkiness of OG Gundam. Shadoll was one of the finest grunt in AU suits that I had ever seen. It was underutilized, and here comes G-Exes, there Shadoll frame was revamped and giving it more ""sidekick worthy enough to fight alongside with Gundam"" vibe. Genoace starts at the short stick, but after in Custom and O-Custom (the best version) gets more spotlight and greatly enough, its pilot, (So long, Lt. Obright. (T_T)7 ). G-Bouncer giving me bounce with a kick on perfomance of AGE-1 Spallow, and underutilized sword shield. Heck, I wanted to see the blade cuts few suits.
AGE-2 and its Double Bullet wear pack was the best, and I'm sucker for these heavily armed transforming mecha. AGE-3 got me liking the Fortress wear for racking much kills and its resemblance to 00's Seravee, but the best design is Orbital wear, which is its legs. Curvy, sexy legs. It can pack lots of punch but underhanded with Gundam Legilis on his debut. Poor Orbital, poor son.
On Vagan side, at first, I didn't like its mechs, but Zedas takes an icing to me. Later in shows, it introduces more experimental units and on 3rd Gen, the Danazine. Oh boy, I'm glad that the design was introduced as Vagan's heavy hitter at first and I can't thank enough to someone whom did a gunpla custom into Charizard. Furthermore, it also introduces Sid as AI fortess and Vagan Gear, skinny, but deadly. Sid was likely designed by a Pokemon company's intern who take another literation of Giratina.

Closure: 

With further emphasize on plots, visuals and music was decent enough to say within my memories as memorable AGE, with character, on their life, death, and conclusion. Furthermore, it came from me whom I'm enjoying it as a whole story to be *immersed*, not to be criticized or praised about. If things give me a plus, the final scene of few our beloved characters final moments and I'm suck at that.


Thank you.

*P.S.: I'm regretting reading AGE doujin.*

6hhoez,28,2017-06-15,Seeking advice and commiseration for a young woman treated disrespectfully in meetings,lionlament,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/6hhoez/seeking_advice_and_commiseration_for_a_young/,"Hello fellow lady scientists. I am a 4th year PhD student studying chemical engineering, and I'm about 1 year away from graduation. I have been having some trouble during meetings lately, and would appreciate advice and/or commiseration about my situation.

For context, I am a 27 year old white female at a school that usually ranks in the 20s for my field. I do experimental work related to pharmaceutical process development. I had ok grades as an undergrad, but I feel that I am a very good researcher. At the risk of sounding braggy, I have secured a fellowship for every year of my PhD, have several publications and more on the way, and am often complimented on my presentation quality. My research project is funded on a large collaborative project that includes 6 PIs and 1-3 students or postdocs per PI. This entire project group meets once a month, and all the students/postdocs doing research are asked to give an update on their progress. The group is actually fairly diverse in terms of gender, race, and type of research, and it includes groups from engineering, chemistry, and biology. 

As the “lead researcher” on my portion of this collaborative project, I usually have a lot to update at these meetings. I am also usually the youngest and least senior presenter at the meetings. After the first one I attended (~2 years ago), I left feeling incredibly demoralized. I thought I had missed the mark on what they were looking for, as I received an extreme amount of questions and criticism. I went home afterwards and cried. Over time, I feel that my presentation quality has generally increased, yet I still get the same reception. 

With each slide I present, I am interrupted before I can finish describing its contents and questioned aggressively. My methods, knowledge, and results are met with the assumption that they are flawed, careless, and incomplete. Other PIs tell me how to get better results without fully understanding the details of my work. In response, I need to defend all my decisions, and this defensive position makes me look and feel even less confident. My “brief updates” sometimes last an hour or more. No one, not even my PI or co-adviser, ever chimes in to help me.

I feel uncomfortable talking about this because I don’t want to make excuses for myself. I DO want to have my work questioned and challenged in the interest of scientific rigor, and sometimes the suggestions I receive are valuable. I also don’t think any of this treatment is malicious or even conscious. However, I feel that I am not shown the same respect during my presentations as the other researchers.

Several other students and postdocs have commented on my unfair treatment, and after our most recent meeting this past week, one PI even approached me to say the same. During my presentation, I shared some unexpected results. I said that when I first saw them, I thought they might be a mistake, but then repeated the experiment several times and felt confident that it was real. He pulled me aside after a meeting to advise that I never suggest during a presentation that I could have potentially made a mistake. Even saying the word “mistake” can make me look vulnerable and lead to more aggressive doubts and questions, particularly as a young female scientist. He suggested “experimental error” or “artifacts” as an alternative.

I think that one PI’s advice was spot on, I need to choose my language very carefully and always feign confidence. Previously I had been operating under the assumption that this was a friendly group with which I could be frank. Instead, how do I present my work in a way that will give me more credibility, both in the content and organization of my presentations and in the way I carry myself? I cannot “solve the problem” of being a young woman, but I can try to present myself in a way that commands respect. 

I also want to know how to ask my PI (who is also a white woman) for her help in standing up for me and other members of our group when this happens. I think this happens to all the women who present at these project meetings (to varying degrees), and also somewhat in our lab group meetings. I often feel that I do not have the authority to speak up for myself. I want to defend myself, but I also don’t want to cause a fuss, particularly so close to my graduation. I know that sounds silly, but there are so many extenuating circumstances to the situation and this post is already getting long. Part of me worries that all this criticism is actually deserved. Also, I’m about to leave for an internship, so I won’t be attending another one of these meetings until January.

To summarize:

1.	How can I seem more credible and confident in meetings, both in terms of presentation content and style, and the way I carry myself?
2.	Should I ask my PI for advice and help, or just let it go?  If I do ask for advice, how?
3.	How do I defend myself when something like this happens in the future? Should I be blunt and say, “Can I please finish describing this slide before you ask questions?” or “Please let me answer questions that are addressed to me?” Should I just let it go? "
6hi3zu,67,2017-06-15,"The ""Straight"" Intern",dppthrowaway004,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/6hi3zu/the_straight_intern/,"Hey all.  I have enjoyed this subreddit for a while and wanted to give back to it.  I hope you all enjoy.  Easily one of my favorite sexual encounters and I get to mark off ""Straight Guy"" from the quintessential bucket list.


So this took place between junior and senior years of college.  As part of my course work,  I was required to do an internship.  So after a while of searching,  I managed to snag a position at an insurance company.  They had this whole program for IT interns. 


A little about myself before I continue.  My name is Isaac, and I'm 6' even, about 175 pounds.  Dirty blond hair and brown eyes.  I'm pretty slim, mostly having lived the past few years off of a college level diet and stress.


Anyways, over the course of the summer, I see a guy who seems pretty attractive over with the finance interns.  Lets call him Dan.  Dan was about 5'9 and around my weight.  Brown hair with blue eyes, always smiling.  He and I don't talk too much, he's over in the finance department, I'm in IT.  I notice him every now and then in the cafeteria around lunch, but never do we really talk.  He does, however, start talking to one of the interns who I have grown close to from my intern group, Alex.


Alex and I were hanging out one night, drinking when the topic starts to get a little sexual.  Alex knows I'm gay and he is too, though taken unfortunately.  Well, in my drunken haze, I admitted that I thought Dan was cute and that I wanted to fuck his brains out.  Alex laughed and after I admitted that he mentioned had talked to Dan a bit and he was pretty straight.  I was a little dejected but hey, eye candy is good for the spank bank.


Little did I know but Alex was mischievous.  Alex invited me over a few weeks later to hang out and bake some cookies.  What he didn't tell me was that he had invited Dan over.  Well, Dan and I got to know each other a bit, enough to warrant a facebook friend request after that night.  We hit it off pretty well and the alcohol definitely helped.


Over the next few weeks we chatted every now and then about work and about the area.  Turns out he's a local who went to Cornell but was home for the summer.  We chatted about local restaurants and the like.  I would spank it to several of his fb pictures.  No big deal until...


One night I was out with our intern group and got absolutely hammered at the local bars.  I get home and strike up conversation with Dan.  Well I drunkenly told him that I thought he was cute and, if I wasn't being too forward, I wanted to get together with him and see what happened.  Drunk me promptly fell asleep without waiting for a reply.


The next morning I woke up and realized what I had done.  I also realized that he had responded.  I was super nervous as I opened his message.  I saw that he was was flattered that I was into him.  He went on to say that he was straight, he wanted to marry a woman have kids and the like., but he was young and figured hey, I could try this out while there are still no strings attached.   After that we talked for a bit about topics from what he might be interested in trying to when we should get together.  All the while though he kept saying how he wanted to have have a wife and kids and how he just wanted sex, not a relationship that's not with a woman.  Annoying but whatever.  He's cute enough for me to suffer it.


We decided to meet up after work on Thursday at my car.  From there to my apartment where we get to do the deed.  I spend the week looking forward to it and Thursday after work couldn't come soon enough.  I decided to clean myself up, trim the pubes, shave my peach fuzz, etc.  Thursday rolls around and I wear a light blue dress shirt, black tie, black slacks and suit jacket, do up my hair a bit.  I recall stopping in the mirror thinking ""Damn, I look good.""  Went through the entire work day shifting around in my desk chair because I was sporting a semi.  Finally, 5:30 rolls around and I text Dan and head out to my car.


Whenever I get there I wait in my car until I see him striding in my general direction.  He's wearing a white dress shirt, skinny black tie, and tan pants with brown shoes.  Just seeing him walking towards me if a smile on his face is enough to really get my hormones cranking.  Its a conservative office environment though so we can't exactly just go to town on each other in the parking lot.  We exchange pleasantries and hop into my car for the 10 minute drive home.  All the while we're talking about the office and about general life situations.  Every now and then he interjects the marry a woman thing.  I'm starting to find it annoying when its in person.


We finally get to my apartment building and we go in and get on the elevator.  He mentions the wife thing again and at this point I am done with it.  I grab his tie, pull him to me and start making out with him.  Surprise surprise, he's not talking about that wife now.  He moans slightly as I push him into the elevator wall and feel him sporting something in his pants. 


The elevator opens and we quickly abscond to my apartment.  At this point we start making out again,  me pushing him against the  door.  I grind my cock against his and he moans again.  He is really enjoying it. Step by step we slowly make our way to the bedroom, never breaking contact.

We get in and I push him down onto the bed. I climb on top and continue to grind his cock,  now hard. Slowly I unbutton his shirt to reveal his bare chest.  There's a small tuft of hair which is adorable.  I make it down to his pants and work on the belt.  I quickly pull his pants down to reveal his cock.  Hard and throbbing.  I go back to his head and make out some more. 


Suddenly he gasps in my mouth and jerks his body. I lift myself off of him to find that he had cum all over his stomach and chest. He looked at me with a mix of sorrow and bliss and I'm laughing. I get him a towel and undress myself.  He's still hard though and the sight of Dan covered in cum is great. I start rubbing myself and see he wants to help.  So I let him handle me and his hand feels divine on my cock.  It doesn't take him long to get me to fountain my own cum. 


I take a few minutes to come down off the high.  As I'm cleaning up,  Dan looks at me,  still hard,  and asks if we want to go again. So I knelt down and took his cock in my mouth.  Instant gasp and moan as I work my tongue over his head. I take his cock deep into my throat and I feel him shudder.  I begin to slowly slide his cock out again and begin to get into a rhythm. 


I taste the cum and precum on his cock and get even more into it.  Dan grabs my head and begins to set the pace, fucking my mouth. I want him to cum in my mouth and swallow his seed. We go at this for several more minutes with the intensity building.  He calls out my name as he cums in my mouth.


Unfortunately at this point we had to stop and I had to get Dan on his way home before questions were asked. Funny part is,  he was back talking about having a wife and kids on the way back. 


Anyways,  I hope you enjoyed this and look forward to comments and messages. "
6hjdvc,2,2017-06-15,"Me [19F] with my Best Friend [19F] of 8 years, has our relationship turned toxic?",duckbokki,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hjdvc/me_19f_with_my_best_friend_19f_of_8_years_has_our/,"Warning: LONG


 Best Friend [19F] (lets call her J for short) and I [19F] have known each other for 8 years. We've grown up together and I owe a lot to her. She helped me get a good office job that gave me a good springboard of experience to start my career. She's also helped my ambitious self with any big decisions I've attempted to make by supporting me while trying to do what she can to help.  


But J has always had a few problems. She's had a slew of medical issues since high school and as a result suffers from anxiety and depression. Because of this, she's had a hard time keeping friends. While she gives off a great first impression, generally she tends to not want to put in the effort to try and stay in touch with anyone. This of course leads to her having a smaller group of friends and she doesn't quite understand that effort is a two way street. Because of this I am always put in a position of having to attempt to reach out to make sure she keeps talking with me. It's difficult but I've tried my best to help her open up more to others. 


In addition to this J has always had dating problems. J has just gotten out of an incredibly convoluted mess of a 3 year relationship. This relationship had major major side effects on my friendship with her. She would stop talking to me for weeks to months at a time. When we hung out together, it would always be myself, her, and her boyfriend. Now this happened in high school so I didn't (and still don't) have the highest self esteem. I told her that I felt uncomfortable being third-wheeled. That I would enjoy if when we spent time together, it be just us and that she would leave her boyfriend at home. Instead of decreasing the amount I saw her boyfriend, she somehow managed to increased the amount of time I was third wheeled. She would go out of her way to make me uncomfortable and joke about how I needed to ""grow up"".


She would prioritize him over any of her plans as well. If we had made plans to go to a movie, she would need to leave early because she wanted to go on a date with him. And it felt like she only downgraded plans that I made with her. I am always the one compromising for what she needs to do. Or dropping my plans because she feels upset. She even managed to third wheel me when I had come over for a bit of support AFTER A BREAKUP. 


But it ended between them. And I guess I was naive enough to think that everything would somehow get better afterwards. I comforted her and stayed with her through times when she said she felt suicidal and I encouraged her to try and get professional help. I said maybe she should try being single for a while. 


Well reddit. I wouldn't be posting on here if things had gotten better.  They were alright for a while, don't get me wrong. She was starting to want to spend time with me. She had begun to put effort into our friendship. But then I found out J had started dating again. Only a month fresh out of a long and toxic relationship she decided she wanted to start dating a man in his mid-thirties. 


Now side note, I don't really care about age differences as long as you aren't breaking the law and are old enough to be aware of what you are doing. But this did shock me. And she started her spiral out of control once again. He is the center of her universe. Now that she's dating him she believes that all things come second to ""The Boyfriend"". 


In addition to this (yep. this shit show is not over yet) I want to move out. Become independent. Blah blah blah and all that jazz. Unfortunately my meager salary of 1300 a month is not enough to live entirely independently. I had talked to J about it and we had agreed that once her lease expired (she had moved in with her ex-bf in September and needed a new place to stay b/c she couldn't afford rent) we would move into a two bedroom apartment together. 


Trust me when I say I have had my fair share of doubts moving out with her and attempted to try and talk to her about them to help ease my mind. And I think that conversation is what's caused me to start questioning if my relationship with her is even worth it. We are both dating and that's somewhat of an inevitable problem to run into. She doesn't like my boyfriend and I despise hers. So I wanted to talk it out. 


I asked her how she saw the situation and she told me that her boyfriend could come over whenever he wanted to as much as he'd like but because he didn't like my SO I would have to see him outside of the apartment if I wanted to spend time with him. I told her I disagreed and that I'd be ok with both coming over but I didn't want them over there excessively. I have a little bit of social anxiety and when I'm home I want to feel comfortable and not constantly third-wheeled. 


She responded to this by saying I ""didn't understand"" and that they weren't allowed to spend time over at his place because his mother and sister disapproved of them dating (he lives with his parents) which meant they could only be over there. She'd be too lonely without him. I responded that I didn't feel comfortable in an environment where he would be there every day. I try to get along with him but I really can't bring myself to like them. Many of my conversations with him end in him sneering ""Shut up duckbokki"". 


She still held her ground but got incredibly heated with me. She said that she was going to have him there because I am never there for her because I am always hanging out with other friends and forgets she exists. She also blamed me for working all the time (I work 2 jobs and have a summer internship) and not being flexible enough to accommodate her.


I like to say that I'm a well tempered person. It takes a lot to make me blow my fuse. But this was the straw that broke the camels back. I drew the line and told her that if she was going to blatantly disrespect any attempts at compromise I make then she could find another roommate. 


And the problem is that I don't regret it. She's been there for me for 8 years. And I feel like giving up on her is a waste of that time. I'm the only friend she has. And while I highlight on the bad, she's done a lot of good for me too. Has this relationship grown too toxic? Is there any way to salvage it? Or should I just walk away? I'm worried what she'll do if I leave. And the idea of moving out with her feels unrealistic now......
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My best friend (J) [19F] and I [19F] have had a few strains. She has trouble making friends and prioritizes her boyfriend. We wanted to move out together and she wants her boyfriend to always be there while I would prefer less of that. Got in a fight. Has this turned toxic? What can I do?

6hk6t2,1,2017-06-15,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,DirtyStoryWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyStoryWriting/comments/6hk6t2/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out.

Bassically you are someone who is aware of his condition and either by pure need of cum or altruism reasons you take the opportunity of us being alone to make me unload a large period of time worh of cum. As it is a generous amount it would be life threatening to have it all done in one go, so you would plan to have me nut several times throughout the roleplay 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my teen daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw Kaley (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that Kaley was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as Kaley? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent little girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) A innocent little sleepover with your 2 friends and you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them and want to learn everything, but no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks), lingerie, thick girls, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.

Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :). I also have kik if you prefer

But ever so patiently waiting, here we are now, more than a year later for (and more for some).

6hkzh4,2,2017-06-16,"Me [21 M] with my GF [21 F] of a year, walking on eggshells and not sure how to help her feel better",yawahortw,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hkzh4/me_21_m_with_my_gf_21_f_of_a_year_walking_on/,"So a little background: my gf and I got together about a year ago when we were both helping each other get out of shitty relationships (we'd known each other since freshman year of college and had feelings, but the timing never really worked out). And for the most part it's been fantastic--I love her so much and I know that she loves me. She does have a history of mental illness (depression, anxiety, and cripplingly low self-esteem, probably caused by shitty, emotionally abusive parents, but that's a story for another time), and I'd been helping her a little bit with that (though honestly it was probably just the happiness from being around a crush that helped her) as I helped her get out and into and out of a couple of relationships with shitty guys (see: low self-esteem). And now here we are. 

In the last few months, it's felt more and more like I've had to walk on eggshells with her, and it's really wearing me down emotionally--I feel like I can't voice my opinion without her getting upset, or shaking her head like what I'm saying isn't true, which really bothers me, and whenever I say things, she likes to take them either very literally (I'm a STEM major--I can't always write/say things the way I want to) or in the worst way possible. 

Some of the things she gets insecure/upset about I understand, like I'm on the cheerleading team and of course have to routinely lift girls in the air. She's petite but not athletic, but I always make an effort to remind her how hot I think she is (I'm also a personal trainer so it's hard to not always give her advice on how to get a more athletic body if that's what she wants, cuz she always has a reason to say it won't happen), and still she gets all weird whenever I say I'm going to practice/do extra practice (I have a year left in college and I want to get good enough to try to compete). But again I see why that makes sense, although I try to alleviate it by always telling her who I'll be practicing with, and making sure it's not just one on one, and even trying to get her to stunt (it takes a bit to get her out with me but it's a lot of fun when she does come). 

But then there's other things. Like today I was working from home while she was at her internship, and I was wicked tired from going to bed late with her and waking up early to make sure she was up and on her way to work (she needs less sleep than I do, although I try to pretend otherwise so I can spend more time with her). So as I was doing work, I was getting sleepy, so I tried laying down for short power naps so I could still kinda keep texting her (if I tell her I've napped she'll hold it over me, especially if I say I'm tired later. It's probably a joke but I still worry that she's seriously resentful). This is where I messed up: when she asked what I was up to/how was work, I said ""I'm exhausted,"" but she asked that with something else and I guess I didn't realize she didn't connect my answer with that question or something? Idk. 

Now around this time, she shifted her texting ""voice."" We're very emoji-heavy texters when we're in a good mood (or when I'm pretending to be in a good mood to try to cheer her up), and the shift I always notice when something's wrong (usually when something's wrong with me, cuz otherwise she'd just tell me about it), is  when she replaces emojis with VERY forced ""haha""'s and ""lol""'s. Maybe it's weird that I notice that but it's what happens. 

But anyways, she shifted to that, and I knew something was up, but I had to run to a training session and was hoping she'd get over it by the time it was over. I was wrong--she was still using that voice and so I stupidly decided to do the same thing and I didn't use an emoji with an ""ok have fun"" message before she went to go shower, which she questioned and I answered (she didn't read it until she got out I guess) with my next mistake. I said how I didn't use it cuz I wasn't in a good mood cuz I thought she was upset with me for something and I didn't know what. When she didn't reply I stupidly took that as an opportunity to say ""I'm pretty sure you're upset with me for not being super clear about what I was doing when I said I was drifting in and out of sleep (I'd said both that I had been drifting in and out of sleep for a while, and that I didn't remember when exactly it started, which I think makes sense...), but I don't appreciate how you're ratting on me for answering vaguely when there's obviously an issue with me being too tired all the time."" She answered with ""what?"" which is standard whenever I try to voice my opinion (maybe I just say things in a confusing way, but it still hurts when she says that), and then followed up with the old ""I'll talk to you later,"" which means she's really mad. 

When I tried asking, she said she was mad about how I was assuming stuff about her (sidetrack--she does that shit ALL the time. She's a criminal justice major so she thinks she's got me all figured out all the time, when really she doesn't and most of the time I just agree that she does to make her feel better about herself). Then I of course get all pathetic and plead her not to go, and try to tell her that I really just meant the best and was trying to remedy the situation but I'm obviously just stupid and blah blah blah. Then she finally agrees to talk to me on the condition that it's not about this (I helped her pick an outfit for a work event tonight).

When she gets back from her event, she's all tipsy and friendly for a while (open bar), but then things start turning sour when I say that I was thinking of stunting with other cheer people the next day (I was really thinking of asking her to come right then, but I was too nervous about 1) her getting jealous when I work with another girl too, and 2) my own insecurity that she'll try stunting with another guy and like that better, which is definitely unreasonable on my part, but you can see where I'm coming from). We drank a little bit more (like actually one drink each), and as I tried telling her that I did want her to come but I just didn't know how to say it or how she'd react, she just shook her head like she knew what I meant more than I did (which again really hurts). And then she brought up the other shit from earlier, and when I tried to ask her what exactly I'd said or did wrong, she just kept saying ""read it over again,"" which I did with no further insight. 

Now she's passed out on my bed, I'm sitting at my desk typing this and feeling like a complete pile of shit, and idk what to do to help her feel better. I love her so much, but it's really hard for me to go through this process of her not wanting to sort out issues but still getting upset at me for them, and not even trying to see that I do as much as I can to make her happy, and then not believing me when I try to say otherwise, and just not feeling like I can tell her how I feel about things without expecting some kind of emotional exile or retaliation. I don't want to break up with her, I just need a better way to approach things, and how to know if a topic will set her off and how to avoid it (but at the same time being open with her about things in my life). 

Idk if this all made sense, but it was at least nice to try to get it all out somewhere where at least someone will listen (my roommate this past year is friends with both of us--her more than me I think--and I'd go to him for advice/venting a lot but I don't wanna burden him this time).

Tl;dr: emotionally unstable gf reacts very negatively to things, I want to be able to approach problem so they can be resolved and we can continue to have happy times instead of shitty times

PS: There's other things that she gets very upset about, like how much I work out (fitness has been a HUGE part of my life since before I knew her, and I've already tried making compromises for her) which I can explain if y'all want."

6hmqov,6,2017-06-16,Confession : I have oneitis.,Casconvacc,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/6hmqov/confession_i_have_oneitis/,"I was living with a girl in college. I lost my virginity to this girl after knowing her for 6 months. She was giving me IOIs from the start but I pretty much ignored her because I was focused on my studies and the gym. She was insanely nervous around me for a long time. I didn't want to reciprocate because we lived together and didn't want distractions. 

To cut to the chase, a close childhood friend of mine passed away in the middle of the semester from cystic fibrosis. I was a mess, I didn't show it but I was. The day after the funeral, she was sitting beside me and I just said fuck it. I liked her too and found her very attractive so fuck it. So I put my hand on her leg, escalated from there and you know the rest. 

I went into it with the idea that I'd lose my virginity to her, fuck her a few times while we lived with each other, then move on afterwards. As things progressed, I saw that we had a lot in common and got along really well with each other, even when not having sex (we had a lot of sex). We would spend all day together and never get bored. Initially I wanted to keep as much distance as possible because we lived together but she gradually broke me down.  Even with the strongest frame, be around a girl literally 24/7 and you're going to break a little. 

I found out that she has a lot of TRP positives : strong father figure, hard working, modest, low N count, highly intelligent, shy. So I naturally start developing feelings for her. She tells me that she loves me and I reciprocate, even though at that time I don't know if I really meant it. I definitely do now though, christ. Can't think about anything / anyone else. No interest in other women whatsoever. What a fucking change from when she was all over me and I was ignoring her. 

So we moved out of the house, and she stayed with me for 2 nights before she left. We talked on the phone for hours.  She had agreed to go travelling through Europe for 2 months with her female friend before we started seeing each other. I had an electrical engineering internship at a top company that I couldn't turn down. 

She was and is madly in love with me. She rings me / messages me daily, and pretty much gives me a run down of her entire day, just in case I think she would cheat. I'm confident she wouldn't, because she knows that if she did I'd be gone in an instant and I've got a very high SMV (6'3, athletic, part time model, amateur boxer, 3.7 GPA in electrical engineering). She also never got with anyone other than me in the time we lived together, despite going out socialising a few times a week, in a far safer environment. There's always a risk but I'd wager the risk is pretty low.


I told her that I don't like messaging and that I'd prefer if things stayed the same as they were before she left (we never had to message because she was there all the time). I wanted to put her out of my head and regain focus, then pick things up again when she got back. This hurt her feelings a lot (I'd imagine I've failed a lot of comfort tests). So I caved, and told her the truth about how I feel (facepalm). Also have been messaging her more. 

She has never admitted to missing me (doesn't feel comfortable sharing her feelings with me a lot of the time) even though the fact that she messages me so much pretty much confirms it. If she was physically with me I could easily manage her but messaging fucks things up. 

While initially I wouldn't have given a shit whether she missed me, now I do. A big part of the problem is that while she's over having the time of her life, I'm going through hell. I'm the only guy under 30 at my job (I've just turned 21, shes a year older than me)I meet nobody during the day, the work is boring, I see pretty much nobody when I come home either. I've been coming home and just crying my fucking eyes out. Obviously she doesn't know any of this. 


Not sure what I'm really asking here. Just need somewhere to vent and need some opinions. I'm sure the prevalent one will be go meet more women, but I genuinely am not interested in any women other than her, and I know this is unhealthy."

6hng2n,62,2017-06-16,The first time I met Doggy Dodger was a complete and utter clusterfuck.,PeopleWatcher94,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6hng2n/the_first_time_i_met_doggy_dodger_was_a_complete/,"Yesterday afternoon, with the recent shennanigans of Doggy Dodger, FW and I reminisced on some of the most ridiculous things she has ever done. This led me to the story of the first time Doggy Dodger and I met, which I thought was worth sharing. This is very long, and I'm sorry.

Background: It was the summer after my freshman year of college.  My roommate at the time had scored this internship in FW's home state and we went on a road trip to get him all settled. The weekend that happened, I met FW, who was still with her ex at the time. They broke up a couple weeks later.

After they broke up, FW spent a lot of time hanging out with my roommate and texting me. That summer, all I did was work and lift weights and kickbox. Many gainz were made. FW and I were really starting to like each other, and her and my roommate convinced me to come up for a week around July 4th.

The Story:
FFIL's birthday was that weekend and he usually does a barbecue. FW and her family are from the Upper Midwest, while roommate and I are from The South. A barbecue in the Midwest is just a term for a cookout, while barbecue in The South is a term for a type of food (slowly smoked meat with a sauce, for those of you who aren't American). FW invited Roommate and I to FFIL's birthday party, and told us to bring food. Roommate and I agreed, because Roommate enjoys drinking and partying (I could start a subreddit on all the times I had to rescue him while he was drunk) and FW is probably the most adorable human being on the planet, and I still have pangs of my 18 year old puppy love for her.

Roommate was renting an apartment for the summer and we came up with the idea of making a few racks of ribs for the party. The night before the party, we slaved all night to make them. Though it was fun because drinking beer, hanging out with RM, cooking, and listening to Radiohead all night is the kind of thing that we both enjoy. 

The next day, we arrive at the party with our ribs, only to find that they were just making burgers and hot dogs. Nothing wrong with that, but I was just a little dissapointed. We introduce ourselves to everyone and point everyone to the 4 racks of ribs we made. Doggy Dodger approached me, and asked what was on the ribs as she had some food allergies, I tell her and she takes one, takes a couple bites and then chokes. After she choked on it, she then decided that she was allergic to pork instead of coming to the realization that she's incapable of chewing her food. She still thinks she's allergic to pork, except for bacon. To add to the mess, she then starting telling everyone that she thought our ribs were undercooked because they were so tender. Though, cooking something over low heat for 6 hours straight, with constant basting will do that. This woman overcooks her meat, I'm sure a ball of rubber bands is more tender than the chicken she makes. Plus, she said that they were inedibly spicy, which they were pretty hot, but not inedible. 

At this point in my life, all of these things would BEC things for me because I realize that Doggy Dodger is insane, but 18 year old me really took it hard as I'd worked all night over those ribs and RM and I found them delicious. Though FW did make me feel better by telling me that DD thought she was allergic to literally everything and they were delicious. 

Her behavior the switched from BEC to full on JustNO. I've mentioned before that Doggy Dodger LOOVE's FW's ex. Seeing her daughter getting friendly with me was traumatizing to her, as I was muscular, had a couple visible tattoos, and  I looked like I belonged in a metal band rather than looking like the 18 year old nursing student that I was. FW's ex was one of those more fashionable individuals and he was quite a suckup to her. You know what she did? She invited that little fucker over, and he came.

The first thing he did was start yelling at FW, who wasn't even my girlfriend at the time, and then Doggy Dodger backed him up in saying that she was an awful person for leaving him. He then proceeded to tell her than she was leading BOTH roommate and I on for the drama. This little snippet was hilarious to me, mainly because RM is gay. After this prick was done berating her, he proceeded to throw the remaining ribs RM and I made on the ground.

At this point something in me snapped, FW was crying and my carnivorous creation was on the ground. I calmly walked up to him and told him not to make a scene, and leave quietly. His response? He pushed me, and said he'd kick my ass... remember that part in the beginning of the story where I said that I spent a lot of time boxing, kickboxing, working out over the summer? This was supplemented by my teenage years of competitive boxing/ kickboxing, and wrestling. FW's ex took a hard left hook to the jaw, courtesy of me. He hit the ground. I'm by no means an aggressive person, to the point where I don't even raise my voice. But I felt I had to, and though I'm not the kind of person to start a fight, I thoroughly enjoy them. 

He them ambled off with Doggy Dodger following him close behind, to console him. RM and I whisked FW away with us and split, as I just assaulted someone and I was terrified of getting the cops called on us. 

The entire night, Doggy Dodger, and FW's ex tried to call her, and text her telling her that RM and I were the bad guys and that we were the ones who started the trouble. Eventually, we just turned off her phone and we went to a park, and then an aquarium. Thinking back on it, I can't believe how insane this woman is, and we dodged a bullet with not letting her live with us.

6hnsx9,4,2017-06-16,19 yr/old looking a little lost on how to go forward with life. Career questions.,tequoia1243,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6hnsx9/19_yrold_looking_a_little_lost_on_how_to_go/,"So I'll try to make this as brief as I can.


I'm 19, will be 20 in several months, live in Eastern Washington and I have a job at a call center where I make about 2k a month, give or take 200 after taxes and commission bonuses. My girlfriend makes roughly ~500/mo but it can also vary 100 or so based on hours.

I am currently staying with my girlfriend and her parents, which is incredibly stable all things considered. My girlfriend's income is probably going to stay as it is for at least the next 4 months or so as she's doing an internship with a filming company, and beyond that she doesn't really have any solid plans either.

My bills are as follows:
Rent: 200
Phone: 70 (for 4 lines, discounted through employer)
Monthly subs like netflix: 40
Car Insurance: ~180 (still ironing this out)
Gas: 150 (rough estimate)
Cruise: 900

Yeah so I got roped into paying for a cruise for me and my gf. Total cost is ~6,500 and we're paying 900/mo every month until it's completely paid off. Already put 700 into it. I have my mixed feelings about spending so much so young on something that will be over in a month but it's unavoidable, socially, at this point.

So my monthly expenses at this point are 1390 before food and stuff, which we are trying to limit ourselves with, but I will be honest now that I actually HAVE money it's difficult to not spend it.

I recently bought a car. It has 200k miles but it seems to run very well, I had a 'family' mechanic who seems to know his stuff say it'll last a decent while. I don't expect many problems with it.

I have a gist of my strategy with my spending but any help is appreciated as far as what I can do with the extra 1000 I pull in every month and have nothing to do with.



Career wise though, I feel super lost. Currently I am doing above average in a call center in a sales position. I like sales, but I really, really hate the job. I was considering going into car sales honestly.

I had a gig at a startup for ~9 months where we were trying to start up a design agency but I did eventually quit because it wasn't heading anywhere, and it fell apart soon after I left. I stayed with it, a lot because of the whole 'can't go back on friends' thing but I just wasn't making any money. I learn really fast and I am feel I am already skilled with a lot of CS/Design subjects like Photoshop, Javascript, CSS, HTML, PHP, yadda yadda. I spent a good ~4 months just watching and practicing on Lynda.com and Udemy.com so I did hone my craft, just I don't have a degree to show for it I suppose. The situation at the startup was that I was primarily working on just a single website, trying to 'perfect it' as per what the boss wanted, but the design was never the problem. Essentially though, I spent way too much time on one project and I was never able to build a portfolio.

I have sales skill but I really do like CS. I did some freelancing before but I was honestly struggling a lot with stuff like contracts and how to operate a sole proprietorship legally and how to handle taxes with it. I am very comfortable going to networking events and the like and I want to get out and do it so I can work with CS but also apply my sales skill.

On the other hand though, I have honestly found that there's no way I'll ever get a salary position as a Junior Web Developer with the current state that is my portfolio and without a degree.

I could go to a 2 year college for nearly no tuition expense because of my family status but I am really struggling to do it as I keep thinking in my head if it's really worth all that time and energy. And then additionally, should I ever do CS or should I just try to focus on business and go into a more sales-focused career? I honestly would choose where the money is if it ever came to that.

I really just don't know the path I should be taking right now as far as a career goes and I would really appreciate any guidance and I will definitely answer any questions if there is something I should clarify."

However  I forgot to de-register when I returned to my home country.
I had some major sudden health problems at the time and  sadly I just forgot about it .

It seems I got this email in 2014 though:
&gt; Your residence permit is/was linked to your status as a student at the University. Since you are no longer registered as a student at the University , the International Service Desk is obliged to inform the (Dutch) Immigration Services (the IND).
Based on that, the IND will revoke your resident permit (your legal stay).
When you leave the Netherlands, please do not forget to cancel your health insurance, de-register from the City Hall, and close your bank account.

Does that implies they may automatically de-registered me?

Now I am thinking of returning back to an EU country , could there be taxes waiting for me when I come back or some other issues?

I've had it since I was a kid, and I'm borderline manic when I'm off of meds. I went a few years without taking anything so I know somewhat how to function without them. since I've went into school though I've been on vyvanse.

I am a double major in mathematics and computer science. I have mostly A's with 3 B's, 1 C and coming up on 90 hours. Right now I'm working at an internship while taking psychology and Cal 3 online. I really enjoy programming, and playing around with technology in general. 

I'm not looking for experiences of people with ADHD who work in the field, I know they are there. I've read the experiences of people who both don't take medication, and take it on a regular basis. I'm looking for the experiences of people who were taking it, and for whatever reason got off of it. How did it affect your school life or career? How did you deal with the adjustment period of acclimating to life without meds? How would you rate your productivity before and after?

If possible I would like to quit taking them, but not at the expense of my ability to pursue my goals. "
6ho9uj,220,2017-06-16,Roommate Got What She Deserved,emergencyemergency98,RegularRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/RegularRevenge/comments/6ho9uj/roommate_got_what_she_deserved/,"At the beginning of my freshman year of college, I came into my new dorm room, all excited about living someplace without my parents. I had yet to meet my roommate, but knew I had been randomly assigned one and had emailed her earlier in the summer to tell her a little bit about myself, figure out who was bringing the mini-fridge, etc. She had emailed me back, and we figured out who was bringing what, but in her emails, she had seemed very uninterested in what I had to say, and told me next to nothing about herself, besides responding to my questions about her hobbies with ""I like to go shopping with my friends."" I kind of thought that she probably was just nervous about meeting somebody new, and would open up more when I actually met her. Plus, I like shopping as much as the next girl, so it was a fair answer to the question.
So, I walk into my dorm room to find that she is already in the process of moving in. She's already chosen a bed, and her parents and family are in the room with her helping her get settled in. My dad and I walk in, I introduce myself to her and her family, my dad introduces himself, all seems good. She's a little subdued during all this, but again, I'm chalking it up to her maybe being uncomfortable with meeting a new person that she's expected to live with, and since I'm not the most extroverted person myself, I understand the feeling. Also, moving in can be stressful and all that jazz, and I'm just happy that it seems like we're going to get along alright. Anyways, she has a ton of stuff - there was probably about 5 suitcases of clothing, at least - and I have to move in some of the larger items that I have in a cart, because they are too heavy to carry up from the car. Stuff like my own suitcase, a printer, microwave. So because her suitcases are kind of covering the floor by the entrance, I politely ask if I can move some of them into the hall for a few minutes while I move the heavier, bigger stuff in. Her response? ""Oh, can you give me a few minutes? I'm kind of in the middle of getting stuff out of them."" Ok, I don't really see the big deal but I'm not about to pick a fight with my new roomie. So my dad and I move in what we can, and about 30 minutes later, she's finally done moving in the clothes.
Over the next few weeks, I get to know her more, and I'm not really liking what I see. This girl is spoiled as hell, almost never talks to me, and is extremely picky about the cleanliness of our room. Now, I'm not the type of person who needs to be best friends with my roommate, but a certain level of civility is expected. When I come into the room and say ""Hi! How are you?"" I consider it rude if you don't respond. Also, I understand that there needs to be a minimum level of mess, but getting upset because i didn't make my bed that morning and making passive aggressive comments to your friends about it, in front of me, is a little ridiculous. I may not be the neatest person, but I certainly wasn't overly messy, and on the survey we both filled out when we were being randomly paired, she indicated that she didn't mind a little bit of mess, provided that it wasn't on her side of the room and stuff remained generally clean.
But again, I was a freshman, totally new to the whole co-inhabiting a tiny room thing, and I could deal, so I didn't say anything to my RA and resolved that I would be fine living with her, even if we weren't really friends. Things continued to get worse. She started communicating only through passive aggressive notes, never talked to me, never helped do things like clean the floor or vacuum the rug, despite how obsessed she was with keeping things tidy, started inviting friends over to loudly watch television in our room, couldn't get through a day without calling her mom and talking to her for at least 30 minutes, loudly, inside our room, often doing these things while I was clearly trying to study or sleep.
There were three major incidents that broke me. They happened relatively spaced out, but the final one was the last straw, and it all caught up to me. The first one was towards the beginning of the year, probably around October. This was back when I was still trying to be friends with her. I came down with a really bad cold - fever, exhausted all the time, constant headache, bad cough and sneezing. Well, as soon as she sees that I'm sick, she flips out. How is she supposed to live in a room with a sick person? Can't I go to one of my friends' dorms? I'm going to get her sick. When I gave her my meal plan card and asked her to get me something while she went to the dining hall with her friends, she told me I was being lazy and should do it myself, despite the fact I was running a 101 degree fever and was so tired I could barely move.
Later on in the semester, I got one of those edible arrangements delivered to me by my aunt for my birthday. It was a really nice gift, but because it had fresh fruit and chocolate, it had to be refrigerated so it wouldn't melt. We shared our mini-fridge, and normally I kept my stuff to the bottom shelf, however, the arrangement was too big to go there, and I had to put it on the larger second shelf that she normally used for her food. At the time, she only had one thing on the shelf, so I assumed it would be alright if I put the arrangement on the top shelf, and left her a note on the fridge explaining why. In the note, I specifically said that I planned on bringing the arrangement to one of my friends' dorms that night, and that it probably wouldn't be in the fridge for more than a few hours, but if she needed more room, for whatever reason, she was welcome to place her food on the shelf I normally used. I went out to go to class, and when I returned a few hours later to get the arrangement, I found it half melted, sitting on my desk. My note was gone. When I asked her about it later that night, she said that she ""was going shopping and couldn't have it sitting there."" She didn't go shopping until 3 days later.
Finally, towards the end of the spring semester, I was welcomed back to my dorm by a note sitting on my desk stating that ""my mess was out of control"" and that I needed to clean up the room because her friends were coming over later and ""it was awkward"" when they saw the dorm room and it wasn't clean. For reference here, my side of the room was slightly messier than normal. I had some unfolded laundry under my bed, because it was close to finals, books and study materials were scattered across my desk and on the floor of my side of the room, and I hadn't done laundry in a little bit, so my bin was slightly overflowing. All of this was contained to my side of the room, didn't obstruct the entrance, and while not the most pleasant thing to look at, was not at all unreasonable. The reason my room was in this condition was because finals were coming up, I was working part time at an internship, and I was trying to balance a leadership role in several extracurricular activities, as well as hang out with my friends when I got the occasional chance. Basically, I was leaving the room at 8 a.m. for class and not coming back until midnight, and was so exhausted that all I wanted to do when I got back to my dorm was fall in bed and sleep - something that I couldn't normally do, since she and friends were constantly in the dorm hanging out until 2 or 3 a.m. So, I normally went down the hall to study in the lounge, since if I was going to be awake, I might as well be productive. Additionally, at the time my grandfather was in the hospital because the hormones and meds he was taking for his cancer treatment had stopped working, and the cancer was spreading. It was stage 3, and his only option was to go through chemo, and he really didn't want to do that. My family was pretty scared and it was a rough time for everybody.
When she came back, I tried to explain all of this to her, and said that I needed to study tonight for a test that I had the following morning, but that I would try and clean up a bit the next day. She stated, ""Just because you're depressed because your grandpa is dying, and your grades are shit, doesn't mean it should have an impact on my social life.""
I consider myself a pretty good person. This was the last straw. I went ballistic. I screamed at her to get out of the room, I was done. How dare she say that to me? She just said ""You're crazy, I knew it"" and walked out. Pissed, I started texting my friend about what happened, and then had a better idea. You see, this girl had about 5 different types of body wash in her laundry caddy. And she was always bragging about how expensive they were and how good they smelled. I pissed in them. Every. Single. One. And then, because I still wasn't satisfied, I pissed in her shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, literally every liquid thing I could find in the bathroom that was hers (I didn't do anything to her toothpaste, but only because I was a little worried she would be able to taste it). A few hours later, she came back into the room, and two weeks later she left for the summer. We spent the last two weeks in complete silence, and I didn't hide the fact I despised her. She never found out, but I had a good laugh every time she went to shower or wash her hands. Next year, I'll have a single, and I completely recognize that it wasn't the right thing to do and that I was in the heat of the moment. But even though I know it was wrong, I'll never regret it. She so deserved it.
TLDR; I pissed in my roommate's shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand soap because she was a bitch to me for my entire freshman year."
6hogjq,4,2017-06-16,Mother is threatening to kick me out.,NanabPizza,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6hogjq/mother_is_threatening_to_kick_me_out/,"Hello, all. For those of you who don't know the full context of my upbringing, here's a link to why I decided to post on here below. Though, a fair warning, it's very long.

https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6dz5e4/support_feeling_stuck_anxious_and_conflicted/

Bottom line is that my mother has been very emotionally abusive towards all of her children over the years, while I try to rationalize it being for our own good, but not being able to see through all the scars she's left me, since i've seemed to have taken it harder than others.

I've been feeling mentally and emotionally unbalanced lately, from feeling sleep deprived, having very little to no friends to reach out for social support, and feeling unmotivated to reach out to other people since i've seemed to have grown more sensitive to other peoples' negative behavior and not feeling like I will be able to express myself. On top of all of that, my mother is constantly placing pressure on me to go out and be active to find a job and the like, despite me stating that i've been exhausted and feeling very off-balance and in need of time to recover and relax. Unfortunately, my mother is one of the biggest sources of stress at the moment, where being in the same house as her prevents me from truly relaxing, making things even more difficult. And as stated in my wall of text that I linked, she loves comparing me to her and my siblings, even though we are fundamentally very different people, and making me feel that I will never be able to measure up to all of them, since I have my own limits that my mother refuses to acknowledge.

Today, my mom came inside of my room and asked me to sort things out since my older brother is coming over and planning on using my room. She then immediately began to criticize me and my time being on the computer, and that I need to get off of it and be proactive, though I use the computer to relax from tolerating her and being outside in the first place. In a knee-jerk reaction, I became infuriated by her comments, and I struggled to hold back my anger and contempt for her. I yelled at her to stop talking, but she refused to stand down once more, acting as if her words are the ""truth"" and that I cannot accept the truth, as her hubris causes her to feel morally superior to me.

As I stood up to try to sort things in my room, I pushed my mother aside with my shoulders when she was standing in front  of me while I was trying to gather up my clothes and bedsheets. I know it is not right to get physical in these sorts of situations, but at that point, it was a culmination of years of verbal and emotional abuse and feeling sick of being emotionally cornered, overwhelmed, and the butt of the family's jokes which made me feel a little less inhibited.

My mother, of course, did not take that well, and asked if i'm so willing to attack my own mother. Feeling exasperated, and knowing that she refuses to listen to whatever I say unless if it is something she specifically wants to hear, I told her that that day may be coming close with her behavior towards me.

When she heard that, she threatened to kick me out of the house if I showed that sort of behavior again. She then messaged all of my siblings that I have threatened violence on her, and turned the majority of them against me, as she usually does. I know that what I have done is wrong, but I am sick of feeling like the red-headed stepchild of the family, being constantly mocked, criticized, or put down mostly because I have my own needs that are different from the rest of my siblings that everyone else refuses to address or accommodate since I am a grown adult and am open to constant scorn and scrutiny.

I really do not know what to make of all of this. I don't really have anyone else I am willing to share all of this with, and I defintiely know that my family is out of the question on talking about all of this. At the moment of this writing, I feel very dizzy. Whether it be from physical exhaustion, emotional stress, or a mix of all of the above, I am really unsure of how to make out all of this. I do not have a job as of yet, and I have had a hard time in finding something at the moment from a mix of physical and mental exhaustion along with my mom's constant pressures and refusing to give me a minute to relax. The closest I have is an internship that does not pay much and is only open during the school year, starting again late August. I do not have much of a steady income to pay rent, relying on my father's allowance to make do of what I can, though I suppose since he is supporting me, my own struggles with trying to get my foot out there is completely moot and I have absolutely no right to complain, I suppose?

I am tired of being constantly treated like I am in the wrong with everything that I do, when I really want to be left alone and figure things out on my own pace. And I am also sick of being at my boiling point whenever my family decides that I have done something wrong and I deserve to be demonized by me trying to defend myself from them. Alot of their words are damaging, and they refuse to acknowledge it, saying that I need to ""man up,"" and stop making excuses, even if my ""excuses"" are legitimate grievances with them.

I think I went on long enough. I really hope people will see this. I really do. I hate not having a voice and hate not being heard by others moreso. I'm not sure what I am asking for around here, but I need help.

- Burke and Cristina dancing is one of my favorite moments between them. They are just so adorable.
- It’s Cher’s son from Mask (who coincidentally is played by Jesse Plemons another Friday Night Lights alum)
- Loud, high-pitched shrieking noises! Mark! Mark! Mark! It’s Mark!
- I had forgotten about that punch. It was a bit alarming.
- Mark has a good point about how Derek was more upset about him talking to Meredith than him sleeping with his wife. It’s kind of like Jackson when he caught Shane and Stephanie kissing. He just walked out and we know he is capable of fighting. He just did not care about Stephanie.
- Those hate messages! I’m rolling!
- Spontaneous orgasm lady felt a lot like blushing lady. What’s next? Uncontrollable queefs lady?
- Awwwww, Mask Boy and Cristina are friends.
- Sloan fixing the kid’s face. He’s skanky but he has a heart.
- This week’s sign of the times - Mer actually using a telephone book.
- Just no to the Meredith and George sex.



**Tearjerker Moment**


- Meredith visiting her dad and asking why he didn’t fight for her.


**Quotes**

- “My mommy’s a filthy whore.”
- “Why is he suturing his own face?” “To turn me on.”
- “Uh, just ah choking back some McVomit.”
- “I am Preston Burke! A widely renowned cardio-thoracic surgeon. I am a professional and more than that, I am a good and kind person. I am a person that cleans up behind myself!

**Dr. Robert Offerman and Dr. Debra Manning**

On October 1, 1979, The East Area Rapist had traveled from Northern California to Goleta, California. He attempted to break into a home and continue his spree of rapes, yet his attack was ultimately botched. Whether the last strike was carelessly planned, he made a conscious decision to graduate from mere terrorizing and raping a female woman, to full-blown murder in the early morning hours of December 30, 1979.

At around 3:00 in the morning, a neighbor of Dr. Robert Offerman had woken up to use the bathroom. While he was getting himself out of bed, the sound of three gunshots suddenly rang out from his next door neighbor's residence. The sound woke up the neighbor's wife, to which both immediately peered out their bedroom window. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary other than the Offermans' glass sliding doors had been left ajar, yet no lights had been illuminating throughout the household. 

As the police made their way inside the Offerman's residence, they stumbled upon Dr. Debra Manning laying face down on the bed with her hands and wrists bound behind her back. She had been murdered by a single gunshot wound to the skull, execution style. Next to her on the floor was Dr. Robert Offerman, who had been shot four times; one in his chest and four in the back. Twine was dangling from his left wrist, indicating he managed to partially get free of his bindings but wasn't quick enough to stop the assailant.

**Noteworthy points**

* Upon further examination of the crime scene, the investigators found clear evidence that ransacking, albeit lightly, had taken place in the bedroom. While they were looking for a specific point of entry, they discovered a turkey bone next to a glass sliding door. On the patio was a turkey carcass in a plastic bag. The murderer had taken the family's leftover Christmas turkey dinner and had eaten it after murdering the couple. 

* The couple was murdered by a .38 caliber revolver, along with Super Vel brand .38 ammunition. 

* The home had three glass sliding doors that led inside. The police investigators discovered each door had pry marks on them.

* Inside the home, every light switch was turned off, as well as the thermostat.

* Debra Manning managed to take off her jewelry and hide it under the mattress and the bedframe before she was murdered.

* The twine used to bind the victims were 1/16 in diameter and the color was nylon and rayon. Moreover, they were tied in a diamond knot as well. Interestingly enough, the twine was discovered on the patio of residences living on 773 Avenida Pequena; a home just down the street from the crime. Furthermore, next door to the Offerman's home was a condo. The residence was vacant, yet a registered nurse had plans of moving in soon. The police found the home had been broken into it. There were pry marks on the wooden framing of the front door, along with a window screen being removed. Underneath the window were footprints matching the same shoe impressions discovered in Robert Offerman's backyard. When the police went inside the vacant condo, numerous strings of twine were littered inside; the same matching the bindings used for Robert Offerman and Debra Manning.

* The police were seeking any [possible motive](http://imgur.com/a/cZMM3) for their deaths, hoping the public would be able to assist them. [Another newspaper article](http://imgur.com/a/0nVu1) details the tragic event.

* When the police canvassed the neighborhood, they discovered a neighbor reported hearing Dr. Robert Offerman's vehicle -- a Porsche -- pull into the parking lot. Afterward, she heard three voices, two of which were Robert and Debra. She was unable to recognize the third voice, though she believed it was a male speaking.

* According to the neighbors who initially heard the gunshot(s) echoing from Dr. Offerman's home, they were looking outside of their window at 3:17 a.m. and witnessed a white vehicle, possibly a Pinto or Honda, driving slowly away from the parking lot with the headlights off. 

* Another nearby neighbor discovered their son's bicycle had been stolen sometime during the night of the attack. It was later found several blocks away. Additionally, the same twine from the Offerman residence and other surrounding areas was found in their backyard as well. 

* An autopsy was conducted on Robert and Debra. Though nothing substantial could be discovered from Robert, the medical examiner unearthed two blue-green flakes on her big toe that were identified as architectural paint, along with loose hairs found on her back.

* Two days after the murders, more evidence was found on a dirt trail with a creek bed a relatively short distance away. The same twine material was found, along with shoe impressions and dog footprints. 

* The detectives working the case investigated the background(s) of Dr. Offerman and Dr. Manning, to see if any new light could be shed on a possible motive for their deaths. Apparently, both Robert and Debra were having an affair with one another. At the time, they were currently in the process of getting a divorce from their significant other. Debra's soon-to-be ex-husband was questioned but he was soon quickly eliminated as a suspect because he was on a skiing trip at Lake Tahoe and his entire story corroborated perfectly with a polygraph test. As for Robert's soon-to-be ex-wife, she too was eliminated as a suspect.

* Two days before Robert and Debra were murdered, they attended a house-party together on 452 Toltec Way. Those who attended the party were primarily doctors and lawyers.

* Earlier in the afternoon before the murders occurred, a lot of strange activity took place in the general area of where Dr. Robert Offerman lived. A prowler was reported breaking into a home with a round screwdriver on 5419 Parejo Drive. This location is very close to where The East Area Rapist failed his attempted rape on October 1, 1979. Shortly thereafter, an unknown individual had burglarized a home on 5422 Hannah Drive, which was nearby. The family's safe had been pried open, and a wedding ring band and cash were stolen. Not too long later at approximately 6:10 in the evening, a family living on Windsor Street spotted a woman dressed in all dark clothing, shoulder-length hair, and in her early twenties standing at their neighbor's front door. One hour later, the same family witnesses another person standing at the front door; this time, a white male who was 5'8 in height. The family thought it was peculiar, but they continued on with their own business. Thirty minutes later, they see the same male figure again standing at the front door; nothing arose from the situation. However, two hours later -- now 9:30 p.m. -- a home on 5470 Queen Anne Lane was burglarized. In the backyard was twine that later matched what was used during the murder(s). Moreover, the glass sliding doors had been pried open and a couple two-dollar bills, jewelry, and a class ring from the 1946 class of Merchant Marine with the initials HJH had been stolen. A short while after this incident occurred, a family returning home from the theater saw a stranger running out of their living room and into the backyard before scaling a fence that leads to Mountain View School. They hurriedly ran inside and found their poodle dog had been injured, though nothing was missing from the home. Whoever the intruder was, he left shoe impressions in the backyard, which later matched those found at the murder scene hours later. The family said the stranger was wearing a dark jacket with a fisherman style hat. 

* The majority of these dubious reports of a prowler and break-ins happened within a mile of each other.

* The police later discovered in their questioning that one year prior, a prowler was seen twice in the vicinity. Each report detailed the stranger as approximately 6'0 tall and dressed in all dark clothing and a stocking cap. This took place on Vineyard Road, Santa Barbra, between 2:00 - 2:30 in the morning. Each time the prowler was spotted, he turned around and jumped the nearby fence.

**Lyman and Charlene Smith**

After the double homicide before the new year, the killer dubbed the Original Night Stalker went on a three-month break before he returned on March 13, 1980, in Ventura, California; a forty minute commute from Goleta, California, where the two previous murders occurred. 

It was Thursday, March 13, 1980, when an older woman awoke to the sound of her great Dane barking at 2:00 in the morning. This startled the homeowner, so she decided to look out of her windows, but nothing seemed amiss. 

Nonetheless, her dog remained persistent on leading her outside to a side gate that leads to the backyard of the Smith residence, where the dog strangely sat quietly. Again, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, so she eventually made her way back inside and went to sleep.

On March 16, 1980, Lyman's twelve-year-old son, Gary Smith, left his mother's home to bicycle to his father's and step-mother's home to mow the lawn as he generally did as a chore. He arrived at approximately 2:00 in the afternoon and was greeted by the gardeners tending to other sections of the lawn.

Before Gary got started with his chore(s), he went inside his father's home and heard an alarm clock relentlessly buzzing in the master bedroom. Curious by the peculiarity, he peeked his head inside the bedroom and discovered two anomalies laying in bed with the bed sheets draped over them. This confused Gary, so he walked over to the bed and pulled the sheets away, only to discover his father laying face down completely nude, with his hands and feet bound by a nylon drapery cord. 

Charlene Smith -- Gary's stepmother -- was next to her husband, face up with only a t-shirt on. Her hands and wrists had been bound behind her back, and her ankles were crisscrossed and fastened. Out of utter shock and terror, Gary stumbled backward, automatically screaming and crying before running to the nearest landline to notify the police. 

The investigators quickly arrived at the crime scene and made their way into the home to gather evidence left behind. While they were examining each room in the home, it was the master bedroom itself that contained the majority of the crime, as it appeared the couple was attacked unexpectedly. Moreover, the bedroom itself seemed to be ransacked, with dresser drawers sprawled open and belongings were thrown onto the floor. 

In between the couple was a wooden log taken from Lyman's backyard firewood stack, believed to be the murder weapon. Various pieces of wood and bark were scattered all over the bedroom carpet due to the immense amount of force used to bludgeon the couple to death. Their blood had been strewn all over the bedroom walls and dressers. 

Once the crime scene was taped off and all of the evidence gathered, logged, and collected, a canvass of the neighborhood, along with friends and family members questioned, more light came to the forefront regarding the Lyman and Charlene's brutal slaying. 

**Noteworthy points**

* Charlene Smith had been raped. There were other signs that shown she had been intimate with her husband shortly before their untimely deaths. More information can be found [here](http://www.santapaulatimes.com/news/archivestory.php/aid/1627/Lyman___Charlene_Smith_murder_revealed_to_be_work_of_serial_killer.html). Additional information can be found in [this newspaper article](http://imgur.com/a/8JR4o).

* Interestingly, Dr. Robert Offerman and Lyman Smith's home had striking similarities in its design and overall layout.

* In both murder cases, the victims were tied with a nautical knot, also referred to as a diamond knot.

* The cushion pillows from the family sofa had been removed and placed behind the sofa. Furthermore, a black cloth was found underneath one of the cushions.

* Lyman Smith was a prominent lawyer waiting for a judgeship. Prior to living in Ventura, California, he had lived in Sacramento, California, where he attended Bella Vista Highschool. A classmate of his ended up working for the Sacramento Sheriff's Department.

* On March 8. 1980, a nearby resident living on High Point Road heard someone scuffling in her backyard. Someone was trying to jiggle her bathroom window as if unloosening it. The commotion stopped shortly after and because nothing else happened, she never called the police. 

* Sometime during the night of the murders, a person living on El Malabar spotted a white 1970's Pontiac Sedan parked on the corner of High Point Road -- the same location of which the reported prowler was tampering with a woman's bathroom window. Apparently, this vehicle hadn't belonged to any residents in the general vicinity. 

* Days after the murder, between March 17 - 18, another resident living on High Point Road claimed to be a victim of a possible break-in. The family's infant son had woken up crying in the middle of the night. The following afternoon, the husband searched around his property to see if anything had been tampered with. He discovered his son's bedroom window screen completely removed and stolen. Strangely, he didn't notify law enforcement until seven days later. Moreover, on the same night the child had woken up, another local on High Point Road heard a neighbor's dog bark relentlessly for forty-five minutes at approximately 4:00 a.m.

* As the police continued to conduct their investigation, they came across a possible suspect by the name Joe Alsip. He was an acquaintance of Lyman Smith by a legal partnership. Shortly before the murders, Joe had been in their home visiting. This particular piece of information stemmed from a priest who claimed Joe had confessed to him about murdering the couple. Joe, of course, pleaded innocence and denied all allegations brought forth by the clergyman. Nevertheless, Joe served a one-year stint in prison but was acquitted because of a lack of credibility from the priest who enjoyed inserting himself into various unsolved crime cases.

* Interestingly, despite the outward appearance of feeling content and loved in the marriage, Charlene Smith was secretly having an affair with a former deputy sheriff, Rick Atwood, for nearly an entire year. However, Rick was completely oblivious that Charlene was married. Once he realized Charlene's unfaithfulness, his vexation prompted him to write an angry letter of resentment dedicated to her, of which he delivered to the Smiths' residence. Eventually, Lyman Smith read the note and immediately confronted his wife about the content of the letter. Despite Rick's confirmation of Charlene being married, a part of him was in utter denial. In order to convince Rick, Lyman invited him to his home and he accepted the offer. Lyman proceeded to escort Rick throughout his home and showed family photos and other miscellaneous items that demonstrated the evidence.

**Keith and Patrice Harrington**

Once the Original Night Stalker murdered Lyman and Charlene Smith, another large gap in time occurred. It wouldn't be until Thursday, August 19, 1980, in Dana Point, California, when the heinous killer emerged from the darkness to kill once again. 

Keith and his wife were living in a home inside a gated community owned by his father, Roger Harrington, who happily allowed them to stay while Keith finished up his schooling as a medical student. He was in his third year and had an internship already planned.

On August 21, 1980, Roger had plans to eat dinner with his son and daughter-in-law. When he tried walking inside he noticed the main door had been locked, which was unusual. Nonetheless, he grabbed the spare key hidden nearby and made his way in. The home was eerily quiet and nobody seemed to be around despite vehicles being in the garage. In the kitchen were newly bought bags of groceries atop the kitchen counter and not stored away.

Sensing something wasn't right, Roger began walking throughout the home and checking each room for Keith and Patrice. That's when he noticed the guest bedroom door was closed. Not wanting to barge in and disturb them, he simply peeked his head inside and saw two people seemingly asleep under the sheets and blankets, yet it was entirely too early for them to be sleeping with groceries not stored away.

Roger knew something was amiss as he slowly walked to the side of the bed and pulled the blankets away. The sight sent him into an uncontrollable frenzy, discovering his son and daughter-in-law had been brutally bludgeoned to death. Their blood had been soaked through the mattress and pillows. Roger immediately contacted his other three sons and the Orange County Sheriff's Department who arrived hastily at the scene.

**Noteworthy points**

* Keith Harrington was a third-year medical student at UC Irvine and Patrice was a registered nurse. Once again, in terms of The East Area Rapist and now Original Night Stalker, more connections to the medical field arose. Furthermore, two brothers of Keith's were attorneys, while another was a psychologist.

* The police investigators found no sign of forcible entry. Moreover, the question has to be asked, was this murder intentionally planned beforehand? Though not entirely, this murder posed its set of challenges. Roger's home was located inside a gated community and there were only three ways of entering. One is through the gate by the security guard. Another is by having access to the gate code itself. Lastly, the third option is by scaling the fence. This attack was the first time the Original Night Stalker had struck in a tight-knit gated community. Moreover, there had been no reports of any dubious prowlers before or after the murders.

* This double-homicide presented clear signs of learning for the Original Night Stalker. After binding Keith and Patrice -- making them immobile -- he placed the bed sheets over the couple before bludgeoning them to death. This helped eliminate blood spatter on the murderer himself and the bedroom walls. Additionally, bruising was found on the wrists and ankles of each victim indicated they had been bound, but the killer had removed the restraints after their death. 

* The cause of death was blunt force trauma, but the investigators couldn't find a murder weapon at the crime scene. The killer had apparently taken it with him. However, fragments of brass were discovered protruding from Patrice's head due to the excessive force used. Though it can't be conclusively proven, the general consensus is that the murderer used the sprinkler head from the family's lawn. A point of reference can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/zYt9r) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/5ipxx).

* Before Patrice was murdered, she had been raped by her assailant. 

* Several blocks away from the crime scene, a blood-stained motocross glove was found.

* After a significant amount of time had passed since the murders, forensics discovered the murderer who raped Patrice had a vasectomy. Unfortunately, in 2010, Detective Larry Montgomery checked with those in charge of handling the DNA evidence for the murder(s) from the Original Night Stalker and The East Area Rapist and found out no such evidence existed of a possible vasectomy. This caused a major hindrance in the overall investigation because due to the supposed fact of the vasectomy, law enforcement had a prime suspect by the name of ""Waz"" for the murders, but he was hesitantly eliminated as a suspect.

* Although this was a horrific tragedy, one blessing managed to come through it. Keith's older brother, Bruce Harrington, helped fund and create Proposition 69, which is a law that prisoners will have to mandatorily donate their DNA to a statewide database. [Here is a very interesting article](http://www.danapointtimes.com/new-interest-in-a-cold-case/) that goes more in-depth about the entire scenario.

**Manuela Witthuhn**

As the breaks expanded between each murder(s), the Original Night Stalked halted his murder spree until the following year on February 6, 1981, when he paid a visit to Columbus, Irvine, and murdered twenty-eight-year-old mortgage broker, Manuela Witthuhn.

At the time of her untimely demise, Manuela's husband had been hospitalized at Santa Ana-Tustin Community Hospital -- now Newport Specialty Hospital -- for an infection. Manuela, who suffered from anxiety and wasn't fond of being alone overnight, was hesitant on staying home by herself. When unfortunate times such as this happened, she would sleep in her sleeping bag because it provided a sense of extra security for her. 

Her father, knowing her daughter's condition, happily offered her to stay with him until her husband was released from the hospital. She declined, but he insisted that she should at least let his German Shepherd stay with her, but again, she said no and assured him she would be okay.

On Friday, February 6, 1981, Manuela was home alone. Her husband tried contacting her from the hospital to simply check in and converse before going to bed. He wasn't able to reach her, so he called Manuela's mother to ask if she was around. She told him she hadn't heard anything from her; out of concern, she went to her daughter's home to see if everything was alright. 

When she arrived, she stumbled upon a ghastly scene. Her daughter had been savagely beaten due death while still in her sleeping bag in the master bedroom. She screamed in sheer terror and immediately notified the police. Upon their arrival, they quickly escorted the distraught mother away from the crime scene and taped off the area with yellow caution tape to begin their investigation.

**Noteworthy points**

* Hours prior to the murder at 11:00 at night, a woman living directly behind Manuela arrived home and found her dead bolt for the main door had been unlocked.

* Manuela was raped before she was viciously murdered. There had been ligature marks around her wrists and ankles, and her cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the skull. However, as reminiscent of the previous murder case, the material used for binding, along with the murder weapon, had been removed from the crime scene. 

* Pry marks were found on the sliding glass doors where the murderer made his forceful entry with a flathead screwdriver with brown paint on it that was left behind.

* Burnt wooden matches were littered throughout the home and family garage. The same type of matches had reportedly been found at the murder scene of Dr. Robert Offerman and Dr. Debra Manning on December 30, 1979.

* Shoe impressions were discovered in Manuela's backyard. One of such appeared to be a ""Tred 2"" racquetball-style print. 

* The assailant had stolen a lamp and crystal curio, both of which weighed approximately nine pounds each. Furthermore, a tape recording from the family's telephone machine was missing. According to those investigating the murder, the home seemed as if it had been purposefully, but poorly staged as a burglary. From their judgment, they suspect Manuela knew her rapist and murderer personally. 

* Due to the strangeness of this murder and the notable differences from previous attacks affiliated with the Original Night Stalker, the two cases weren't linked until years later when forensic evidence from DNA connected the two together. You can read more from this very brief [newspaper clipping](http://imgur.com/a/Iz3az).

* Now that it had been proven the Original Night Stalker raped and murdered Manuela, the question is, why? He deviated from his modus operandi and attacked a woman home alone. Did he go off course, or was he planning to murder her husband as well, only to find he wasn't present? 

---

**Greg Sanchez and Cheryl Smith-Dominguez**

Five months had gone by before the Original Night Stalker returned to where it all began on July 27, 1981, in Goleta, California. Cheryl Domingo's aunt had been living a half-mile away from where Dr. Robert Offerman and Dr. Debra Manning was murdered. Though two years had flown by since the unexpected tragedy, a sense of unease and paranoia clouded her mind regularly. Due to that, she had put her residence up for sale. Meanwhile, Cheryl would occasionally house-sit until the property could be sold. 

On the night of the murders, her boyfriend, Greg Sanchez was accompanying her. At the time, their relationship had been rocky, with them frequently breaking-up and mending the relationship. 

Earlier in the afternoon -- on July 26, 1981 -- John Sullivan, the real estate agent in charge of selling the property had a potential buyer who wanted to look at the residence. During this scheduled event, another male adult had randomly arrived unexpectedly. Nevertheless, the agent didn't consider it much of a roadblock and let him check out the property as well.

The following afternoon, John Sullivan had appointments with more prospective buyers. As he was providing a tour to one of the family's, he opened the door to the master bedroom, and when he did a horrific sight was unearthed. Cheryl Domingo was laying motionless on the bed, and Greg was partially nude with the lower part of his body protruding from the closet doorway.

**Noteworthy points**

* According to Richard Shelby, the unexpected prospective buyer who showed up during John's scheduled appointment had removed the screen from the bathroom window in order to sneak inside later that evening.

* While the real estate agent was guiding the family around the home shortly before discovering the grizzly crime scene, when he opened the master bedroom door, the family's three-year-old son peeked his head inside and saw the gruesome scene. It's allegedly rumored the child was so traumatized by what he saw that he didn't speak or utter a single word for nearly a year. 

* The crime scene painted a clear picture of what transpired during the murders. Greg and Cheryl had been sleeping in bed when he had heard strange noises emanating from the bathroom. While he was getting out of bed to check on the sound, he encountered the murderer in the bedroom doorway. He was quickly shot in the face, causing him to fall back into the closet. The wound was not fatal, but the assailant had quickly run to Greg and repeatedly used a blunt-force object to hit him in the face and skull, subsequently removing hanged clothes and draping them over his head. Afterward, he focused his attention on the petrified girlfriend, Cheryl. Though Greg was not discovered to be bound because of the abrupt attack, Cheryl's body indicated she had been bound by her wrists and ankles. Strangely, unlike past murder victims, Cheryl had been hog-tied.

* A local resident nearby stated he had witnessed a man standing behind a tree at 9:45 at night when he realized someone was watching him. Fifteen minutes later a married couple on a leisurely walk around the neighborhood reported they were being followed by a young white male with shaggy blond hair down to his neck. He was approximately 5'11 and very thin.

* During the murder(s), between 3:15 - 3:30 in the morning, many surrounding residents heard a single gunshot being fired, but nobody thought to call the police.

* One witness claimed to see a young white male with a dog jogging away from the murder scene.

---

In a strange turn of events, the Original Night Stalker disappeared for five years after murdering Greg Sanchez and Cheryl Dominguez. It's unknown what transpired in this interval of time. Nevertheless, speculations and theories went rampant.

Law enforcement considered the likelihood of the reprehensible murderer simply becoming complacent and bored with his atrocious crime spree due to the prolonged gap in-between the murders. Others speculated the possibility the individual required an out-of-state job or even a possible stint in prison for a lesser charge. Some people even suggested he ended up in a mental facility for an extended period of time.

Regrettably, nobody has an accurate answer to his sudden disappearance. However, though he wasn't apprehended in this five-year period, communities in Southern California were beginning to feel comfortable in their neighborhoods again. The sense of paranoia and untrustworthiness amongst others were fading away and life was seemingly back to normal.

The dark and gloomy cloud looming over the Original Night Stalker's hunting ground started to disperse, and his crimes, though never forgotten, lives of surviving family members were beginning to put their broken hearts back together and find a sense of peace and closure.

Unfortunately, this newfound peace shared within many residents unexpectedly shattered when on May 4, 1986, the murder of an eighteen-year-old girl sent waves of terrified panic across the town of Irvine, California. 

---

**Janelle Cruz**

The night was Sunday, May 4, 1986, in Irvine, California. Janelle Cruz -- an eighteen-year-old cashier at Bullwinkle's Pizza -- was at home with a male friend while her family was vacationing in Mexico. 

During their get-together, they began hearing unidentified noises occurring outside of Janelle's bedroom window. They laughingly joked and shrugged the incident off, dismissing the sound as a pestering cat. Shortly thereafter, another startling sound echoed from inside the family garage. Once again, they blamed the sound on the washing machine.

Some time had passed since any abnormal noises were made and the male friend decided it was time to go back home. The time was approximately 10:45 p.m. Afterward, nothing seemed amiss. The following evening at 5:00 p.m. a real estate agent who had been scheduled to tour a prospective buyer for the Cruz's' home arrived at the residence to make the necessary preparations.

He knocked on the front door multiple times but didn't receive an answer. Nonetheless, he made is way inside anyway and was making sure things were tidied up before presenting the home. That's when he stumbled upon the deceased body of Janelle Cruz sprawled out diagonally across her bed with a blanket draped over her. The sight stupefied the real estate agent, sending him into a hysterical fit of emotion as he swiftly alerted the police.

**Noteworthy points**

* Unlike previous murders where the Original Night Stalker was learning to make less of a mess in terms of blood spatter, on this occasion, Janelle's blood was found in many sections of the home, including the kitchen floor and cabinets, near the front door, wooden shutters on the inside of the windows, and her bedroom. More information can be found in [this newspaper clipping](http://imgur.com/a/nXjk0).

* The police found blades of grass on the bed where Janelle was raped and murdered. As they examined the yard, they discovered shoe impressions. It's more than plausible the sound Janelle and her male friend heard stemmed from the Original Night Stalker preparing for his attack.

* It may not be entirely important in the grand scheme of things, but the residence of Janelle Cruz had an insurance policy with Frederic Sauer Insurance Agency; the same insurance held on Dr. Robert Offerman's home.

* Prior to Janelle's untimely murder, she had spent a significant amount of time in two separate psychiatric hospitals due to overwhelming emotional stress.

* Sickening rumors circulated following Janelle's death. In particular, people were spreading illegitimate stories that Janelle had been molested by her step-father and numerous people affiliated with the military, one of which was a Marine stationed at El Toro. He lived less than a mile away from Janelle (and close to Manuela Witthuhn) and owned a business marketing dental supplies with his wife. Furthermore, shortly before Janelle's murder, she had spent a total of $2,000 dollars on dental work.

* When the police conducted their investigation searching for a possible motive for the murder, Janelle's good friend, Greg, told investigators about a man referred to as the *Kitten Man.* This person was supposedly meant to meet Janelle at her home the evening of her death, to bring over a few kittens for her to choose to have as a pet. Apparently, Greg had met this individual at the local swimming pool. When he approached him for a conversation, the man tried avoiding him and refused to speak. Greg sensed something suspicious about the man and promptly told Janelle to stay away from him.

* More oddities surrounding the alleged *Kitten Man* came to the forefront. Supposedly, Greg had attended the same high school as him (Woodbridge High). Moreover, a woman named Amber, but often referred to as *Bambi*, was friends with *Kitten Man.* Years later -- post-graduation -- rumors began surfacing that stated Amber became pregnant by an unknown individual. Eventually, due to their friendship, she had temporarily moved in with *Kitten Man,* who lived on the Marine Core Air Station base. Strangely, Amber and *Kitten Man* have never been identified and there is no evidence suggesting they even exist.

* The sudden murder of Janelle Cruz was the Original Night Stalker's last known victim. As to why he suddenly appeared and disappeared in the blink of an eye is not clear.

This officially concludes my series on The East Area Rapist and Original Night Stalker. I have to thank everyone who invested their time in reading and sharing my entries. Your generosity, support, and overall kind words and dedication helped motivate me to continue writing a new post each week. Though my series has ended, the story of The East Area Rapist and Original Night Stalker hasn't. This monstrous criminal has yet to be identified and apprehended. It's important to spread awareness for this case that has largely gone under the radar. Whether this person is alive or dead, the case still has a chance to be solved. As always, I'll link my sources and previous posts below.

6hqrs9,2,2017-06-16,Was Lexapro treating a legitimate serotonin deficiency or made me feel good when things were horrible,maximus4rome,AskDrugNerds,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDrugNerds/comments/6hqrs9/was_lexapro_treating_a_legitimate_serotonin/,"So I failed the bar exam 3 times, diagnosed ADHD with Anxiety and Depression initially, I had struggled through full time law school on the instant release Adderall tabs prescribed to me @ 20 mg but quickly ran through them. Met an ex-gf on POF who I considered toxic looking at what was done to me, and she claimed to be reformed from prior drug use and back from rehab etc. (she was a perfect 10, so I was thinking with the wrong head for sure but she tried heroine at one point, maneater isn't the word, I fell hard).

All we did was screw, I would skip law school lectures and just be in my room screwing her and when I tried to sit through law school lectures, I would have so much anxiety (even when I tried Adderall XR, it was never-ending PTSD or some other type of Anxiety I just couldn't shake, almost like I was running from myself).

She was the only thing that made me happy, I was miserable in a broken home, surrounded by a mother who took advantage of me and my car (while other siblings got to live their lives and move out) and I was a sacrificial POS for awhile... until I got a big break.. and haven't had once since.

I applied for years for top jobs in law school and never landed them except my first summer of law school I was a paralegal for a law firm before medication and that same firm offered me a summer associate gig which is very high paying, but it wasn't enough for me, I knew my brain was elsewhere I wanted something meaningful, my old boss thought I was nuts.. my last summer after being rejected by the WH in D.C. 3 times, they finally granted me an internship for that summer and I got to meet POTUS the first fam1ly etc. 

I knew I was not fitting in with the rest of my law school peers and instead of trying a benzo like clonzepam etc. I immediately figured I was in a Major Depression, begged my doc for lexapro 10 mg and he said some SSRIs can change you etc. but I needed it if I was taking this opportunity. Almost immediately I felt relief but an overwhelming anger more than that.

I was angry at how I was treated for nearly all my life or during first two years of law school, I was beyond irritable but felt the never-ending anxiety that was chasing me finally stopped and I was content or happy? for once in my life but an angry happy. Without thinking about lease costs etc. it was the WH in D.C. that cleared me and granted me clearance for a summer I would never forget. I put my ex-gf in the car, she was shaking at first couldn't believe I took her with me neither could her family? They thought I was nuts but figured I had it together if I was taking her right, i knew she had anxiety issues etc and I knew lexapro changed me so much, it also changed the way I viewed people so I felt like her White Knight.

This is why I'm really posting here... Switched to Adderall XR 25 mg or Vyvanse 50 mg (the last year after the WH that followed) or even adderall instant and I had intake control?! I use to never have control over my instant release meds and finally I wasn't running through my scripts etc. one XR of 25 mg and lexapro 10 mg I was working out every morning and I got through that summer, people in my law school and around my entire city were stunned that knew me, how did I actually work there and how was it okay? Lexapro gave me a careless I dont give a F*ck kind of confidence that may not have been the most beneficial? It helped me in the sack with my ex and other women were also attracted to me but guy friends claimed I was ""weird"" or ""off"" and a prick, not how i felt at that time... 

failed the bar twice, second sitting my ex changed on my so quickly it broke me in half for two years that I needed lithium so I didnt kill myself. she looked at me and said i cant remember anything really this is all a blur and cant date you like this bye i screwed someone else.. I was stunned and of course didnt pass. 

It was the last time I had a job offer on the table but it wasnt the best financial opportunity (lexapro made me careless about finances, biggest downfall of the drug and dumbed me down or didnt allow me to live my life and go on vacas etc. unless she played me that bad and that was it).

After trying BP 2 meds, nothing worked, finally decided to see a psych got my ADHD re-confirmed and back on adderall doses but without her around and without lexapro, on hydroxyzine HCL or something like that (antihistamine after she thought clonzazepam 1.0 mg was bad for me) and wellbutrin xl which i refuse to take anymore, i dont want an antidepressant if it changed me or made me so oblivious a young girl can take things from me like that.. although my broken home and family despises me now.. cant blame them.. i still felt more confident, capable on lexapro and brain seems to wander more of it.

Maybe I dont really want to be a lawyer and the real me is forcing the issue with all these meds, but why would I be so sensitive to lexapro that my confidence becomes surreal after I go back on it but i cant create any type of life for myself? Being on it for 3 years its second week off it and clonzepam was only real effective med for withdrawals as this one doesnt sedate me but i still have more anxiety. 

I lowered my adderall dose all the way down to 10 mg and got a part time job in the area but was fired shortly after because i couldnt put in full time hours she claimed, although it's either my ADHD wasn't treated long enough or I do in fact need a serotonin med. 

I'm nicer again now and able to pick up a phone without lethargy blocking me like lexapro did.. so i dont want to go back, but beyond confused here and 4 psychs 2 pcps cant get it right? i dont know.. I tried vyvanse and seems like I depend on the NE from adderall. thanks for reading and the input in advance, only sharing here because medical team isnt getting it right."
6hr5jz,4,2017-06-16,I [21 M] need advice on coping with jealousy and paranoia when dating. (currently [20 F] of about 3 months on and off),Dom_Flannel_Guy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hr5jz/i_21_m_need_advice_on_coping_with_jealousy_and/,"Greetings redditors,


I'm coming to this subreddit tonight because I am having a difficult time coping with my feelings of jealously and paranoia about the affairs which take place in the personal lives of my current and past partners. This personal issue of mine has never lead to anything that has affected my partner(s) in past relationships, nor do I believe they had realized I even foster this trait; but it does leave a heavy burden of stress, anxiety, and depression on myself. To give you further insight, let me give an example (this portion may be a little lengthy, but it does cover who we are and why I think this):


**I. 20F, background**
Currently I am dating someone I have been seeing on and off [20 F]. She's a very beautiful and attractive lady. To keep it brief, she comes to my city every summer for an internship and leaves for her home and university during Fall/Spring. I get to see her about 3 months every year. We are in the midst of our second summer together. Last summer we had an incredible thing going on, we both agreed on that! It was very depressing for the both of us when it came to an end. This summer we wanted to restart it all again, see if we still had that thing between us and so far, it has. It has been pretty good; she spends a large portion of her spare time with me and we are both on this fitness thing now, motivating one another. Many laughs, adventures, and good times. **NOTE:** We are NOT an actual couple, but have discusses and agreed we want to remain exclusive.


**II. [20F, the issue]**
There is a lot of information about this I want to share, but I will spare you the read. Look down below if you want more detail about her. So I recently received a text that has left me dreading over the idea she is on a date. When asking if she would like to go out on Friday, she told me she was busy and when I asked why, she said she was meeting with a friend.....from her internship. Now, my mind began racing because of this: she has never mentioned about any friends from her work. Never once has she even expressed any positive relations she has with fellow coworkers to me. Even earlier this week, she asked me to meet her for lunch when she hadn't prepared any earlier (this, meaning she probably had no one else to eat with). So who is this friend? Why does she sound so secretive in her text? And why hasn't she messaged or returned a text to me at all today? This is the kind of stuff that rushes through my head but I dare never say anything to her about it. It is paranoia at its finest, and it makes me sound totally obsessed. 


   ---
**Extended Detail (II.) -- Feel free to read or pass this**
Even though things between us are pretty good, I **always** have a gut feeling she is talking to someone else. She is someone that will spend a lot of time on their phone, and I don't want to be that person who checks her phone; but me not seeing who she talks to has me racing scenarios in my mind. Another note is that I have caught her lying to me a handful of times before, usually insignificant issues though. I'd like to think I can track down when she lies to me  pretty well at this point. A final note is that I see she is back on Tinder, as she has updated her profile with a picture she just took earlier this week. To be fair, she knows I uses Tinder as well; but she knows very well that I only use it for the entertainment of swiping and seeing who I match with; she has never expressed any concern with it and greeted the idea of me doing it humorously. I do not know what her intentions with Tinder are. So with all of this information in mind, I recently received a text that has left me dreading over the idea she is on a date. When asking if she would like to go out on Friday, she told me she was busy and when I asked why, she said she was meeting with a friend.....from COOP. 
   ---


These are the things that I suffer with in relationships/dating. This is only one scenario, but there are many like it. Ones with plenty of justification to make me believe this, but it is probably all in my head. What I am asking for is advice. Can anyone relate to me and if so, how to you cope with it and make it not affect your relationships and personal life? Thank you.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have come to accept that, though it is who I do not let my partner see, I am indeed a jealous person by nature. I tend to get paranoid about the loyalty of people I date. What advice can you give on coping or taming this?

  ---
**EDIT**: The note about me using Tinder is giving me some flak. Let me explain what I mean by ""entertainment"": I have a roomate who uses it and like to brag whenever he gets a match....which is not too often. Myself on the other hand can get matches fairly easily. So as playful banter between him and I, I use it to mock him. I do no messaging or meetings between my matches at all. Also, this post is not to be about the current girl. She is merely an example and if you want to build off that, go for it. But I am seeking advice on how to cope with jealousy. The example I listed above was merely to show the thought process that runs through my mind with these kinds of things. We both agree we are not a couple l, but my feelings for her make me want more. Regardless of what she thinks, I am requesting advice as to how I should go by not letting these feelings of jealousy affect me. "

I don't know who goes to this subreddit anymore but I figure I'll share my fanfic. I wonder if r/haruhi would ban me if I posted this there?**


As soon as class end I headed over to the Literary Club room as I do every day. I was looking forward to a productive afternoon of not doing my homework by playing Battleship with Itsuki, all the while sipping Ms. Asahina's tea and staring at her in her maid's outfit wishing I had the courage to make a move. At least until Haruhi shows up and starts sharing her ridiculous ideas with us to which I respond with hilariously snarky thoughts. In other words a typical weekday afternoon.

I knocked on the door and heard Ms. Asahina's soft voice telling me to come in. Only I didn't. Instead my knock was answered by the demanding voice that could only belong to the SOS Brigade's fearless leader Haruhi.

""Kyon, is that you? Get in here already!""

She's already here? This can't be good. With a groan of pre-emptive annoyance I open the door to see Haruhi sitting in front of the computer her face beaming. As usual Nagato was sitting quitely in the corner reading a thick hardcover book.

""I told Mikuru and Koizumi not to show up for today's meeting. I figured Yuki could stay though. Hey lock the door will ya!""

For a moment I feel a pang of disappointment at not getting to enjoy a cup of Ms. Asahina's tea today. Then it hits me that when Haruhi has that look on her face the lack of hot tea will be the least of my problems. I sit down at the table with a sigh. What is it this time?

""I've been doing a lot of research on the internet and have come to an important decision.""

That our webpage has an appalling lack of content.

""Who cares about that? Content is the last thing people would come looking for on the SOS Brigade's website. No this is much more important than that. I'm talking about debreasting!""

Once I pick myself and my chair up from the floor I ask the obvious question. What the fuck? Even Nagato is looking up from her book at this point.

""I'm talking about debreasting of course. You know cutting off a girl's breasts."" She says as though she were explaining a trip to the conveience store.

I don't know where to start. Why? Yeah that's a good place to start. Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhyyyy?

""As I said, I did a lot of research on the internet and it's obvious that attractive young women should want to have their tits cut off.""

Where exactly did you do this research? Encyclopedia Dramatica?

""Don't be ridiculous! It was mostly Gurochan. But everyone there is mostly posers and Otaku who write uninspired stories about anime girls getting mutilated. I'm going to do it for real.""

Suddenly I wave of fear and anger washed over me as I began to see that she was serious. ""I will NOT let you hurt Asashina! Her tits are fine right where they are!"" Well that sounded better before I said it out loud.

""You idiot. If Mikuru wants her melons removed she can do it herself. Although hooters like that would look good taxidermied. Besides, if she had a flat chest certain 'chivalrous perverts' would be able to keep their eyes off her for a change.""

And how many times have you groped her again?

""Those details are beside the point! What I'm trying to say is I need your help cutting of my breasts.""

Unable to think of a better response I facepalmed like I never facepalmed before. I closed my eyes and became certain that I soon as I opened them again everything would be normal and Haruhi would be suggesting something saner like stealing a convertable and playing mailbox baseball, carving swastikas on bathroom walls, or kidnapping the loved ones of Kyoto Animation executives and cutting parts off until we get a third season. That would at least make sense. But no instead we have a psychotic teenage girl demanding that I help her cut off her perky C-Cup breasts for no apparent reason other than that a guro site made it look like a good idea to her.

To be fair however, that is about as much of a good reason as anything else she has the SOS Brigade do. I groan again.

She's still talking. Getting louder it would seem now that she realizes I'm not paying attention. Sorry Haruhi but there is no way in any of the 18 levels of Diyu, the 9 circles of Hell or the 7 layers of Jahannam that I am having anything to do with cutting off your tits. You can bitch at me all you want but I am not listening. I am just going to bury my face deeper into my palm and inner monolouge tossing in references to things I looked up ok Wikipedia to make the reader think I'm smart. Yeah that's it I'll just ignore her until she forgets this entire th-

""Suzumiya's breasts belong to her."" Came the unexpected voice of Yuki Nagato snapping me out of my lemony narration. ""If she wants to cut them off it is her choice to do so. As her freinds we should be willing to help her.""

Wait a second. Nagato wants us to help Haruhi cut off her boobs? Seriously? No way.

""Way.""

And with that Nagato closed her book and stood up.

""Nagato, do you seriously want us to help Haruhi cut of her breasts?""

""Yes."" Nagato looks up at me with her big golden eyes. I could be wrong but her facial expression seemed to me to have the slightest hint of a smile.

""Why?""

""Because that is what she wants. She trusts us to help her with this.""

That's true. Knowing Haruhi it's not hard to imagine her attempting to cut them off herself, or perhaps even conning and or bullying a doctor to do it for her. I can pretty much picture the whole scene in my head; Haruhi grabs a doctor's hand, puts it on her tit and BAM snaps a picture. Then it’s just a simple matter to threatening him unless he cuts the damn thing off. After all who would believe the doctor's story? 'But your honor, this teenage girl forced me to grope her breast and then threatened to turn me in for sexual harassment unless I cut them off for her. I'm innocent.' A year ago I wouldn't have believed such a story.

I look at Haruhi standing in front of the computer, glaring at me. I suppose she's asking herself 'Who the hell does he think he is? His Brigade Leader gave him the order to cut off her tits and there he is just standing there. If I had asked Koizumi to lop off my udders he'd do it without a second thought, just lop them right off with an ax without ever wiping that stupid grin off his face. I should force Kyon to buy me lunch more often, I think Kyon is made of money, blah blah blah.'

Who the fuck are you kidding? You want to mutilate Haruhi and you know it. You want to hear her scream with agony as you chop her tits off even more than you want to put your face between them. You are getting hard just thinking about it. Admit it, you know it's true.

I sigh with resignation.

""Alright Haruhi, you win. I’ll help you with your debreasting.” With that her eyes light up. I'm sure people have had smaller mood swings after being told that what looked like cancer on the MRI was really just something that an intern spilled on the machine. ""But are you absolutely sure. You know there is no going back right?""

""Duh, of course! It's not like I think they are going to grow back or something.""

Well, for anyone else that might be true, but for you I wouldn't blink if they were back in a month bigger than ever.

""Soooooooooo, how we gonna do this? I'm sure we could find a paper cutter around here somewhere...""

""You dumbass! Do my tits look like they are made of paper?"" And for apparently no other reason than to accentuate her point she takes off her blouse and bra and gives me a great view of them before pointing at them. It occurs to me that despite spending all of this time discussing her boobies this is the first time I've actually seen them. It also occurs to me that I think I'm supposed to have a nosebleed right about now. ""Clearly they are made of meat, and to cut meat we need THIS.""

With that she picks up a duffle bag and puts it on the table. After unzipping it she pulls out an electric knife.

""See? This was made for cutting up bread and chicken. My tits will be a breeze for it.""

Sounds painful. I feel my cock straining against my pants picturing the blade penetrating her soft pale skin. But how are we going to stop the bleeding?

""With THIS!"" She reaches back into the duffel bag and pulls out... a butane mini-blowtorch. Ow. ""This should completely cauterize the wounds.""

Ok, it looks like she put a relatively large amount of thought into this. Perverted masochistic thought apparently. What about the blood?

""I thought of that too."" She exclaims looking very proud of herself. She turns over the duffle bag and dumps the rest of the contents onto the table. 2 large plastic tarps, a ball gag, some ropes, some towels, and a pair of falsies. ""This way I don't have to answer a bunch of stupid questions from every busybody in the whole fucking school.""

When you think about it, that might be the most astute thing Haruhi has ever said. People can't seem to mind their own business. I mean if a girl comes to class one day missing the pair of tits she had the day before you should just assume that if she wanted you to know why she would tell you. I thought about pointing out the fact that cauterizing the wound would not disinfect it and failing to clean and suture it could lead to gangrene, but assumed that if Haruhi and Yuki were ok with it there shouldn't be a problem.

As I was thinking that last paragraph Haruhi unceremoniously began taking off the rest of her clothes. In addition to finally getting to see her perky tits, it is my pleasure to report that Haruhi does in fact shave her pussy. I'm not sure but I'm fairly sure I heard a choir of angels singing.

""You know if you keep standing there with your mouth wide open a bug will fly in there."" Only Haruhi could get naked in front of you and then bitch about how you are staring. Her complete and total lack of modesty just makes it that much harder to look away. ""What are you waiting for? Take of your clothes!""

Wait, what? Why should I be taking off my clothes? You're not planning on cutting anything off of me are you?""

""So that her blood does not get onto our clothing."" Answers Nagato helpfully as she removes her coat and blouse. I’m getting to see not one but two beautiful girls naked at once. I knew I did the right thing giving my spare coins to that bum, now my good Karma is finally paying off. It seems Nagato is also diligent in keeping her pussy shaved or maybe she never had any being an artificial construct. I reluctantly undress as I ponder the mysteries of Yuki Nagato's android pubic hair.

""Dammit Kyon, I knew you were a pervert!"" Declares Haruhi, pointing at my raging hard on. ""Can't you take this seriously?""

Believe me I'm trying not to. Besides is there a man alive who wouldn't be sporting an errection standing next to you? Itsuki according to the fangirls, but his attitude during the Disappearance movie seems to contradict that.

Rather than stand around debating the sexuality of the SOS Brigade's token bishonen the three of us proceed to spread out one plastic tarp under the table and the other on top of it. Then Haruhi lays on her back on top of the table with the empty duffle bag as a pillow.

“Tie me up good and tight you two.” Orders Haruhi. “If I get an arm loose in my thrashing about you can bet I’ll punch you in the face!”

I proceed to tie her left arm and leg to the legs of the table while Yuki does the right. Then Nagato came around and completely re-did my knots. Excuse the hell out of me. It’s not like I was a Boyscout or anything.

“Haruhi, I’m about to put this gag into your mouth. Once I do there is no turning back. Are you absolutely positive that you want to do this. It’s not too late to change your mind and no one will-”

“I’m not going to change my mind!” Interrupted Haruhi. “I’ve spent weeks planning this and there’s no way I’m going to back out now so if you do-mnpt mppmh mmbpmt MNBPMNT MNKNT!”

Well that’s one way to shut her up. I turn to Yuki, standing there on the other side of the table looking up at me expectantly. I can’t help but stare at her soft petite body and A-cup breasts.

“What do we do now? Draw on her face?”

That question prompted a series of muffled curses from Haruhi.

“It would be more productive to fondle her breasts for the last time.” Answered Yuki in her usual expressionless tone before bending over and taking Haruhi’s right nipple into her mouth. I can’t help but wonder if perhaps she is injecting Haruhi with nanomachines. I reluctantly take hold of Haruhi’s left breast. This is my first time doing this with a girl and my hands are shaking. I squeeze and fondle her breast pinching the nipple. At first Haruhi appears to give off muffled protests but they quickly turn to moans of pleasure. I take her nipple into my mouth and gently suck. Nibbling it softly and stroking her flat abdomen with my hand. Why the hell does she want these cut off? They’re perfect. Damn you GuroChan!

Haruhi’s muffled protests suddenly get louder and I look up to see Nagato’s face buried between Haruhi’s legs. I can see the anger on Haruhi’s face as she shakes her tied-down legs in a futile attempt to shake Nagato loose. Nagato is completely unperturbed by this and continues flicking Haruhi’s clit with her tongue and rapidly fingering her pussy. Between that and my attention to her breasts it didn’t take long before Haruhi was attempting to scream into her ball gag in apparent ecstasy.

“It’s time.” Said Nagato tonelessly as she handed me the Electric Knife. Pushing the button activating the motorized blade I could see how this could cut easily through even the toughest roast. However I could also see how it would tear far more than it would cut. A simple butcher’s knife would cut far cleaner. Did Haruhi want the extreme pain of having her tits violently severed from her chest. I glanced at Nagato who was testing out the butane mini-blowtorch. From 3 feet away I could feel the heat of the blue tongue of flame. Apparently pain was precisely what Haruhi wanted.

“Fuck her while you cut off her tits.” I don’t know what I found more shocking, the suggestion that I more or less rape Haruhi or the shock of hearing Yuki Nagato’s dispassionate voice say “Fuck”.

“It will help her deal with the pain.” Explained Nagato. That actually makes sense, and besides Haruhi instructed us to get naked and tie her up with her legs spread. Even by non-Japanese standards that would be considered carte-blanch for us to fuck her. But is it really ok to fuck someone who rates a 5 on the Kardashev scale?

I climb on top of Haruhi, her face red with anger and indignation cursing futilely into her ballgag. Trust me, this will make it easier for you. I pressed the head of my 10 inch cock (did I mention I’m considered by some to be an extremely unreliable narrator?) against her soaking wet labia and carefully push myself in. I didn’t expect it to be nearly this tight. I break through her hymen and she lets out a muffled scream. Looks like neither of us are virgins anymore. The walls of her tight cunt squeeze my cock painfully. I slowly push the rest of the way in until I am balls deep into her and begin stroking in and out thankfully beginning to loosen up a bit. No longer threatening my life with muffled death threats Haruhi is now moaning like a slut as I fuck her formally virgin twat. Nagato stands beside Haruhi’s head holding the blowtorch and watching me unblinkingly. Am I wrong or does she look a little jealous? Me fucking Haruhi was her idea it’s not my fault I’m enjoying it.

“Are you ready Haruhi?” I ask after a few minutes brandishing the electric knife. Her dark eyes widen before she nods solemnly. “Then, I guess here goes…”

As I continue to fuck her I take the blade and lift Haruhi’s right breast with my other hand. I press the button and the motor comes alive with a buzz. I press the moving blade against her skin at the base of her underboob. Haruhi yells in pain as the blade gets approximately half an inch into her flesh.

“Do you want me to stop?” I ask. Her red tear streaked face shakes her head ‘no’. Beneath the tears her facial expression is one of determination. I should have known better, Haruhi is always determined in whatever she does.

I turn the blade back on and bring it through the meat of her C-Cup breast and out the other side. I take great care not to go too deep lest I cut something important. With the flesh completely severed I lift up the bloody mammary pillow and turn it over. Funny, I never knew human fat had such a corn yellow color to it. I show Haruhi her severed titty before setting it aside. She gazes at it with almost child-like wonder.

“Stand back.” Commands Yuki as she activates the blowtorch. She burns the flesh with the blue flame stopping the flow of blood. The delicious smell of roasted meat fills the room. I feel Haruhi’s entire body convulsing in pain and… orgasm? I feel her cunt spasming in what I believe to be an orgasm. The motions of her cunt squeezing against my cock send me over the edge and I feel myself shooting my load of cum deep into her womb. That’s when it hits me that I wasn’t wearing a condom.

I decide I’ll have to worry about that later because for now I have another tit that needs to be cut off. Again I start at the bottom and carefully sever it from her beautiful body. I show it to her only to realize that she has passed out from the pain. She looks so cute when she’s asleep and not barking orders at everyone else. Perhaps it’s best that she’s unconscious I think as Yuki readies the blowtorch.

After Nagato finishes cauterizing the 2nd wound, she bends over and bites Haruhi on the arm.

“Nanomachines?”

“Yes. This will keep her wounds from getting infected.”

“Did we do the right thing? I mean helping her with this and… well, more of less raping her.”

“Yes. Had we refused to help her she may well have performed the procedure by herself with an 82.738% chance of fatality.”

“Well that’s good to know.”

I take the two severed breasts and wrap them in some paper towels before putting them in the mini fridge. I wonder what Haruhi plans to do with them? After untying Haruhi, Nagato and I use the towels to clean the blood off of our naked bodies before getting dressed. As soon as her clothes are back on Nagato walks back to the corner of the room and resumes reading her book. I clean all of the blood off of the electric knife, taking extra care to make sure there are no fingerprints… as if that would really matter.

I spend the next fifteen minutes or so staring at Haruhi’s unconscious body laying naked on the table covered in blood and leaking semen and virgin blood from her vagina. 3rd Degree burns where her breasts used to be. I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve done something horrible. I can’t deny the fact that I enjoyed every moment of it. I’m going to hell aren’t I?

“She’s going to be ok right?”

“Vital signs are normal. She will awaken shortly.”

I gaze at her sleeping form, her pretty face and soft pale skin. I remember the first time we kissed in the closed space. I remember being told about ‘Snow White’ and ‘Sleeping Beauty’ by Adult Asashina and Nagato. I stare at her pink lips. I lower my face to hers and hear her soft breathing. I press my lips against hers and kiss her softly. I taste her swe-

SMACK!

Well, at least I’m no longer worried about how long it will take her to wake up.

“Who told you that you could kiss me?” Demanded Haruhi. “And for that matter, who told you that you could sexually assault me! As penalty you have to buy everyone lunch on weekends for a month!”

One could argue that that is the lightest sentence a rapist has ever got. One could also argue that she sure seemed to be enjoying it.

“Where did you put my breasts?”

“In the fridge?”

Giddy with excitement she pulled her removed breasts from the mini-fridge.

“Fat?” Haruhi questioned. “Where is the meat? Who is responsible for filling my breasts with fatty tissue? I’ll never forgive them! How am I supposed to serve tit-steaks at the SOS Barbeque?”

Mr. Face allow me to introduce you to Mr. Palm. I believe the two of you will get very acquainted over the next few minutes.

Haruhi got dressed and cleaned up insisting all the while that she was fine and saying something about Taxidermy. Then she left the clubroom leaving me and Nagato to clean up the bloody tarps. Thankfully Nagato simply used her space magic to make the two tarps (which I had named Exhibit A and Exhibit B to preempt the prosecution) disappear.

I sat down next to Nagato, physically and mentally exhausted. On a whim I put my arm around her. Not moving or reacting in any other way she leaned her head against my shoulder, her lavender hair against my chin. We sat like that for a few minutes neither saying anything, no sound besides the hum of the ceiling fan, our quiet breathing, and Nagato occasionally turning a page.

“Want to go to the Library?” I asked.

“Not this evening.”

“I need to go and kill some people in bloody gory ways, and abduct other people and impale them on a giant metallic tree where they will suffer incomparable agony and pain but never die as they move through non-linear time.”

I sat open jawed for about ten seconds with no idea how to respond.

“That was a joke.”

I let out a sigh of relief. No one on Earth could possibly do deadpan humor the way Yuki Nagato can.

“I have all the time in the world to do that.”

But no constantly all I ever fucking see is that the best way to get involved is to have talent of your own and to know someone. Are u fucking kidding me!! I'm sure that I don't need to tell anyone that the world is full of talented people, people who are actually 10x more talented then half the people who actually are famous. So that reason is pointless so all that's left seems to be that you have to know people, oh for fucks sake, are you honestly telling me that the majority of famous people were just lucky enough to stumble across someone one day or just happened to be friends with someone who knew someone else. Is that how shitty directors, writers and other people can still get work because they just have connections out the ass so it doesn't matter and they don't have to work hard at all. This is an absolute fucking joke, it's just like a tiny microcosm of selfish people who only look out for themselves and that's it, with a few exceptions. Don't believe me? Well why is that you can't just simply google search a talent agent to work with you, or some festivals to get involved with? Nope!! Cuz nothing is fucking sacred!!! I can't tell you how often I get sites that say oh we'll keep you updated but you'll have to pay a monthly subscription to see if your chosen, or oh you need more experience, how can I gain experience if I don't get involved to obtain said experience. Or just the endless, endless amounts of scams that fill screenplays and film contests, that you feel completely uncomfortable to give any of them a try. I mean I just don't get it, I see constantly articles about how reputation is sooooo important if it was so important than we wouldn't be getting so many shit things made would we. How the fuck do people get involved?!?! It's like a bunch of mini clubhouses each with their own little sign on the door saying ""members only."" I'm trying so hard to be a writer and director, and I'm not the only one I'm nothing special in that regard. But when I think of all the amazing ideas out there that creative people who are obsessed and passionate about this art form come up with everyday, that all just go to waste and will never be heard of by no one, it fucking pisses me off. Heck I'll work with anyone who's not an asshole and would be actually interested in helping me and my friends out, heck we don't even have to start with just our ideas, why not we all collaborate on one idea, or create an anthology type of film with all our own ideas mixed together. This shit just is beyond stupid to even comprehend how the hell we as people even got to this point where it's so hard to get stuff made and seen, and especially be taken seriously. None of this ""well if you want your stuff taken seriously and seen just shoot on an iPhone and put it on the internet"", no dammit I want to make a living doing this, I don't have to be filthy fucking rich, and the amount of videos that are put on the internet that exact same way, none really stand out. I want to make stuff, get it in festivals, get it distributed, it takes time I get that. But it shouldn't take this absurdly long time that I'm constantly told, like, why?! Why is it like this?! I actually find writing and directing absurdly simple and easy to do, I've written dozens of screenplays and I've directed several projects with friends and people I just met and they tell me that they're impressed with what I can do, yet here I'm constantly being told by ""professionals"" that it takes tons of time and paying your dues and starting at the bottom of the food chain to get a job doing what you actually want to do. Why the fuck is that?!?!? This isn't a job being a doctor or anything like that where years and years of practice and experience is incredibly important because your dealing with diseases and people's lives. Our job is literally playing pretend people, tons of celebrities are rich off of playing pretend, it's not hard to play pretend (to some people it is but not the majority who actually know what they're doing). It's just absurd that you'd have to do all that meaningless stuff to ""work your way up"" or ""earn the respect"" of people who will get you going. Dumb projects that everyone knows will flop and not make any money made by people who couldn't give a shit get greenlit to be made all the damn time, and great ideas are just sitting around with producers going ""well we could make this but it's too big of a risk."" Just, for fucks sake people. I can't imagine the amount of people who just want to share their ideas with the world in the highest possible quality they can, but nope unless your born wealthy or maybe buddies with someone just flush your dreams and your hardwork down the toilet, and keep working a job you fucking hate your whole life till you die just cuz you don't get the smallest, tiniest opportunity that other people no more talented than you just so happened to get, fuck!!!!"
6hrnwa,42,2017-06-17,The East Area Rapist - Original Night Stalker part 12. This is the last entry in my series.,Nerdfather1,EARONS,https://www.reddit.com/r/EARONS/comments/6hrnwa/the_east_area_rapist_original_night_stalker_part/,"Welcome back. We are now entering into the Original Night Stalker's territory. In this entry, I will be discussing the horrific murders caused by this unknown assailant who has never been apprehended, let alone properly identified. This will be the final entry in this incredibly long journey. A lot of time has been invested in this unsolved crime spree, yet I feel as if I have barely scratched the surface. Hopefully, this series garnishes enough attention to spread more awareness to those who aren't familiar with this unforgivable rapist and murderer.

**Dr. Robert Offerman and Dr. Debra Manning**

On October 1, 1979, The East Area Rapist had traveled from Northern California to Goleta, California. He attempted to break into a home and continue his spree of rapes, yet his attack was ultimately botched. Whether the last strike was carelessly planned, he made a conscious decision to graduate from mere terrorizing and raping a female woman, to full-blown murder in the early morning hours of December 30, 1979.

At around 3:00 in the morning, a neighbor of Dr. Robert Offerman had woken up to use the bathroom. While he was getting himself out of bed, the sound of three gunshots suddenly rang out from his next door neighbor's residence. The sound woke up the neighbor's wife, to which both immediately peered out their bedroom window. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary other than the Offermans' glass sliding doors had been left ajar, yet no lights had been illuminating throughout the household. 

As the police made their way inside the Offerman's residence, they stumbled upon Dr. Debra Manning laying face down on the bed with her hands and wrists bound behind her back. She had been murdered by a single gunshot wound to the skull, execution style. Next to her on the floor was Dr. Robert Offerman, who had been shot four times; one in his chest and four in the back. Twine was dangling from his left wrist, indicating he managed to partially get free of his bindings but wasn't quick enough to stop the assailant.

**Noteworthy points**

* Upon further examination of the crime scene, the investigators found clear evidence that ransacking, albeit lightly, had taken place in the bedroom. While they were looking for a specific point of entry, they discovered a turkey bone next to a glass sliding door. On the patio was a turkey carcass in a plastic bag. The murderer had taken the family's leftover Christmas turkey dinner and had eaten it after murdering the couple. 

* The couple was murdered by a .38 caliber revolver, along with Super Vel brand .38 ammunition. 

* The home had three glass sliding doors that led inside. The police investigators discovered each door had pry marks on them.

* Inside the home, every light switch was turned off, as well as the thermostat.

* Debra Manning managed to take off her jewelry and hide it under the mattress and the bedframe before she was murdered.

* The twine used to bind the victims were 1/16 in diameter and the color was nylon and rayon. Moreover, they were tied in a diamond knot as well. Interestingly enough, the twine was discovered on the patio of residences living on 773 Avenida Pequena; a home just down the street from the crime. Furthermore, next door to the Offerman's home was a condo. The residence was vacant, yet a registered nurse had plans of moving in soon. The police found the home had been broken into it. There were pry marks on the wooden framing of the front door, along with a window screen being removed. Underneath the window were footprints matching the same shoe impressions discovered in Robert Offerman's backyard. When the police went inside the vacant condo, numerous strings of twine were littered inside; the same matching the bindings used for Robert Offerman and Debra Manning.

* The police were seeking any [possible motive](http://imgur.com/a/cZMM3) for their deaths, hoping the public would be able to assist them. [Another newspaper article](http://imgur.com/a/0nVu1) details the tragic event.

* When the police canvassed the neighborhood, they discovered a neighbor reported hearing Dr. Robert Offerman's vehicle -- a Porsche -- pull into the parking lot. Afterward, she heard three voices, two of which were Robert and Debra. She was unable to recognize the third voice, though she believed it was a male speaking.

* According to the neighbors who initially heard the gunshot(s) echoing from Dr. Offerman's home, they were looking outside of their window at 3:17 a.m. and witnessed a white vehicle, possibly a Pinto or Honda, driving slowly away from the parking lot with the headlights off. 

* Another nearby neighbor discovered their son's bicycle had been stolen sometime during the night of the attack. It was later found several blocks away. Additionally, the same twine from the Offerman residence and other surrounding areas was found in their backyard as well. 

* An autopsy was conducted on Robert and Debra. Though nothing substantial could be discovered from Robert, the medical examiner unearthed two blue-green flakes on her big toe that were identified as architectural paint, along with loose hairs found on her back.

* Two days after the murders, more evidence was found on a dirt trail with a creek bed a relatively short distance away. The same twine material was found, along with shoe impressions and dog footprints. 

* The detectives working the case investigated the background(s) of Dr. Offerman and Dr. Manning, to see if any new light could be shed on a possible motive for their deaths. Apparently, both Robert and Debra were having an affair with one another. At the time, they were currently in the process of getting a divorce from their significant other. Debra's soon-to-be ex-husband was questioned but he was soon quickly eliminated as a suspect because he was on a skiing trip at Lake Tahoe and his entire story corroborated perfectly with a polygraph test. As for Robert's soon-to-be ex-wife, she too was eliminated as a suspect.

* Two days before Robert and Debra were murdered, they attended a house-party together on 452 Toltec Way. Those who attended the party were primarily doctors and lawyers.

* Earlier in the afternoon before the murders occurred, a lot of strange activity took place in the general area of where Dr. Robert Offerman lived. A prowler was reported breaking into a home with a round screwdriver on 5419 Parejo Drive. This location is very close to where The East Area Rapist failed his attempted rape on October 1, 1979. Shortly thereafter, an unknown individual had burglarized a home on 5422 Hannah Drive, which was nearby. The family's safe had been pried open, and a wedding ring band and cash were stolen. Not too long later at approximately 6:10 in the evening, a family living on Windsor Street spotted a woman dressed in all dark clothing, shoulder-length hair, and in her early twenties standing at their neighbor's front door. One hour later, the same family witnesses another person standing at the front door; this time, a white male who was 5'8 in height. The family thought it was peculiar, but they continued on with their own business. Thirty minutes later, they see the same male figure again standing at the front door; nothing arose from the situation. However, two hours later -- now 9:30 p.m. -- a home on 5470 Queen Anne Lane was burglarized. In the backyard was twine that later matched what was used during the murder(s). Moreover, the glass sliding doors had been pried open and a couple two-dollar bills, jewelry, and a class ring from the 1946 class of Merchant Marine with the initials HJH had been stolen. A short while after this incident occurred, a family returning home from the theater saw a stranger running out of their living room and into the backyard before scaling a fence that leads to Mountain View School. They hurriedly ran inside and found their poodle dog had been injured, though nothing was missing from the home. Whoever the intruder was, he left shoe impressions in the backyard, which later matched those found at the murder scene hours later. The family said the stranger was wearing a dark jacket with a fisherman style hat. 

* The majority of these dubious reports of a prowler and break-ins happened within a mile of each other.

* The police later discovered in their questioning that one year prior, a prowler was seen twice in the vicinity. Each report detailed the stranger as approximately 6'0 tall and dressed in all dark clothing and a stocking cap. This took place on Vineyard Road, Santa Barbra, between 2:00 - 2:30 in the morning. Each time the prowler was spotted, he turned around and jumped the nearby fence.

**Lyman and Charlene Smith**

After the double homicide before the new year, the killer dubbed the Original Night Stalker went on a three-month break before he returned on March 13, 1980, in Ventura, California; a forty minute commute from Goleta, California, where the two previous murders occurred. 

It was Thursday, March 13, 1980, when an older woman awoke to the sound of her great Dane barking at 2:00 in the morning. This startled the homeowner, so she decided to look out of her windows, but nothing seemed amiss. 

Nonetheless, her dog remained persistent on leading her outside to a side gate that leads to the backyard of the Smith residence, where the dog strangely sat quietly. Again, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, so she eventually made her way back inside and went to sleep.

On March 16, 1980, Lyman's twelve-year-old son, Gary Smith, left his mother's home to bicycle to his father's and step-mother's home to mow the lawn as he generally did as a chore. He arrived at approximately 2:00 in the afternoon and was greeted by the gardeners tending to other sections of the lawn.

Before Gary got started with his chore(s), he went inside his father's home and heard an alarm clock relentlessly buzzing in the master bedroom. Curious by the peculiarity, he peeked his head inside the bedroom and discovered two anomalies laying in bed with the bed sheets draped over them. This confused Gary, so he walked over to the bed and pulled the sheets away, only to discover his father laying face down completely nude, with his hands and feet bound by a nylon drapery cord. 

Charlene Smith -- Gary's stepmother -- was next to her husband, face up with only a t-shirt on. Her hands and wrists had been bound behind her back, and her ankles were crisscrossed and fastened. Out of utter shock and terror, Gary stumbled backward, automatically screaming and crying before running to the nearest landline to notify the police. 

The investigators quickly arrived at the crime scene and made their way into the home to gather evidence left behind. While they were examining each room in the home, it was the master bedroom itself that contained the majority of the crime, as it appeared the couple was attacked unexpectedly. Moreover, the bedroom itself seemed to be ransacked, with dresser drawers sprawled open and belongings were thrown onto the floor. 

In between the couple was a wooden log taken from Lyman's backyard firewood stack, believed to be the murder weapon. Various pieces of wood and bark were scattered all over the bedroom carpet due to the immense amount of force used to bludgeon the couple to death. Their blood had been strewn all over the bedroom walls and dressers. 

Once the crime scene was taped off and all of the evidence gathered, logged, and collected, a canvass of the neighborhood, along with friends and family members questioned, more light came to the forefront regarding the Lyman and Charlene's brutal slaying. 

**Noteworthy points**

* Charlene Smith had been raped. There were other signs that shown she had been intimate with her husband shortly before their untimely deaths. More information can be found [here](http://www.santapaulatimes.com/news/archivestory.php/aid/1627/Lyman___Charlene_Smith_murder_revealed_to_be_work_of_serial_killer.html). Additional information can be found in [this newspaper article](http://imgur.com/a/8JR4o).

* Interestingly, Dr. Robert Offerman and Lyman Smith's home had striking similarities in its design and overall layout.

* In both murder cases, the victims were tied with a nautical knot, also referred to as a diamond knot.

* The cushion pillows from the family sofa had been removed and placed behind the sofa. Furthermore, a black cloth was found underneath one of the cushions.

* Lyman Smith was a prominent lawyer waiting for a judgeship. Prior to living in Ventura, California, he had lived in Sacramento, California, where he attended Bella Vista Highschool. A classmate of his ended up working for the Sacramento Sheriff's Department.

* On March 8. 1980, a nearby resident living on High Point Road heard someone scuffling in her backyard. Someone was trying to jiggle her bathroom window as if unloosening it. The commotion stopped shortly after and because nothing else happened, she never called the police. 

* Sometime during the night of the murders, a person living on El Malabar spotted a white 1970's Pontiac Sedan parked on the corner of High Point Road -- the same location of which the reported prowler was tampering with a woman's bathroom window. Apparently, this vehicle hadn't belonged to any residents in the general vicinity. 

* Days after the murder, between March 17 - 18, another resident living on High Point Road claimed to be a victim of a possible break-in. The family's infant son had woken up crying in the middle of the night. The following afternoon, the husband searched around his property to see if anything had been tampered with. He discovered his son's bedroom window screen completely removed and stolen. Strangely, he didn't notify law enforcement until seven days later. Moreover, on the same night the child had woken up, another local on High Point Road heard a neighbor's dog bark relentlessly for forty-five minutes at approximately 4:00 a.m.

* As the police continued to conduct their investigation, they came across a possible suspect by the name Joe Alsip. He was an acquaintance of Lyman Smith by a legal partnership. Shortly before the murders, Joe had been in their home visiting. This particular piece of information stemmed from a priest who claimed Joe had confessed to him about murdering the couple. Joe, of course, pleaded innocence and denied all allegations brought forth by the clergyman. Nevertheless, Joe served a one-year stint in prison but was acquitted because of a lack of credibility from the priest who enjoyed inserting himself into various unsolved crime cases.

* Interestingly, despite the outward appearance of feeling content and loved in the marriage, Charlene Smith was secretly having an affair with a former deputy sheriff, Rick Atwood, for nearly an entire year. However, Rick was completely oblivious that Charlene was married. Once he realized Charlene's unfaithfulness, his vexation prompted him to write an angry letter of resentment dedicated to her, of which he delivered to the Smiths' residence. Eventually, Lyman Smith read the note and immediately confronted his wife about the content of the letter. Despite Rick's confirmation of Charlene being married, a part of him was in utter denial. In order to convince Rick, Lyman invited him to his homestead. He accepted the offer. Lyman proceeded to escort Rick throughout his home and showed family photos and other miscellaneous items that demonstrated the evidence.

**Keith and Patrice Harrington**

Once the Original Night Stalker murdered Lyman and Charlene Smith, another large gap in time occurred. It wouldn't be until Thursday, August 19, 1980, in Dana Point, California, when the heinous killer emerged from the darkness to kill once again. 

Keith and his wife were living in a home inside a gated community owned by his father, Roger Harrington, who happily allowed them to stay while Keith finished up his schooling as a medical student. He was in his third year and had an internship already planned.

On August 21, 1980, Roger had plans of eating dinner with his son and daughter-in-law. When he tried walking inside he noticed the main door had been locked, which was unusual. Nonetheless, he grabbed the spare key hidden nearby and made his way in. The home was eerily quiet and nobody seemed to around despite vehicles being in the garage. In the kitchen were newly bought bags of groceries atop the kitchen counter and not stored away.

Sensing something wasn't right, Roger began walking throughout the home and checking each room for Keith and Patrice. That's when he noticed the guest bedroom door was closed. Not wanting to barge in and disturb them, he simply peeked his head inside and saw two people seemingly asleep under the sheets and blankets, yet it was entirely too early for them to be sleeping with groceries not stored away.

Roger knew something was amiss as he slowly walked to the side of the bed and pulled the blankets away. The sight sent him into an uncontrollable frenzy, discovering his son and daughter-in-law had been brutally bludgeoned to death. Their blood had been soaked through the mattress and pillows. Roger immediately contacted his other three sons and the Orange County Sheriff's Department who arrived hastily at the scene.

**Noteworthy points**

* Keith Harrington was a third-year medical student at UC Irvine. Patrice was a registered nurse. Once again, in terms of The East Area Rapist and now Original Night Stalker, more connections to the medical field arose. Furthermore, two brothers of Keith's were attorneys, while another was a psychologist.

* The police investigators found no sign of forcible entry. Moreover, the question has to be asked, was this murder intentionally planned beforehand? Though not entirely, this murder posed its set of challenges. Roger's home was located inside a gated community and there were only three ways of entering. One is through the gate by the security guard. Another is by having access to the gate code itself. Lastly, the third option is by scaling the fence. This attack was the first time the Original Night Stalker had struck in a tight-knit gated community. Moreover, there had been no reports of any dubious prowlers before or after the murders.

* This double-homicide presented clear signs of learning for the Original Night Stalker. After binding Keith and Patrice -- making them immobile -- he placed the bed sheets over the couple before bludgeoning them to death. This helped eliminate blood spatter on the murderer himself and the bedroom walls. Additionally, bruising was found on the wrists and ankles of each victim indicated they had been bound, but the killer had removed the restraints after their death. 

* The cause of death was blunt force trauma, but the investigators couldn't find a murder weapon at the crime scene. The killer had apparently taken it with him. However, fragments of brass were discovered protruding from Patrice's head due to the excessive force used. Though it can't be conclusively proven, the general consensus is that the murderer used the sprinkler head from the family's lawn. A point of reference can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/zYt9r) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/5ipxx).

* Before Patrice was murdered, she had been raped by her assailant. 

* Several blocks away from the crime scene, a blood-stained motocross glove was found.

* After a significant amount of time had passed since the murders, forensics discovered the murderer who raped Patrice had a vasectomy. Unfortunately, in 2010, Detective Larry Montgomery checked with those in charge of handling the DNA evidence for the murder(s) from the Original Night Stalker and The East Area Rapist and found out no such evidence existed of a possible vasectomy. This caused a major hindrance in the overall investigation because due to the supposed fact of the vasectomy, law enforcement had a prime suspect by the name of ""Waz"" for the murders, but he was hesitantly eliminated as a suspect.

* Although this was a horrific tragedy, one blessing managed to some through it. Keith's older brother, Bruce Harrington, helped fund and create Proposition 69, which is a law that prisoners will have to mandatorily donate their DNA to a statewide database. [Here is a very interesting article](http://www.danapointtimes.com/new-interest-in-a-cold-case/) that goes more in-depth about the entire scenario.

**Manuela Witthuhn**

As the breaks expanded between each murder(s), the Original Night Stalked halted his murder spree until the following year on February 6, 1981, when he paid a visit to Columbus, Irvine, and murdered twenty-eight-year-old mortgage broker, Manuela Witthuhn.

At the time of her untimely demise, Manuela's husband had been hospitalized at Santa Ana-Tustin Community Hospital -- now Newport Specialty Hospital -- for an infection. Manuela, who suffered from anxiety and wasn't fond of being alone overnight, was hesitant on staying home by herself. When unfortunate times such as this happened, she would sleep in her sleeping bag because it provided a sense of extra security for her. 

Her father, knowing her daughter's condition, happily offered her to stay with him until her husband was released from the hospital. She declined, but he insisted that she should at least let his German Shepherd stay with her, but again, she said no and assured him she would be okay.

On Friday, February 6, 1981, Manuela was home alone. Her husband tried contacting her from the hospital to simply check in and converse before going to bed. He wasn't able to reach her, so he called Manuela's mother to ask if she was around. She told him she hadn't heard anything from her; out of concern, she went to her daughter's home to see if everything was alright. 

When she arrived, she stumbled upon a ghastly scene. Her daughter had been savagely beaten due death while still in her sleeping bag in the master bedroom. She screamed in sheer terror and immediately notified the police. Upon their arrival, they quickly escorted the distraught mother away from the crime scene and taped off the area with yellow caution tape to begin their investigation.

**Noteworthy points**

* Hours prior to the murder at 11:00 at night, a woman living directly behind Manuela arrived home and found her dead bolt for the main door had been unlocked.

* Manuela was raped before she was viciously murdered. There had been ligature marks around her wrists and ankles, and her cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the skull. However, as reminiscent of the previous murder case, the material used for binding, along with the murder weapon, had been removed from the crime scene. 

* Pry marks were found on the sliding glass doors where the murderer made his forceful entry with a flathead screwdriver with brown paint on it that was left behind.

* Burnt wooden matches were littered throughout the home and family garage. The same type of matches had reportedly been found at the murder scene of Dr. Robert Offerman and Dr. Debra Manning on December 30, 1979.

* Shoe impressions were discovered in Manuela's backyard. One of such appeared to be a ""Tred 2"" racquetball-style print. 

* The assailant had stolen a lamp and crystal curio, both of which weighed approximately nine pounds each. Furthermore, a tape recording from the family's telephone machine was missing. According to those investigating the murder, the home seemed as if it had been purposefully, but poorly staged as a burglary. From their judgment, they suspect Manuela knew her rapist and murderer personally. 

* Due to the strangeness of this murder and the notable differences from previous attacks affiliated with the Original Night Stalker, the two cases weren't linked until years later when forensic evidence from DNA connected the two together. You can read more from this very brief [newspaper clipping](http://imgur.com/a/Iz3az).

* Now that it had been proven the Original Night Stalker raped and murdered Manuela, the question is, why? He deviated from his modus operandi and attacked a woman home alone. Did he go off course, or was he planning to murder her husband as well, only to find he wasn't present?

**Greg Sanchez and Cheryl Smith-Domingo**

Five months had gone by before the Original Night Stalker returned to where it all began on July 27, 1981, in Goleta, California. Cheryl Domingo's aunt had been living a half-mile away from where Dr. Robert Offerman and Dr. Debra Manning was murdered. Though two years had flown by since the unexpected tragedy, a sense of unease and paranoia clouded her mind regularly. Due to that, she had put her residence up for sale. Meanwhile, Cheryl would occasionally house-sit until the property could be sold. 

On the night of the murders, her boyfriend, Greg Sanchez was accompanying her. At the time, their relationship had been rocky, with them frequently breaking-up and mending the relationship. 

Earlier in the afternoon -- on July 26, 1981 -- John Sullivan, the real estate agent in charge of selling the property had a potential buyer who wanted to look at the residence. During this scheduled event, another male adult had randomly arrived unexpectedly. Nevertheless, the agent didn't consider it much of a roadblock and let him check out the property as well.

The following afternoon, John Sullivan had appointments with more prospective buyers. As he was providing a tour to one of the family's, he opened the door to the master bedroom, and when he did a horrific sight was unearthed. Cheryl Domingo was laying motionless on the bed, and Greg was partially nude with the lower part of his body protruding from the closet doorway.

**Noteworthy points**

* According to Richard Shelby, the unexpected prospective buyer who showed up during John's scheduled appointment had removed the screen from the bathroom window in order to sneak inside later that evening.

* While the real estate agent was guiding the family around the home shortly before discovering the grizzly crime scene, when he opened the master bedroom door, the family's three-year-old son peeked his head inside and saw the gruesome scene. It's allegedly rumored the child was so traumatized by what he saw that he didn't speak or utter a single word for nearly a year. 

* The crime scene painted a clear picture of what transpired during the murders. Greg and Cheryl had been sleeping in bed when he had heard strange noises emanating from the bathroom. While he was getting out of bed to check on the sound, he encountered the murderer in the bedroom doorway. He was quickly shot in the face, causing him to fall back into the closet. The wound was not fatal, but the assailant had quickly run to Greg and repeatedly used a blunt-force object to hit him in the face and skull, subsequently removing hanged clothes and draping them over his head. Afterward, he focused his attention on the petrified girlfriend, Cheryl. Though Greg was not discovered to be bound because of the abrupt attack, Cheryl's body indicated she had been bound by her wrists and ankles. Strangely, unlike past murder victims, Cheryl had been hog-tied.

* A local resident nearby stated he had witnessed a man standing behind a tree at 9:45 at night when he realized someone was watching him. Fifteen minutes later a married couple on a leisurely walk around the neighborhood reported they were being followed by a young white male with shaggy blond hair down to his neck. He was approximately 5'11 and very thin.

* During the murder(s), between 3:15 - 3:30 in the morning, many surrounding residents heard a single gunshot being fired, but nobody thought to call the police.

* One witness claimed to see a young white male with a dog jogging away from the murder scene.

In a strange turn of events, the Original Night Stalker disappeared for five years after murdering Greg Sanchez and Cheryl Dominguez. It's unknown what transpired in this interval of time. Nevertheless, speculations and theories went rampant.

Law enforcement considered the likelihood of the reprehensible murderer simply becoming complacent and bored with his atrocious crime spree due to the prolonged gap in-between the murders. Others speculated the possibility the individual required an out-of-state job or even a possible stint in prison for a lesser charge. Some people even suggested he ended up in a mental facility for an extended period of time.

Regrettably, nobody has an accurate answer to his sudden disappearance. However, though he wasn't apprehended in this five-year period, communities in Southern California were beginning to feel comfortable in their neighborhoods again. The sense of paranoia and untrustworthiness amongst others were fading away and life was seemingly back to normal.

The dark and gloomy cloud looming over the Original Night Stalker's hunting ground started to disperse, and his crimes, though never forgotten, lives of surviving family members were beginning to put their broken hearts back together and find a sense of peace and closure.

Unfortunately, this newfound peace shared within many residents unexpectedly shattered when on May 4, 1986, the murder of an eighteen-year-old girl sent waves of terrified panic across the town of Irvine, California. 

---

**Janelle Cruz**

The night was Sunday, May 4, 1986, in Irvine, California. Janelle Cruz -- an eighteen-year-old cashier at Bullwinkle's Pizza -- was at home with a male friend while her family was vacationing in Mexico. 

During their get-together, they began hearing unidentified noises occurring outside of Janelle's bedroom window. They laughingly joked and shrugged the incident off, dismissing the sound as a pestering cat. Shortly thereafter, another startling sound echoed from inside the family garage. Once again, they blamed the sound on the washing machine.

Some time had passed since any abnormal noises were made and the male friend decided it was time to go back home. The time was approximately 10:45 p.m. Afterward, nothing seemed amiss. The following evening at 5:00 p.m. a real estate agent who had been scheduled to tour a prospective buyer for the Cruz's' home arrived at the residence to make the necessary preparations.

He knocked on the front door multiple times but didn't receive an answer. Nonetheless, he made is way inside anyway and was making sure things were tidied up before presenting the home. That's when he stumbled upon the deceased body of Janelle Cruz sprawled out diagonally across her bed with a blanket draped over her. The sight stupefied the real estate agent, sending him into a hysterical fit of emotion as he swiftly alerted the police.

**Noteworthy points**

* Unlike previous murders where the Original Night Stalker was learning to make less of a mess in terms of blood spatter, on this occasion, Janelle's blood was found in many sections of the home, including the kitchen floor and cabinets, near the front door, wooden shutters on the inside of the windows, and her bedroom. More information can be found in [this newspaper clipping](http://imgur.com/a/nXjk0).

* The police found blades of grass on the bed where Janelle was raped and murdered. As they examined the yard, they discovered shoe impressions. It's more than plausible the sound Janelle and her male friend heard stemmed from the Original Night Stalker preparing for his attack.

* It may not be entirely important in the grand scheme of things, but the residence of Janelle Cruz had an insurance policy with Frederic Sauer Insurance Agency; the same insurance held on Dr. Robert Offerman's home.

* Prior to Janelle's untimely murder, she had spent a significant amount of time in two separate psychiatric hospitals due to overwhelming emotional stress.

* Sickening rumors circulated following Janelle's death. In particular, people were spreading illegitimate stories that Janelle had been molested by her step-father and numerous people affiliated with the military, one of which was a Marine stationed at El Toro. He lived less than a mile away from Janelle (and close to Manuela Witthuhn) and owned a business marketing dental supplies with his wife. Furthermore, shortly before Janelle's murder, she had spent a total of $2,000 dollars on dental work.

* When the police conducted their investigation searching for a possible motive for the murder, Janelle's good friend, Greg, told investigators about a man referred to as the *Kitten Man.* This person was supposedly meant to meet Janelle at her home the evening of her death, to bring over a few kittens for her to choose to have as a pet. Apparently, Greg had met this individual at the local swimming pool. When he approached him for a conversation, the man tried avoiding him and refused to speak. Greg sensed something suspicious about the man and promptly told Janelle to stay away from him.

* More oddities surrounding the alleged *Kitten Man* came to the forefront. Supposedly, Greg had attended the same high school as him (Woodbridge High). Moreover, a woman named Amber, but often referred to as *Bambi*, was friends with *Kitten Man.* Years later -- post-graduation -- rumors began surfacing that stated Amber became pregnant by an unknown individual. Eventually, due to their friendship, she had temporarily moved in with *Kitten Man,* who lived on the Marine Core Air Station base. Strangely, Amber and *Kitten Man* have never been identified and there is no evidence suggesting they even exist.

* The sudden murder of Janelle Cruz was the Original Night Stalker's last known victim. As to why he suddenly appeared and disappeared in the blink of an eye is not clear.

This officially concludes my series on The East Area Rapist and Original Night Stalker. I have to thank everyone who invested their time in reading and sharing my entries. Your generosity, support, and overall kind words and dedication helped motivate me to continue writing a new post each week. Though my series has ended, the story of The East Area Rapist and Original Night Stalker hasn't. This monstrous criminal has yet to be identified and apprehended. It's important to spread awareness for this case that has largely gone under the radar. Whether this person is alive or dead, the case still has a chance to be solved. As always, I'll link my sources and previous posts below.

6hrpm1,1,2017-06-17,My (24m) roommate/friend (24m) is slowly sinking into depression and I have no idea how to help,WhiteMercury,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hrpm1/my_24m_roommatefriend_24m_is_slowly_sinking_into/,"We've been friends since our first year of uni and have roomed together off and on several times. We (to my knowledge) have no issues with each other, roommate wise. I've just finally finished my schooling after taking some extended time off due to mental health and just started a new job doing what I love.

However, he's not doing so hot. He also took time off but hasn't been able to really succeed after coming back. I know he's failed at least two classes since fall, and likely at least one more. He hasn't been able to get any sort of relevant internship in his field and had to pick up an outdoor manual labor job for the summer. His long distance girlfriend (22f) (they usually see each other once every 6 weeks ish) has just graduated uni but is living 300km away with her family until she can go back for a graduate degree. They haven't seen each other all summer (and likely won't since neither has much money for travel).

Over the past semester, and even more so over the summer, he's just been sliding down a slope of despair and doesn't seem to be making any effort to fix things. I understand mental health is hard, I've been there and failed my own share of semesters, but he doesn't seem to want to fix it. He leans on alcohol, an abundance of sleeping/naps, or hours and hours of video games to try and cope. I've tried to gently help, but haven't seemed to get anywhere. What's the best thing I can do to help him out? I feel like my success is making him resent me a bit but I just want him to succeed too. 

Tldr: roommate depressed, how can I help him succeed?"
6hrr7e,1,2017-06-17,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6hrr7e/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
6hrwsw,12,2017-06-17,My 2 year old son has had 3 stomach bugs in 3 months.,zaphne,emetophobia,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/6hrwsw/my_2_year_old_son_has_had_3_stomach_bugs_in_3/,"Ugh. I've never posted here before, but I've had this phobia for probably 27 years. I have made a lot of progress in desensitizing myself to it. Now I can mostly watch it in movies. I was able to clean out disgusting mouths and perform dysphagia (swallowing) therapy in a hospital for my grad school internship as a speech language pathologist. I've come a long way from sobbing and screaming at the top of my lungs with a blanket over my head and my hands over my ears when my poor little sister gets sick in the same room while we are watching tv, and running panicked and yelling out of a college dorm bathroom mid-pee when a drunk dormmate needed the stall next to me to evacuate her beers.

But.

I now have a 2 year old. Who goes to daycare.

And 5 times in his life he has had some sort of stomach-affecting virus. 3 of which have been in the last 3 months. 

It is so hard...SO HARD to be the calm and comforting rock of a parent I need to be for him when I can hardly stand to be near him when he's this sick. My husband's job is such that he can't be the one to take time off to hold a sick baby all day. It always falls to me. I end up covered in towels and vomit, as my son refuses to get it in any receptacle 90% of the time. I medicate my son with a mini dosage of oral dissolving zofran when it happens, but even that didn't stop the one this week.

It was bad. Fortunately, only for 24 hours.

And now I fear I am passing the phobia on to him. He gets so scared, I can see it in his eyes. I know he notices my gut fear reaction to any burp or cough that sounds....a little too wet. He will either preemptively reassure me he's okay, or get a nervous look and ask for water and sometimes say, ""I might frow up,"" which is not necessarily a reliable statement at this age, but puts me on edge nonetheless. And when it happens, he just cries and cries. ""I frow up today. It didn't feel better."" :(

It sucks so much to see him so pathetic and scared and miserable. It sucks to have to be there for him when I can barely hold it together.

It was easier when these bugs happened with like 6 months break in between. I could at least feel comforted by that. Like okay, I did my time, I don't have to do it again for a while now. But 3 in 3 months??? WHAT THE FUCK. It just isn't fair. I can't take much more of this.

 I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything, if you read the prompts you will realize I am flexible and open to all sort of things so please don't feel shy of pitching me your idea)

**Opportunistic**

Rick (a nearly underage boy ) watches you shiver craving for cock, his eyes look at your red lips and down at your cleavage as he realises he has a chance to fuck a much older girl, in fact this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unlesss he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load.
""Ok.."" he nods as you beg for him to fuck you raw...he drops his backpack and starts to unzip his shirt revealing a large bulge under his underpants. Before he continues you presse ""STOP"" button on the lift.
Bassically you are someone who is aware of his condition and either by pure need of cum or altruism reasons you take the opportunity of us being alone to make me unload a large period of time worh of cum. As it is a generous amount it would be life threatening to have it all done in one go, so you would plan to have me nut several times throughout the roleplay 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my teen daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw Kaley (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that Kaley was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as Kaley? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent little girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) A innocent little sleepover with your 2 friends and you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them and want to learn everything, but no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks), lingerie, thick girls, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.

A true partnership, if you will, where the guy appreciates a confident and capable older woman who demonstrates sexual self-agency and has no issue taking the lead. And if you're more interested in femdom, I'm game for that so long as it isn't based on degradation/debasement, humiliation, or cruelty.

___
I'm open to a fair number of settings here involving the older woman x younger man pairing, and I have a few ideas.

**High fantasy where magic is commonplace:** A noblewoman deciding upon another form of gratitude for my character doing her a service, be it classically heroic or dealing with a rival from the shadows? Perhaps my character serving as a queen/empress's right-hand man?

**Real-life:** A college student and his older neighbor? An intern/expert scenario that grows into something more? Office shenanigans between a boss and employee or co-workers? A college professor and a college student having a mutual attraction (*no ""sex for grades"" plots, please*)? A female celebrity having some private time with her personal assistant, or a fan who wins the opportunity of a lifetime? Some related plots are below:

&gt; 1. *Colleagues with feelings for one another--A and B--are paired up to work on a long-term project together into the late hours of the night.*
&gt; 
&gt; 2. *A typically mean boss becomes vulnerable after learning her job might be in jeopardy. She gets comfort unexpectedly from an employee.*
&gt; 
&gt; 3. *Persons A and B get stuck in the elevator/office suite) on their way home, after hours. They have some time to kill until help arrives.*
&gt; 
&gt; 4. *Person B is an intern has a genuine professional respect for the older Person A's accomplishments and intelligence (not wanting to jeopardize this golden academic opportunity), and finds himself increasingly attracted to her. Further, he has a fondness of women wearing stockings or pantyhose. While he doesn’t outright stare, he finds it odd that one day, he can’t tear his eyes away from the sheathed, long legs of Person A, but thinks he was discreet in his observations. Unfortunately, that was ill-assumed, as she approaches him with an...interesting proposal.*

**Pokemon:** My character being the protege/assistant of an older female Gym Leader or Pokemon Prof, or somehow traveling with one? I'm certainly open to outright romantic/smut-centric encounters (the classic offering of alternate payment in lieu of a Badge/Ribbon, etc).

**Modern-day superheroics:** Maybe an older heroine having my character be her sidekick or an up-and-coming hero with considerable potential, or perhaps two heroes/villains already together? Some related plots are below (where listed, Person A = Action Girl, Person B = Badass Bookworm):

&gt; 1. *Person A comes across a huge fan of hers, or wins some sort of contest to be her sidekick for a week.*
&gt; 
&gt; 2. *Thinking they are in a rut in their relationship, A and B trade places for a day to see how the ""other half"" lives, or...well, in the bedroom.* (This really only works if it's a hero/villain pairing.)
&gt; 
&gt; 3. *Persons A and B get stuck in the elevator/office suite) on their way home, after hours. (Person A can't use her powers for some reason, or doesn't want to use them in front of B to confirm his suspicions about her identity.) They have some time to kill until help arrives.*
&gt; 
&gt; 4. *Person A bribes Person B to do their work at their ""professional"" job, in exchange for sexual favors.*



___
There are a few canon older women/MILF-ly figures--or ladies I'd love to see aged up as such--I would love to play an original male character opposite of in one of the above prompts/ideas. 

* **Dragon Ball Z:** Bulma, Chi-Chi, Android 18
* **Nintendo:** Peach, Zelda
* **DC Comics/Smallville:** Power Girl, Starfire, Lois Lane, Chloe Sullivan
* **Legend of Korra:** Kuvira, Lin Beifong, Police Chief!Toph
* **Disney:** Elsa (*Frozen*); Esmeralda (*Hunchback of Notre Dame*)
* **Who Framed Roger Rabbit:** Jessica Rabbit
* **Harry Potter:** Hermione Granger
* **Pokemon:** Jessie, older!Misty, Fantina, Office Jenny, Nurse Joy, Delia Ketchum, Lorelei
* **King of Fighters:** Mai Shiranui
* **Street Fighter:** Chun-Li, Rose
* **Celebs:** Sofia Vergara, Gina Carano, Salma Hayek, Stephanie McMahon, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Kim Kardashian

While my general OOC info is viewable on [**my DPP profile**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/4ps6v1/m4f_ranger_vyces_profile/), here's the most relevant stuff...

1. **RP Medium:** E-mail only, though I'll chat/plot over PMs.
2. **Writing Style:** I'm a multi-paragraph poster (2-4 on average) who writes in the 3rd-person POV only and tries to be on point with spelling/grammar, description and such. I ask that partners do the same.
3. **Story-Smut Ratio:** I'm looking for story-centric smut, and am flexible on story length (one-shot, short-term, long-term).
4. **Post Frequency:** Please just keep me in the loop. Real-life always comes first and the muse can be fickle at times. Posting every few days (or even once or twice a week) is perfectly fine if that’s your comfort level. *If ten days pass without a reply, I assume the line's done.* Just let me know instead of abandoning the line without warning.
5. **On “Sex Positivism”:** Let’s have sex be consensual and depicted as something fun, pleasantly kinky and mutually enjoyable for both parties, allowing for playfulness, humor, snarky banter, eroticism, and shared pleasure on a physical--and perhaps even emotional--level. Sex that's generally degrading/demeaning, exploitative, cruel or rapey in tone and intent doesn't work for me. *(Fetishizing, glorifying, or romanticizing abuse and discrimination is an outright dealbreaker.)*
6. **Kinks:** Though my full kink list can be viewed [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/fetishes%20and%20kinks), below are my main turn-ons and turn-offs.



❤ ***Turn-Ons*** ❤ | ✘ ***Turn-Offs*** ✘
---|---
Consensual sex | Rape/non-con, dub-con
Equal ""switch"" relationships | Rigid ""sub/dom"" roles
Footplay/foot worship | Bad hygiene (stench, bodily secretions, bathroom kinks)
Muscle and body worship | Bimbofication/sluttification
Pussy worship/cunnilingus | Adultery and cuckolding
Light bondage | Eroticized/glorified abuse and discrimination
Copious foreplay | “2darknedgy4u!” tryhards
Consensual, tongue-in-cheek kidnapping/DiD (Damsels in Distress) play | Extreme violence and gore
Playful role-reversal | [Welfare submissives](http://media.oglaf.com/comic/submission.jpg)
Gentle/loving/teasing femdom | Characters under 20 years old
Partially clothed sex and uniform play | Heavy bondage and BDSM
Women in nylons/stockings/heels and seductive dresses | 
I'm especially seeking the following:

&gt; *Foot/leg worship.* Focusing attention upon a female's bare or nylon/stocking-covered legs and feet: Licking, suckling, nibbling, massaging, footjobs, etc. I'm not looking for it to be debasing/degrading or humiliating in intent, but an extension of foreplay and body worship, or teasing sensuality in fully savoring the female form. It wouldn't be given sole--bad wordplay, I know--focus (unless you're open to it), but a partner must be comfortable with its inclusion...or at least willing to consider it.
&gt; 
&gt; *Light bondage.* Blindfolds, silk scarves and fuzzy handcuffs, consensual kidnapping/DiD (Damsel in Distress) roleplay, a few droplets of hot wax dripping across the body while hands and soft/feathery/silken things glide across the skin unseen...it's more about sensuality and teasing than dominance or control.
&gt; 
&gt; *Foreplay.* Body licking, oral, anal, massaging, kisses…you’d hardly run into the game cold without warming up, right?
&gt; 
&gt; *Using magic and supernatural/superhuman powers in a sexual fashion (when appropriate).*
&gt; 
&gt; *Playful role-reversal and loving/teasing femdom.*
&gt; 
&gt; *Uniform/costume play.* I admit having a weakness for seeing ladies in nylons/stockings/pantyhose and heels, as well as wearing particularly seductive dresses and certain outfits (be it fitting with their actual profession or just for smutty funtimes). Likewise, the idea of partially clothed sex is also appealing.
___

So if this appeals to you, please PM me with all of the following:

* *What drew your interest*
* *What mutually-favored kinks--see my kink list--you'd like to include* (no vague or indecisive ""I'm up for anything!"" replies, please)
* *A small RP writing sample or a link to one* (I've found it goes a long way in showing if we mesh)
* *Any RP dislikes, pet peeves and dealbreakers you have* (you know, so I don't grind your gears)
* *Anything else you think is relevant or I should know*​

But if you decide we wouldn't mesh for whatever reason, may you soon find a much more appealing/compatible partner!"

Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence on the National Security Council, and Derek Harvey, the NSC’s top Middle East advisor, want the United States to start going on the offensive in southern Syria, where, in recent weeks, the U.S. military has taken a handful of defensive actions against Iranian-backed forces fighting in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

-- WHERE HE’S SPENDING HIS SATURDAY: “From regal to rustic, Trump heads to Camp David for weekend,” by AP’s Catherine Lucey: “President Donald Trump is picking simple over swanky this weekend. Nearly five months into his presidency, Trump is heading to Camp David, the government-owned retreat in Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains, for the first time. A frequent weekend traveler, Trump has favored his palatial residences in Florida and New Jersey over the wooded hideaway used by many presidents for a break from Washington. No one expects the luxury-loving leader to make this a regular thing. After all, Trump told foreign newspapers earlier this year that Camp David was ‘very rustic’ and ‘you know how long you’d like it? For about 30 minutes.’” [http://apne.ws/2tyun3D](http://apne.ws/2tyun3D)

-- HOW HE’S SO RICH: “Trump reports assets of at least $1.4 billion in financial disclosure,” by Theo Meyer and Matt Nussbaum: “The Trump International Hotel, which opened last year just blocks from the White House in a building leased from the federal government, brought in nearly $20 million in revenue for the president, according to Trump’s latest financial disclosure, released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on Friday. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, which he visited often in the early months of his presidency, raked in $37 million – up from $30 million in the report Trump filed last year and about $16 million in the report filed two years ago.

“Sales of Trump’s ‘The Art of the Deal’ brought in as much as $1 million for Trump, compared to the less than $100,000 in royalties that Trump reported in his 2016 filing. And sales of Trump’s book ‘Crippled America’ brought in up to another $5 million. Trump reported assets of at least $1.4 billion and income of at least $596.3 million in the 2016 calendar year and the early months of 2017. He reported owing at least $310 million to various financial institutions, including at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank.” [http://politi.co/2tduBOt](http://politi.co/2tduBOt)

DARREN SAMUELSOHN: “Escalating investigation puts Trump and his staff at legal odds”: “The legal interests of President Donald Trump and his aides are dramatically diverging as special counsel Robert Mueller expands his probe into possible obstruction of justice – and as the president ratchets up his attacks on the investigators. While Trump’s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, recently told White House staffers they can rely on him, rather than hire their own lawyers, some of the people closest to Trump aren’t taking that advice. … More White House staffers are likely to hire lawyers and splinter off as the president’s response to the investigation grows increasingly aggressive.” [http://politi.co/2sAqH4i](http://politi.co/2sAqH4i)

CORRECTION OF THE DAY -- WaPo: “A May 19 Page One article about investigations into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign incorrectly quoted President Trump. Speaking in the wake of Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein’s decision to appoint a special counsel, Trump said, ‘I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt, and there is no collusion between -- certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself and the Russians. Zero.’ He did not say, ‘I can only speak for myself and the Russians.’”
   
   
SCARY -- “Alexandria Gunman Carried List With Names of 3 Republican Lawmakers,’ by NYT’s Adam Goldman: “The gunman who targeted Republican congressmen this week at a baseball field in suburban Washington was carrying a list with the names of at least three lawmakers, and had pictures of the ballpark stored on his cellphone, two law enforcement officials said on Friday. One of the officials said there were no explicit threats written on the list that was found on the body of James T. Hodgkinson, who was killed on Wednesday morning in a shootout with the police in Alexandria, Va., after he took aim at Republican lawmakers preparing for a charity baseball game against congressional Democrats.

“The official said the list included at least three names:Representatives Mo Brooks of Alabama, Jeff Duncan of South Carolina and Trent Franks of Arizona, according to the two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the shooting remained under investigation.

“Both officials said Mr. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., had also taken pictures of the ballpark, nestled in a mostly liberal neighborhood seven miles south of the nation’s capital. For several weeks, Mr. Hodgkinson had hung out at a Y.M.C.A. center located next to the ballpark, using its locker room facilities and sitting for hours in the lobby while on his laptop. Authorities believe he was living out of a van since leaving Illinois in March; his brother said he was in the capital region to protest President Trump.

“The morning of the shooting, Mr. Hodgkinson approached Mr. Duncan in an adjacent parking lot and asked for the political affiliation of the lawmakers on the playing field. ‘I told him they were Republicans,’ the lawmaker recalled. ‘He said, ‘O.K., thanks,’ turned around.’” [http://nyti.ms/2slNsql](http://nyti.ms/2slNsql)

2020 WATCH -- “How Jason Kander Won by Losing,” by Isaac Dovere in Manchester, N.H.: “Jason Kander was wearing a mic pack here as he wandered around the Puritan Backroom, chatting with local activists and politicians at the Manchester Democratic Club chicken dinner. A videographer, who followed him around as he moved from table to table, was being paid out of his campaign account. Kander’s Senate race ended seven months ago. He lost. …

“The 36-year-old Kander — who came shockingly close to ousting Missouri’s Republican Sen. Roy Blunt last November despite Hillary Clinton’s blowout loss in the state—has been a man in demand the last seven months, starting with a major Iowa progressive group that reached out after the election to ask him to come to its holiday party. He drew a slightly bigger crowd than Bernie Sanders had at the same event two years earlier. He’s kept doing presidential-ish travel and generating presidential-ish buzz, though the highest office he’s ever held is secretary of state—of Missouri.

“‘All I can tell you is what people say when they invite us,’ Kander said, sitting down for an interview for POLITICO’s Off Message podcast. ‘They say that they want me to come talk about the future of the party, how we were able to run 16 points ahead.’” [http://politi.co/2rBZheX](http://politi.co/2rBZheX) … Listen and subscribe to Off Message[http://apple.co/2nEa7y0](http://apple.co/2nEa7y0)

HMM -- “Democratic 2020 contenders? Voters haven’t heard of them,” by Steven Shepard: “President Donald Trump’s poor poll numbers have dozens of Democrats reportedly considering challenging him in 2020. But voters haven’t heard of the vast majority of them. According to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll that tested voters’ views of 19 potential Democratic presidential candidates — a list that includes eight senators, five governors, one congressman, a big-city mayor and a failed Senate candidate — most of the prospects are unknown among at least half the electorate. Since the next presidential election won’t start in earnest for at least 18 months, that leaves a limited time for no-name candidates to build name recognition and familiarity among voters.” [http://politi.co/2tyjmzi](http://politi.co/2tyjmzi)

IMPORTANT READ -- “Trump threatens to break the glass on DOJ succession plan,” by Annie Karni: “An abstract, in-case-of-emergency-break-glass executive order drafted by the Trump administration in March may become real-world applicable as the president, raging publicly at his Justice Department, mulls firing special counsel Robert Mueller.

“Since taking office, the Trump administration has twicerewritten an executive order that outlines the order of succession at the Justice Department -- once after President Donald Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend his travel ban, and then again two months later. The executive order outlines a list of who would be elevated to the position of acting attorney general if the person up the food chain recuses himself, resigns, gets fired or is no longer in a position to serve.

“In the past, former Justice Department officials and legal experts said, the order of succession is no more than an academic exercise -- a chain of command applicable only in the event of an attack or crisis when government officials are killed and it is not clear who should be in charge. But Trump and the Russia investigation that is tightening around him have changed the game.” [http://politi.co/2sJnRdC](http://politi.co/2sJnRdC)

Raised with three siblings on an Iowa farm, she graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1995 and, three years later, from Harvard Law School. ... Brand was part of the legal team representing Bush in the Florida vote recount in 2000. She went on to be hired as a Supreme Court clerk to Justice Anthony M.

The House Russia investigation is planning to send an invite to Parscale soon, as they begin scheduling witnesses over the summer … The Senate intelligence committee is also interested in how Russian bots were able to target political messages in specific districts in critical swing states, although it is not clear if Parscale will be called before the Senate panel as well.” [http://cnn.it/2tyo2oX](http://cnn.it/2tyo2oX)

BOB COSTA ON GEORGIA’S SIXTH -- “Trump’s shadow and stalled GOP agenda loom over close Georgia race”: “The unfolding drama over Russian meddling in the 2016 election and President Trump’s handling of ensuing investigations has transfixed Washington — and bored Mather Lindsay.

“‘Probably a little overdone,’ Lindsay, a 46-year-old economistand father of three girls, said during lunch this week at the Salt Factory Pub. What grabbed Lindsay’s attention was the GOP’s stalled legislative agenda -- in particular, the promised overhauls of the tax code and the nation’s health-care law. ‘Trump’s self-inflicted wounds are my biggest disappointment,’ Lindsay said. ‘He has squandered a huge opportunity to get all that done.’ ‘Someone,’ he added, ‘needs to take his Twitter away.’

“Republicans in this wealthy community on the outskirts of Atlanta -- and in traditionally right-leaning suburbs nationally -- are facing a reckoning. So far, they have been willing to stomach a torrent of Trump outbursts and worrying twists in the Russia probes, but they are beginning to wonder if their patience is worth it. A crucial test of that patience will come Tuesday in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, home not only to well-educated, mostly white Republicans but also to what has become the most expensive House race in history.” [http://wapo.st/2sAxQBE](http://wapo.st/2sAxQBE)

NOT SO FAST -- “DACA still ‘under review,’ Trump administration says,” by Ted Hesson: “The future of an Obama-era deportation relief program remains undecided, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday.

“‘The future of the DACA program continues to be under review with the administration,’ a DHS spokesperson said in a written statement. ‘The president has remarked on the need to handle the issue with compassion and with heart.’ DHS felt compelled to issue a statement on the program’s fate after POLITICO and other outlets reported Thursday on guidance posted to the DHS website that suggested DACA would remain on firm footing under the Trump administration.” [http://politi.co/2rGPkIE](http://politi.co/2rGPkIE)

The trouble is, this voice is a dangerous liar. It tells us that we are good and rational and that other people are venal and flawed. And in a world that defines a good person as high-achieving, high-status, slim and attractive, sometimes the strain of maintaining the story is too much.” [http://bit.ly/2s9YS1Z](http://bit.ly/2s9YS1Z) (h/t ALDaily.com)

6htxvb,1,2017-06-17,Haphazard sentences and a goodbye.,sombersombreroz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6htxvb/haphazard_sentences_and_a_goodbye/,"I like you. I spend hours engulfed in your labyrinth - feeling too much and then, not feeling much at all. I sit still, reading letters written by lovers, woes and rejections - I read of elation and triumph, of rage. I laugh sometimes too. You're incredibly nice sometimes, and then tragically vile all at once. 

My mind is shrinking. I'm wasting away. What did it feel like to be eighteen? To be seventeen? And sixteen and fifteen? I will be twenty in 2 months. What do I have to show for all this time - for all these privileges - for all this peacefulness? I thought I would be different.

Inadequacy, depression, social anxiety.  Nah.  Just lazy - maybe I'll give this definition a try. Pathetic, ungrateful, decaying. I cry over this numbness - this inability to feel, to be happy, to see a future. So I sit here, day in and out. Dreaming. Hoping to be the polar opposite of what I have become. 

I have tried to change. I promise. I have tried talking to people. I have tried to smile. I have tried to love. It just doesn't work. Something is broken, I say, at the end of all this trying - and the cycle begins again. The hope gets washed away, and then come skipping back to me, hoping I'll give it another try. I always do. I’m an idiot like that. Some days I really do want to live. Ferociously.

There is a girl I adore. She is smart, and beautiful, and thoughtful, and funny - she floats through life, it seems. She drinks too much coffee and writes too many words – all perfect and sincere. She prays to a god, her wishes tell about the nights she spends thinking to herself - or out loud to people who love her. I would love to be her. She doesn't seem happy though - not all the time. She isn't perfect, though at times, I find her annoyingly so. She is real. She isn't a hero - she repeats that often enough. It's endearingly heroic though. She smiles a lot, and talks to people - she has a special way. I have never met her, but I want to be just like her. I know I never will, and I know she wouldn't approve of it, and neither would I – but I’m willing to sculpt myself and she’s a dream. 

I think about my parents often. They are broken, loving, imperfect people. My dad - so stubborn, so forceful, so hateful at times. My dad - so loving, so charismatic, so smart at times. My mum - so meek, so quiet, so passive at times. My mum - so resilient, so faithful, so peaceful at times. I think about how happy they are at my achievements, so proud they are to announce my highs to the world - as if they were their own, perhaps they are. I am guilty. I want to make them proud. It aches me that I'll never know how to make them truly happy. My mum lingers sometimes, watching my sister and I eat at the dining table - listening to us banter. She tells me she knows we'll leave her someday - and the day is coming close.  I'm scared she'll leave us someday, and time is moving so fast these days. What do I do? How do I console her - or myself. I love her. I want to make her happy - always. I need to get out of bed. I want to leave her side, to walk on my own two feet, to show her that her sacrifices didn’t all do her no good – and then at times, I’m too scared to part ways, as if she'll vaporize if I do. 

I am in a haze, shrouded in a thin film of sleepiness and apathy. I want to sleep all day. I can't. I need to get out of bed. I need to carry my burden. I need to pull my weight. I need to get out there. My mind is chaotic, and empty. My voice too quiet. My appearance too forgettable. My persona too plain. I made a promise to myself, a couple of months ago - that I will change. Change is a buzzword that's dried out. Change has been fidgeted with too many times, by my fingers - change is frail and tearing. I don't know how to change.

I'm going to go see a therapist. I am going to let hope wrap its cold hands against my colder hands and try to rejoice in all its weirdness. People always talk about how cold my hand are. Warmth could never stick around them - I get that from my mother. My dad used to say that people with cold hands tend to be with cold souls - my sister had warm hands, so did he. He doesn’t say that anymore, but his words always meant a lot to me – both the good and the ugly. Did I believe him? Or was it true after all?

I don't know what I want to be - what kind of a person I want to be. Sometimes, I want to be a doctor like my mother, the doctor my father dreamed his daughters to be. I can imagine myself as one. Other times, I want to be a lawyer, or a consultant - someone who can up and leave - someone who can bounce around from place to place. I've always been better at the bigger picture. I want to have a bigger impact than 1 patient at a time. I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to be either, to have an impact at all. I used to believe I was. Not no more at all. I see people who are – those go-getters, with too much energy in their body. I find them annoying, and exhausting, and yet I’m envious. How do they do it?

I hope I find love someday. I hope I find adventure someday. I hope I can love someone some day. I hope I can love myself someday. I hope I can beat this sleepiness. 

I hope I will want to live someday, for more than a week. I hope I can always marvel at the beauty of weeds, or glistening leaves, or seagulls without the colorlessness and the exhaustion.  

Goodbye reddit. I don't want to come back - I want to go live for a while. I'm going to explore this crazy city of mine. You see, I dream of living in NYC someday - but my city is not far from it. So I'll take some pictures, marvel at its soul. I'm going to tackle math – the beast, and read – diligently, maybe in cafes and in parks - perhaos it's a pretty picture only in words. I'll never know unless I try. I need to wake up earlier, maybe go for a bike ride. I need great grades, and an internship. I need to help people. I need to stop daydreaming. I need to be kinder. I need to smile more. I need to learn about space, and visit museums, and talk to people. I need to learn to think critically, and write, and to communicate - sterile, bureaucratic words, I know. But I truly have forgotten how to. It's strange – my mind has given up on me. I need to pray more often - to a god my mother believes in so fervently, a god that makes my father so forceful and bigoted at times. To a god that I cry to at night - a god that makes me feel lighter and heard. I hated him for a while. But I need him, the concept of him - I hope he is real. I hope they are all real, yours and mine - I hope heaven exists. Hell, I don't know.

I'm ranting again. It's 1 am. I've downed two coffee pills, and I'm about to go study for my exams. Take care strangers... or oblivion? Maybe this note will be lost in a sea of other notes. That saddens me a little, but I guess that’s how it goes. It's okay.

I've just started a new internship with a small local team using React Native. I would like to try to get up to speed and learn the ins and outs a bit faster with a side project.

My idea for a simple side project is a sleep sound app, where you can mix sounds to build a sound environment (yeah, lots of these exist, I'm aware). 

Because the app is built heavily around sound, I'd like to hear my options for the best sound library to use for this. The only real option I have found is the 'react-native-sound' library which may meet my needs. Just wondering if there's anything better, basically."

I just accepted an internship with the B4 in Advisory for Summer 2018, but was recruited more toward the Tech side. I'm interested in the Business Risk aspect of Advisory and am sure the firm will be open to the conversation, but want some perspective first. Coming from an Accounting and Tech background, I'm confident that I will excel in either role, but I loved the people in Business Risk and think I would enjoy working with them more. 

I've been thinking long-term about exit opportunities and know that Tech can lead to ERP implementation, IT Audit, IT Consulting, Internal Audit, etc. 

Not too sure about exit opps for Business/Financial Risk. Does anyone have experience in this area? I could see myself transitioning into general B4 consulting, but honestly not too sure what else. Would appreciate any insight!"

By internship I mean from who Bakugo will receive tutelage and what will his hero name be.

For me I believe his hero name would probably be: Nuking hero, Ichiban(which translates to the best). I think it's quite fitting since most hero names reflect the hero's personality. As for where he would take his internship, I'd say Edgeshot also known as Shinya Kamihara could be a great hero to mentor Bakugo as he is a skill-based hero who could help Bakugo get very strong considering having awesome technique on top of incredible strength will definetly close immensly the gap between him and Deku.

6huhgq,1,2017-06-17,"Me [19 F] with my now ex boyfriend [19 M] of two years, we broke up and I'm not coping well",anwomaninstem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6huhgq/me_19_f_with_my_now_ex_boyfriend_19_m_of_two/,"Hi all, this is probably going to be all over the place, so I apologize for that in advance. 

I posted a couple of weeks ago asking how to handle my long distance boyfriend of over two years saying that we needed to have a ""not fun talk"" when I came down to visit. It turns out that the not fun talk was a breakup. We talked it out and I stayed for the weekend. It was very emotionally charged but the reasons were solid (long distance wasn't something he thought he could continue doing for the next four years while we finished up college and we are starting to go down different paths in life). So he decided that he wanted to end it. We ended on good terms and we want to try to keep being friends once some time has passed and we've each had some space. 

I am really not handling it well. This guy was my first real love. I've never felt as happy before as when I was with him. I know that we are both really young and most high school relationships don't make it through college (I've heard the whole spiel a thousand times from parents and friends) but long distance, while it was hard, seemed to be going well. We aren't in contact right now because we both agreed we needed space and that is killing me. I've talked to him every day for the last two years, and now that's just completely cut off. I just want to talk to him and see how he's doing, but I know that contact wouldn't be healthy for either of us right now. 

Meanwhile, he seems like he's doing just fine. He finished the school year, he's starting his new job and living with his best friend, and it looks like he rebounded with another girl less than a week after we broke up (there was a very suggestive photo of her in a bed on snapchat). And I'm just here crying myself to sleep every night, applying to minimum wage jobs and not hearing back, and binge-watching Netflix shows wondering where things went wrong. My one friend is leaving for an internship in another state tomorrow and he was the only person getting me out of the house. I just don't know what to do. How do you make yourself keep functioning after a breakup?

  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend of two years broke up with me for legitimate reasons and we ended on good terms, but I am completely falling apart and he seems like he's doing just fine. How do you keep yourself functioning after a breakup?"
6hund7,12,2017-06-17,"Diagnosed 6 months ago, extremely demotivated, need help. (TLDR)",PandaVeekay,PCOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/6hund7/diagnosed_6_months_ago_extremely_demotivated_need/,"

Hello girls, 

After 16 kilograms weight gain, tremendous hair thinning, and horrible skin, my dermatologist prescribed a pelvic ultrasound. I was diagnosed with a cystic uterus of 20mm volume. 

I was absolutely overwhelmed with this “lifestyle disorder”, at a young age of 19 years, as it was not a hereditary disorder. It had to be because of my unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle. 

You see, when I joined law school at the age of 17 years old and moved out of home, I made a couple of unhealthy lifestyle choices which included vices and food. Everything about my life had changed the minute I stepped into law school. My food habits, my sleep schedules, my stress level, as a consequence of which, extremely unhealthy addictive vices to vent out the stress, low metabolic activities as a result of extreme workload, etc. You get the point. I F’ed up real bad; halfway through the 2nd year of law school, I weighed nearly 16 kilograms more than I did when I joined. I just thought it was the freshman “16”, and thought a little rigorous exercise in the gym and a strict diet could kill the excess weight. I had oatmeal, bananas, brown bread, eggs, soy milk, and everything the internet suggested, plus exercise. It did not work. I was still 5”7 and weighed 75 kilograms. 

After when I had been diagnosed with PCOS in December 2016, I was pouring over books, blogs, and all over the internet for a “cure”. After a week of reading countless words, I was extremely confused. I realised there is no definitive cure for this disease. 

My OBGYN prescribed birth control and this “pre-breakfast pill” called Normoz-20, which contains Chromium Picolinate, D-Chiro-Inositol, Myo-Inositol, and Vitamin D3 as active ingredients. 

Additionally, I’ve been taking a multi-vitamin of the composition of one-a-day to kill my fatigue, and Vitamin E gel capsules. 

It has been 6 months since I have been diagnosed with PCOS. It’s been a rollercoaster journey. From January to March I’d been dedicated to my body. I followed a good diet, yoga, meditation and medication. I felt great. There was definitely no visible change, but I felt better internally. I could pull-off an ‘all-dayer’ without much trouble, and had no trouble waking early in the morning, or keeping myself awake when needed. 

Then came April, finals month; you can imagine how it went. I was completely demotivated to see the weigh scale; my old clothes still did not fit me and I had an ugly pooch hanging, which I had to cover with my new mid-waist jeans; low-waists weren’t even last on the list of clothes I could wear. I covered my body with clothes that could hide it. I binged on all sorts of junk, while preparing for examination. I had developed an erratic sleep pattern, and returned to a couple of the vices that I had in the first year of law school. I was guilty, definitely. But, I had convinced myself that I had tried “enough” and was “tried and tired”. 

In May, I went to intern at an international arbitration centre. This was the hardest month of the disorder so far. I had to wake at 8 a.m. in the morning and keep myself awake till about 12 midnight, which I was finding impossible even with probiotics, multi-vitamins, and the PCOS pills prescribed. I did not find time or energy to exercise. Plus, I started eating the suicidal foods because I started hanging out with all the old friends, and they were eating it, so I could not control myself, is what I tell myself. 6-packs of donuts, carbonated sugary sodas, sugary fruit juices, Chinese food made of all-purpose-flour, white bread sandwiches, etc. You name it, I ate it. This month was also the worst for another reason: I started having blackouts. I would leave for work, get to the metro/book an Uber, and I’d start having an accelerated heartbeat, cold sweats, nausea, giddiness, numbing arms, etc. This happened about 4-5 times, and then I visited a doctor, who said it was probably a Vitamin B12 or Vit D deficiency and prescribed to get the blood work done. 

As of today, I have not got the blood work done due to shortage of time, but I got an appointment for this Monday. I feel extremely demotivated and disappointed. I do not know where to begin or how to plan my day, and how to eliminate this disorder. 

Last week I discovered r/PCOS, and I read several stories of women who have successfully defeated PCOS in a battle that lasted 5 to 10 to even 20 years. I needed support and advice in planning for this battle. Please help me, *cysters.*

6hurqi,7,2017-06-17,[NSV] Managed to stay on track even after an emotional breakdown about my weight,Geo__cat,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6hurqi/nsv_managed_to_stay_on_track_even_after_an/,"Yesterday I didn't have the best day...it was the first day since CICO that I've had trouble. I didn't start with my usual, healthy, low calorie breakfast (got a starbucks drink...man those have a lot of calories!), and then I didn't go camping like I had hoped, which wouldn't gotten me hiking and active. 

Anyways, by night time I was grumpy and figured I would go out and get some clothes needed for a new internship I'm starting next week. The ended with me crying in the dressing room because the store didn't carry my size in clothes, and I could barely pull the extra large size over my thighs. 

I ended up calling my sister crying because I was so upset and disappointed in myself...I couldn't believe I let myself get so unhappy with my body and weight. I emotionally eat, especially when I'm upset, but instead of stuffing my face I went home and made some dinner (I hadn't eaten in like 6 hours at that point), but when I logged all my calories I was still under my daily goal.

TL;DR Had an emotional break down after finding they don't sell my work clothes in my size, wanted to emotionally binge, but didn't and ended up staying under my calorie goal."

* USA-AMERICA-USA-: I have been to every state, and I would have to say California. People are rude as shit, everything is over priced, They have more nut-cases per capita than any other state.
* bakemeawaytoys: California nutcases think eating meat makes you Hitler.

Florida nutcases will take bath salts and eat your face.

Big difference. 
* USA-AMERICA-USA-: both are crazy, but I can afford things in Florida.
* bakemeawaytoys: Bruh. As someone with a terrible income who has been in FL often and for a while, there is nothing there at any price that could possibly justify the way you have to live your life there. CA is paradise comparatively.
* USA-AMERICA-USA-: I'm just saying California is worse, not that Florida is great.

* USA-AMERICA-USA-: being from the South East, no one here wants to move there.
* firefly9191: That's just your opinion. The market shows otherwise. Housing is super cheap in your region compared to CA, because not as many people want to live there. 
* USA-AMERICA-USA-: ummm... Our population is growing extremely quickly. The city I live in is one of the most sought after cities in the country because of the houses, schools, golf courses and Pinewood Studios. 
* firefly9191: Yea I'm sure the population in your area is growing rapidly percentage wise but that's probably because up until recently there weren't a lot of people moving there. I'm sure your area is a nice place but it doesn't compare to CA where the real estate industry is huge and national trends show that it's been a popular area to move to for a long time. 

I'm not sure what area you live in but I work in real estate and I know that on a national level there have been boomtowns in TX or the Western region (Dakotas, NV etc) that are tied to the oil industry and when the price of oil dropped those towns emptied out.

* USA-AMERICA-USA-: just by sheer size, of course more people move to california. But I live just south of Atlanta. People have always moved here.

* firefly9191: I don't think CA is the best place to live. It's not like I want everyone to move here, it drives up the cost of a house for me. I think every region of the US has something nice to offer and it only just depends on your preference/what industry you work in. I'm sure Georgia has some really nice places that I'd be happy in. 

Sorry that rude people were rude to you in California, you get those types of people everywhere unfortunately. But you don't have to shit talk an entire state just because you had bad experiences.

I have access to enough money right now to spend about &lt;$100 a month until next summer on health related expenses. I get vyvanse for free, and I've been taking it for a year, but the long term risk have me somewhat concerned. If I can replace my medication, awesome. If I can't I would rather use it alongside supplements to maximize my productivity/health and minimize my long term risk. 

I've built a stack around taking with the meds(though I haven't started yet), but there's still the risk of long term oxidative stress, and I haven't incorporated stuff to help me sleep(I have to get up at 5 in the morning so I can't power through the night without consequences). also on or off the medication I eat right, exercise 3-7 days a week, and meditate frequently, so please don't recommend these things. 

I'm looking for the experience of people who have managed to get off of vyvanse/adderal and replaced it with their stack of choice. I would also like the experience of people who took stacks alongside their medication. 

background info: I'm a mathematics/computer science double major, and right now I'm working a full time internship along with taking two online classes, so all day performance is a must for me. I would also like to sleep sometime"
6hvj68,3,2017-06-17,[Directed to Right-Libertarians mostly] The Importance of An Aristocratic Class.,Moprollems,CapitalismVSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/6hvj68/directed_to_rightlibertarians_mostly_the/,"The thread on the ""Alt-Right"" and Libertarianism's delightfully devilish romance has motivated me to make this.

The advent of The Industrial Revolution and the Victorian Era in general saw the sun set on one of the most ancient institutions in The World: Aristocracy. There has not been, in world history, a single country which has not had an Aristocracy playing at least a role in governing the Body Politic. Even The United States, with its constitutional ban on aristocratic titles, had a psuedo-aristocracy in the form of The Planter Class.

As more and more people came to own land, or moved to dense urban centers, Aristocrats--who were bound by their status as Land *Owners* and tied to a specific plot of land--gradually saw their decline. The Three Estates of Medieval Europe, Clergy, Bourgeoisie, and Aristocracy were gradually replaced by two each vying for control of the institutions of Government, the Psuedo-Clergy in the form of idealistic ""Socialist"" movements, and the Bourgeoisie with neither side ever wholly dominating the other, and each movement being infested with the yolk of internationalism. Marx was fundamentally correct when he stated that the profit motive chases the bourgeoisie across the globe, and as infrastructure has improved and the movement of all people have increased, the body politic as a whole has slowly come apart at the seams.

Statistically fewer and fewer of The Upper Class are serving in The Military, and as more and more rich children attend universities across the globe, and holiday and intern in foreign countries, an ominous question is raised over whether they see themselves as, for example, American Citizens, or ""Citizens of The World"".

What this gradual dissolution of The Body Politic has lead to is nothing short of chaos, the sundry Governments of The West are fundamentally not acting in line with the whims of The Western *People*, but rather of an international elite class. The mass importation of Third Worlders and establishment of a hefty Welfare State does not benefit Western *people* in the slightest. The industrial worker in Minnesota gets *nothing* from an overpopulated work force willing to work at half the cost of them. Current immigration and welfare policies are solely to the benefit of The Elite; actual ordinary Americans, Germans, Frenchmen, don't get any benefit from these policies and are in fact harmed in the long run.

Thus the restoration of an Aristocratic Class may be chiefly necessary for the safeguarding of Individual Liberty, Prosperity, and The Welfare of The People. Aristocrats, who are bound to The Land on which they were born, are capable of mediating between the Psuedo-Clergy of Socialism and the Modern ""Bourgeoisie"" class. Given they are inherently opposed to internationalism due to their unique status, they can compromise with Socialists in ensuring the Welfare of The Common Man, as they are bound entirely to their land they have a duty to nurture and maintain their inheritance and thus wont sell their subjects out for a few dollars. Given their opposition to revolution's chaotic tendencies and the mixture of State and Corporate Power, Aristocrats can also compromise with Capitalists; as most AnCaps would agree, I imagine, that they would be horrified at the prospect of Corporate-State cooperation and the foundation of unnatural, state controlled monopolies.

More importantly for both sides, Aristocracy is intrinsic in ensuring Human Dignity, Humility, and Moral Virtues which have guided mankind for centuries. Democracy has been misinterpreted not as power coming *from* The People, but rather The People in some humiliating ritual, pretending to give others a right to rule over them. The vast majority of the time the candidate that gets elected, or even nominated, is not the one The Majority wants, but rather elected through a combination of appealing to the right interest groups, having the most realistic chances of winning, and statistic apathy--I.E. of a party that makes up 5% of the total population, only 20% of the people in said party votes for the individual in question--and more importantly those who actively *seek* power, generally speaking, are the ones we want to keep from Power the most.

An Aristocrat, by comparison, does nothing to earn his title, his wealth, his power. His status is a completely unearned, it's an inheritance, a gift, a White Elephant of sorts. The common man need not deal with the humiliation of *pretending* he wants the man to rule him, or giving his implicit *consent* to someone to rule him, the Aristocrat's power is entirely due to an accident of birth, there was never anyone's choice in the matter and thus there is no implicit agreement or allowance for *totalitarianism* on The Aristocrat's part: he was never elected *for* anything, he never was required to *do* anything, he does not have an obligation to pretend every four or years to be in this constant battle for the will of The People, nor to look like he's doing something to justify his position, his position is *self-justifying* and thus he can go his entire life as both a unifying symbol and a man who fundamentally doesn't interfere in peoples' lives.

Look at the rise of welfare, of the surveillance state, of declining civil liberties, all of these are being performed gradually by *democratically elected institutions*. The Patriot Act was passed in part because we wanted to have the impression of a Government *doing* something, even if it hurt us in the long run, because we have an implicit need in our system for people to *act*, to pass more and more laws to justify themselves.

Another benefit to an Aristocracy is, when done correctly, it transcends race and ethnicity; of all the actually successful ""Multicultural"" states on Earth, almost all of them were Absolute Monarchies. The Ottoman Empire was composed of a Turkish Upper Class, but with Clergy coming from a wide variety of ethnicities, and the Janissary Class ensuring that conquered peoples could still on some level have a say in local matters.

If America, North and South, had an aristocratic class, Blacks could easily be ruled by Black Aristocrats who were *part of the actual community*; these people being bound to The Land wouldn't be some politician who lives outside of Detroit but pretends he perfectly understands The Peoples' problems, it would be one of their own vested with their welfare and overseeing laws. A hypothetical ""Kingdom of America"", with a sublime, unwritten constitution would be a veritable rainbow of Aristocrats each in tune with the ills and petitions of their community.

Thus, a perfect solution to the sundry crises of The Modern World is to bring back an Ancient and Noble system which sadly died out with the birth of The Modern World."

Help.",Xglitzz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hvouf/my18f_boyfriends_18m_family_hates_me_and_i_cant/,"Hello reddit,  and to all of my friends out there. I am seeking some serious advice here. First off, let me introduce myself. I am an 18 year old girl who has just graduated highschool with my boyfriend. I have achieved a 4.0 GPA, participated in countless after school activities, work at a very reputable company, and am quite introverted. I am very sweet, not to flatter myself at all. I am normally well liked by adults, especially intellectuals who I am able to have deep and interesting conversations with. I was even offered an internship from a district attorney, after only a brief conversation. Those are just some materialistic things, but all in all I strive to be a good person and to be kind to everyone who deserves it. However, I do have quite a deep past. I came from a bad family background that forced me to mature quite earlier than I should have.  I hold no grudges, however, and am grateful for the person I am today. 

Now, onto this B.S. 
I have been dating my boyfriend for going on three years now. When I met him at the begging of high school, it was a mutual instant attraction and we have been inseparable since. However, in the past year his family has begun literally hating me.- but mostly his mother and grandmother. I have my suspicions that it was always this way, but I'm not too sure. When I met my boyfriend he was on a very bad track. He was a shoplifter, and avid marijuana smoker (nothing wrong with that but it was to the point where he was driven to depression)he was seriously considering selling drugs,  a pathological liar; had confided in me that all of his life his entire family has done nothing but put him down (he is literally their punching bag and black sheep.) and about to be very close to dropping out of high school. After I met him, I being an honor student, he started to stay in school with me. He stopped hanging out with losers. He began realizing that he had a future as an individual, and as his girlfriend i support and love this kid; since his family are ALL narcissists, was his only support system to get him up and to school, and into graduation. Even if we break up one day, I regret nothing. I do not think I changed him, however I do feel that the conversations that we had and the growth that we have gone through together,  inspired him to change within himself, and am very proud of him. 

This all started when I had to leave my home and live with my grandmother. My grandmother's house is very far and to boot, the living conditions are quite bad, however I am just happy to have a roof over my head after what I have been through. I was over my boyfriend's house often, and did share with his mother about the situation at my previous home. Little did I know she would use this against me. They suddenly started accusing me of eating all of their food because they knew that I was struggling to support myself (His narcissist mother and step father) to my boyfriend behind my back and told him that I wasn't allowed to eat when I came over. Fair enough, if you're going to be like that I don't need your food (I stopped having dinner with them after that). After my boyfriend stuck up to them, they let off and apologized. But it didn't stop there, and soon they started to sabotage us seeing each other all together, ,my boyfriend and I can only see each other on weekends. His mother constantly talks behind my back to him, saying that ""she has nothing going for her"" and ""she's using you for rides"" (which by the way, they never give me rides), ""She's a negative person"" (she said that after asking me what I wanted to do after college, which to I replied I wanted to travel the world, which to she said ""why would you want to do that it's so scary"" and then later said that, and that I was bringing him down) and my favorite, ""she's using me and the family because she doesn't have a good one.""

The crazy thing is, when I met my boyfriend he wanted to kill himself because of these people. His step dad who is a felon who 's profession is a window washer started my SO's bad smoking habit, and at the time he was only fourteen.  He puts him down constantly by poking at his manhood and saying demeaning things to him whenever, LITTERALLY  each time he gets the chance. It makes me sick.

His mother constantly offers him up to young girls and tells him that all of her co workers daughters want him. Yet at the very same time, she puts him down (his while family gets together and does this, I have been there to see it) and when I stick up for him it gets worse on him. They got upset because he decided to go to college instead of trade school like they wanted, got upset because he got a backbone and some free will.. they say things like ""you will be nothing"" and ""you're a failure"" while also blaming me for everything WHEN IM BARELY ABLE TO SEE HIM ANYMORE. 

Let me make you all realize how actually uneducated and materialistic theses people are..'

step dad: ""Did you know 80% of mexicans are either gay or rapists""
his mother: ""yes.""

This is their logic... please.. help me..

Note: I decided to post here instead of the relationships sub-reddit because I feel like this is a lot kinder of a community with women supporting one another and I just wanted to get this off my chest to a female audience. However, men are welcome to comment as well as I'd like their perspectives too! :)

Here's the thing, there's a guy I like at my workplace who will be heading back to his country after the internship ends. We didn't interact much in the beginning since our work didn't really overlap. Recently we've had to work on some stuff together and I enjoy working with him so much! 

Overall he's amazing: kind, knowledgeable, super attractive, and just an all-around awesome guy. I've been thinking about him a lot lately and wondering if I should even bother asking him out on a date because he'll be leaving to go back home anyways so I feel like there's no chance of us even dating. Also another major fear factor for me is just the idea of asking him out on a date and being rejected, which is highly likely because he's way out of my league. I know my thoughts are all scrambled right now, and I'm already hypothesizing what will happen without even having asked him out on a date yet, but I don't really know what to do at this point and it's been bugging me a lot lately.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. I really love the community here at TwoX and I hope you guys can give me some words of wisdom. or just words of comfort I guess since I haven't felt this strongly about a guy in a while. 

Thanks everyone!"
6hwqew,23,2017-06-17,"EDad and some mild covert sexual abuse (CW/TW and all that jazz, nudity, covert sexual abuse, creepy-crawlies).",MikeGinnyMD,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6hwqew/edad_and_some_mild_covert_sexual_abuse_cwtw_and/,"I never really thought about this way until recently, but I'm remembering some really gross boundary violations mostly by my Edad.  

Now, I think we all know that when dealing with teenagers, it's OK to discuss puberty in general.  One should tread lightly when discussing pubertal changes that bring about the need to engage in new hygiene practices (like teaching girls how to handle menstruation or teaching boys to use deodorant and how to shave).  Otherwise, the only people who really should be discussing the child's own pubertal development with the child is a medical professional because we are trained to do this in a clinical and depersonalizing way (and the kids still low-key wanna die, anyway!  LOL!).  Pubescent teenagers are extremely touchy about their bodies and it's best to let them deal with these changes with a minimum of poking and prodding.

So at age 12 or 13 my mom saw me naked and loudly exclaimed ""YOU HAVE HAIR!!!""  She told my father about it and then he gave me this really irritating and creepy grin that made me feel all cold and slimy and violated inside.  I kinda wanted to die.  I expressed this and of course was told that I was being overly sensitive and that he had every right to be proud of me and express pride in me as a father.  (But you're proud of your son going through puberty?  That's not even an accomplishment.  That's like being proud of your son for breathing.  That's just...so odd to me.)

So from that point forward, I had a rule: *my parents were never to see me naked.*  

Around 15 or so I started needing to shave, so I asked my father to teach me how.  There wasn't really another man in my life who I could ask this (because that would involve inviting some man who wasn't my father into the bathroom with me as a teenage boy and...no.)

I would have liked my father to just calmly instruct me on how to shave.  Instead, he stood next to me with that same creepy grin and snickered in some sort of sick caricature of fatherly pride.  Again, I asked him to stop and expressed that his reaction was making me really uncomfortable and again I got the same dismissal.

By late 15 or early 16, I had finished growing and I was shaving on a daily basis soon after my 16th birthday.  My father would comment often on how I looked like a man now, or the state of my facial hair, and once made a comment as to how big my penis might be (god, that made me want to dive into the ground) and I'd ask him to stop because these comments made me very uncomfortable, almost as if he was sexualizing me.  He reacted angrily, dismissing my concerns and reasserting his right to fatherly pride.

I was a competitive swimmer, so my father and mother got to see my body a lot as it developed, but I *never* let them see my private parts again.

The summer I finished my Masters Degree, I was 23, about to turn 24.  I was still a competitive swimmer and I had reached that point in life where I looked in the mirror and thought: ""Wow!  I'm actually a really good-looking man!""  As an awkward and pudgy kid, this was a novel and wonderful feeling for me, to see myself not only as a man, but as a good-looking man.  

I was starting medical school close to my parents' home in the fall, and there weren't any realistic job opportunities or ways to keep me occupied for that summer.  (For example, nobody is going to hire someone with an M.S. in Molecular Biology from an elite university as, say, a summer lifeguard or a waiter; they'd just tell me I was overqualified.  But any sort of lab/science-related job wouldn't be interested in someone who was just going to be around for a month before vanishing, and because I wasn't technically a student for those six weeks, there were no student internships.)  So my only option was to go and live back at home for the summer and just lie around and do nothing.  

So one day, I went to my parents' country club and spent the day horsing around in the pool with my nephews (11 and 13 at the time).  We were to be having dinner there, so after the pool I went back to the Men's Locker Room (first time I'd really used it) with my dad to shower and get changed for dinner.  As we were going to the locker room together, I decided it was time for a test.  I was now a fully-grown young man and way beyond puberty, no longer touchy about my body, and even proud of it.  I decided that I would allow my father to see me naked and see how he reacted.  This was my test to see if my father was capable of appropriate behavior when confronted with my physical manhood and masculinity.

He failed.  Badly.  Worse than I was expecting.

The club locker room was a cavernous room with rows of large lockers.  As a country club, the decor was opulent, the floors were carpeted and each locker was really more of a small closet.  There were rarely more than three men using the entire facility at any given time.  The room was always very quiet and the carpeting absorbed any echoes.

So I stripped off my swimsuit, and casually reached for my towel, ensuring that my father had full view of me.  And there was that grin again.  And a snicker.  I had thought that I was old and mature enough to not feel creeped out by it anymore.  This was my body and I'd worked hard to earn it and besides, who would be the least bit surprised that their 23yo son would look like a grown man?  In spite of it, I felt the same cold slime run down my spine that I had when I was 13 and 15.  

I simply responded with a look of annoyance, confusion, and incredulity and set off to the showers.  As I came out of the showers and dried myself, my father again hit me with the same grin/snicker and shake of the head.  

* Me: ""Dad, let me ask you a question, would you ever look at any other man in the locker room the way you're looking at me now?""
* Him: ""You're not just any other grown man, you're my son and I'm proud of you.  You're all grown up now, you're a man and you have a man's body.""
-I felt a wave of nausea and hurriedly wrapped my towel around myself-
* Me: ""Today was a test, dad.  I got naked in front of you to see if you would be able to handle it, or if you would react inappropriately.  I know a lot of father-son pairs who can use a locker room together without commenting or smirking.  I wanted to see if we could be adults together.  I wanted to see if I could trust you to behave like a grown man who understands the boundaries of other grown men.  You just showed me that I cannot trust you.  I can't let you see me naked again ever.""
* Him: ""Well, pardon my ass for being proud of you!  I have every right to...""
* Me: ""No, you do not!  I'm my own man first, and then I'm your son.  If you behaved this way towards any other man in this locker room they'd probably kick you out of the country club.  I've had gay guys check me out less overtly in the locker room than you just did.  If I didn't know better, I'd think you wanted something from me.  So if you think that being my father somehow means I have no right to boundaries around you, think again.  Sorry, Dad, but you've lost my trust on this matter.  And, frankly, if you want to have any kind of meaningful relationship with me going forward, you could start by apologizing to me for openly violating my boundaries as a grown man.""

We didn't speak much through dinner.  I couldn't very well tell NMom what had just transpired; I couldn't tell my brother-in-law or my sister what had just transpired; I *certainly* couldn't share that with my nephews.

He did try to apologize later that night, but it was one of those half-apologies in which he basically accused me of being unreasonable for having those boundaries and reiterated that my status as his son gave him the right to openly *ogle* me.

And the irony is that I am actually gay (he didn't know it at the time) and I'm reasonably confident my dad was truly heterosexual.  I don't think he was actually sexually interested in me; it was just a really revolting violation of my boundaries.  

Part of me, though, blames myself.  Surely, I knew what was going to happen, so why did I ""test"" him?  Wasn't I just setting him up for failure?  Isn't ""testing"" (provoking) a thing that narcs and other Cluster Bs do?  I turn 40 in three weeks and I'm still confused by it.

But on the other hand, shouldn't any man have a reasonable expectation that his father can handle changing with him in a locker room without getting all weird about it?

He died a little under two years later.  

Wow, I wrote a wall of text.  TL;DR: My dad always creeped me out with his reactions to my pubertal development, even way after I'd finished puberty.  It was one of several things that poisoned our relationship in his final years."
6hwwjz,1,2017-06-17,Please help! Question about changing to UPS Access Point.,ups_question,UPS,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPS/comments/6hwwjz/please_help_question_about_changing_to_ups_access/,"Hello UPS! So long story short, I applied for a visa a few months ago while I was still in North Carolina. When I applied, I had to specify where to send it return it to, so I put my address in NC. However, the visa took months to process, and I'm no longer in NC.  
  
Once I got my tracking number with the package of the visa, I went to UPS MyChoice and set it up to deliver to a UPA Access Point location in my current state of Florida. Seemed like it went through. However, the online tracking system is making me very nervous right now, showing tons of scans without a location, and while it shows the final address as the Access Point in FL, the ""Help"" page says it's ""In Transit"" to the NC area. I'm very concerned because I need this visa for international travel for an internship.  
  
I called the UPS hotline, and the first person on the phone told me that while it showed the request to switch to the FL Access Point was approved, it actually had not processed. I asked for a solution and she didn't have anything. I then spoke to the supervisor, who told me everything is fine and not to worry. I'm really concerned – has anyone here heard anything like this? Really really appreciate any help."
6hx03i,2,2017-06-17,Feeling insecure and scared about starting something with a guy,Holyduchess,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6hx03i/feeling_insecure_and_scared_about_starting/,"Hello there, as stated in the title I have a ""thing"" going on with a guy and I'm at loss. This is probably going to be super lame but I need to get this out somehow ~

Thing is: I have no experience in the matter. I'm 20 and he's five years older than me. This is relevant because he has had experience where I have none so I really don't know what to do. I'm super clueless and all my friends can't understand my perspective on things because they all had relationships before. This is my first really serious thing with a guy.


So, backstory for context:

This thing started like a month ago when we went drinking after work between colleagues and I met him (I'm a part timer so I hadn't had the time to meet him) and during this event we ended up talking a lot but that was it.

Then a week later they were doing something again after work at a bar and I said I'd come by later because I was meeting up with a friend first. Then as my friend and I were going to join them I asked him if they were still there and he said he wasn't but that my colleagues were. He then proceeded to give me the phone number of a colleague there and his ""just in case"".

From there we talked a bit and we started texting like not a lot but maybe every two days or so. It was always casual and it just felt good. Like silly good talking about nothing and stuff.

Then two weeks ago he asked me out for a cinema date and unfortunately I was traveling somewhere so I couldn't. But  we still texted each other during my trip.

Then when I came back he stopped texting me and I thought I'd start the conversation for once as I hate letting a guy do everything like, a relationship is built between two persons so it has to come from both. From there he picked up and asked me out again for the cinema (which is what I was after).

So we went and it was super nice and easy. I was feeling super happy and looking forward for what was next.

Then at work he talked to a colleague I talked to a lot and he slipped while they were smoking that he went to the cinema with me and also that he went drinking with another girl from our work (a young intern only there for three weeks).

I was highly disappointed and hurt (I'm not sure about saying this casually at work, I felt like I was a trophy) and after a while I realized that we hadn't an exclusive relationship and that from where we were at I couldn't really hate the guy for seeing other persons. Guess I just took it on myself beating me down. I'm not a very confident person. I see myself as lame, boring and ugly so... Just took the hit personally as maybe he was just trying a girl out just like that with no real intent.

I started being a bit distant but then he came back asking me if I was okay like concerned and I answered casually but not too friendly and we picked up from there.

Then last night in my drunken state I sent him something along the lines of ""on a more serious note, do we see each other tomorrow night? :)"" and he said yes.

Was feeling a bit anxious as I have no clue about dating and stuff. Anyway I went today, gathering all the courage I could find and we just hanged out on a park talking for hours. It was super cool and as we were parting I kind of froze anxious like do we kiss or what. I went for ""la bise"" (kissing each other's cheeks, yes I'm French so sorry for typos and bad grammar) but it felt awkward as I felt in my guts (can't really explained) that he did wanted to kiss me. Awkward moment really. Then he told me to text back when I was home and asked me if we could see each other again tomorrow. During my trip back home he also texted me that he had spent a really good evening and that he felt ""intimidated"" and shy around me. I said the feeling was mutual.  I was surprised though. He doesn't look like the type to be shy, he seems radiant with confidence so, a bit surprised.

Anyway, I feel there's a thing going but I'm still confused about the intern he went drinking with and I'm scared shitless about my first kiss and all. I'm scared to disappoint him and myself and I'm so shy. I so want to go along with it but as the same time I never had anything like that so this is all new and mysterious and first times are so scary. 

Probably making a huge deal out of nothing but it feels important and I don't want to fuck up.

Sorry for the long post and thanks to anyone who read this.

TL;DR: met a colleague at work who seems interested in me but I still have doubts about his interest over me and about mine. Not super confident and I have zero experience in dating so I'm lost."
6hxdpu,5,2017-06-17,Yon sparkly goal thread ahoy. Long-winded. But indulge me.,apersonsusername,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6hxdpu/yon_sparkly_goal_thread_ahoy_longwinded_but/,"A while back, I asked around about the goal threads people make.  I still had a while to go and I figured you're expected to write one, so I just wanted to make sure I did it the right way when I got the chance.  My understanding is that you're supposed to give an inspirational story with some tips on what newcomers can do to better lose weight.

I do have one of those!

Once there was a college senior who understood that he was wildly overweight.  That boy had made an abortive effort in freshman year, but was never especially dedicated to the effort.  That changed when he visited family in North Carolina and struggled with a two-mile downhill walk.

Somehow, this drilled into his head that the problems he had walking *weren't* normal, and the importance of the problem became clear.  He did not quit junk food, being a college kid, although it helped that he didn't care for the aptly-named ""fat sandwiches"" the area was famous for.  He budgeted many days for many chicken nuggets and learned to stop worrying and embrace the calorie count.  The hardest week was the second, because he was on a cruise with family and had just spent another week failing to lose weight.  But the process worked, all praise be to CICO and self-discipline.

303.5 pounds to 198.5 in about thirteen months' time is nothing to sneeze at.  I had difficult days with that, but I stuck it out.  The psychological key was to bear in mind that there would be bad days, that I would mis-count, but I'd hit true more days than not.  I just had to trust the process.  It's boring, but it's really the biggest general takeaway.  In terms of college weight loss, again, it was more about holding back so I could, indeed, have that giant pile of chicken nuggets when the time came.

The end.

After all of that, I started some internships meant to get me into the law field.  I wasn't making any money that way, but the understanding was that by bumming off my folks while giving away free labor I would eventually make a career for myself.  That plan fell apart when my father mostly unexpectedly lost his job.  I ended up taking an unrelated dead end job because suddenly, I needed to make money **now**.

I won the respect of my coworkers as a determined worker who would take on extra shares of work, partly to show off my newly-won strength.  A large part of my motive was to get coffee breaks on the company dime, though.  College made a caffeine nut out of me, and nobody could or wanted to make an example of the guy who moved every barricade.  Still overweight but well below obesity, I had a measure of confidence I've never been able to recapture since.

Weight slowly trickled back on.  Some nine years later, I was back into the 230s but unconcerned.  I was a lot more alarmed that I was still at this job, still in this house, with no prospect of improvement.  I took a paralegal studies course to try and freshen up my resume after one rejection too many from local recruiters.  When the class predictably failed to salvage my ill-planned career, I fell into something of a panic and put on ten more pounds in a matter of months.  I finally started freaking out, watching my prized accomplishment go up in smoke while my prospects remained disastrously poor.  My dating life, never particularly active, completely collapsed - either my personality started to fall apart or I ran into bad luck, I don't know for sure.

I got a job when I stopped trying to find one.  It's the damndest thing, but a fellow student was able to get me a position after I quit trying.  It was pure luck that she found an opening, but I claim as much credit as I can for the impression I made on my classmates.  With one good break under my belt, and with a one-way ticket away from the guys who stole lunch from the refrigerators, I set lightly to work losing the weight again.

A lot of this has felt backwards.

I had greater success moving away from an active job, which matches up with the experiences of absolutely nobody here.

I had many days where I deliberately tried to ""outrun my fork.""  Running was something that came much later, and while I was able to discipline myself to eat little on days I ran a long way, I took full advantage of the physical symptoms that came when I didn't eat.  Many, many Sundays full of ""terrible"" food.  My 13 mile run was proudly fueled by half of a delicious barbecue chicken pizza - the apparent nightmare of anyone trying to lose weight, according to a recent post!  I apologize for nothing.  It was the single best day I had this entire time.

The last ten pounds weren't hard.  I ground my teeth, ready for a couple months of great difficulty, looked up, and they were gone.  It felt, and feels, strange.

I came in without any real goals.  I am still searching for them, now that I'm at something of an ""end.""  Obligatory ""but it never really ends,"" though *of course* I'm happy to be able to open a few more pages of the cookbook, to have an easier time prepping my meals because I don't need to freeze over-portioned proteins anymore.  I wasn't prepping meals at all before I had to in order to lose weight, but it's going to be more fun when I don't have to.

Which gets to the last part.

At heart - hell, at stomach - I'm still a person who likes food and enjoys eating.  I worry somewhat that this dooms me to a failed maintenance.  I think of myself as someone who knows how to be responsible, but I've already blown this once before.  I came a long way without really changing much of myself.  I tailored my plan and my handling of those calories around my life and the mild variations within it.  I started in earnest in January, not out of any interest in New Years resolutions but out of a desire to avoid having to cut down at social events.  I have mostly succeeded in this goal, but I have some worry that this hasn't been a complete mirror of my ""normal"" life from this point onward.

The format of these threads demands that I leave some specific tips for people to follow.  I don't entirely agree with this because I believe that the most important thing is to figure out what works in your own life.  Find your own low hanging fruit and keep picking it.  For me, it was about loading up my lunch with small quantities of lean protein and having a combination of balance, bulk, and socializing with dinner.

But for you, if it's the milk in your morning coffee, if it's cutting out fast food forever, if it's cutting out carbs like they're a possessive ex constantly breaking the restraining order...you should work through possible changes by trial and error.  Weight loss takes time, and the problems will be there tomorrow if you happen to dislike Halo Top or whatever (though bear in mind, the rest of the board will take a blood price if you do).

The rest of my life still needs work.  I didn't get a personality transformation out of this and my jawline didn't transform into that of a male model.  People don't treat me any differently, so I've just got to do it myself.  The rest of the work I need to do isn't related to my body (although I could use a stronger back for climbing).  It's a lot less mechanical in nature and about a lot of things I don't fully understand.  I wish the rest of you luck and support with weight loss; I hope I can just hang on to mine, and that the other things fall into place.

Thanks for everything (especially reading all this crap)!"
6hxmoa,1,2017-06-17,[19/m] I love my girlfriend (19/f) but at the same time I still have an interest in my friend from high school (19/f).,Citiesskylinesexpert,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6hxmoa/19m_i_love_my_girlfriend_19f_but_at_the_same_time/,"I am now home for the summer from my first year of college. I feel like I’ve changed a bit, but all in all not too much. In any case, I met someone during my first year that I really love. We have been dating for about eight months now, and I must say she is wonderful. The only bad things I can say about our relationship is that she gets really sad sometimes and I don’t know what to do. She will also get mad at me for stupid things. She also seems very dependent on doing things with me and sometimes gets upset when I can’t because I’m busy with homework or something. The dependency issues bother me the most.

Since she lives on the other side of the country and we are both at home now, we’ve been dating somewhat long distance for the past month or so. Returning home, I have reunited with all of my high school friends. In my group of close friends, there is this one girl who I have liked since January of last year. I asked her to prom and we went together. She is exciting and interesting and beautiful. I was going to ask her out after prom, but in the end, I decided that it wasn’t worth it because we were going to college way too far away. I was really upset about it because I really liked her, but I think she only sees me as a friend. In all likelihood, I think she only saw me as a friend when we went to prom together too. Still though, there is a part of me that really wishes we could be together and everything could just work out between us.

Recently, we have been hanging out more since we’re all back together for the summer. I’ve realized how much I missed her additions to conversations and just all around how amazing her presence is. I sometimes think that I would love to be with her for the rest of my life, even though I know it would never happen since she must see me as a friend.

I say all of this still being with my girlfriend from college. I love her and would never want to hurt her because she has been such an influential person in my life, but I am infatuated with this other girl from my high school life. I could never break up with my girlfriend and move on to the girl from my high school. Both logistically and emotionally it would be too much for me. Logistically it would not work between me and the girl from my high school since we are just too far away from each other during the school year, she is awful about communication with everyone because she is stressed from school and hates using her phone, and even during the next few summers she will be away likely with an internship. Emotionally, I would not be able to break up with my current girlfriend because I still love her so much. Despite her breaking my heart somedays, I still adore her. I just can’t help but think of being with my prom date. 

All in all, it just feels like such a sucky situation, and I just want the best of both worlds. But I know that in the end I can’t have that. Is it inherently wrong for me to be happy with my current girlfriend but still have the longing to be with my friend from high school?

Tl;dr
I think I still feel attracted to my friend in high school (who happens to be a girl), but I am now in a relationship with a girl from college. I love the girl from college, but I can't help but think of myself with my friend from high school. I'm not even sure if my friend would consider me someone that she would ever want to date and I would not ask her out at all this summer, but Is it inherently wrong for me to be happy with my current girlfriend but still have the longing to be with my friend from high school?"
6hxvl1,10,2017-06-18,I realized what I want to do with my life today!,IHeartCaptcha,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/6hxvl1/i_realized_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life_today/,"First of all I hope this does not come off as serious cause it is not supposed to be, and second I hope the mods do not get mad at me if I did this post wrong in any way, I have only posted on here 2 other times. Anyway enjoy. 



So a little background about myself. I have been studying Electrical and computer engineering for 3 years now and am going into my 4th year. I honestly had been finding it hard to know what I want to do with the education, but I always knew that this was the area I wanted to study. 


My ""direction"" all started recently actually, I currently am doing my third internship so far. I am working as a programmer for a large grocery company (you can probably guess who it is lol). The people I have met are awesome, but honestly the work does not give me purpose like I hoped it would, and I also did not find purpose in my last two internships either (which were more on the electrical side of my degree). This got me thinking every night before I went to bed: ""is this what I want to do for the rest of my life""? That slowly started to turn into: ""what do I actually want to do with the rest of my life""? And I think I had an epiphany? or something like that one night. I am not sure what it was, but I started to have one of those slow realizations of things you missed before in your life. Like those movies where the plot was unfolding in front of you the whole time, but you just weren't paying enough attention so at the end of the movie it reveals all the details you might have missed right before the big climax. Anyway well I slowly started to realize all these small things. Like why I enjoyed the night time so much, and why when I was dating this girl back in high school my perfect idea of a date was seeing a meteor shower together and cooking out (not a fancy dinner and a movie), or why I am so facinated with planetariums, telescopes, books (*A Brief History of Time*), and space movies like *Interstellar* . So all these things started to hit me and finally I just realized that I want to be an astronaut. Not because it sounds cool, not because it is a very respectful job (although that is nice too), but because from the bottom of my heart it is something that is so interesting to me and fascinates me beyond anything else. The idea of just being able to see things outside of this earth just makes me so freaking happy and it gives me something to work for, which is something that is needed in engineering school to motivate you to make good grades (which I currently need lol). So all in all, yes I have read through requirements for the NASA program because I pondered it as a teenager sometimes and I know it takes a lot to get there especially if you do not have a PHD, but I do not care because I will dedicate my life to get there. 

If you read this, I made this because I really needed to tell someone. If I told my parents or anyone else I knew about this I think they would laugh at me, so I hope there are some late readers out there that will pay this post a visit. Thank you."

6hyppi,1,2017-06-18,"Me [20F] with my Friend [22 M], took my virginity three years ago and I still love him",sotosika,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hyppi/me_20f_with_my_friend_22_m_took_my_virginity/,"Please be real as possible with me.. sorry about the length and somewhat unnecessary info I tend to ramble )= 


Three years ago, when I was 17, my now friend and I were dating. We met through some mutual friends and without even knowing it, I fell in love. My friends noticed it before I did--I was head over heels for this boy. I decided to lose my virginity to him regardless of the fact that he was going back to his second year of university. I refused to confront the real issue of him leaving in about a month and avoided it until the last minute. I knew I was a summer fling but I could not help it. I watched him go off to college and find a new girlfriend in a month. It was absolutely devastating. I became depressed, stopped trying in school and hated myself during my senior year of high school. 


About 6 months later, I ended up meeting this guy, a mutual friend (who was a part of my first guy's friend group), and I felt somewhat human again. We talked and I kept it lowkey until things started to get serious after about 6 months.. We started dating officially about a year after that heartbreak. During the time we were dating, I ended up getting really close to their friend group. I never deeply loved this boyfriend of mine, and a day never passed where I didnt think of my first love. It hurt less, but it still hurt nonetheless. Our relationship eventually went to shits and I had nothing to say when he confronted my lack of presence in the relationship. We broke up after a couple months.


I ended up moving across the country a month later and I ended up moving across the country to clear my head and explore America. (lol nyc). I was rooming with people from our friend group. I met a bunch of people there and I can say I had genuine feelings for some. BUT STILL I could not stop checking up on social media to see what he was up to, getting excited when I got a snapchat from him or even perking up when I heard his name. I was ecstatic to hear him and his gf broke up. TOTALLY UNRELATED, I moved back home after a couple months. 


New Years Eve 2016: we hooked up after going to an event together and it was amazing. It happened a couple times after that, also. 
This time it wasnt so bad. It didnt hurt when he went back to school to finish his last semester. I was seeing someone casually and I really liked him, and i still do. Lets call him love#2. So while im falling in love with this amazing smart, funny and fun dude, I still have reservations because of love#1. I could not get over him because of his close proximity in the friend group.


Me being me, I basically sabotage the relationship or as I like to call em, relationshits the second things start to get serious. And now, here I am. Not over either, they are both gone for summer internships and I am here pathetically and painfully hurting, wondering what to do at this point. Im happy with every other aspect of my life, but I just cant seem to get this right. I know #1 likes me at least a bit.. I catch him looking at me, or making fun of me just for fun and I just feel it. Is it just in my head because it is what I want to believe? I am considered to be a highly logical person, and from what I observe mostly in my female friends, is that they take a situation and dwell on it, and as they do, get further from reality. IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?


I find myself doing things for him--or to be good enough for him. He comes from a great family, did really well in school, got an absolutely amazing internship this summer and is also physically attractive. I find myself hitting the gym more, studying harder and dressing nicer in general so i can see myself with him.. i tell myself its the only way id even be close to good enough for him. Have I lost my shit lol.

 I just have never been able to confront him about anything and I just cant. With any other relationshit or even just a situation involving men, I speak my mind rather clearly. I dont know what it is thats keeping me from either talking to or moving on from this boy. 
Am I crazy for even wanting something to do with him romantically after almost three years? He told me he is coming back in August, I am pretty excited for that.. Love#2 is coming back in August also. Should I force myself to forget about #1 and give #2 all my effort? Will it even worK? 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I really fell for my first and it consumes me emotionally after three years. Is it possible that I will always love him in some ways? Is this normal??"

Sadly, I must report that the [Mindwar Archive] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NmsMindwarArchive/) recently suffered a minor informational assault. Thankfully, due to our KVC engineered digital security procedures alongside other rapid response security protocols upon the ‘Grey Ward’ the offending virus alongside the means by which it initially gained entry hastily identified. The virus eradicated long before it could worm its way into any essential core system.

The smart viral did however manage to corrupt a few links to some low security broadcast promotional material. As a result, we took the necessary steps of isolating and removing said infected files instantly before they could potentially harm anyone taking an interest in our project.

The means by which the virus initially gained entry since identified as an unmindful Vy’keen Intern who neglected to maintain full anti-psionic emission procedures whilst visiting a known Hive World during an orientation exercise. A Hive World at that time only partially PGS-5C liberated. We believe the Intern mind nudged via emission into uploading a supposed virtual reality shooter from an already infected site onto our servers.

Sadly, I must report that the [Mindwar Archive] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NmsMindwarArchive/) recently suffered a minor informational assault. Thankfully, due to our KVC engineered digital security procedures alongside other rapid response security protocols upon the ‘Grey Ward’ the offending virus alongside the means by which it initially gained entry hastily identified. The virus eradicated long before it could worm its way into any essential core system.

The smart viral did however manage to corrupt a few links to some low security broadcast promotional material. As a result, we took the necessary steps of isolating and removing said infected files instantly before they could potentially harm anyone taking an interest in our project.

The means by which the virus initially gained entry since identified as an unmindful Vy’keen Intern who neglected to maintain full anti-psionic emission procedures whilst visiting a known Hive World during an orientation exercise. A Hive World at that time only partially PGS-5C liberated. We believe the Intern mind nudged via emission into uploading a supposed virtual reality shooter from an already infected site onto our servers. 

We apologise for any temporary inconvenience.

---

Just a general and brief review of what has been happening in rookie mini-camp, organized team activities, and mandatory mini-camp. Regular training camp will start on July 27 so expect more then on all open practices.

---

**General:**

- As this is all the early stuff there are no pads, so take all notes with a huge grain of salt.

- Johnathan Calvin (EDGE) and Jason Spriggs (OL) got into a fight.
- Davon House has taken over the leadership role in the CB group.

**Injuries:**

# Preface: 
I wanted to give back to the community some things that I have learned from my experiences growing up. I hope newbies in seddit can learn from my mistakes and the more advanced people here can relate with my successes. This post will have a wide range of things to offer and I hope there is something everyone can take away from my experiences.
 
 
## General Info About myself:
- Turning 23 YO at end of month
- White
- 6’1, 191 lbs (been lifting for 6 years), good looking
- Work in technology consulting role making 75k + ~15-20k bonus in a city
- I’ve always wanted the best for myself, besides losing my virginity the women I’ve been with are HB7+.
 
 
## High school years: 
I grew up in affluent area in NE and went to all guys high school, I was raised mostly by my Mom. My Dad was never home due to work. I never had any trouble getting anything I really wanted besides women in my starting high school years. I grew up as a popular kid in a good social circle but was always known as the “quiet” and “shy” kid. I played a lot of video games, mostly online with friends in my high school group though. I also played some sports at a fairly high level and was considered by some D3 schools to pursue those sports so I was generally athletic and in good shape. Despite having success in most things, I still felt insecure about myself because I wasn’t getting any women. In comes my best friends Dad at the time who was this single, 45 YO, running a successful business and dating smokeshows only a couple years older than us. He gets me and my friend in the gym. Luckily I had my friend to help keep me motivated, having the male camaraderie to help support me in a positive way I found to be important. As a result of this I was always in a lot better shape than people my age heading into my college years. I noticed significant boosts to my confidence and respect during this time as well.
### Key Takeaways from this:
- Grew up in a female oriented household, naturally trained to be a “provider” type
- Lifting was important to helping me build confidence and social status
- Having a like minded male support structure is something that can help build you up in many different aspects of your life
	
# College years: 
 
## Freshman Year/Sophomore year: 
I end up leaving the north east and going to college in the south. Here I start to flourish a bit and come into my own. I end up joining a top fraternity. I would say I got laid relatively infrequently that year, between school and pledging I was very busy. Sophomore year begins and I spend the first semester being a classic frat douche(this was the part of my college career where I fucked the most girls), looking retrospectively at this fact it makes a lot of sense to me now(treat girls like classic frat douche would, display myself as higher value to them, I get laid). Then towards the end of the year I end up having this weird relationship with a girl named Kathy. I developed oneitis for this girl Kathy, I constantly wanted to be around her and to make her happy. I was also talking to two other girls on the side, but I really wanted to be exclusive with Kathy. Although I wanted that Kathy didn’t and she would go around hooking up with/having sex with other dudes every once and awhile and I would find myself hurt and trying to please her more. She always said she that is like a “guy” and wouldn’t want to settle down(women like and enjoy sex, especially during these low stress college years where they are figuring out their life). Now despite how angry and frustrated Kathy made me, those two other girls I was “talking to” on the side who I treated like garbage wanted my attention even that much more. Going out of there way a lot to invite me over or send me flirty texts/snapchats, at the time this didn’t make sense to me. I wanted Kathy to treat me the way these other two girls were treating me. Knowing what I know now it makes sense. Kathy ended up transferring. I spent my summer slaving away at an internship in a city as a 19 YO, had sex with a couple girls that summer.
### Key takeaways from this:
- I “suffocated” Kathy’s attraction to me due my constant neediness of being around her/talking to her
- Girls are sexual creatures and enjoy sex
- If your investment in a women &lt; theirs in you, you then display a higher value, their attraction for you increases
- Social status is important. I had many options of women at the time due to being in a top fraternity
- Multiple options is important. One of the things Kathy liked so much about me was the fact other girls found me attractive
 
 
## Junior year: 
I end up meeting a girl who transfers to my school named Lauren. Lauren and I hit it off immediately and not long after that we end up dating. After the honeymoon stage and school year ends attraction began to dwindle. Once that attraction started to dwindle, like it did with Kathy, I only became more invested. I tried to save the relationship and took Lauren on a trip to Europe once my summer internship ended. The trip was amazing, we told each other we loved each other for the first time and generally had an awesome time. I thought I had saved the relationship. We get back and I keep up my suffocating ways constantly am trying to have these boring text conversations with her and talking to her all the time. She breaks up with me two weeks later. 
### Key takeaways from this:
- More investment on your part = more neediness = less attraction
- You can’t save a relationship, she’s either attracted to you or she’s not
- If you give a girl exactly what you think she would wants(Europe trip, saying I love you), she has nothing to work for anymore. “You put someone on a pedestal they have no choice but to look down on you”
- Circumstances change, my neediness increased once we left school. Going from seeing someone everyday in a low stress environment for a relationship i.e college...to not at all, this puts a strain on the relationship
 
## Senior year: 
Pissed off and ready to make Lauren regret what she had done by breaking up with me I go into senior adopting the frat douche mindset I had in the beginning of sophomore year. I end up fucking a good amount of girls. I eventually meet this girl named Fran though. Fran was known as one of the hottest girls at my university. She was also dubbed a “good girl”, never going out, good grades, leader in her sorority, I developed oneitis once again. One thing to note before I get into how I handled this relationship an observation I am now making is the most I got laid in that relationship was after I booked a trip to Mexico with my fraternity and without her, and the week before I left. Like Lauren, after our “honeymoon phase” and we graduated attraction began to dwindle once again. She was going to grad school and I was starting work. Our lives already heading in different directions. We had frequently talked about our future with one another and how we were going to make it work. Everything seemed perfect, I would have a well paying job as would she once she finished grad school. I thought she was “the one”. I once again tried to save this dwindling attraction through calling her all the time, sending flowers, exc. This only made her feel like I was suffocating her more. The writing was on the wall, a couple months into the summer she breaks up with me.
### Key takeaways from this:
- Same points I made above
- Give women space, whether they are your wife, girlfriend, ONS or whatever. Invest that time and effort you planned on putting into them back into yourself. This will only make them like/invest in you more. “Have you ever loved someone so much that you would do anything for them, make that person yourself”
- The “abundance mentality” I had in the beginning of senior year was low-stress, high reward. I was able to bang a lot of girls while at the same time have time for other things I found important to me.
- I haven’t mentioned it in the stories here so far, but during my relationships my male friendships suffered. This stems from over-investment once again. Keep them around and do interesting things with them. The most sex I had in that relationship was right after I booked Mexico spring break trip with them and the week before I left. She felt like she needed to prove herself and made sure I got my “share” of sex before leaving her. 
- Don’t get down on yourself. You build strength through your failures. You can let them slowly eat at you and fall into the same traps again, or choose to make yourself better and make sure that next time you are better prepared for what’s to come. This is for everything, not just women.
- Circumstances change again, me starting my job and her starting grad school, low stress high reward environment in college seeing each other everyday changes to high stress low reward environment putting a strain on the relationship, causing attraction to dwindle.
 
### Post break-ups
After the break ups and then looking at my experiences from a more analytical perspective I immediately have adopted the “abundance mentality”. I was able to look at how it has worked for me in past and apply it to my life today. I have been spinning anywhere between 3-7 women at a time for the past couple months and I want to tell you some things I have learned so far, and what has worked for me.
 
## Seduction:
### Women want men who are wanted by other women:
This comes from just the other day. After work I went out to the pool my apartment has to read a little bit. It was a quiet day and there were two girls there HB8,HB7. HB8 is sitting by the pool and ends up getting in. I go up to her and strike up a conversation, ends up she was laid off her from her job that week.She ends up telling me she’s 29 and asks me how I old I am. I say 22 and she tells me she’s too old for me. I just tell her that she’s not the first person who’s told me that. The conversation continues and it’s flowing well and she comes at me again with another shit test asking me what I want to do when I grow up? I playfully said sit by the pool unemployed and she loved it. She had to go see her friend but ended up getting her number and I’m seeing her for drinks this weekend. HB7 is watching me clearly hit on this girl and get her number. After reading some more I decide I am done for the day and gather my things and head towards the elevator. HB7 follows me shortly behind. She approaches me by the elevator and we get into a quick conversation and she ends up asking me for my number. We are also getting drinks next week.
### Key takeaways:
- Age doesn’t matter, women want to be with men they find attractive
- Women will want to belittle you to test how you react, brush it off if you can and be playful about it
- If women find you attractive they will want to “steal” you from other women. This applies not only in this situation but also at clubs/bars too. Talking to hotter girls = higher value.
 
### Eye-contact/body language:
Holding eye contact makes your interactions with people much more personalized. The things you say also come across as much more powerful, and it definitely increases sexual tension. I would also suggest reading “What every Body is saying” by Joe Navaro and what various signs you're giving off non verbally mean. Be aware of your own body language as well as the other persons in order to drive your interactions accordingly and help them stay within your frame.
### Key takeaways:
- This stuff is very important. Not just with women but also with work and general day to day things. Learn about it and try to understand it
- Once you understand it you can more easily “read” people, this is a skill that takes experience and practice, I don’t think there are any “short cuts” here.
 
###  “I’m not having sex with you tonight”
I love hearing this. Almost every time I’ve heard this I end up having sex that night. When they say this I know they are thinking about having sex with me and envisioning what it’ll be like in your head. Just brush this off and keep the conversation going or playfully challenge her with something like “who said you were going to get that lucky anyways?”. If she’s saying this sex is probably in your near future even if its not “tonight”.
### Key takeaways
- Don’t take lines like this as rejection, they are a good thing
- Keep the conversation playful, sexual, and fun
- Make sure you are having fun yourself, self-amusement
 
### Women like being played with emotionally
This is an example from the other night my HB9 work friend(who’s friends I’ve fucked...this comes in later and links to an earlier point).  We talked for about three hours about sex and relationships. A lot of the talk was about her manipulative boyfriend. Every minute new stories and truths kept coming out over and over again which was hilarious. This guy literally treats her like an absolute piece of garbage...banging other girls on the side while at the same time emotionally manipulating her and tell her that he loves her and is going to marry her and all this shit. She then tells me that despite how much she hates him and all this stuff they had sex the other day. She was also constantly talking about getting laid and how she was going to go out and rock some guys world and she needs to find a good lay to bounce back from the ex-boyfriend. While this was happening she had a 3-4 guys texting her at once. I ask(although I already knew the answer) why doesn’t she bang one of those guys. She responds that they are all too nice and she looks at them as good friends and she just wants to get fucked. Eventually it’s getting late and I was going to go home. I’ve fucked some of her friends and her friends talk about the sex they’ve had with me, so she knows I have toys. She brings this up and tells her that she now wants me to fuck her and tie her down and dominate her. I tell her no and leave. She texted me the next morning that she’s never felt so powerless in her life being denied sex like that.
### Key takeaways:
- Girls like an emotional roller coaster, the guy in the example above may be “extreme” with the marriage talk and such but the same applies nonetheless. Be the drama of the women you want to fuck.
- Social circle game is good. If you have sex with a girl, she’s going to tell your friends about it. If you’re good at sex you can use that to your advantage to have more sex within that friend group as well as the girls you’ve already fucked.
- One of women's greatest source of power = their vagina. Take this power away and watch them have no idea what to do with themselves.
 
### Rejection now does not mean rejection later
Within the past two months alone I have been rejected by a women via head turn three times when going in for a kiss. One of them was a straight up rejection. One of them I ended up hooking up with later. Then the last one I ended up banging the same night. Every time though I brushed it off and kept the conversation fun, flirty, natural. Don’t let a simple rejection like that be the end all be all.
### Key takeaways
- The action of a women cannot be directly controlled by you. How you react to that action can be though and will either generate or kill attraction
- Be a man and go after what you want. If you get rejected pick yourself up, become better and try again.
- Don’t apologize, keep the conversation going
 
 
### Just have fun
I like to think it’s called game because it’s supposed to be fun. Gaming women and getting rejected can lead to some hilarious stories that you can look back on and laugh at if you don’t take it too seriously. It can also lead you down some wild paths in regards to sex and your relationships that lead to stories just as exciting and hilarious in nature. When you’re having fun and enjoying yourself other people notice and it shines through into the rest of your life. Also make sure to never lose sight of the bigger picture which is developing yourself, the women will come naturally then..
 
### Thanks: 
Thanks for reading, I know it’s a lot and I have more stuff I’ll eventually bring together into another post.

The account at the gay bar was true... as in all the girls he got with... he chose not to tell me because he was ashamed. he still denied being bi. so I hate to say it.. but I told him I was done ... :/ ... I don't know if I'm overreacting.. because he didn't actualyl do anything else with those girls besides the groping and dancing.. kissing altho I don't know what he excluded from the story... but I kept having these images in my head and praying it was just a fantasy story.. and now found out they were real.. :(.... he hasn't even called. just said he's sorry to hurt me... this sucks.. but thanks Reddit for all the help. it's been a rough day and will be a rough day at work tomorrow.
________________________________________________________
My bf and I had a short break when my ex started contacting me trying to get back with me, because he couldn't deal with him trying to get back with me. We decided to work things out (between bf and I if I didn't hang out with my ex 1 on 1)... so things are going awesome except I found some things today that disturbed me...

We're currently working on similar work projects and he mentioned he had written notes on something I needed help on and showed me his folder with his notes a few days ago. He's currently away for vacation and had his notes sitting on the table, so I went back to his folder to take a look at the notes again and I found some additional papers on his personal thoughts.

During the whole ordeal with my ex, he had written everything out all his thoughts and all of his bullet points were things he talked to me about. I felt bad about how I made him feel.. then I flipped through few pages more, these thoughts seemed to be in time order and found some notes that were older .... it was labeled to have been located at a gay bar near his apt, a place we went to before with our friends. it was a whole page of pretty graphic description of him dancing/groping with these hot girls and it said one of my guy friends was there (that I accused him of loving but he denied). in these notes. of course the girls he describes is what he told me his dream girl was (brunette blue eyes beautiful etc.) something I'm already sensitive about because I know I'm not his type (black hair, black eyes). He writes how they loved that he was bi (something I had called him out on based on his actions with said friend and he vehemently denied and got really mad about me about).. and even goes on to talk about flirting with other guys when the girls weren't interested when he tried advancing in his ""story"". 

After reading this I immediately texted the friend that was listed in the story and it turns out he hasn't gone with him recently to this said bar. so I'm lead to believe none of this happened and is just a fantasy, but seems to confirm my suspicions now that he's bi because he wrote that he was bi in the story. I'm not sure how to feel about this, never happened to me before? Then I go to the next page and I find a list of 40 girls he knew. I was 2nd on the list, some girl I don't know is first. and scattered throughout the list is a few names I know.. and then encounters. ex. ""brunette at this dudes party"" or ""blah blah in HS"" and some of the events I actually recognize. and know which girl he was referring to even if it wasn't a name. He even has a separate list of 5 girls I mostly know, squared in a box. Ten girls are circled and 9 are starred and I have no idea what they mean.  One of the girls has a note on the bottom that says ""interested maybe?"" . I have no idea what this list is!!! After some time... I decided to go on his computer (wasn't locked). He had read all the text messages between my ex and me when I wasn't looking so I felt justified going through his personal things.. I know that's bad.. I've never done this before, never gone through his phone ,text emails.. nothing. but I am so upset at all this finding.. practically shaking and just wanted to know moree =( .. 

So on his computer, I find the exact thing that so many other girls seem to find on r/relationships, a huge fap folder under some pseudo folder name with girls that were mostly all hot brunettes dating back to few yrs with only one folder that was during the time we were going out. Don't really care. He also frequents a web cam site (saw on his common page) but again don't care for some reason he told me doesn't pay I think, although he had a folder for that web cam site so probably does but again, seems like this is common.. Then I find another folder in the non-fap folder that were all the people he knew. Girls from our training class... and  events he's been to. Each girl had a separate folder (one of them was made in March 2017 when we were going out.. again pretty brunette girl), and in it pictures from FB copied to it. He supposedly didn't have FB until he made one sometime when we started going out. I found it strange because he goes on FB so much and know things about my friends and others I barely know because I don't keep up with FB. He uses it a lot for someone who didn't have FB until recently and remembers all these details. Also these pictures were all uploaded before he made his FB, so it seemed like he had an old FB that he deleted? He had a folder with me made at a time I barely even knew him.  The pictures he included in these folders were normal pictures but some girls had lots of bikini pictures, but anyway.. I don't know what to make of this... this doesn't even disturb me as much as the real or possible fantasy story because apparently this is common? 

Edit: I forgot to mention some of the folders that were made were not just a girls name.. but were called sister's classmates, neighbors, some guy's friends, work company (the one that I'm in.. uploaded Jul 1 2015 way before we started going out), work company  interns, neighbors, underclassman.. so not just FB specific for those who may suggest he is collecting. He even had a folder where he took cell phone photos of girls in his classes wearing dresses without them knowing... which I find creepy....

However, in his ""story"" it seems real because he is so specific about the details of him dancing with these girls, but it also doesn't seem like him. He writes how he goes dancing from girl to girl grabbing at them. I don't know what to think anymore.. when I started dating him my friends all told me he was no good and that he was mean. I started to see some of his mean side which led to me wanting to break it up. But there were also some disturbing rumors that they wouldn't tell me and now i wonder what they are ...

I love him and he says he loves me. when we broke up due to the ex issue, he supposedly cried 5 times in a day and was really heart broken but I find the list and story and folders really really... weird.... and I'm not sure how to deal with this, Reddit please help, am I overreacting?

  **tl;dr**: Found a possible ""fantasy"" story written by my bf where he says he is bi but if real, he had kissed/did other things with hot brunette girls while we were going out. Then found list of 40+ girls (I was 2nd on list) of people he know/encountered at events, with stars and circles next to some (fap list?), then his actual fap folder and separate folder with girls he knew (each girl had their own folder filled with FB photos downloaded to it).

(my trust is gone thanks to her no self control) 

I'm sorry I had to delete this my close friend told me I shouldn't post things like this on Reddit but after I deleted it I saw there were many thoughtful and great advice in the comments section so I'm posting this again because I truly do value everyone's  comments... I'm pretty new to Reddit and underestimated how amazing these comment section would be so I'm posting this again in hopes of hearing more... the few comments I saw really made me think and I know they probably won't see this again but thank you for the advice


Here's the whole post again...

Also I should mention I hadn't had too many ""real"" relationships until I started college but I've learned alot but it's pretty obvious that the redditors know more than me so here it is...

Before i start this post i have to give some background on this girl. She has never had a decent relationship until she met me (according to her) she dated two guys before me and she said they treated her like garbage and made her feel less of a person always calling her names etc. Also she wasnt a virgin but only had sex twice before she met me and she had a far higher sex drive than i did. Now  for the post itself. Me ( age 19)(male) and this girl ( age 20)(female) started dating in our freshmen year of college. It was one of the best relationships I've ever had. I can honestly say we loved each other. We shared many good memories and stories together. we were close until she had a panic attack and she had to leave school and move back home  ( which was quite far from the school were we met. It's in a entirely different state). we spoke for a while but ultimately figured itd probably be better that we didn't try long distance. As I didn't have the financial abilities to visit her. We always kept in contact but we made it clear that we could see other people as we weren't a thing anymore. I dated some other girls in college and had a couple of one night stands but I always thought about her when I was with all these other people. 

After a couple of months Her and I talked about our dating life and she said she was talking to a guy she met online and was dating him but he was using her to cheat on his original girl friend so she broke it off with him and  after that she went on a sex rampage on tinder almost having sex with anything that walked. She told me all the guys she was with treated her like crap and not the way i treated her. She called me about this crying and sobbing saying she wanted to stop. I spoke to her the entire day helping her get through it which she told me she was done having sex with strangers and tinder as it was mentally destroying her. She always stated that I was the only one to truly make her feel ""weightless"" And ""warm"" and no other person had made her feel that way which I do believe is sincere and honest.

 Fast forward to the middle of sophomore year we are both single.  She contacts me and  says she is doing an internship near the school im attending so she can see me. I told her I would stay during the summer and not return home if she really was going to be near my school.( i live about 2 hours away so driving there wouldnt be a hassle)
 To make a long story short I got into real bad financial issues and literally couldn't stay as it would put me debt. So i had to leave for home to work almost 7 days a week to pay off my student loans etc. But before I left for home she came down 2 weeks prior and we hung out and loved each other just as much as we did when we initially met. After the 2 weeks I was forced to return home but I told her I would visit her less than a months time and stay for a week. At this point we aren't dating I suppose but we are definitely  ""Something."" 

About half way through the month she texts me saying she slept with another guy and is crying and sobbing on the phone saying she messed up and how she feels disgusting and worthless and saying I'm the only guy that has shown her compassion. She said she slept with the guy because she didn't know ""what we were"" but I told her if we weren't anything you wouldn't be so destroyed about what you have done. We love each other on a very deep level and the only thing that kept us apart was distance. But knowing that I WOULD come back and see her in less than a months time and she still had sex with someone else shows me that she may not love me as much as she says. She also said she has a sex problem and sex is like going to the bathroon for her as she puts it but i dont see that as an excuse. if she loves me as much as she claims those sexual urges she has should become irrelevant as that how i ive been during my time back home. She also said i would have to drive up to the school to see her because the car she had was given to her by her mother and her mother didnt want her driving 2 hours to see just to see me. Although her mother would never find out unless she told her. That was her excuse for her not being able to come down to see me which made me the only one capable. 

But her mother also said she was not to have sex with anyone but she still did anyways and the only way her mother woukd find out is if she told her. So im hurt she rather stay at the school and have sex with a random guy rather than come to see me...I''ve never been hurt this much in my life and I don't know how to handle this... My trust is gone. I told her since I've been home I don't talk to other girls or anything of the such because we are ""something"" and even if that's something isn't significant I'm not going to have relations with any one else unless I don't have the means to see her. Please tell me if I'm in the wrong or not. I'm not going to argue with anyone because I value all of your opinions negative or positive. 

Also some people In the comment section were saying I treated her poorly because of how I'm phrasing our relationship as a ""fairytale"" but I promise you I haven't done anything to harm her at all. I've never had a bad relationship until now I suppose. I still talk to the few ex's I have with no anger or regret, But I didn't mean to make this relationship seem like a fairy tale so please forgive me. "

I've set up a lot of this with my post [Heat Wave pt. II](https://redd.it/6hydeg)

##Fritz Robotics

Fritz Robotics has been a staple of the Alporte business world going back to the city's golden years. Back then, Fritz made its name selling colour TVs and radio-controlled cars. With advances in computation and the advent of the microchip, Fritz took the new technology and moved swiftly into the future. They made a fortune manufacturing personal computers, but while their competitors turned their attention to smartphones and mobile devices, Fritz returned to its original dream: full-sized robotic creations.

The move into full robotics nearly sank the company. There were numerous disastrous experiments and false starts before they had anything to put on the market. Some stories say the company was a week away from bankruptcy before they launched their flagship model, the [Mk III Rollerguy^TM](http://i.imgur.com/1wBNLB5.jpg). It was a household service and maintenance robot with a versatile skillset and a lovable appearance. It was wildly popular and immediately became a staple for every wealthy family in Alporte and across the country, while the stripped-down Mk III-B unit became ubiquitous in middle-class households.

The Mk VI Rollerguy^TM is still in service today, with more advanced features, but the same lovable exterior. Other popular models have included its personal security drones: the Panther, the Falcon, and the Drake. The Arachnoid surveillance and maintenance droid was also extremely popular, due in part to its advanced AI and customizable personality matrix. 10 years ago they also rebranded their east offices as Fritz BioMech and pushed into the market for robotic limbs and personal implants. They have been successful in the former, but in the latter they lag well behind their chief competitor YRI.

Fritz Robotics made back its fortune quickly, but unfortunately the company has been beset by a number of costly failures in recent years. The most prominent of which was the Venus Loverbot, which boasted a realistic body temperature. Due to a manufacturing error, the heating core was misplaced inside the gynoid's body, and caused many painful and embarrassing injuries. The resulting lawsuits and full-scale recall cost the company over $1 billion.

Many of its remaining funds have also gone into the development of what it claims to be its most advanced equipment yet. It is supposed to be a lifelike combat and security gynoid with near-human AI. Little is known about it except that the prototype is being referred to as “MK”.

The current CEO of Fritz Robotics is Jakob Fritz, grandson of the founder, Wilhelm Fritz. He is 62 years old. His first marriage lasted 25 years until his wife died in a boating accident. They never had children. 9 years ago he remarried to Elenora Brushwell, 30 years his junior. It was largely a political marriage. She came from the Brushwell political dynasty and secured Fritz Robotics the contract for the Alporte Police Department's new line of security drones.

Jakob Fritz recently had a serious health crisis. There is little official word, but it is clear he is incapacitated for the time being. The company has been left to his CFO, Acton Burke, who supports a plan to merge Fritz Robotics with an overseas company.

##The Brushwells

Elenora Brushwell comes from the prominent Brushwell family. They have been moneyed gentry in Alporte for a long time, but became most prominent when her grandfather Bronson Brushwell served the city as mayor for many years. His tenure was popular, but ultimately divisive. Some people say he is responsible for giving the city its thriving economy and semi-autonomous statehood. Other people say he was responsible for the colossal wealth inequality, the creation of slums, and the proliferation of street gangs. Both accounts are correct.

Benny Brushwell is current inheritor of that political legacy. He also stood to inherit the gargantuan Brushwell Estates on the west side of Dorsett Island. He has served on city council for the past 10 years. In that time, despite his wealth, he has promoted an image of himself as a down-to-earth and compassionate family man. He eschews the typical trappings of wealth, and he can be often seen patronizing hot dog stands while wearing a t-shirt and ballcap. He runs on a populist message, saying that he speaks for all the people of Alporte, and thus far his message has proven popular.

One of his most prominent actions on city council is to create SOMA: the Social Outcast Mobility Accordance. Its aim is to target those poor and disenfranchised citizens of Alporte and give them the tools to improve their quality of life for themselves and their children. It is an ambitious and multi-faceted initiative that includes things like after-school programs, adult night classes, child care, open internships, and affordable housing. It has been three years since SOMA was approved and thus far, none of those things have happened, save one.

The SOMA Housing Project was opened last year in the southernmost slums near Qualkutta station. It was constructed to provide subsidized housing to the city's poorest residents. When it opened, it was treated like a miracle. Families were invited in from the streets and handed the keys to their apartment, where they had drinkable tap water and hot showers for the first time in their lives. And Benny Brushwell was behind it all, heralded as a saviour every where he went.

In the year since then, however, other stories have filtered out. There are stories that not all apartments in the project are as habitable as the ones shown on the news. Stories of crooked maintenance workers demanding extra money — or even “favours” — to fix life-threatening mold or rat infestations. There are stories that many of the apartment buildings are not housing families at all, but are being used as gang safehouses, brothels, and drug labs. And there are stories that Benny Brushwell knows all of this and takes his cut from the street gangs to let it keep happening. Those stories never make it to the news, though. At least not anymore.

**Deckard Junction** - I've mentioned this a few times. It's a major intersection within the entertainment district. It's a coveted piece of real estate for businesses. It also represents a collision of the friendlier, glitzier parts of Arcadia and the darker, seedier parts.

Preferably with an income I can count on - so not so much entrepreneurship or freelancing I don't think.

Problem is, I'm not sure what to look for or where to narrow my focus. I'm an over-40 woman and have learned that startups and small companies don't feel I'm ""a good culture fit"". 

I attended a 40-month coding bootcamp followed by a month-long internship at a software company, then after feedback from employers at job fairs decided to get a degree. So I'm a year into a 2-year Electrical/Computer Science Pre-Engineering program and thinking it's time to start looking forward to find what direction to go after degree completion. 

Web development seems to be one logical choice, though I'm looking for other options. Any ideas?"
6i4bni,0,2017-06-19,Wondering if my [21F] hookup arrangement with close associate [20M] of ex boyfriend's [23M] new gf [20F] is healthy despite my insistence on its absolute secrecy,hookupethicsthrow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6i4bni/wondering_if_my_21f_hookup_arrangement_with_close/,"Hi guys, I could use some perspective, since I'm not comfortable talking to my friends about this yet.

6 months ago, my then-boyfriend broke up with me, and then almost immediately started dating another girl at our college. At the time of the breakup, I'd been verbally lashing out at him and ignoring him for weeks out of seemingly nowhere; I'd really been struggling in my classes / job search, and came to resent him for my sense of inadequacy (like I was a girlfriend who couldn't match his worth), and for my belief that I could never be transparent to him about the full depth of my difficulties / limitations without seeing the admiration and adoration on his face instantly turn to scorn and disgust. My appeal in our relationship was very much founded on the idea of me as an effortlessly put-together, uncannily bright person, and I feared and hated the feeling that I had to hold it all together or pretend to in order to keep his love and kindness.

The point of this is that he was absolutely devastated when he decided to break up with me. He didn't know about my stress and my difficulties that semester, and only saw his seemingly perfect girlfriend suddenly spiral into two weeks of bewilderingly spiteful, mean, and cold behavior that had no explanation and no end in sight. It was the most serious and intimate relationship both of us had ever had, even with my constant fear of him doing a 180 in his treatment and opinion of me if he ever realized how little I really resembled the amazing girl I liked to present to him. The end was messy, with both of us trying two or three times each to get back in touch for two weeks after, and me crying daily and fantasizing about going back in time to ""fix"" mistakes for at least three months afterwards. But we've blocked each other on all social media and phones and kept out of contact since the week after we broke up. The silence was absolute torture for me at first, but eventually helped me grow stronger and focus on myself independently of an adoring boyfriend who helped me buff my self-identity.

I didn't date, use dating apps, hook up, or really even flirt with anyone until two weeks ago, until I started sleeping with a guy, let's call him Rick, at my internship who goes to the same college as my ex and me. I thought Rick was extremely attractive the first time I met him, and really warmed up to him over a week of having lunch with him, walking to events with him, hanging out in groups with him making everyone laugh, and seeing his place and how small and spare but clean and functional it was, etc. He was flirting with me pretty strongly too, and even though I was afraid that I might be ""using"" him to feel confident after a crushing breakup (instead of regaining confidence from my own actions), I honestly had such a great time around him and was so attracted to him that I went back with him after hanging out and slept with him. We've been keeping this up for the past two weeks.

Since the breakup with my ex 6 months ago, I've been mostly off facebook and instagram, since the idea of catching glimpses of my ex's life without me felt like cruel torture. So it was only two weeks ago that a mutual friend of my ex and me, during a catch-up skype call, told me that my ex (let's call him Will) was still with the girl he started dating days after we broke up.

Well, this was news to me, since I'd always imagined that Will was heartbroken by our breakup and had stayed as single and celibate on principle the same way I had, for about as long as I had. So I felt like a complete fool, realizing that he must not have cared about losing me the way I'd vainly imagined he did. I felt vulnerable and humiliated hearing this, that Will could have moved on so quickly while I was struggling and blindly imagining him doing the same in parallel. So I searched this girl up on facebook to see what she was about, and lo and behold, I find that she has TONS of pictures and tagged stuff with Rick, the guy I'm hooking up with. They're apparently in the same year and major and close-knit club at our college, and look platonically chummy in every picture they're in together. I feel sort of violated, almost, because it felt like this reminder of the awful feelings during/after my breakup had snaked its way into this supposedly new, fun, fresh chapter of my life with the internship and Rick.

So I haven't told Rick any of this, and I've continued sleeping with him casually, even though I've firmly told him that I need this to be strictly secret, even to his best friends. I like him and I enjoy what I have with him, but ever since I found out about his connection to Will's new gf, I've been stressing endlessly about the social consequences of our summer fling becoming public knowledge back at our college. I shudder at the idea of our hookup reaching Will and his gf, since it's basically 100% guaranteed that they'll think I went after Rick to ""get back"" at them for being happy together without me or something. Right?? I want to ask my friends for perspective, but I'm losing my mind that someone will tell someone else, and soon word will get out and my worst suspicions will be confirmed.

So far, Rick has been very cooperative about this, thinking I just value my privacy about my sex life outside of relationships in general. But I feel shameful and dirty, sneaking around and thinking about my ex with his gf every time I remember that Rick and I have to be this big taboo secret when we have so much fun together and seem to like each other a lot. It feels like I'm tainting our times together by stressing out about my ex, of all people, every time I think about what ""we"" are.

So seriously guys, do you think I'm being slimy by keeping Rick as essentially a dirty little secret, all so I don't risk my ex's contempt of me? Should I not be hooking up with him at all? Is there any good that can come out of me (oh god) explaining the deal behind my paranoia and insistence on secrecy to Rick? anyone been through a similar experience and have any advice for my anxiety about this? thanks SO much for helping me, this isn't the biggest problem in the world, but it's been making me feel ashamed and has been driving me crazy.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My ex and I had a mutually devastating breakup that kept me off social media ever since. I move on eventually, and start sleeping with a hot guy at my summer internship. Things are great, but I insist that he keep our relationship/arrangement 100% secret because I learn that my ex wasn't hung up on me like I'd thought, and in fact started dating his new gf only days after breaking up with me. Hot summer guy is super close with this new gf through various college functions, and I'm sick with fear that word will get to ex's new gf that I'm seeing someone close to her, and that she and ex will think I'm some obsessive psycho who's trying to get closer to them or something weird. So relationship with hot summer guy is hidden from everyone. I like him a lot, I see a possible future with him, and this secrecy depresses me and makes me feel dirty. Any ideas on how to handle this?"

6i6ddf,53,2017-06-19,Oh no she didn't! Am I being low balled or what?,munchytrip,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6i6ddf/oh_no_she_didnt_am_i_being_low_balled_or_what/,"Hello everyone. Big 4 Tax here. I'm in a large market city. I met this recruiter who I thought would be a great connection for when I decide to leave my firm. We set up a meeting and I explained my interest in exiting big 4 and tax in general and transitioning into industry accounting (financial accounting &amp; reporting, financial analyst or something similar). 

Here's my background: 2 years accounting experience pre-graduation (includes internships). 2 years big 4 experience post graduation to date. CPA. Masters in Accounting. Now being promoted to senior and new salary will be mid 60s. 

When we met, I expressed that I would like to get a senior non-tax role that pays at least low to mid 70s and if possible as much as high 70s to low 80s based on my experience of ex-coworkers with similar experience getting paid. The lady tells me she doesn't think I can get more than 60k since I am leaving tax and I understand I am leaving tax but I do have financial accounting experience and am still not so far along in tax that it's all I know. 

I told her if I can't get at least more than what I'll be making as senior in my current role, I am not interested as there is no point in wasting my time. A few months later, she emails me with a few ""job opportunities"" for staff accountant positions. One job was temp hire paying 40k and the other was perm hire for 50k. 

#1. I said I wanted a senior role, not a staff role. If I'm already promoted to senior, I do not expect with all my qualifications to be downgraded to an entry level staff role. 

#2. Both salaries are lower than what I was making my first year in big 4! Why would I accept a 15-25k pay cut???

#3. We have already discussed my career interests and goals, so why is this lady offering me a temp job and all this other bs that i clearly said I'm not interested in?

I feel so insulted I don't even think I can work with this person anymore. How should I respond to her email? Or should I not even bother responding at all and just move along to finding other headhunters who actually want to take my job search seriously???"
6i75b9,1,2017-06-19,"Me [25 M] with my girlfriend [26 F] of 3.5 years, only ever long distance, now may break up over transitioning to being together",Coheedin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6i75b9/me_25_m_with_my_girlfriend_26_f_of_35_years_only/,"My girlfriend and I have been together since December of 2014. We met at an internship over the summer of 2014 and became friends. We talked afterwards for some time before she came to visit me at school and I decided to ask her out. We have been in a long distance relationship ever since as she is pursuing her PhD in Tennessee and after I graduated I moved to Texas to take a job (both of us are chemical engineers).

We have always seen each other fairly frequently, once every month or two, usually just for a long weekend. There have been a few occasions where we have spent a week together for vacation or where she has been able to come to Texas for 2 weeks during a break in school and stayed at my apartment during the day while I worked.

Overall our relationship is good, but we do argue what I feel is fairly frequently. She gets jealous of me going out and spending times with my friends. I get frustrated when she shuts me out instead of talking to me when something bothers her. Etc. etc. But when we are together things are usually pretty good.

Recently I have felt a lot of pressure from her to move forward in our relationship. She has expressed multiple times that she would say yes if I asked her to marry me and that she doesn't understand how I can say that I love her and WANT to be with her but yet I'm not sure about our future and that I don't feel ready to move forward. Sometimes I feel that I'm making excuses but I think what I've settled on is that I have doubts and I really don't feel comfortable taking the next step until we have spent some times (e.g. months) together in the same place. She disagrees and thinks it's unnecessary and doesn't seem to think there is anything more for us to learn about each other and that since we've been together for 3 years I should be able to know if I want to spend the rest of my life with her or not.

Now she is getting ready to graduate in August. This should be an exciting time but in fact it's only been stressful for both of us. I have an established life in Texas. I have a job that pays well, a nice apartment, friends. But for her interests within biochemical engineering there are not really any opportunities for her in Houston. She feels that having spent the extra time and money to get her PhD she wants to get a job in her field of interest and not settle for something else. However she has also stated that if I could unequivocally tell her that I will marry her she would settle for a different engineering job and move to Houston. I don't want her to settle I want her to have the job she wants and she worked so hard for.

The difficulty comes in that I want us to spend time living together and she doesn't think it's necessary. I don't know if I'm being selfish but she asked if I would move to be with her if she found a job somewhere else. I told her that I don't know. It's difficult for me to uproot myself for something I feel uncertain about. If I do quit my job and move with her and then after spending the time living together I realize that it's not right for me then I can't take that decision back. It's also not fair of me to ask her to spend some months in Houston with me before going and finding a job for herself. I've told her that potential employers would understand if after spending 7 years in school you want to take a couple months for a break before starting work but she disagrees.

She feels, probably rightly so, that it's not right for me to ask her to move to me to spend time together when I'm not willing to move for her. 

  ---   
  tl;dr: Long distance relationship of 3+ years has reached the point where we could be living in the same place but my uncertainties about our relationship/future together are making that difficult to come to fruition and causing our relationship to crumble."
6i7o2k,4,2017-06-19,My year long relationship ended three weeks ago and I [28M] am struggling with wanting to contact my ex [23F].,dntkn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6i7o2k/my_year_long_relationship_ended_three_weeks_ago/,"**Backstory:** Six months ago, my now ex-girlfriend caught me searching one of my past girlfriends on Facebook. Upon going through my search history, she discovered that some of the past women I dated (serious and non-serious) that were being searched was being paired with PornHub links. Therefore, clearly showing that when I was masturbating my mind was also wondering off into past hook-ups. Since that happened I’ve tried the most I could to show her how wrong I was in that. I planned cute surprises and created a bunch of romantic arts+crafts things, dates, etc.

About a month ago she must have reached her breaking point and said she can’t stop thinking about what I did, that if I loved her I wouldn’t have done that, and so on. She said she needs time and space away from me as she doesn’t see me as the same man anymore. I don’t know why I did what I did, but I know for certain I have no feelings for my past girlfriends. How do I know? Because I can look at pictures of them and not feel anything, where as if I see a picture of my most recent ex-girlfriend I immediately break down. I am still madly in love with her.

**Present:** It’s been three weeks since the break up and since we last spoke. I have been a complete mess internally since then. I feel the most depressed I’ve ever been and have no motivation or desire to date again. When I’m with friends I put on a happy face but I’m the farthest from that feeling. Even my youngest sibling just got engaged, and although I am ultimately happy for her, I find it hard to be true to that as it makes me realize how alone I really am.

The past three weeks I’ve been trying to find something to make me happy again. At first, I contemplated a new truck, then I thought about getting a dog for companionship, then I began looking for teaching internships in overseas countries. But what I really want is to talk to her and see how she’s doing. Upon reading many threads on this I know it’s not the smartest of ideas but I wake up every morning and go to sleep at night with the urge to want to. I can’t stop thinking about her, how much happier I was with her, and how she is truly the most beautiful women I’ve ever met. I feel utterly hopeless and depressed at throwing away the best relationship I’ve ever had.

I'm not sure what I'm seeking with posting this. At the surface, I guess it's wanting to hear others opinions on this and what they think I should do. I think about calling her every single day, but should I? My sister seems to think that 3 weeks is plenty of ""time and space"" to have given her and she think I should text her if I truly loved her. My birthday is in two weeks and a part of me says to wait till then to see if she sends me a ""Happy Birthday"" text, but I know that seems petty and silly. I would be greatly appreciative if some of you can give some of your personal opinions on the matter and I am willing to answer any questions needed to form a better opinion. 

---   
  **tl;dr**: My now ex-girlfriend caught me searching one of my past girlfriends on Facebook six months go. About a month ago she reached her breaking point and said she can’t stop thinking about what I did. She said she needs time and space away. It’s been three weeks since the break up and since we last spoke and I have been a complete mess internally since then, feeling the most depressed I’ve ever been. I struggle every day with missing her and wanting to contact her to see how she is doing or if she would like to talk. My sister says she thinks I should, does this community feel the same way?  "

Given the opportunity, I will contribute smooth communication, writing and research skills and an infectious team spirit to your office. Enclosed is my resume featuring writing samples. The majority of the work I had published for Soraspy.com is no longer available online as the site has since been revamped, but I still have the plain copy of all 66 articles I wrote for that publication and have no issue submitting them for you at your request, or publishing them on my wordpress as to bring it to life.
 I am an incredibly hard worker and am not opposed to working outside of my job description. Any of my former employers will attest to that. I can be contacted via email (Dominickfilsaime@gmail.com) or by phone (914-312-3596) at your convenience to further discuss the position and the ways I can contribute. Hope all is well.

6i8j1v,10,2017-06-19,2 Month Motivation,uiucuwm,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/6i8j1v/2_month_motivation/,"After the break up, you’re sad and angry, playing out all the what-if scenarios in your head, thinking about what you could have done better, what you could have said differently, how you could have saved the relationship. Anything to avoid all the pain and misery you’re feeling. The cold truth is that getting back with your ex will not solve all the issues that separated the two of you, it won’t permanently heal the pain and sadness you’re feeling, and it won’t return things back to how it once was. The ending of your relationship may seem like the end of the world but it isn’t.

Two months ago, I was broken down. My mind and heart was dedicated to my relationship. I was so involved in my relationship that I lost focus of who I was and what my personal goals were. After my break up, I spent the first month being sad and miserable. After that first month, I began to realize my value and how being sad over all of this was pointless.  I used that built-up sadness and anger as motivation to hit the gym, upgrade my wardrobe to dress better, buy those pair of shoes I always wanted, push harder in my projects for my internship, and push me out of my comfort zone to be more social and build and reconnect with friends and family around me.

At first, doing all of this was to show my ex what she was missing out on, but slowly I began to realize that I wanted to do this for me. I pushed that extra rep in the gym with the anger from the break up, but in the end those gains were for me. It’s for the future me to look back on and appreciate and for the next lucky girl to appreciate. I didn’t let this sadness overcome me and shadow me from my potential. Instead, I channeled that negativity into positivity to better myself and those around me that deserve my respect. I slowly began to detach my mind from her and part of me wanted the best for her, but at the same time I didn’t want to have anything to do with her anymore. Our anniversary is right around the corner, but I don't expect anything to happen. It's just another day of the week for me. 

Don’t get me wrong, she’s still on my mind, but I’ve kept myself occupied with my job, hobbies, and hanging out with family and friends. My mind and life doesn't revolve around her anymore. Me telling the story about my break up to others doesn’t hurt as much. Looking back at what I learned and experienced through the 2-year long relationship has allowed me grow into a better person. You don’t learn and grow as a person unless you’ve encountered and overcome hardships in your life.

The phases after a break up that I see is being sad, being angry, moving on and enjoying the single life where all your time and energy is focused on you and your relationships with your family and friends, and eventually forgiving your ex. I am slowly moving away from the angry phase and transitioning to the moving on phase. I don’t think I will ever forgive my cheating ex, but one day in the future I can see myself sitting down with her and catching up with her in a friendly and nonromantic way. But, I don’t have hope of us ever forming back a friendly relationship and instead would prefer to make new friends and prioritize other people in my life. As of now, I will remain no contact. I wouldn’t be who I am today without going through this break up.

I’m not here to tell you to get over it or move on right away. Take your time to grieve and accept the fact that what happened has happened.  It takes time and changing the way you think and see things. Grow from this experience whether it be learning from your mistakes or accepting that you did everything in your power to make things work out. Respect yourself. You’ll slowly begin to realize that the end of one thing may just be the beginning of something better and more beautiful."

Beyoncé and Jay Z’s relationship is the stuff of pop culture legend. Over the course of almost two decades, the ultimate power couple has done everything from collaborate on music to tour together. And while their relationship hasn’t always been [drama-free](http://ift.tt/1uX9ifG), there’s no doubt that Jay and Bey are committed. In honor of the [birth of their twins](http://ift.tt/2jEbh6V), here’s a comprehensive primer on Beyoncé and Jay Z’s relationship.

**1997 – 2000**: Sometime during this three-year period, Jay Z and Beyoncé meet for the first time. Exactly when depends on the interview. In [a 2007 interview with Charlie Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS_imMLbmyw), Jay Z said he met Beyoncé “10 years ago,” which would place their first meeting around 1997. However, in a 2008 interview with _Seventeen_, Beyoncé says that she first met the rap mogul when she was 18 (around 1999 or 2000) and that they began dating when she was 19.
   
**November 2001**: The pair appear [on the cover of _Vanity Fair_‘s music issue](http://ift.tt/2ssWWR2) alongside David Bowie, Gwen Stefani and others. According to [an interview with _Vanity Fair_in 2013](http://ift.tt/1hBMb82), Jay Z says that during this shoot, they were “just beginning to try to date each other,” and that at the time, he was still trying to “wine and dine” her.

**October 2002**: In her first post-Destiny’s Child work, Beyoncé is featured on Jay Z’s 2002 track “’03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde;” she also appears as the ride-or-die Bonnie to Jay Z’s Clyde in the accompanying video. Jay Z’s use of the term “girlfriend” only heightened the romantic narrative of the song, sending [tongues wagging](http://ift.tt/2st5gQr) about a potential romance between Beyoncé and Jay Z.

In [a 2016 interview with _BET_](http://ift.tt/2rJtvgi), Roc-A-Fella founder Kareem “Biggs” Burke said that this song signaled to him and Damon Dash that Jay Z was really in love with Beyoncé.

“There was a time in Paris when they sent us ‘Bonnie &amp; Clyde,’” he said. “When we heard that song, Dame looked at me and said ‘Yo, he’s in love.’ So if y’all know Jay, a lot of times everything comes out in music. When he does interviews he’s a little more reluctant to speak about certain things. But it always comes out in his albums; so at that time when ‘Bonnie &amp; Clyde’ came out we knew he was in love with Beyoncé.”

**November 2002**: Although Bey and Jay are keeping mum about a relationship, they show up in matching denim ensembles (and Bey rocks Jay’s signature Yankees cap, natch) to promote “’03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde” on MTV’s _Total Request Live._During this appearance, Beyoncé [also says that they “met a long time ago.”](http://ift.tt/2st93NZ)

**February 2003**: Jay Z and Beyoncé are photographed together at the NBA All-Star Game Weekend, one of a number of outings that year.

**April 2003**: Lest anyone get the wrong idea about their chummy relationship, however, Jay Z sets the record straight in an interview with [_Playboy_](http://ift.tt/2ssWUbS): “We’re just cool. We’re just friends.”

**May 2003**: Beyoncé releases “Crazy in Love,” as the lead single off her first solo album, _Dangerously in Love._Jay Z contributes a rap verse and features prominently as her love interest in the accompanying music video. Needless to say, their respective fans and most of the world [assume](http://ift.tt/176Nkir) that the two are more than just friends.

**June 2003**: _Dangerously in Love_officially drops. The album features another duet with Jay Z, “That’s How You Like It,” and perhaps more interesting, a reference to her love for a Sagittarius on the song “Signs” with Missy Elliott; Jay Z, born on Dec. 4, is a Sagittarius.

**August 2003**: The dynamic duo perform “Crazy in Love” at the MTV Video Music Awards.

**November 2003**: Jay Z releases _The Black Album_; on his song “Public Service Announcement,” he makes the declaration that he’s got the “hottest chick in the game wearing my chain,” which is widely believed to be about Beyoncé.

Later that month, Jay holds a “retirement” concert at Madison Square Garden where he and Beyoncé perform “Crazy in Love” together.

**December 2003**: In an interview with [_The Guardian_](http://ift.tt/2ssWUIU), Jay Z is referred to as Beyoncé’s boyfriend.

**August 2004**: Bey and Jay make their first red carpet appearance at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards together in some very memorable matching ensembles.

Frank Micelotta—Getty Images**2005**: [Rumors](http://ift.tt/22pzzD7) that Jay Z is having a relationship with then up-and-coming singer Rihanna surface. The author of an unauthorized Beyoncé biography, J. Randy Taraborrelli, told _[Entertainment Tonight](http://ift.tt/1RXaHgA)_in a 2015 interview that the unsubstantiated affair was fabricated for the tabloids to “boost Rihanna’s career.” Bey’s father and manager Matthew Knowles does not address the rumors until the following year in a [lengthy press release](http://ift.tt/1NMyDAf) that it’s a “consistent plan by some to create chaos around Beyoncé’s _B’Day_release.”

**January 2006**: Trouble rumors swap out for rumors of wedding bells after an interview with [_Cosmopolitan_](http://ift.tt/1z2QNrd) when Beyoncé hints at a possible wedding.

“Right now, the tabloids are saying I’m pregnant, and they’re naming the baby,” she said. “It’s hilarious. I don’t know when I’ll want to get married. I never pictured myself as a bride, but after my sister’s wedding, I did start thinking about what kind of wedding I’d want. I don’t think I want a big one.”

**September 2006**: Beyoncé releases her second album _B’Day,_which includes two duet tracks with Jay Z: “Dèjá Vu” and “Upgrade U.”

In the “Upgrade U” video, Beyoncé dresses up like Jay Z and lip syncs some of his rap verse.

Matthew Knowles releases [a statement](http://ift.tt/2stbNuH) denying several rumors including the ones about Rihanna, suggesting they are an attempt to sabotage the album’s success following the release of _B’Day_. The album prominently featured a number of joyful love songs, but “Ring the Alarm” and “Resentment” get the rumor mill going as some fans [speculated](http://ift.tt/2rJtyst) the [lyrics to “Resentment” in particular](http://ift.tt/2ssZ4rP) could have been inspired by an affair.

**November 2006**: Jay Z releases the album _Kingdom Come_, which includes the song “Lost One.” The song’s introspective lyrics read “I don’t think it’s meant to be, B/But she loves her work more than she does me/And honestly, at 23/I would probably love my work more than I did she.”

Later, in 2010, Jay Z addresses the lyrics in his book, _[Decoded](http://ift.tt/1ngcbWk):_“These lines are about trying to have a real, serious relationship with another ambitious professional. In a lot of ways, this is the flip side of the songs in my catalog like ‘Big Pimpin’, where women exist almost completely as predators or objects. This is about how difficult it is to respect a lover as an autonomous human being, with separate needs and goals and timelines than yours. It’s one of the hardest things about a real relationship of equals. But it’s worth it.”

The album also features “Hollywood,” a collaboration with Beyoncé.

**April 2008**: Beyoncé and Jay Z tie the knot in a top-secret ceremony at Jay Z’s penthouse apartment in NYC [on April 4, 2008](http://ift.tt/2stbPTb). The date is an homage to the significance of the number 4 in the couple’s life; both Bey and Jay are born on the 4th (Beyoncé’s birthday is Sept. 4 while Jay’s is Dec. 4.) In lieu of wedding rings, [Jay and Bey get the Roman numeral “IV” tattooed on their fourth/ring fingers](http://ift.tt/2jx4UHi).

While the couple kept the wedding under wraps, without releasing photos or video, wedding footage makes its way into [the “On the Run” tour visuals](http://ift.tt/2l3NXob) and on Beyoncé’s 2016 visual album _Lemonade_. It’s an uber-private ceremony — in [a 2009 interview with Oprah](http://ift.tt/2oQObQS), Jay Z says it was a small affair.

[9 years already??? Congratulations to the Carters❤❤on their Anniversary 💐 ( thats my arm fixing the dress lol) Thats my minister Rudy Rasmus who married Solange, Beyonce and me❤](http://ift.tt/2oySCQs)

A post shared by Tina Knowles (@mstinalawson) on Apr 4, 2017 at 7:11am PDT

**October 2008**: Beyoncé offers a rare glimpse of what her relationship with Jay Z is really like during an interview with _[Essence](http://ift.tt/2rJmRGV):_“We decide everything. My word is my word. What Jay and I have is real. It’s not about interviews or getting the right photo op. It’s real.” She also shares that she didn’t want an engagement ring because “people put too much emphasis on that. It’s just material and it’s just silly to me.”

During this month, Beyoncé also released “Single Ladies” and “If I Were a Boy” as the first singles off her third studio album _I Am…Sasha Fierce_. Producer Christopher “Tricky” Stewart commented in a 2014 interview with _[Texas Music Magazine](http://ift.tt/2stkbu2)_that at the time, the song was “the only public statement [Beyoncé and Jay-Z] ever made about marriage.”

**January 2009**: Jay Z and Beyoncé solidify their status as a power couple by joining forces with President Barack and First Lady Michelle Obama. The Carter-Knowles were [vocal supporters of Obama during the 2008 presidential election](http://ift.tt/1sAla5i) and made high-profile appearances at both the Inauguration and an inaugural ball. Beyoncé performed “America the Beautiful” at the Obama Inaugural Concert and “At Last” for the first dance at the [Neighborhood Ball](http://ift.tt/206fa5R).

**April 2010**: While Beyoncé is taking a break from her music that [many believe is due to pregnancy](http://ift.tt/2rJBEBg), she makes a surprise appearance at Jay Z’s Coachella set that year to help him sing “Forever Young.”

**October 2010**: Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, tells _[Access Hollywood](http://ift.tt/2sthysb)_that there’s no truth to the talk of pregnancy. “No, it’s not true right now,” she said. “It’s gonna happen when it’s time, but not right now.”

**May 2011**: In [a blog post on his website _Life + Times_](http://ift.tt/2rJqWuA), Jay Z posts a video that he took of Beyoncé rehearsing for an _American Idol_performance, captioning it “Sometimes you need perspective. You’ve been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time. This is the dressing room rehearsal for _American Idol_. NO MICROPHONE. No effects.”

**June 2011**: Beyoncé releases her fourth studio album, appropriately titled _4_, after the couple’s favorite number. This is her first studio album that doesn’t feature Jay Z on any of the songs. Of the many love songs on the album, “Countdown” leads fans to theorize about a future pregnancy.

**August 2011**: Jay Z and Kanye West release joint album _Watch the Throne_; Beyoncé appears on the track “Lift Off.” Later that month before performing at the MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé announces her pregnancy by asking the audience to “feel the love that’s growing inside of me.”

At the end of her performance, she unbuttons her sequined tuxedo jacket to reveal her growing baby bump — much to the unbridled delight of the audience, [Kanye West](http://ift.tt/2styoaw) and pretty much the entire world. The announcement even [sets a Guinness World Record](http://ift.tt/2kjLQcM) for the most tweets per second recorded for a single event at the overwhelming rate of 8,868 tweets per second.

**January 2012**: Beyoncé gives birth to Blue Ivy Carter on Jan. 7, 2012 in New York City. The couple releases [an official joint statement](http://ift.tt/2ehvHDl) about the heir to the Knowles-Carter legacy: “Her birth was emotional and extremely peaceful – we are in heaven. She was delivered naturally at a healthy 7 lbs. It was the best experience of both of our lives. We are thankful to everyone for all your prayers, well wishes, love and support.” Many [see Blue’s middle name Ivy as a homonym for the Roman numeral IV](http://ift.tt/yPwvQX), pointing to the Knowles-Carters’ affinity for the number.

About a week later, Jay Z posts the Neptunes-produced song “[Glory](http://ift.tt/2ssWXo4)” on his website, which commemorates the birth of Blue Ivy, most notably by including a clip of her cries at the conclusion of the song and giving her a credit on the song as B.I.C. ([Blue Ivy is the youngest person to ever appear on a Billboard chart](http://ift.tt/1dcBGDW).)

The song is uncharacteristically revealing about the long-awaited joy Blue Ivy has brought them with lyrics like “False alarms and false starts/All made better by the sound of your heart/All the pain of the last time” and “My most greatest creation was you.” Jay also has some touching homages to Bey in the song, including a reference to her past life as a member of Destiny’s Child: “You’re a child of destiny/You’re a child of my destiny/You’re my child with the child from Destiny’s Child/That’s a hell of a recipe.”

**February 2012**: The Knowles-Carters post [the first pictures](http://ift.tt/2jxAnZW) of Blue Ivy on [her own, now-defunct Tumblr](http://ift.tt/2rJU6VB). The Internet, predictably, loses it.

May 2012: Jay Z makes a rare display of public affection on Twitter about his wife.

""I'm gonna say this and then I'm gonna end mine."" BEYONCE is the best performer in the world. Period.

— Mr. Carter (@S\_C\_) [May 26, 2012](https://twitter.com/S_C_/status/206237635994324992)

**August 2012**: The Carter-Knowles surpass Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen as [_Forbes’_highest-paid celebrity couple](http://ift.tt/2ssZ4Il) at an estimated combined $78 million.

**January 2013**: Beyoncé sings the national anthem at Obama’s second inauguration.

That same month, [Ora takes to Twitter](http://ift.tt/2rJrUqD) to vehemently deny the rumor she’s having an affair with her then-Roc Nation mentor Jay Z.

**February 2013**: Beyoncé releases her HBO documentary _Life Is But a Dream_, which features footage of intimate and romantic moments.

Beyoncé also denies [rumors that she wasn’t actually pregnant with Blue Ivy](http://ift.tt/1D2Pf6o).

An especially poignant part of the film shows the pair singing Coldplay’s “Yellow” together. Later in 2015, Jay Z will select this song as his pick for [her birthday playlist](http://ift.tt/2ssPdlR), citing that “This song reminds me of you and I on vacation. ‘Look at the stars, look how they shine for you.’ So many legendary nights. It represents vulnerability; it’s us in our own world, away from work and totally lost in love. ‘For you, I’ll bleed myself dry.'”

This month, Beyoncé also reveals to [Oprah](http://ift.tt/1z2QNrf) that she suffered a miscarriage before Blue Ivy; she also sheds light on how her marriage helped shape her self-concept. “I would not be the woman I am if I did not go home to that man,” Beyoncé said. “It gives me such a foundation.”

**April 2013**: The couple [celebrate their 5th wedding anniversary in Cuba](http://ift.tt/Y0PQvM) with their respective mothers. While the trip was drew criticism for possibly violating U.S. sanction laws, it was [later officially cleared by the Department of the Treasury](http://ift.tt/YCSu1M).

Beyoncé embarks on her Mrs. Carter World Tour; while on tour, Jay Z makes romantic surprise appearances like this one.

**July 2013**: Jay Z releases his album _Magna Carta Holy Grail_; Beyoncé appears on the track “Part II (On the Run),” a sequel of sorts to “’03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde.” Out of countless lyrics about matters of the heart, “Holy Grail” has a verse that references infidelity, which leads some listeners to jump to conclusions: “Keep cheating on me /What I do / I took her back / Fool me twice / That’s my bad / I can’t even blame her for that.”

**December 2013**: Beyoncé drops her surprise self-titled visual album, _Beyoncé._The album features Jay Z on the sexy track “Drunk in Love,” which [introduces the word “surfbort”](http://ift.tt/2sto4PT) into the pop culture canon. Jay Z — or representations of him — appears multiple times in the visual components, including Jay watching Beyoncé perform at the Crazy Horse in Paris in “Partition” and dancing with her on the beach for “Drunk in Love.”

The album is [lauded](http://ift.tt/1lWgINp) for Beyoncé’s strong embrace of being an empowered woman, from “Blow” to “***Flawless,” which sampled Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The theme of betrayal that Bey’s addressed in the past pops up again, especially on the tracks “Mine” and “Jealous.” On “Mine,” lyrics talk about “having conversations about breakups and separations/I’m not feeling like myself since the baby/Are we gonna even make it? Oooh/’Cause if we are, we’re taking this a little too far” while on “Jealous,” she notes “I never broke one promise, and I know when you’re not honest.”

**January 2014**: Beyoncé and Jay Z give a [much-praised](http://ift.tt/2stoGVq) performance of “Drunk in Love” at the Grammys; while Jay Z was criticized for [his references to Ike and Tina Turner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G1E3llZtWM) in his verse on the song, Beyoncé co-signs the lyric by singing the line with him during the live performance, [a move that some pointed to as Bey standing by her man](http://ift.tt/2rJrjFK).

Later that night, when Jay Z wins a Grammy for _Magna Carta Holy Grail,_Hov pays homage to Queen Bey in his acceptance speech. “I want to thank God, I mean, a little for this award, but mostly for that and all the universes for conspiring and putting that beautiful light of a young woman in my life.” He also calls his Grammy a “sippy cup” for Blue Ivy.

**April 2014**: Jay and Bey announce their first ever joint tour called the “On the Run” tour, which includes a very excellent short film of a trailer.

Ora again dispels rumors that she and Jay Z are involved in anything besides a working relationship during an interview on Power 105.1, telling the interviewer, “Don’t you dare disrespect Beyoncé like that ever again in your entire life,” she said. “You should know better than that. That’s just straight-up disrespect.”

**May 2014**: The news of the tour is soon overshadowed after [video footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhu2I_Luv74) is leaked of Beyoncé’s sister Solange physically attacking her brother-in-law in an elevator at the Standard Hotel in New York City, following a Met Gala after party. Beyoncé stood by without interfering during the incident.

The [buzz](http://ift.tt/VzoPVA) about the footage was enough to prompt the family to make a statement to [_AP_](http://ift.tt/1nPmVMi), saying that while there has been “a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident…the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred.” The statement stated that Jay and Solange also apologized to each other and that “we have moved forward as a united family.”

Some speculated that the elevator episode was prompted by an interaction with Rachel Roy at the after-party. The fashion designer is the [ex-wife of Jay’s ex-business partner Damon Dash](http://ift.tt/1Qxeq0V). A former intern at Jay and Dash’s fashion label Rocawear, she eventually rose in the ranks until she was named the creative director of womenswear at the label.

The day after the elevator incident, Beyoncé posts a photo of herself on Instagram wearing a shirt with Aaliyah’s face on it. Some see this action [as a slight toward Roy](http://ift.tt/2rJtxoq), since [Dash had dated the late singer until her untimely death;](http://ift.tt/22LtwqV) When [Solange appears to delete](http://ift.tt/1mmS7QB) most of the photos of her sister on her Instagram account, it makes headlines. Meanwhile, Beyoncé posts a prayer and photos of her and her sister together on her own Instagram.

Toward the end of the month, Beyoncé posts a photo of herself to Instagram that shows that she’s not at Kim Kardashian West’s wedding to Kanye West, an interesting development especially given Jay Z’s close collaboration with West. [Some on the Internet point to Roy’s close friendship with Kardashian West](http://ift.tt/RmXpja) as to why Bey and Jay skip the wedding.

**June 2014:** The On the Run tour starts, with music’s ultimate power couple showing off tons of PDA onstage. During the Cincinnati stop of the On the Run tour, Beyoncé changes the lyrics of “Resentment” from “been ridin’ with you for six years” to “been ridin’ with you for 12 years,” which corresponds to their relationship timeline at that point.

She also changes the lyrics to another line from “I’ll always remember feeling like I was no good/Like I couldn’t do it for you like your mistress could” to “I’ll always remember feeling like I was no good/Like I couldn’t do it for you like that wack b—-ch could.”

The kicker of lyric changes, however, comes from the line “been ridin’ with you for six years/I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she’s had half of me” becoming “been ridin’ with you for 12 years/I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she’s had half of me. She ain’t even half of me. That b–ch will never be.”

Over on Beyoncé’s Instagram, all appears well with the Knowles-Carters.

[A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)](http://ift.tt/1RYmpvi) on Jul 21, 2014 at 7:57pm PDT

**August 2014**: Beyoncé releases a remix of”Flawless” featuring Nicki Minaj, adding the instantly iconic, self-referential line, “Of course sometimes sh-t go down when it’s a billion dollars on an elevator.”

Later that month, Tina Knowles tells a _[TMZ](http://ift.tt/1uZQMol)_reporter that “everything’s perfect.” Matthew Knowles, no longer Beyoncé’s manager, suggests that breakup rumors are a “[Jedi mind trick](http://ift.tt/1plIqoZ)” to ignite ticket sales for the tour in an interview on the _The Roula &amp; Ryan Show_.

However, at the end of the month, Beyoncé appears and performs a medley of her greatest hits at the MTV Video Music Awards, where Jay Z and Blue Ivy present her with the Video Vanguard Award. In her acceptance speech, Beyoncé tells Jay Z, “My beloved, I love you.”

After the VMAs, the pair are spotted being affectionate at Jay’s Made in America festival.

**September 2014**: Jay releases a tribute video to Bey in honor of her birthday. Later that month, HBO releases an “On the Run” concert special.

**October 2014**: Bey and Jay take a trip to Paris. Quelle romantique!

[A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)](http://ift.tt/1RYmoHJ) on Oct 17, 2014 at 6:31am PDT

**November 2014**: Beyoncé releases the track “Ring Off,” which includes a story about turmoil that her mother Tina experienced; she ultimately divorced from Matthew Knowles. Some [view this ode as a cautionary tale](http://ift.tt/1BRLOhR) for Jay Z.

**February 2015**: The pair appear at the Grammys that month.

[A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)](http://ift.tt/1RYmpvm) on Feb 9, 2015 at 10:57am PST

**May 2015**: One year after the elevator incident, Jay Z and Beyoncé attend the Met Gala together.

**September 2015**: During a trip to Italy, Beyoncé posts a picture of herself on Instagram with a lemon, [a photo that will be heavily analyzed](http://ift.tt/2stbQXf) after she releases her next album.

[A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)](http://ift.tt/1SS4Ckb) on Sep 20, 2015 at 8:17am PDT

**April 2016**: Beyoncé releases her [widely celebrated](http://ift.tt/1rsEgPB) sixth studio album (and second visual album,) _Lemonade._An overarching theme of the album is infidelity, with many lyrics and entire songs devoted to betrayal in a relationship (at one point in her song “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” she says “If you try this sh-t again/You gon’ lose your wife). However, the album ends with themes of reconciliation and forgiveness.

As might be expected, the [Internet explodes with memes](http://ift.tt/2rJ0oJY), hot takes and perhaps more importantly, a manhunt for a certain “Becky with the good hair” who is referenced on the song “Sorry.”

“Becky With the Good Hair” is one of two figures: either a fictional character who factors heavily into lyrics about infidelity, or an actual person with whom Jay Z cheated on Beyoncé. Whatever the case, the Bey Hive (the singer’s rabid fanbase) and the media devoted a great deal of energy to seeking out “Becky,” at one time [pointing to designer Rachel Roy](http://ift.tt/1VzVrLw), who had worked with Jay Z. Celebrity chef [Rachael Ray](http://ift.tt/2rJtzg1), whose name is similar to Roy’s, and hilariously Ray Romano, were also targets of the Hive’s ire.

Roy denied the rumors in an interview with _[People](http://ift.tt/1VzVrLw)_ saying “there is no validity to the idea that the song references me personally,” and advocated against bullying.

Beyoncé also begins her [Formation tour](http://ift.tt/2hi5TWy). At the opening show in Miami, she dedicates the song “Halo” to Jay Z with this sweet tribute: “I want to dedicate this song to my beautiful husband, I love you so much.”

**May 2016**: Beyoncé attends the Met Gala sans Jay Z. At a Met Gala after-party, [multiple celebs including Rita Ora are spotted wearing “Not Becky” pins](http://ift.tt/1SWlMjb). Ora also [Snapchats a selfie](http://ift.tt/2stoIww) of herself with Queen Bee, in what one might assume is an attempt to sedate the Bey Hive.

[A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)](http://ift.tt/1UtOVoc) on May 2, 2016 at 5:17pm PDT

**February 2017**: Beyoncé breaks the Internet with a simple Instagram post announcing that the Knowles-Carter family would be expecting not one but two new additions to the family.

[We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. – The Carters](http://ift.tt/2jYGQMe)

**April 2017**: On their ninth wedding anniversary, Beyoncé releases a new Tidal exclusive music video filled with lots of intimate home footage for “Die With You,” [a song that she debuted in 2015 also on Tidal](http://ift.tt/1xOFI0n) for the same occasion.

I am talking about things like, if you can't support op2 or X, take an intern and make him push all the needed code to github, the phones are absolete anyway, why not make people who have it happy? Money? Well, I am pretty sure that, if they make sure people have proper tools to support themselves, they wont complain, nor will it hold it back to buy new hardware.

Release all the needed blobs, code, drivers and give people a stable code foundation or at least give them tools to create such. Make sure that WE people whose tech opinion is asked by friends and relatives, WE people who repair stuff for free for others, will think about you first if we are asked once again what to buy.

You do a lot for the Open Source community OnePlus, I know, but please go the extra mile which you are always talking about and we WILL spend money on you even more so."

    &gt;I loved Elon so much, I had all the SpaceX hoodies and mission patches.
    &gt;I pray to Elon every night before bed, thanking him for the life I’ve been given.

    &gt;""Elon is love"" I say; “Elon is life”.

    &gt;My dad hears me and calls me a space bro.
    &gt;I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Elon.
    &gt;I called him a shill for the oil industry.
    &gt;He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.
    &gt;I’m crying now, and my face hurts.
    &gt;I begin writing to ease the pain.

    &gt;”Dear Elon…
    &gt;From the moment I met you, all those years ago at Code Conference, not a day has gone by when I haven't
    thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it 
    gets. The thought of not being with you- I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the Model 3 blueprints that you
    should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that will not become a scar. You are in my very
    soul, tormenting me...what can I do?- I will do anything you ask.”

    &gt;I go back to return to sleep, dreaming of a day when I will be taken away into another world.
    &gt;I lay in bed and it’s really cold.
    &gt;Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me.
    &gt;It’s Elon.
    &gt;I am so happy.
    &gt;He grabs me with his powerful engineer hands and whispers into my ear. His voice is warm and husly like 
    dark melted chocolate fudge caramel… or something.

    &gt;“My desires are … unconventional.”
    &gt;“So show me.”
    &gt;He drives his Boring Company deep into the underground.
    &gt;He launches his rocket up into the Hyperloop.
    &gt;He lets his advanced AI link with my neural systems.
    &gt;My very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba. I flush at the waywardness of my
    subconscious - she's doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.
    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

    &gt;He flies me away to his secret rocket facility.
    &gt;”Aren’t you hungry”, he asks.
    &gt;”No.” I didn’t feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full - of butterflies.
    &gt;”I would let you drive this Falcon 9 V1.2 Block IV Fullerer Thrust but friends don’t let friends drive 
    drunk.”
    &gt;”Drunk?”
    &gt;”You’re intoxicated by my very presence.”
    &gt;We arrive at SpaceX.
    &gt;We touch goodbye. His fingers were ice-cold, like he’d been holding them in a snowdrift before the 
    flight. But that wasn’t why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an 
    electric current had passed through us.
    &gt;He bids me goodbye and says we will meet again...when I am ready.

    &gt;Fast forward, the year is 2194.
    &gt;The smoldering remains of planet Earth are being ruled by Chancellor Trump XXVIII, victor of the Great
    Resource Wars. Meanwhile I am stationed on the Dagobah System, hunting down any criminals that exploit the
    environment and harvest its fossil fuels. After years of peace and prosperity, it has been rumored that a
    dark presence has re-appeared.
    &gt;I wake up in my cryo-chamber. As I slip into my SpaceX hoodie, I glance towards my robot companion. I load
    my REI credits into the 370N-XFEM-4000 and a frozen yogurt portion pops out.
    &gt;I give her a kiss good-bye.
    &gt;I put my Ray Bans on and head off to work. Outside the door, I pass a group of interns has returned 
    from their weekly trip to Space-Aspen. A tear rolls down my cheek as I fondly remember the Days of
    Learning. Away in the distance, I spot a group of liberal arts majors being led away. 
    &gt;Their fates lie in the sarlacc pits now.
    &gt;The central bell chimes. Everyone stops in their tracks and recites the morning pledge.
    &gt;”I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE,” we all chant in unison.

    &gt;I’m on my way to see the All Knowing One. He wants to speak with me privately. 
    &gt;I traverse the hill and arrive at the castle at the top.
    &gt;At the end of the Great Hall, the head of Jeff Bezos lies on a solitary pike. Below it, the God-Emperor 
    sits on his throne, made out of the un-reusable boosters of his vanquished enemies.
    &gt;Elon: “I have been watching your career with great interest, Michael.”
    &gt;He gets off his throne and pulls a curtain, showing an artifact behind him. I recognized it as one of the
    forbidden fossil fuel objects – a preserved Dodge Neon.
    &gt;A sense of shock envelops me. How could he be seen with this abomination? How could he go against the
    teachings?
    &gt;E: “I sense great fear in you. Do not be afraid of the Dark Side. It is a pathway to many abilities 
    some consider to be…unnatural.”
    &gt;Me: “You’re the oil sheikh we’ve been looking for! I have to inform the council at once.”
    &gt;E: “I do not fear the fossil fuels as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to 
    my new empire.”
    &gt;M: “YOUR new empire? My allegiance is to affordable electric vehicles. To developing a cost-effective 
    method of space exploration.”
    &gt;E: If you’re not with me, then you’re my enemy.”
    &gt;M: “You were the chosen one. It was said that you would destroy the oil companies, not join them!”
    &gt;At that point, I felt as though my limbs had been hacked away. My entire body and soul felt charred. How
    could this be? He had made affordable electric vehicles for the common consumer and a cost-effective energy
    solution that would solve all our problems and bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Was it all a ruse 
    to gain power and fame for himself?
    &gt;E: “Look into your heart, you know this to be true. Join me and we will rule together.”
    &gt;I knew. 

    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

6i9btk,2,2017-06-19,My brain isn't letting me be happy anymore,Weaponshell,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6i9btk/my_brain_isnt_letting_me_be_happy_anymore/,"Hey everyone. First time posting here, have been lurking for a while. Everyone who comments and helps other people out, you're amazing.

I'm a 22 year old guy, currently in the last 6 months of my bachelor Software Engineering. I'm doing a paid internship at a company in my city.

When I was 14, my father was diagnosed with cancer. It had already gone on too long to be stopped, so we knew he was on a timer as it were. We went on holidays while he was still able (he loved going on holidays with me, my mom and my older brother) and went Asia. It was amazing. During this time, I met a girl I really liked from high school. Couple of months later we started to date. My then-friends did not approve of her and did not like it when I was sad about my father. I left those friends.

I then had to find new people to hang around with and connect with. Luckily, I already knew a couple of the friends of my girlfriend, and I got new friends in the process. Friends who really cared. I was very happy that that happened. 

My family then went on one other holiday; going around in the U.S. in an RV. It was the best holiday of my life. Both my girlfriend and my brother's went along. It was the best time of my life.
About a year later, my father's health started to decline really rapidly. He passed away one day before my 18th birthday. I loved making music, so my parents got me a real Australian didgeridoo. He knew about it, but has never seen it or heard it.

Skip to six months ago. Me and my girlfriend moved in together. We got an apartment in the city (I still live there). It was nice, but something was off. 2½ months ago my girlfriend told me she had problems, she wasn't sure about our relationship anymore. We tried counselling, but it didn't work. She had feelings for other people, but no longer for me. So two months ago she broke up with me. Three weeks later she already had another boyfriend. We had a relationship for 6½ years.

I couldn't live with myself anymore, I was heartbroken. But aside from that, all the feelings I had in my earlier life came back as well. The loss of my father, my friends who did not care for me, the fact that I could not follow the study I wanted to and had to settle for less. I never had a girlfriend before her (or even kissed a girl or had sex). It broke me apart.

I started going to a therapist. This helped a little bit, but I had hoped for more. Three weeks ago I started using antidepressants. This helped for about a week and a half, but then I sort of 'wore out'. My doctor said it was part of the medication, but I'm not sure if I believe him. I also started doing the internship to get my mind of things, but it doesn't help (enough). I've lost 6kgs, don't really eat healthy and barely leave the house if able. I'm just so miserable all the time, and feel like I won't ever be happy again. There is no-one in my life who understands, or who has been through the same. I have tried committing suicide twice, but both times I managed to stop myself. Now I don't want to anymore, but I also don't want to go on. I've got no hope or motivation left.

I had plans to propose to my girlfriend in autumn. I'm still stuck on her. I can't even look at other women anymore, or couples, or relationships. I can't even look at porn between a man and a woman anymore. When I saw a pretty girl on my college, I shunned and felt miserable. I don't even know why! It's like my brain is stopping me from ever doing anything with love or happiness.

My brain is cluttered with memories that now feel fake or false. I keep seeing my ex doing all the things she did with me with someone else, and it breaks my heart every time. The medication helped a bit, but they the thoughts are now back and are really 'sharp' (if that makes sense).

I don't know what to do anymore. It just feel so drained all the time. I hope to find people here who feel the same, who can talk about their experiences and share. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this kind of thing. If it is not, please tell me where to go. I'm not really familiar in reddit. Thank you for reading."

I'll be doing a short term internship in the fall in Toronto and found a couple prospective places in Stockyards District (apparently formerly known as Junction Area?) Anyway, I wanted to know if people knew of this area and whether or not it's a red flag. If not, do people have other recommendations to look for 4 months stays in safe areas of the city?

Appreciate any responses! :)"

Unfortunately pretty much all of my friends have gone home or to other cities for internships now that the semester is over, so I'm finding myself pretty bored when not at work. Looking for someone to hang out with and get to know over the summer, and if we click I'm open to pursuing a relationship.

I have a tendency to tell incredibly bad science jokes. For example: what do complex analysis and Spanish have in common? I always forget to conjugate.

I'm a physics and computer science major, going into my senior year. I love reading (currently working on House of Leaves), writing (I've written two novels and a stage script, which has actually been published), watching Rick and Morty, and finding stupid videos on YouTube (for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdzCv_9eaoM).

For those who care what I look like, I'm 6'3"", slender, and I work out regularly. Anyways, I'd love to hear from you. Let's chat and see if we click. Maybe find a time and place to hang out, if you happen to be nearby. Grab coffee or visit a museum or just chat online. Something like that. I'm not opposed to long distance friends, so feel free to PM me even if you're not local."
6iapnd,13,2017-06-19,How do you guys come to terms that you (potentially) fucked up your life?,NeroRay,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/6iapnd/how_do_you_guys_come_to_terms_that_you/,"I am 26 for like three days, male and.. a virgin. I literally wasted my last ten years in front of my computer self-loathing, depressed with a healthy chunk of social anxieties. 
I would like to blame my pretty abusive childhood for my ""outcome"", but I think this would be just an excuse. I literally hate myself and I am incredibly disappointed in myself for my stupid decision back then. 

I literally brainwashed myself to convince me, that I won't ever need someone and that I would never need a relationship. And for some fucked up reasons I really started to believe this when I was in my teens. This was either based on my childhood or it was some kind of coping mechanism because I always knew I wouldn't have the confidence and self-esteem to pursue a relationship. 

I can't even remember when I was not depressed. But I know for sure, that it got way worse when I was around 18-19. That's when the real thing came down: a lot of crying, a lot of self-loathing, completely confused and insecure. I genuinely thought it couldn't get any worse back then. But it worsens with every year. With 24-25 it got so bad I failed two exams and ask my mom if I could move back to her place. I just couldn't study, work full time, attend classes and have a bunch of internships, while living in one of the worst parts of my city (Living in a pretty expensive German city). So I thought cutting back on the work time (I am still working and paying ""rent"" to her) would be a good idea and might give me some space to relax and ""breath"". 

And yes I passed my exams, but to be honest, this decision was still god fucking awful. I was/am now a 25-26-year-old guy living with his mom. This destroyed my confidence even more. I am quite honest, I am at rock bottom atm and I don't know where to even begin to change something. I feel like there is so much to do and I am running out of time - well, tbh, I think I already run out of time. There wasn't a single day in the last 6 months where I didn't go to bad wishing to wake up 10 years younger and preventing me from being such a cowardly shut-in, not a single day I didn't wish I wake up being someone else or not waking up at all.

I am not too keen to go get therapy. I am really not sure, I think I should have gone 10 years ago before I fucked up everything. My entire adult life between 18 to 26 can only be considered an abject failure, based on my own stupidity? Instead of just seeking help at 16 or 17 I ruined ~1/7 of my life. 
A huge part where every normal human would have gathered experiences, set milestones in his development and grew as a human. But I skipped this bit completely and I am now pretty much a boy in the role of an adult. 

The biggest problem currently is this annoying voice in my head pretty much telling me it's all my fault (which it is). There was no super natural force preventing me to socialize. I wasn't in prison either. Literally, nothing was preventing me from getting more friends (And I already have almost no friends at all). I know there were a lot of people who wanted to hang out with me, girls who wanted to be with me. But I was too stupid. If I could travel in time, I would go back in gave my ""past-me"" a huge dropkick. 

Also, being inexperienced at my age is one of the worst emotions I have ever witness. It's a combination of shame and inadequacy, to the point I just don't even want to leave the house."

6iaxzq,0,2017-06-19,"Interning in DC this summer, which Metropass should I buy?",cyanshirt,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/6iaxzq/interning_in_dc_this_summer_which_metropass/,"Hi!

I'm from NYC and in our subway system, there is a single 30-day unlimited ride metrocard which is basically the best bang for your buck if you have a regular job where you at a minimal take the trains 2 times a day, 5 days a week. However, I can't seem to figure out which Metropass is the best value for me interning this summer since it feels like there are SO MANY OPTIONS. The 28-Day Fast Pass? The SelectPass? The regular pay-per-ride pass? 

My regular 5 day a week trip consists of my point of origin being Woodley Park and my destination being Union Station during the peak hours. One trip from Woodley Park --&gt; Union Station is $2.40x2 (for roundtrip) so I've been paying 4.80 every day. 4.80x5daysx4 weeks means I'm spending at least $96 each month. I will also definitely be making metro trips on the weekends since I want to do tourist-y things like visit museums and whatnot. 

I've read about the SelectPass and this website (https://selectpass.planitmetro.com/select_plus_7/) says I will pay only $90.00 per month for an unlimited ride card. Is that way I should go? I'm honestly so confused as to how I should be riding the metro/buying a pass to get the best value, any help to assist a broke college student with an unpaid internship will be appreciated!


(I've just been loading up my card with money and reloading every time its run low and using the metro that way)

**edit**
Also what is up with this fineprint on the SelectPass? 
""SelectPass loaded on a smartcard from the 1st thru the 15th of the current month is valid for that month. A pass loaded on a smartcard from the 16th through the last day of the current month is valid for the following month.""
So if I bought a SelectPass today, I won't be able to use it until July?"
6ib278,1,2017-06-19,22 [M4F] Swapping Bodies With My Sexy Neighbor,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6ib278/22_m4f_swapping_bodies_with_my_sexy_neighbor/,"Stepping out of the cab I looked at my old neighborhood and all could think was “I’m home.” Eddie Mara was recent college grad and after years of spending his summer’s doing internships and jobs across the country he decided to spend his last summer before heading out into the real world at home with his family. Two weeks into his vacation he saw his neighbor Mrs. Anderson unpacking groceries from her car.

Now Mrs. Anderson was the kind of neighbor that most guys would kill to have. Sure, she was a bit older but her body could pass for a girl in her mid-20’s. Growing up Eddie was constantly helping her out around the house. Mrs. Anderson’s husband was always away on business trips so he paid Eddie to help out around the house. Needless to say, Eddie had a crush on his neighbor for most of his life, and seeing her again after all these years she was still a knockout.

He decided to help her out for old times’ sake and after catching up Mrs. Anderson offered Eddie a bit of work for the summer. Naturally, he agreed. It meant getting to spend for time with his hot neighbor and make money.

A week later after mowing Mrs. Anderson’s lawn she called him in to have a drink and talk. Eddie found about how Mrs. Anderson was having trouble with her husband and how she was wishing that she could have pursued her dreams instead of settling down as a housewife.

“And that’s the reason why I’m taking your body” She let out menacingly. Before Eddie could even react, he felt the world around him go black. By the time he came to all he found a lavishly decorated bedroom, Mrs. Anderson’s bedroom. As he got up he felt something was different, no everything was different. At that point he saw his own body walk into the room.

“You’re gonna make a great housewife honey, don’t you worry.” His own voice said. Looking down he saw Mrs. Anderson’s clothes, her body, everything. Eddie’s summer was just getting interesting…"

For example, whenever they're fixing something on the track, they're using these 5 lightbulb-strips. I looked today and those bulbs are actually 75W each! The often use these strips for stretches of a whole mile, which adds up to thousands of bulbs! If they replaced those with LED bulbs, they would have the following benefits: 


- It would save an enormous amount of energy


- It would lower the temperature, because those bulbs generate an insane amount of heat


- It's cheaper and better for the environment. 


Now I know it's the MTA we're talking about, so they might do this in like 10 to 15 years or so, but why aren't they just getting some interns, a project manager and 1 million USD in LED bulbs and start replacing those lamps? 


Do you guys have any other ideas on how to improve the MTA? "

I just finished my second year. In the past, my mom has always gotten upset at me when I don't want to spend time with the family. I always end up feeling really guilty when I go to spend time with friends or spend time in my room alone because she'll get really upset. 


I have an internship as well as another part time job this summer. With that being said, most of my time is surrounded by other people. I am naturally a more introverted person, so it's really important to me that I get to spend time alone at the end of the day just doing my own thing. Today (after my first day at work - a very stressful thing for me!) I came home and ate dinner with my family, talked for a bit, and then went to my room. 


My mom just came downstairs to ask why I'm not upstairs. She said how everyone (my sister &amp; my dad) is upstairs on the couch and that I should be there too. I told her I really wanted to be alone and that it was important to me to be able to have some alone time at the end of the day. She said that her ""love time"" is really important to her. I told her that I spent time with her after I got home from work and I just wanted a few hours to myself before I go to sleep. She acted like I was ridiculous and that that was a ridiculous thing to ask. She told me how my sister (who recently graduated college and is living at home to save money for now) always spends time with her and my dad after work so I should as well. I told her that my sister and I are different people and asked if she could please try to be more understanding of how I feel. She walked away without saying anything after that.


Am I being out of line? Do I need to spend more time with my family? I've literally been back home barely a day and this is already a problem, I don't know what to do for the rest of the summer. How do I handle this?

6ic2xc,3,2017-06-20,How should I [20M] deal with cold feet and my first serious GF [23F]?,throwaway_chinese_gf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ic2xc/how_should_i_20m_deal_with_cold_feet_and_my_first/,"So I've been dating this girl since early November - just past 7 months now. This is my longest relationship by about 4 months I guess, so I wouldn't call myself experienced. Since the beginning of May, she has been on an internship across the country, and I'm starting to get thoughts I'm not comfortable with. 

Don't get me wrong - I legitimately enjoy being around her and sharing things about my day with her and talking to her. The problem is, recently I've had this festering FOMO to the point that I keep wondering what it would be like in social situations if I was single right now. Thinking about just breaking up because I am scared of being with her for the rest of my life, I don't feel ready... but I know that I'm still enjoying this relationship and (by all appearances) so is she. 

The crux of the issue is that I know I'm still enjoying this relationship... and I know I could see it going on a long time. I'm doing my best to learn Mandarin so I can visit her family with her and see China with her, for example. She has a flight scheduled back in two weeks for a long weekend, and I flew to see her two weeks ago. We video chat every night and it's wonderful.

What scares me is there are some things I just don't know if I could live with for the rest of my life. Some minor culture shock things, differences in small things in the bedroom, some odds and ends where we just don't line up. 

What it boils down to though is that I don't know how ready I am for a long term relationship. I feel like I'm staring down a 10m cliff and I just barely learned how to doggy paddle last week. It could be that this is what I'm going to spend the rest of my life waiting for and wishing for... but I don't know if I'm going to drown if I dive off. 

I guess what I want is just some advice from anyone who feels they understand what I'm talking about... I feel so lost whenever i think about what to do that I'm starting to lose track of my life. Not studying enough for my midterms, forgetting about classes, picking up gaming habits I thought I kicked a year ago... I need some sort of resolution to this massive problem hanging over my head right now.

Thanks for spending the time to read my rambling, I don't know if it's entirely coherent right now.

I tried finding my old assignment sheets from my NX class but couldn't find them on my computer.  Any help would be appreciated!"

Yet we don't do the same when we know the parent is refusing to vaccinate their children for non-medical or non-financial reasons. Taking kids away from their parents is an extreme measure, so I understand that the courts won't do so lightly. I just don't see how one is worse than the other.

It would be interesting to know your arguments for and against getting CPS involved for failure to vaccinate. Is there case law where one parent who shares custody has asked the courts to order the other parent to allow a child to get vaccinated? Do you think the ""religious"" excuse is the true barrier? Or is this purely socioeconomic discrimination by the government because it tends to be well off parents who chose not to vaccinate? "

My housing is paid for through student loans at school, and I feel as though I am held a bit hostage by my parents financially. I am 21 now and whenever I have asked my parents for advice on where to put my money and how to save, they set me up at a credit union where they also put themselves on my card and ""borrow"" money without asking, telling me they will pay me back, and eventually giving me half of it over a few months claiming they have given me enough here and there to pay it all back. I really would rather be in a situation where they couldn't take money out because whenever I ask for my money back from them, it feels like I am just begging them for money and I am tired of feeling financially dependent on them to survive. 

I am looking to change this because I am starting to realize that since I am always worried they are just going to take my money, I spend extremely liberally since if its going to go, I want to spend it myself. So basically I guess I am asking, what is the best way to deposit my money and save up as much as I can for when I need to start paying off my student debt? 

My parents always tell me they are going to sell one of the few properties they rent out in Philadelphia once I finish school and need to start paying off my debt, but it was illogical to me that they didn't just sell it up front to help pay for a bit of my school if they ever wanted to help at all so I am not counting on them ever helping me with any of that money. I really want as few financial relationships with my parents now as possible since money has begun to effect my sense of family at home which is something I really do not like. Sorry for only doing limited research before asking this, they just again borrowed $150 from my account yesterday and I want to try to make a change ASAP."

I am a fairly fresh programmer with no major experience, school projects here and there. My cousin recently got me an internship for python data engineering. Part of my learning experience is my station set-up, we'll be using things like  Airbnb's Airflow, Filezilla, and Python 3 to preform ETL with lots of disorganized data. 

The company computer is running Windows 7. I've got everything else working but I'm highly confused with how to go about getting Airflow working, and could use step by step instruction for how to get the pip to recognize the airflow package command.

I understand that Pip comes with the basic version of Python 3 I've installed, but I have no idea how to access the package that prompts installation of Airflow. 

&gt;pip install airflow

Where do I put this?

From what my cousin (boss) explained the google results I keep finding for installing airflow are based in Unix and will not work on a Windows based system. i.e. ~/.bashrc

Until I've figured out a windows based solution I'm going to try using Ubuntu in a VM to activate the install package.

Thanks for any advice you can provide.

6igo2z,73,2017-06-20,FMIL has become unhinged...need to vent/advice!,readingrainbowhoe,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6igo2z/fmil_has_become_unhingedneed_to_ventadvice/,"My FMIL has recently turned her crazy notch to full blown and I cannot take it anymore. 

My SO never really replies to his mother's massive block of obsessive and daily texts (mostly of her stupid questions of how school is, etc. but shit she asks every single day so there are no updates available for the same daily questions...) and whenever he does give his rare reply, he only offers her short and curt answers. 


Well a few weeks ago, my SO was getting ready to go out with our roommate and he was getting the usual obsessive yet unnecessary texts from his mom. He ignores them. She then goes on to blow up his phone saying that if he doesn't respond she's going to come down to our house 2 hours away at 10 pm on a Friday to talk to him. WTF?! She literally sounds like a crazy girlfriend. She then states that she is on the freeway on her way down to our house. When he finally texts her to calm the fuck down she DEMANDS he come up to see her and ""talk"" about what's going on in his life to why he feels the need to ignore her. She literally keeps texting him, ""Something is wrong I know it. I am SO worried about you."" I tear SO a new butthole and tell him he needs to set strict boundaries with his mom and calm down the obsessive texting and obsessive EVERYTHING and he totally agreed. The next weekend he went to see her but didn't go into detail with what he talked to her about but I got the feeling she felt threatened because she knew that this new semi-spine of his was my construction. She texts me (I am currently NC but was then VLC with her) telling me how SO was on his way back down. Idk it felt like a subtle jab stating ""haha I know where SO is and you don't"". I get such crazy psycho girlfriend vibes from her and it really gets in my head sometimes.


Of course my SO's talk with her was fruitless and she goes back to obsessively texting my SO again... But he does his usual dance of no response and after a couple more weeks of that, she freaks out again but this is the blow up to end all blow ups (wishful thinking). She officially tells my SO that he is cut off from everything. She pays for everything for him while he is in school: tuition, rent, groceries, car, etc. It is definitely a form of control for her but she has played this card before (See Bitchbot for my first post) when she doesn't get her exact way. FMIL goes on this cry pity fest about how she has been working so much for little to no pay to put SO through school wah wah wah. It's funny she mentions that because she has fully expressed her plans to take a few vacations this year including Disneyland, Europe, California, and Nevada. Hmm so do you have the time and money or not? She is also in an active lawsuit again SO's dad for him to pay for all of SO's school so she doesn't have to pay a penny. Working sooooo hard right? So she says that she will not be paying for anything anymore, including school which is BS because SO literally has one more semester. I have only seen SO cry twice in our 4 years of dating and this was the second time. Not because of her cutting him off, but because he was unsure whether I would stay with him or not. He is completely done with her at this point and decided to go VLC but I am not sure if it will last. I brought up NC but he doesn't want to cut out another family member (he's currently NC with his sister and dad), but I tried gently reminding him that toxic people don't deserve excuses. He literally said word for word ""I only need her for finances."" That's literally all she is to him. I told him when we have children she will not be in their lives and the only grandma they will know is my mother and he agreed! I just don't get why he still feels the need to be VLC with her...


BUT GUESS WHAT?! She still texts him rug-sweeping the shit out of the last few blow ups but this is where she gets even fucking crazier: She told SO she was willing move down and rent a place HERE to where HER AND SO CAN LIVE TOGETHER SO THEY CAN ""SAVE MONEY"" WHILE HE GOES TO SCHOOL. No mention of me. What about the whole: no tuition?! SO literally sprung into action when she ""cut him off"" and is planning on working at the real estate agency he just got an internship for and then stay on full-time after his 100 day trial period and decided to finish school later since his credits don't technically expire. SO already loves working there and it's the type of job where they will pay for your real estate license exams, prep courses etc., and willingly re-locate their employees to any other location the employee wants since they have offices in all 50 states. SO told me multiple times that he has no plans to ever ever live with his mom again so her fairy tale plan will never work. I am also getting lonely vibes from her and that's why she is proposing this but I also am getting the sense of her desperate need to control my SO because of the fact that a). her daughter hates her and is NC with her and b). her ex (the ""love of her life"") also hates her and is NC with her. 


So, I need advice for what to do about her from now on. I am already NC with her unless she says BS to me. I am just WAITING to hit her with the hard truth about her actions throughout SO's life if she dares say anything to me. SO has also been going to a counselor (yay for mental health treatment!) so I really really hope this bi-partisan professional will help him become more confident and assertive against his mother because right now those traits fall on me.

6igu70,3,2017-06-20,Me [24 M] had a harrowing argument with my abusive girlfriend [24 F] of 11 months that ended in our breakup. It's 2 months later now and I can't move on.,rong_account,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6igu70/me_24_m_had_a_harrowing_argument_with_my_abusive/,"So we've had our troubles, and I've always had lack of self-esteem and trouble seeing arguments and disagreements clearly and so at the end, I stopped fighting the urge to breakup since it just got too traumatizing to be with her, but I still don't understand why. I'm clearly not good enough at standing up for myself, but I'm also not sure whether my way of dealing with things is the problem here.


What happened, was I made an agreement with her to go help her grandfather move in another part of the country. Combined with this would be a big get-together with all of her family. I'd excitedly offered my help and was somewhat looking forward to the event. But then two weeks before we had a huge argument due to her problems with me bailing to spend a weekend with my family in the middle of an extremely stressful internship. Her gripe was that I'd told her too late (on Friday). When I told her we were looking at apartments together and she just ignored me the whole trip back to her place. When we got there I was really hurt and felt awful that it had turned into such a problem. She complained that I would leave when she'd had expectations of spending the weekend with me. After us arguing over whether my decision was fair and me being in tears for much of it, I buckled and spent the weekend with her.


On Monday the stress had gotten to me and in the evening I'd started crying to her on the phone, feeling crushed under the pressure. She sort of turned it on me and got worried for our relationship, I was making her insecure. I ended up consoling her and trying to fix the situation. When we hung up it seemed less than natural and I knew that she'd still be bothered, while I also felt awful. The next day she texted me how I was doing while I was at work. Stressed out as I was over a big presentation I had to do the next day and being short on time, I told her that I couldn't deal with it, I had to talk to her the next evening (I didn't explain to her that I had the project or that I had to work on it during all of my free time until the next day), she freaked out and started texting me that it was torture and she was going to ""blow it up"". She even called me and I had to hang up on her (I was at work!).


The next couple of days I spent in unbelievable stress and uncomfortable ""brooding"" over the problem. I got a lot of negative feedback on my less than perfect project and that was that. I visited her in the evening and we made up with all of my anger and frustration just crumbling when I saw her (I still didn't explain about the project as I didn't want her to feel guilty or getting into the whole thing again. I should have been angry... I know).


Now my week-long vacation had started that we'd planned to spend at her family's. I tried in vain to get her to agree to me not going, since I was still very much reeling from the stress I'd suffered a week ago (I of course only offered to stay 2 days instead of 3, since I didn't feel secure that I could get out of it entirely). She couldn't accept less than me only getting out of it, if I personally told her family I wasn't coming. I then agreed to go for her sake.


Now her and her family were scheduled to come pick me up before driving to her grandfather's. But right before they left I called her and said that I didn't want to go. At this point I'd acted like everything was alright while we'd spent the last few days together, but when I'd gone home to pack, I decided that I wasn't able to deal with it all. She just hung up and sent me these messages:


""It is simply not okay what you're doing!""

""If you don't answer or get your shit together, you can come pick up your stuff on Friday""


I was completely frozen and obviously didn't want to deal with her. She called me and I hung up. I was debating calling my father up for some sort of advice when he luckily called. He was able to talk me down and took my side to an extent.


When we'd been talking for a while she just locked herself into my apartment and just stood in the door, watching.


I told her that this was the final drop and I wasn't having it. She went on about how I was terrorizing her emotionally and that I was insane for not being able to see that. I told her to leave and she asked me whether I was giving up on us, I replied that right now, I was. She gave me my key and left after telling me it was my fault what was happening.


Then she texted me about how much I meant to her and that she would always love me. I replied something in the same vein, saying sorry for acting shitty. I now see that she was the shitty person, or at least completely unaware of how her behavior was affecting me. She asked whether I'd try again with a therapist and I said no - that I had to work on myself. Next week follows with more texts from her. One about how much she loves me but that I'm just so confused and the basic gist is that I can't function without her. I end up telling her that I'd always had my doubts about us. She of course claims the victim card and I tell her to leave me alone and block her on facebook.


Now it has been two months(!) and I'm still feeling bad about it all. I'm still hurt, angry, sad and I miss her. I'm able to take care of myself better, but this whole thing has left a scar that I dont know how to heal and I still haven't been to her place to pick up the rest of my stuff. I know that I'm a weak pushover, or at least was, but I'm trying to take care of that, but what do I do practically reddit? I'm at my wits end here.

Now, I am totally understanding that she has work early in the morning, but this rule was not mentioned on their page when we booked. How should we proceed? We are going to be going out and will be coming back late at night. 

We are paying a pretty penny for this room and one of the reasons we chose an airbnb over a host family was precisely for the reason of not having to tiptoe around late at night. Should I talk to the other roommate about this? Like I said we will be staying here for a month so I dont want to cause any drama and have it be uncomfortable for the rest of the time.

I'm looking at graduating this coming Spring. I am really anxious about jobs though, I don't have an internship this summer and I think I'm screwed. 

My thoughts are as follows: At the business school, we really only learn theoretical stuff mostly like graphs and charts and some basic calculations. We also take that class where we learn to do excel and those null hypothesis. But I feel all that is just bullshit in the eyes of employers. 

All the jobs I've looked at online for well known corporations(entry level mind you) require some sort of experience, not just a few months but years, and what not which is totally unreasonable given that we're just getting out of college.

Basically what do you tell these recruiters at job fair? ""I've studied graphs and stuff, and can do hypothesis testing and excel.""

I think the question I'm getting at is as follows, ""Do employers hire students out of school with NO experience, but merely the fact they have the degree and the schooling/knowledge to go with it?"

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.
Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'

Hello there people! This was the start of a story that I had going with someone else but due to personal reasons they had to leave but now I am looking for someone to revive it. I would play the role of the males in the story so I am looking for someone to be Scarlett. I want this to be a long term detailed role play. 

I'm thinking the story could go in a couple of ways. It could be a very smutty journey with Scarlett (can be changed somewhat ) being a very ignorant girl and getting used by raiders, townspeople, ghouls, super mutants, and more… just many smutty scenarios in a wasteland. Or it could be a very serious kinda romance type of rp.

Don't worry so much about the large wall of text if that worries you as i do want long detailed rps but normally only do a few paragraphs.

 This is obviously set in a post apocalyptic/ post nuclear world of the video game series Fallout but can incorporate other themes of post apoc worlds.

My kinks would be rough sex, anal, dirty talking, spanking, hair pulling, light biting, light slapping, risky sex/hold the moan, cheating, rimjobs (both ways), clothed sex, interracial, larger men, cream pies, facials, being man handled and bisexuality. Sadomasochism Slapping Spanking Rough fucking Hatefucking Dub con Non con Tit fucking Footjobs Anal Receiving oral Fucking in public Blackmail Risk of being caught Infidelity Stockings Leggings Lingerie Drug/alcohol intoxication.

My limits are only largely scat and piss.

I want this rp to be done over google docs and use kik, skype or google chat/hangouts to chat and set things up on. If you're interested send me a detailed message."
6ihkvx,1,2017-06-20,I think that my [20F] boyfriend [20M] of 2 years is depressed. Now he wants to take a break,awd726throwaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ihkvx/i_think_that_my_20f_boyfriend_20m_of_2_years_is/,"We both love each other, but I think he's depressed again.

Today, he told me that he wants to take a break. He's away in another city for the summer. He comes to visit about once a week. We call about once or twice a day, but we don't talk too much. Typically he's telling me about the people he's around and day to day things. Recently (past week or two?) he hasn't been calling or talking as much. He's been drinking or high (weed) with his friends instead.

Okay, cool. I'm not stopping my boyfriend from having fun with people, especially if he's not hurting people and still getting his work done.

He has been complaining about the people he's around for his internship. He says that they worry too much about his personality (introverted). He doesn't like people too much in the first place, but he had been trying to socialize more. It hasn't been working well for him. He has a very sad, negative, depressed outlook about things socially. Something happened within his new social group, and he said that they don't like what he did. He got frustrated about it, and told me. We finished talking, but I didn't have much to say because I understood both sides (his and theirs).

He called back and said that he wants to take a break. He said that he needs to reboot and recuperate from people. He needs to be alone. Since I am a person, I am included in this. He doesn't want to deal with, be around, or associate with anyone.

He told me that he doesn't know how long this will last, but he wants to be left alone. He doesn't know what he wants from this break. He said that I can talk to other guys. He doesn't want to talk to me, call, or text. There is nothing I can do about it.

He sent me this song to listen to: Solo Dolo (Nightmare) by Kid Cudi

He has been depressed before (started in middle school). He loves this song (most played), and feels that it perfectly explains him. The song are the thoughts in his head. He said that his depression hasn't really left. I said that he has days that are much better, but he said that they're every blue moon. He feels that nobody understands him.

I really want to help my boyfriend, or at least be there for him, but he doesn't want me to. He even stopped location sharing with me. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I think my boyfriend is depressed again. He wants to take a break from our relationship. No more contact (text or phone call), and we're not in the same city over the summer. Turned off location sharing. He ""hates"" people, and attempted to be more extroverted and interact/socialize with people, but it did not work well. Solo Dolo (Nightmare) by Kid Cudi describes his thoughts. What do I do to help him??"

We were able to gather some supplies and equipment from Vault 5 to the north of the city, but Vault 4, located under the ruins of Grand Central Station, is a bust. The door is sealed tight and I don't think they'll be opening it anytime soon.

6iifxu,0,2017-06-20,Career Help,confusedgrad123,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/6iifxu/career_help/,"Hello Reddit Community,
I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Biology, and I feel as if that is the biggest mistake I have made for myself. When I started college I was eager to succeed and become a dentist. I never thought about doing anything else besides that, but as my grades plummeted I realized that the path I envisioned just wasn't going to happen. I struggled through my tough science classes and it felt like a drag and it even took me an extra year to complete my bachelors but I finally got the degree that holds zero value for me. Every time I sit and try to come up with a plan on what to do next I feel as if a heavy rock has been placed on me. But the clock is ticking and it doesn't stop for anyone, so I do need to figure out what my next step is on this road to success. So far I have thought about doing nursing, I never wanted to do that but with my background in science and poor GPA it seems to be a valid option. My second thought was completely changing my field of education and trying for the IT field. But for that I have no idea where to beginning from. I know Data Science is a huge growing field right now and they earn well also. But how do I figure out that that is the career path for me? I am afraid to make the wrong choice and regret it later or waste my time. I know, I know, that is life and I cannot be afraid of it if I want to go somewhere. I need to stop thinking the ""buts"" the ""what ifs"" and go for something already, as of right now I'm wasting time regardless. Honestly, I just want to make a lot of money with a slightly easier path than becoming a doctor of some sort. Just look at the Kardasians, living in millions for doing what? I always thought about becoming a Youtuber, I am a creative person, I want to be famous, who doesn't? Or be one of those Instagram models? Why not? It all seems nice to think about but not practical for the future, or I just don't have the courage in me.
What my nursing friends tell me- they started making 93K and only have to work 13 shifts a month- that's like working 150 days out of 356 days. Sounds nice but why hasn't this pushed me to do that then. Going for the corporate world means working a 9-5pm job M-F. I ask myself do I want to wear scrubs for the rest of my life or business wear, nice pencils skirts? And I honestly don't know the answer to any of these questions. Can I get a trial and error at this life. There are an endless amount possibilities I can choose from yet I can't pick any.
The nurses out there, please tell me the pros and cons about what you do. And if this was the route I chose what would my next step be? Should I go for an associates first since my GPA is so low and then do a bridge programs? Is getting a second bachelors degree worth what you guys do?
Anyone in the IT field, (data scientists, QAs, anyone) how do I enter this field with a biology background? Should I find some internship? I looked into those data science boot camps but they seem pricey for something I'm unsure of. Any insight on what your job entails of would help.
Redditters please help me clear up the clutter in my mind, let me know what you would do in my place.
Thank you"
6iilb5,4,2017-06-20,Is it possible to develop in Angular2 without having to install anything?,rrt303,Angular2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/6iilb5/is_it_possible_to_develop_in_angular2_without/,"Basically, I'm at an internship and don't have shit to do for at least a week. During the previous lulls, I've been teaching myself HTML and Javascript and a smattering of AngularJS. Since it looks like Angular2 is the future, I'd like to spend some time on that (also looking to create myself a website soon and it'll come in handy)  
  
Problem is, the company IT department has rather restrictive policies and installing node/Angular CLI, as most tutorials seem to recommend, would be way more trouble than it's worth (and by the time they got around to giving me permission, the summer would be over anyway). AngularJs wasn't any trouble as it was simply just getting a js script from a CDN, which doesn't seem to be an issue.   
  
So anyway, is there a way to run/develop Angular and compile typescript that doesn't involve running any kind of exe?  "
6iitkv,103,2017-06-20,To Everyone Who Hates Living W/Autism,throwaway901210,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/6iitkv/to_everyone_who_hates_living_wautism/,"One year ago, I received my diagnosis of ASD. It felt like a death sentence. I thought that I would forever be stuck lonely and depressed and that the diagnosis confirmed that I was nothing more than a freak. I remember going home that night and crying, thinking that I would rather be dead than live a life with the struggles of an autistic person. And i felt paralyzed, like I couldn't really do anything about my situation. Many times I fantasized about killing myself to escape the nightmare of living life with autism. 

Fast forward to today. Even though things still aren't perfect, I don't regret staying alive. It's taken a lot of energy and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, but I've come to realize that autism doesn't have to stop me from doing what I want to achieve. 

Next week, I am slated to start a new job as a barista at a local coffee shop and start my internship on a political campaign to prepare for college next year, where I will study public policy. And tonight, despite all of my fears of never being able to talk to anyone normally again, I was able to give a speech in front of a hundred people and answer impromptu questions without hesitation. No way could I have seen myself doing that a year ago. 

So to those of you who are depressed and/or have suicidal thoughts due to autism, please don't give up. You may not even know why you're continuing life at this point, but keep pushing on. I'm not saying it'll be easy to keep going, but it will pay off in the end. Autism doesn't define you, and with enough courage, you can overcome any obstacles that autism puts in your path. Wishing you lots of success in your battle; go get em!! 

Sorry for the super cheesy post, but I feel like this is the post that I would have liked to read when I was suicidal a year ago. If anyone needs to talk about their suicidal/depressed thoughts, feel free to PM me. I'm here. "
6iivqv,142,2017-06-20,Ossoff loses. $23 million down the drain: most expensive congressional loser in history.,quill65,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/6iivqv/ossoff_loses_23_million_down_the_drain_most/,"[Multiple outlets are calling the race for Handel](http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2017/06/20/live-updates-all-eyes-on-georgias-6th-district-special-election/). 

Here's why I'm glad Ossoff lost, besides the fact that he's a Clintonite:

&gt;John Ossoff’s supporters got a pep talk from Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who helped launch the candidate’s political career.

&gt;Lewis, who hired Ossoff as an intern, told the crowd that they’ve “made a major down payment in changing our nation.”

John Lewis:

&gt;Civil rights leader John Lewis on Thursday dismissed Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ 1960s work on racial equality, saying, “I never saw him. I never met him.”
&gt;The Georgia congressman — a stalwart of the Freedom Rides through the South, lunch counter sit-ins and the 1963 March on Washington — raised questions about Sanders’ involvement in the movement when the Vermont senator was a college student.
&gt;Lewis has endorsed Sanders’ chief rival, Hillary Clinton, and his comments come at a critical time as the two White House contenders focus on the upcoming primaries in Southern states with predominantly African-American Democratic voters. He made the remarks at a Capitol Hill news conference where members of the Congressional Black Caucus’ political action committee delivered a full-throated endorsement of Clinton."

But my weekdays have been getting too boozy as well.

I was at work today, programming with the INTERN.

Trying to figure some shit out.

---

All of a sudden, my body just turned cold.

I couldn't think about anything.

I started sweating 

I felt like I was honestly about to collapse.

As much as I hate any medical shit, I was wondering if I'd actually need help.

I pretended I was thinking about the code to seem normal.

Then excused myself to go to ""the bathroom"" for a long time to recover.

Managed to ignore my symptoms since then.

Booze and weed, naturally.

But I've just felt fucked up since though..

I don't know what happened.

I feel like I've got something bad happening in my body.

6ij0pt,0,2017-06-20,My daughter and her absent father.,Zip619,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6ij0pt/my_daughter_and_her_absent_father/,"Created a throwaway account because of the subject.

I guess I should give a little backstory. I met my ex husband freshman year of college. We were only dating for a few months when I got pregnant. Being stupid kids we got married, it was rough at first but we worked. I dropped out of college while he finished his degree and internship. He came from money so while neither of our parents were happy, we did have it easy financially. His parents bought us a house and things were good. During all this we talked that once our daughter was old enough I would go back to school. He was completely supportive of this. Other things got in the way of that at first but after eight years I was ready to go back. After my first semester back, I got pregnant again. We were both happy but a part of me felt cheated, that I would have to stay at home again. I want to say my ex never brought up any of this, he constantly told me I could so both. Long story short my anger about the situation led me to blame my husband and I had an affair. Things were very ugly between us, he wanted to work things out I didn't at first but once I pulled my head out of my ass it was too late. The divorce was very easy, he gave me the house and was generous in CS and alimony. The emotional side was a disaster for me and him.

The ex was always a great father, he was the first to admit our daughter had him wrapped around her finger. She was a daddys girl. But once the affair and divorce happened things became strained. He didn't see as much because of the situation at first and then because he took a job a couple of hundred miles away. Then one day he just stopped all contact, he became a ghost. At first everyone was worried something had happened. He just didn't cut off contact with us but his parents and siblings too. He never even showed for either of his parents funerals. The only contact anyone had with him is through a lawyer. This went on for eleven years.

Through all of this my daughter has struggled. She never understood why her daddy left her and I never had an answer. Child therapists helped but as she got older those same questions were still there. For awhile she even claimed that her father was dead, because I think it was easier than the alternative. My son never knew his bio dad so things are much easier for him. The second ex husband raised him as his own and they still have that father son bond. 

So that takes me to now. My daughter went away to college and had a complete breakdown. Drugs, alcohol and a suicide attempt. She was just recently released from a rehab and recovery clinic last month. I won't get into details but a lot of her issues still have to do with her father. I contacted the lawyer and told him to relay what happened to her father. Surprisingly I actually got a call from the ex who said he would be in town and wanted to talk to me. 

We met up, again the details don't matter really other than the fact he has a new family. Married with four children. He wants to talk to our daughter and try to make amends. I've talked to her doctors and they're divided on whether this would be healthy for her and it could go either way. I'm lost, on one hand I think seeing him again would help her deal with things no matter if she wants to forgive him or not. But I also worry that finding out about his new family could hurt her even more and cause a setback.

Any opinions or thoughts?

6ij4kl,5,2017-06-20,I do not feel safe at my internship. I don't know how to bring it up without saying something I shouldn't have.,Help_Me_Reddit01,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6ij4kl/i_do_not_feel_safe_at_my_internship_i_dont_know/,"I'm going to be a senior in college as a psychology major. My advisor set me up with an internship with an awesome facility doing cognitive rehabilitation therapy for individuals with TBIs, autism and CP. I'm there two days a week, mondays and Wednesday's. 

I started this a couple weeks ago and immediately red flags popped up. I was told to go through clients charts to read about them but was told just to focus on the basics a lot of it ""isn't important"". I decided I'm going to read cover to cover. I came across two individuals who concern me greatly. 

Client 1: was diagnosed with a TBI and has hemiparalysis. He has inappropriately touched and continues to touch women of all ages. When cued, ""remember"" he suddenly realizes touching isn't appropriate. He has been banned from ALL public transportation due to touching incidents. 

Client 2: on the autism spectrum and has exposed himself on several occasions. 

On day one, client one was VERY interested in me. He complemented every on me down to my fingernail polish. I was pulled aside and told I cannot sit next to him, keep my distance I cannot be in a room alone with him. Sitting at the table, I could feel him staring at me the entire session. 

Day two: same thing occurred with client one. However, I found him trying to be around me at all times and I told him several times you need to sit down. He would touch me (on the arm) when he wanted to speak to me. I pulled away every time telling him do not touch me. My supervisor also would tell him that. Halfway through the day, I was pulled aside by my boss and was told Client one has been staring down your shirt every chance he gets. I found out as I was sitting down, he stood behind me quietly staring down at my boobs. 

I do NOT feel comfortable around client one at all. I'm not comfortable around client two but I find him much less of a threat. I've wanted to tell my boss, keep him away from me at all times but I don't exactly know how to do that. I feel as if he knows a WHOLE lot more and his diagnosis is used as an excuse for this horrible behavior. I've actually debated on quitting due to this individual or completely stopping mondays all together and only go on the day he is not there. 

Someone please give me some advise on what to do here. "
6ijegz,2,2017-06-21,[RF] Tara Loves Dixie Mae,BacchusCoil,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/6ijegz/rf_tara_loves_dixie_mae/,"Dixie Mae was an international celebrity but when she woke up at six that Sunday, same as every day, she wanted to die. She got out of bed and into the shower. Under the flowing water she exfoliated her skin, before conditioning and shampooing her lustrous mane of dark black hair.

Stubble on her arms and legs drew Dixie’s attention next. She reached for a razor then went to work. The hairs weren’t long, barely a prickle, but when you lived under a microscope you learned to appreciate attention to detail.

Dixie shut off the shower, and stepped out into the bathroom, wrapping a snow-white towel around her voluptuous form. Insurance covered her breasts for several million dollars and she took some time to admire their perfection of form; utterly natural, perky and plump. Now if only her stomach would stay flat without a million hours of cardio every week.

When possible, Dixie preferred privacy. After drying off with her towel, she walked to her bedroom as bare as the day of her birth. She cherished the feeling of being able to walk out of her bathroom naked without a care in the world. No prying eyes, no crowds of camera-touting men wearing shades of grey and no talent managers.

Selecting some grey leggings, Dixie stepped into the tight pants. She slid her sports bra up and over her chest before fixing her hair into a ponytail. Her reflection caught her attention in the mirror once more and she turned sideways, resting a hand against her exposed belly. Dixie’s body type gifted her enormous breasts, but the same body type meant she carried a bit of surplus chub. Her manager Eric told her that if her waist size expanded even a size, she would lose millions of dollars in concert revenue and album sales. 

Dixie sighed, walked out of her room, and sat upright on the sprawling couch as she waited for her personal trainer to arrive. Sometimes Dixie wished she’d been born with the body type of a Taylor Swift; long legs, pixie features and slim femininity. Her mother’s voice chided in her mind at the thought. Dixie once made the mistake of sharing her envy with her mother who responded ‘you wouldn’t be famous with Taylor’s tits dear.’ 

A knock at the door signalled the arrival of Cindy, her personal trainer, so Dixie went to the front of her house and opened up. She smiled wide, despite her mood, and greeted Cindy jovially. Acting happy when she wasn’t came naturally to Dixie after years of practice.

Cindy stepped inside holding a rolled-up exercise mat under one arm. Her personal trainer made Dixie feel insecure; the woman personified beauty and slender femininity.

“Ready to rock?” Cindy asked.

“Yeah, let’s do it,” Dixie said.

They made their way down a winding staircase to Dixie’s personal gym. One wall of the gym held floor to ceiling mirrors and the wall on the other side presented a series of big-screen TVs.

They started the exercise routine without much delay. First set squats, second set lunges, third set calf-raises, fourth set leg lifts and then a ten minute sprint on the treadmill. After the first circuit, Dixie sprawled out on an exercise mat panting with jagged breath.

“Hey you can sit, but engage your core or I’ll make you walk the treadmill on break,” Cindy said. The diminutive blond’s drill sergeant demeanour kept Dixie fit.

Groaning, Dixie sat up and tucked her feet under her thighs. She engaged her core by tightening her abs and focused on recovering her breath.

“Anyone interesting in your life recently?” Cindy asked.

“No one to speak of,” Dixie said.

“I met this new guy, Robb, he’s amazing,” Cindy shook her magnificent blond head. “He owns a chain of juiceries across LA and he’s really into exercise, eats vegan, but he’s so strong and bold. You know?”

Dixie nodded her head, though she did not know. Between exercise, practice, travel and planning, Dixie barely found time to floss her teeth, whiten and brush, let alone meet a nice man. Cindy’s watch beeped.

“All right, another circuit, let’s move your butt,” Cindy said.

Dixie got through the squats all right, then struggled through the lunges, rapidly losing strength. She felt dizzy and her vision twisted like a top. She slowed her pace and Cindy rounded on her.

“C’mon Dixie, you wanna lose that gut? Sex symbols don’t have guts girl, work it off,” Cindy shouted.

Dixie strained into another lunge, but then wobbled and collapsed on the floor. Her heart pounded, and she curled into a ball. Tears flowed unbidden from Dixie’s big blue eyes and mixed with sweat on the mat beneath her. Cindy stopped shouting and crouched down beside Dixie, soothing her with a hand.

“Hey, hey, what’s going on?” Cindy said.

Dixie sobbed harder at Cindy’s question and squeezed armadillo-like into an even tighter ball. Cindy stood and walked out of the gym. She’d probably call Eric, Dixie’s manager, and have him come to the house. She wished he wouldn’t. Eric cared about her, no doubt, but only as far as he could push her for a pay-cheque. Dixie stood as tears continued to trickle down her cheeks. She walked to the row of TVs, each and every one of them flashing with a different channel of celebrity gossip, and grit her teeth. Dixie picked up a twenty-pound dumbbell and used the weight to smash the screens. A scream ripped free from her lips as she smashed the second, and she kept screaming all the way down the line of TVs until she smashed all fifteen. Cindy burst back in the room.

“Hey, it’s okay Dixie, Eric’s on his way. He said he’ll be about twenty minutes. I’ll see you again Wednesday, we’ll cut today short, okay?” Cindy stopped short at the sight of the smashed TVs. She rushed over to Dixie. “Oh my god, you cut your hand.”

Dixie looked down at her hand where a sliver of glass extruded from the skin of her palm. She dropped the dumbbell with a thump. Dixie then used two fingers to pull the piece of glass free. A bubbling brook of blood flowed from the incision.

“Come, sit over here,” Cindy said. Dixie let Cindy shepherd her towards a nearby bench where they both sat. Cindy retrieved some gauze from the fanny pack she wore at her waist, and wrapped the white cotton around Dixie’s hand.

“Thank you,” Dixie said. Calm came over her again.

“My pleasure Dixie. You know I care about you right?” Cindy said.

“Of course, it’s just — sometimes it’s really hard be-“ Dixie said but Cindy interrupted.

“I’d love to know but I’m not allowed to talk feelings with you. It’s in my contract. I’m sorry,” Cindy said.

Dixie nodded, staring numbly at her reflection in the mirrors across the gym. She looked pitiful as Cindy rubbed her back like an indulgent mother.

“I’m fine,” Dixie said, wiping her cheeks. No reason to cry. “You can go. Thank you and sorry again for wasting your time.”

“Hey don’t feel bad hon, I’m getting’ paid anyway,” Cindy said. “Feel better.”

Then Cindy left, leaving Dixie all alone in her enormous house.

Tara May sat on the couch in her three hundred square foot apartment eating ice cream from a four gallon tub and watching TMZ. After a hard day’s work at the local convenience store, Tara loved catching up on celebrity gossip. Mostly because all the beautiful, effortlessly awesome people provided ample escape fantasies for her.

“Bad news out of Dixie Mae’s camp. A poor pitchfork review proved an ominous precursor as critics and fans alike are panning her new album,” the narrator said.

Tara May shot up in her seat, eyes burning like living flames. Grabbing her laptop, she wrenched it open with tremendous speed and logged into tumblr.

‘Dixie hinted at her potential as a serious performer with her early work, but this new album confirms her as a place-holder with great boobs,’ wrote Boobman420.

Tap-dancing her fingers across the keyboard, Tara wrote a scathing rebuttal. In fact, Tara wrote over one-hundred scathing rebuttals in the next few hours. By the time she closed her computer again, a nasty aspect consumed her features. Dixie Mae was the most special person in the world. An angel given to humankind for worship and adoration. Plus, Dixie was Mae with an e and Tara was May with a y. Tara always felt a close connection with Dixie.

Tara opened up twitter next and sent a direct message to Dixie Mae’s twitter account.

‘Don’t let them get you down Dixie, they’re all assholes. You’re perfect. No darkness can hide your light. I love you so much, you’re like a sister to me, or a best friend I don’t see very much. You left for college, that’s it. Anyway, I love you so much, stay strong and I will defend your honour online,’ Tara wrote. She pressed send.

Then she sent a tweet to Dixie’s twitter account saying “pls check your DMs I am your biggest fan.”

Finished with her virtual crusade, Tara put her ice cream back in the freezer and went to her bedroom. She remembered the dentist’s suggestion to floss but decided against flossing because her teeth were too far gone anyway. Plus her gums always bled when she worked the string in between her teeth. Tara’s smile presented a twisted, mangled mess to the world. What was the point of flossing? No matter how much mouthwash she gurgled, Tara’d never have teeth like Dixie Mae.

Tara pulled off her baggy t-shirt and pyjamas, before examining herself in her tiny mirror. Her thick legs shared their texture with butterscotch pudding. Her face ran rampant with break-outs of angry red acne. Even if a cement-roller ran over her frizzy hair the strands would never hang straight.

Sighing, Tara crawled into her bed and closed her eyes. Before she went to sleep, she dreamed of a different life. Tara dreamed her hair long and black, thick and straight, hanging over an impressive chest. Her pencil thin waist tapered into wide, curvy hips. Her cobalt blue eyes looked back in the mirror as big as meteorites. Feeling beautiful and blessed, Tara drifted easily off to sleep.

***

“The record sucks,” Dixie said. Eric and her mother stood over her shoulder.

“It doesn’t suck, it’s misunderstood,” Eric said.

“I knew you should’ve kept that song Growl out,” Mother said.

Dixie’s shoulders slumped. The studio made most of the creative decisions for her last album. Growl had been her one insistence, a pet passion project, and a much-needed departure from the rest of the air-brushed bubble pop on the album.

“I like Growl,” Eric said.

“You’re alone on that mister,” Mother said.

“When can I get some time alone?” Dixie said.

Mother and Eric exchanged surprised glances. Dixie monitored their non-verbal exchange in the make-up mirror in front of her.

“You have six to six thirty every morning,” Eric said.

Mother said nothing, but crossed her arms and harrumphed to make her position clear as water.

“I just – I work so hard,” Dixie said. “I start at six every day and I don’t get to rest again until eleven at night. I’m constantly exhausted. I never get a good meal. I never get to go on any dates.”

“Poor pop star princess,” Mother said. “I used to work in a textile factory. You ever work in a factory Dixie?”

Dixie sighed, feeling defeated. Eric seemed totally puzzled by her discontent.

“Forget it,” she said.

“You can always take a vacation,” Eric said. “But the rest is your job Dixie. That’s what it takes to be a pop star. We both know you work hard, don’t we?” Eric turned to Dixie’s mother.

Mother harrumphed again and nodded curtly, a bare fractional degree of an incline.

“We can set up one of those celebrity relationships. Jon Meyer is always into that. How would you like to date him?” Eric asked.

“No, just, never mind,” Dixie said.

“We can always talk to the chef about spicing up your meal plan,” Eric said.

“Please – just forget about it. I’m okay,” Dixie said.

“Okay, well let me know if you want Kerick to substitute cottage cheese for yoghurt or anythin-“

“Forget it,” Dixie said.

“Okay,” Eric said. “But that five minute chat put us five minutes behind schedule. You better hurry with the make-up or you’re gonna be late for your Q and A.”

Dixie nodded and applied her make-up hurriedly.

A security team escorted Dixie, her mother and Eric to a waiting limousine. They got inside and rode in silence to the meet and greet. Mother stewed silently, seemingly chewing her tongue like a stick of gum, while Eric fiddled on an enormous tablet. Dixie sat with her knees pressed together and tried not to cry.

***

Tara shivered in bubbly anticipation, a smile as wide as the horizon on her face. She’d be meeting her hero at the Olympus theatre in just a few short hours, and she quite literally couldn’t wait. Tara checked the time in five-second intervals, hoping for some will-based manipulation of the fourth dimension.

She’d dyed her hair raven black to match Dixies and wore blue contacts to complete the imitation. Tara wore the same one-piece teal coloured bathing suit from Dixie’s newest album cover, and though the outfit fit Tara poorly, she felt sure Dixie would understand and appreciate the homage. She’d also booked the next two days off work; one day to meet Dixie, and another day to recover from the experience.

“I know you already,” Tara said. “You can’t hide anything from me.”

Tara remembered being five years old and braiding her older sister Dixie’s hair. They sat on a picnic blanket in Central Park. After braiding Dixie’s hair, the two of them danced across the grass like two striking eighty-eight butterflies. The girls’ carefree spirit drew a local crowd and the cameramen for the local news station happened to be walking by, and a recording of the whole thing ended up on prime time television.

Tara rushed to the computer and searched “two sisters butterflies flashdance” on youtube. She found nothing, and then slumped back in her chair, perturbed. Weird, youtube must have taken the video down. Dixie would never take it down, they were sisters and Dixie loved her.

Wanting to make sure she adequately prepared to meet the sun and moon, Tara made sure her nine millimetre was loaded. Fully licensed and registered, of course. If any haters tried to drag her sister through the mud, Tara would end them in a shower of lead.

***

The Olympus Theatre sported a full house as Dixie took the stage. The fans screamed adoration at her, cheering wildly. Her heart warmed at the showing of support, despite her floundering album which dropped down the charts like a piano demolition as she stood there smiling.

The format of the show would be a short talk, a Q and A, then finally an autograph session. Dixie took a deep breath and looked off stage where Eric and Mother stood. They’d prepared words for her and Eric held the microphone attached to Dixie’s earpiece.

“All right, wait for the applause to die down,” Eric said.

Dixie made a decision for herself and pulled out her ear piece.

“Hey everyone, how are you all doing today?”

The crowd exploded into cheers. Dixie shot a glance off stage and saw Eric striding towards her with an alarmed expression.

“I’m just fine Eric. Thanks. Maybe a water,” Dixie said.

The crowd fixated on Eric as he burst on stage. The fans fell silent, so he turned slowly and walked back off-stage. Dixie could’ve giggled, Eric looked quite uncomfortable under their scrutinizing stares. “So, you’re here to see Dixie Mae,” Dixie said.

The crowd went crazy again. A girl in the front row went ballistic. The poor thing was overweight, wrought with acne and she wore the same one-suit bathing suit from the cover of Dixie’s latest album. Dixie felt taken aback at the passion that must’ve inspired such a costume. Then she turned back to the crowd.

“I just want to say that every person who’s attained any measure of success is a product of other people’s hard work,” Dixie said.

The crowd went quiet.

“I am Dixie Mae, and I am the one up here singing, dancing and looking good, but behind me is a dedicated team. Without my team, there’s no way I’d manage any of this. I owe my manager Eric, my Mom, my trainer Cindy, my stylist Greg, my social media team and my chef. They help me keep all everything together,” Dixie said.

The crowd clapped.

“No, give it up for them, c’mon now,” Dixie said.

The crowd cheered raucously at Dixie’s urging.

***

The rest of the talk blurred into a wet mess for Tara. She burst her way out of the auditorium and into the bathroom, crying desperately. Dixie didn’t operate her social media? Tara heard about celebrities employing people to represent them on social media, but Dixie was supposed to be different. Dixie was supposed to better.

Did that mean the time Dixie liked Tara’s tweet, the like came from some college graduate intern? Dixie used a personal trainer? What in the actual fuck. Hell, Tara could look as good as Dixie with a personal trainer, a chef and the whole rest of the team on her side. Jesus. Tara grit her teeth as her sadness mutated quickly to anger. A stranger stood on that stage, not the Dixie Mae Tara knew and loved.

Tara knocked back the hammer on her pistol, tucked it back into her purse and walked out of the bathroom. Dixie Mae was the biggest fake in the entire world. Was Dixie Mae even her real name? Who the fuck knew. Lipstick on a pig defined Dixie Mae and the realization infuriated Tara.

Most of the people in the back seats played on phones or talked amongst themselves. A little girl in the front stood on her seat holding a microphone as she asked a question.

“How many times do you sing a year?” The girl asked. The audience cooed.

“Oh what a good question,” Dixie said. “What’s your name pretty girl?”

“I’m Taylor,” the girl said.

“What a lovely name,” Dixie said.

We’ll be finding all about names very soon, thought Tara as she took her seat in the front row. Being a major contributor to the Dixie Mae fan club provided some privileges, but the advantages offered fell short. Tara knew that without her support Dixie’s fan club would fold like a wet cardboard box, and the fake Dixie Mae would follow. A celebrity without fans possessed nothing short of artificial glam. A lonely faker.

“Well, I guess I sing about six hundred times I year. Most days I’ll sing after breakfast, and again at night, so that’s two most of the time. Sometimes I’ll take a day off. Letting yourself rest is important. Thanks for the question Taylor,” Dixie said.

A woman with a microphone patrolled, looking for people who wanted to ask Dixie a question. Tara grabbed the woman and pulled her close. “I have a question,” Tara said.

“Okay, what is it?” the woman asked.

“I’m going to ask Dixie Mae if that’s her real name,” Tara said.

“Oh, good question. Here you go. You’re after that guy,” the woman said. She pointed to a man in the middle rows who stood up.

“I’m just wondering how you aren’t married yet Dixie?” asked the man. Dixie’s face fell, she’d been noticeably upset by the question. Tara wondered if she was already married, hiding a secret celebrity husband somewhere.

“I haven’t met the right guy yet,” Dixie said. Her eyes lingered on the stage, just feet from Tara. If Dixie looked right at Tara, she might be forgiven, but the singer’s eyes passed over Tara as she looked up. “All right, next question.”

Tara looked at the woman who handed her the microphone and the woman nodded, smiling. Tara stood on shaking legs. Her left hand held cold steel in her purse.

“Is Dixie Mae your real name?”

Dixie Mae smiled brightly.

“Of course it is. What’s your name?”

“Tara May,” Tara said.

“Wow, we have the same last name.”

“I know Dixie. We could’ve been sisters.”

With that, Tara raised the pistol and pulled the trigger five times in succession. Bullets shredded Dixie’s middle and she collapsed in a pool of blood on the stage floor. An old woman came flying from off-stage and threw her arms around Dixie.

Tara never saw the man coming, but he held a glock of his own. The security agent pulled the trigger and Tara’s life flashed before her eyes.

Holding Dixie’s hand as they swung on the swings together. Pushing Dixie in the pool. Holding Dixie’s hair as she threw up from stolen sips of whiskey. Dixie’s voice during the high part in Growl. A birthday cake with twenty candles arraigned delicately around a frosted picture of Dixie Mae.

We've been planning this visit for a little over two months now and I've had my tickets booked since May 9.  I'm landing in San Diego on Thursday night and taking a red-eye home Monday into Tuesday then driving straight to work.

One of my sisters lives in the San Francisco area and I found out about 2 weeks ago that she's visiting at the end of June; when I'd contacted her before booking my trip, she had been planning to visit in mid-July.  She's taking a red-eye to Connecticut Friday into Saturday and then leaving Wednesday morning.  Despite our best efforts, our trips have a huge overlap and the only chance we'll have to see each other is Tuesday night, when I will be sleep deprived and she will be packing.  She will probably not be back on the East Coast until Christmas.

On top of that, the reason she bumped her trip up is because another of our sisters is getting ready to leave for a 4 month long internship in Panama; she leaves on Saturday July 1.  She's going to be in our hometown while I'm in California before returning to her current city for a few days and then departing for her internship.  I'll be visiting her in Panama in August, but that's still quite some time away.

I should be really excited right now about leaving on my trip to see him, but tonight I'm just really sad about missing the time to see my sisters.  They're significantly younger than me, and now that we're all adults we never get to spend time together."

6ikhk5,7,2017-06-21,First film job as production designer for an indie f: I hink I need to walk away from it. Need some advice.,GordanFreechman,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/6ikhk5/first_film_job_as_production_designer_for_an/,"EDIT: sorry for the title gore. Something got screwed up in how my phone formatted the title I guess.


Background: I'm a props artisan and fabricator and have been in the live entertainment industry for 15 years. I specialize in props production and scenic design. I've been an intern in props for a few different performing arts companies and have done a little freelance film work. I live in California.

I recently got an opportunity from the director of one of the first indie film I worked on. It was really fun and turned out great in the end, it was exciting to see. He was so impressed with my work as props master that he asked me if I would be interested in being his production designer for a feature film he wanted to do up in Canada in a couple years or so. My husband and I own an events company, and we said we would be willing to invest money towards the film because we loved his idea. So we worked out a deal to invest $27,000, own 30.5% of the movie plus a percentage of what comes out the back end. It sounded like a good opportunity to get into film. So we planned it and I came up here June 12, and am scheduled to be here till July 18th. The filming location is at an active psychiatric hospital.

Since I got here, I have realized that I have been thrown into a huge mess. Since I got here on the 12th, I have come to learn that:

* The budget went from 250k to 90k
* I can't get paid until the back end comes out
* Producers had no money in bank until day 1 of shooting
* I was asked to design costumes and was originally told I would have a wardrobe super who would source and dress actors, but most actors would be costuming themselves.  In  reality, there is no wardrobe super, and actors are not dressing themselves. I have to buy costumes and dress actors, and it comes out of the art department budget (not how it was planned originally). People keep coming up to me asking for costuming and I have to tell them I have fucking nothing.
* There is barely enough food provided by catering to get us through the day. No breakfast or dinner, only small lunch in a 15 hour day (The norm so far). Multiple people have been complaining.
* Massive lack of communication: I am hearing things that needed to be told to me months ago related to production design
* No location manager: I had to rework a location due to logistics being impossible to make work
* No form of transportation to move set dressing or set pieces from location to location
* DP, art director and grips and camera ops drinking beers on hospital grounds at night after crew was explicitly told to not bring alcohol or drugs on the ground due to it being a psychiatric hospital. (This location was hard to win over: the last crew disrespected their rules similarly)
* Exec producers do not get all emails sent out
* NOTE: I have not signed a contract because it was never sent to me


My design for the film has been very highly recepted by the producers and director. They are asking me if i would like to work more with them. Some of the producers would be nice to list on my resume as a reference, but I'm starting to think this isn't worth it. Because I don't have a vehicle, I was stuck sitting in the car in the parking lot on hospital grounds at midnight while the crew went through 2 rounds of beer, on no food no less since we don't get dinner. I had to borrow my art director's car to get home myself  (30 min away) because I didn't want to be driven home by people who were chugging beer at about 1am.

 Am I wrong for wanting to quit? It is day two of filming. It is very hard to do my job effectively when I am walking in blind like this and wearing hats I was told I wouldn't wear. And I can't deal with the drinking after shooting if this is going to be a regular thing. This is the most mismanaged production I have ever worked. I'm not sure how to even quit something like this. Any advice would be appreciated."
6ikqrv,1,2017-06-21,I thought my [24F] partner (2.5 years) and I [24M] were having the same goals. Now she seems to be distant.,thomdevalv,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ikqrv/i_thought_my_24f_partner_25_years_and_i_24m_were/,"Hi Reddit!

I've come to you because I'm having trouble with my relationship. We were having a blast for the last 2 years together, went to Australia together for 6 months, even when she went in India for 4 months without seeing each other, I was ok with it, I knew that we would eventually come back together. 

I knew that she had to do her last internship away from me as well, but that didn't matter, we discussed it (I always put communication as a key element in a relationship) and we knew that after that we could finally begin to live our ""adventure"". But that changed.

She recently applied for a position in Barcelona (which is really further away from where I am at the moment), and things are looking good for her. But she never talked to me about that, and when I confronted her, she told me it was ""just an interview"" to practice on.

Truth is, she's really thinking about moving there now. It is like all of what we agreed on during the last couple of years was forgotten. And she's either dodging my texts or replying ""I don't know"" to everything I say.

I'm kinda lost. She's sometimes arguing that she can't find a job like this where she is (Paris), which is honestly a lie, there's more opportunity for what she does in Paris that I can count. I even know from a friend of her that she received some calls for the same opportunity in Paris.. 

I want to keep this relationship alive, but I can't force her into staying where she is right now, I know that it's not how it works. It's like I'm a complete stranger to her now ... She knows that I won't follow her there, it's really a bad spot in my line of work. 

How can I act reasonable and talk to her about what we are right now without feeling like I'm pushing her to make a decision right now? Honestly sometimes I'm just feeling betrayed and angry.

so I was considering what should I do with my life and one of the conclusions I came to is that I might to try how’s it living in Munich. Briefly about me: I was born and raised in Europe and have lived in cities like London and Copenhagen, also visited Germany and Bavaria a few times but have never actually lived there. As I soon to receive (after a successful internship starting from 2018 Feb) my degree in computer science – web development I wondered if it is worth to try my luck and move to Munich.

Not speaking German at the moment, I’m curious what chances I’ve got to end up in a Junior software/web developer position and what are the rough estimates moneywise I can expect (monthly, after tax). Browsing accommodations, I found tons of agencies offering their service but I do encourage you to let me know if there’s a particular company whose work you found outstanding or very poor so I can try or avoid them respectively. In general, please share everything with me that you find important to mention living in Munich, good and bad things together (places to avoid in town, etc). It doesn’t matter if you have spent your whole life over there or just moved a few years ago – I’m really into get to know the place so I can make up my mind if it would worth to move over there or not.

**TLDR: I wonder if it is worth to move to Munich for an English-speaking junior software developer to work and live over there. Looking for advice from inhabitants including good and bad experiences with the city itself and the IT industry.**

Thank you for all.

Good Wednesday morning and happy first day of summer. THE FACTS -- KAREN HANDEL quite easily beat JON OSSOFF in Georgia. House Republicans are now 4-0 in contested special elections since PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP won the presidency. That means Democrats have failed -- despite millions of dollars in spending -- to win a single race with a president who has a record low approval rating. Democrats are even further from the majority than they thought. Let’s be clear: something ain’t working for Democrats, party insiders privately tell us. The Ossoff race galvanized national donors and activists in a way that led many to believe House Democrats were en route to wresting control of the chamber from Republicans. That’s not how they feel this morning. Caveat: this is a Republican seat. Being close is nice. But after six years in the minority, that’s about all it is.

-- REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MASS.) (@sethmoulton): “#Ossof Race better be a wakeup call for Democrats - business as usual isn’t working. Time to stop rehashing 2016 and talk about the future.” … “We need a genuinely new message, a serious jobs plan that reaches all Americans, and a bigger tent not a smaller one. Focus on the future”.

-- THE DCCC is holding a Georgia-6 debrief and consultant call at 1 p.m. today.

NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN STEVE STIVERS (R-OHIO), the guy that some Republicans were sniping at a month ago, has run through the tape in Montana, South Carolina, Georgia and Kansas with four victories.

-- STIVERS SENT US THIS TEXT MESSAGE after the victory was announced: “Despite 30 mil spent and all the Democrat bluster, Republicans never took their eyes off the horizon. We were consistent focused on the issues and data that mattered and the results speak for themselves. Moral victories don’t get a vote in Congress.” Rachael Bade on Stivers[http://politi.co/2rPV9Ip](http://politi.co/2rPV9Ip)

SURE, all these districts are GOP held seats, and Republicans just squeaked by. Fair enough. But if Democrats want to win the majority, they need to knock off some Republicans -- actually, lots of them. REMEMBER THIS: In 2011, Democrats flipped a GOP-held House seat in upstate New York -- so it’s not unheard of for them to win these races. They just haven’t done it in a long, long time.

THERE IS A LOT OF BUZZ that this will help ease the passage of Trump’s agenda. Eh, kind of. The same fissures still exist within the GOP on issues like tax reform, health care and big government spending.

GABE DEBENEDETTI, who was at Handel HQ in Atlanta and also dropped by Ossoff’s election night event, sent us his takeaways: “Heading into the night, Democrats figured even a close loss would lead to a narrative about the party over-performing in GOP-heavy districts. That much is definitely true, but the recriminations started earlier than expected when Archie Parnell came closer than anyone anticipated in South Carolina’s Fifth District earlier in the night.

“There were some awkward moments for Republicans on Tuesday even at Handel’s party -- a blue blazer-and-khakis crowd with a few MAGA hats and Bikers For Trump t-shirts scattered in -- especially when she thanked the president without using his name. But no amount of GOP discomfort or polling numbers showing a nationwide swing to blue was enough to calm frustrated Dems.

“To Bernie-aligned progressives I’ve spoken with, the Ossoff loss was evidence that candidates need to be more liberal, more outspoken on economic populism. Others wondered why the party didn't spend much money at all in Parnell’s race. But one Dem congressman texted me a question that summed up all the exasperation early in the night: ‘Lots of ‘moral victories.’ But when do we get actual victories???’”

-- MORE DEBENEDETTI: “Lessons from the 2017 elections”:[http://politi.co/2rTte5K](http://politi.co/2rTte5K)

NYT’s JONATHAN MARTIN and RICHARD FAUSSET: “The apparent success of relentless Republican attacks linking Mr. Ossoff to the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and her ‘San Francisco values’ also affirmed the efficacy of tying Democratic candidates in conservative districts to their brethren in more liberal parts of the country. …

“Both parties now confront the same question: What does such a hard-won victory in the Lululemon-and-loafers subdivisions of Dunwoody and Roswell, where Mr. Trump prevailed in November, augur for Republicans who next year will be defending an array of less conservative seats outside the South?” [http://nyti.ms/2tMxGEr](http://nyti.ms/2tMxGEr)

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES at 11:48 p.m.: “Well, the Special Elections are over and those that want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN are 5 and O! All the Fake News, all the money spent = 0” … KELLYANNE CONWAY (@kellyannepolls): “Thanks to everyone who breathlessly and snarkily proclaimed #GA06 as a ‘referendum on POTUS @realDonaldTrump’. You were right. #winning” … “Laughing my #Ossoff”

-- WAIT A SECOND, GUYS. Republicans did spend tens of millions of dollars to defend these seats and they won’t be able to do that everywhere in November 2018. We’re not saying Republicans will lose the majority, just pointing out a touch of nuance here.

RAHM EMANUEL and BRUCE REED in The Atlantic, “How the Democrats Can Take Back Congress”: The party needs “to recruit candidates who match their districts and offer voters a detailed agenda ... Democrats don’t need to spend the next year navel-gazing over how to motivate their base. In 2018, Trump will provide the greatest fundraising and get-out-the-vote machine the party has ever had. Wave elections are a chance to build on that base by winning back voters disappointed in the other side. Democrats will have plenty of disappointments to bring to their attention, including Republican health-care and tax-cut plans that betray the working-class voters who put Trump in the White House. To pull that off, though, Democrats must channel their anger, not be defined by it.” [http://theatln.tc/2rBsUcs](http://theatln.tc/2rBsUcs)

THE RUSSIA PROBE CONTINUES … “Mueller meets with 2 House Intel members,” by Kyle Cheney: “Members of the House intelligence committee huddled Tuesday with Robert Mueller — the special counsel probing Russian interference in the 2016 election — to ensure their parallel investigations don’t conflict with one another. Reps. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the two lawmakers leading the House’s probe into the matter, huddled with Mueller in a secure Capitol conference room to begin setting parameters. ‘We are setting up a system to deconflict,’ Conaway said shortly after the meeting.” [http://politi.co/2rQ0AqN](http://politi.co/2rQ0AqN)

   
COMING ATTRACTIONS -- “Fate of Obamacare repeal uncertain in Senate,” by Burgess Everett and Jen Haberkorn: “Senate Republicans are planning a pivotal meeting for Thursday morning to start the whipping process for Obamacare repeal, according to two sources familiar with the process. Mitch McConnell’s current whip count to repeal Obamacare is far short of 50 votes. There is still no bill, and even Republicans are moaning about the rush and lack of transparency.

“The GOP plan to jam through a bill over the next 10 days amounts to a rare political risk by McConnell with no guarantee of success -- and one that could jeopardize his Senate majority long-term if the bill ends up being viewed as poorly as the House-passed bill, which has a 17 percent approval rating. McConnell himself wouldn’t guarantee passage on Tuesday, or even commit to a vote next week, though that is his plan.” [http://politi.co/2rAtUO9](http://politi.co/2rAtUO9)

-- KEY SENTENCE: “Regardless of the outcome, the vote is still planned for next week.” … NYT: “G.O.P. Rift Over Medicaid and Opioids Imperils Senate Health Bill”[http://nyti.ms/2rPNWYQ](http://nyti.ms/2rPNWYQ)

NEW POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL -- “Poll: Opposition to GOP health bill is on the rise,” by Steven Shepard: “Opposition to the Republican health bill is growing, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. As the GOP-led Senate prepares to take up the measure, only 35 percent of voters surveyed approve of the bill passed by the House last month. Nearly half of voters, 49 percent, disapprove of the bill. The other 16 percent don’t know or don’t have an opinion, the poll shows.

“POLITICO/Morning Consult polling indicates the bill has become less popular since the House advanced it in early May. Immediately after the bill passed, slightly more voters approved of the bill, 38 percent. Opposition to the bill was lower, too, immediately after the House passed it: 44 percent.

“The poll underscores the risks Republicans face in pursuing legislation for which opposition is creeping toward a majority of voters. The Senate’s so-far behind-closed-doors drafting process also complicates Republicans’ efforts to sell the proposal to their own voters — and there’s some evidence of slippage among the GOP base on the party’s Obamacare repeal bid.” [http://politi.co/2sSFtEo](http://politi.co/2sSFtEo)

CH-CH-CH-CH-CHANGES -- “‘I’m Right Here!’ Sean Spicer Says While Toiling to Find Successor,” by NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush: “The biggest shift Mr. Trump is discussing is a dramatic change to the briefing room schedule, including limiting briefings that he has described as a ‘spectacle’ to once a week and asking reporters to submit written questions. Some of Mr. Trump’s outside advisers, including the Fox News host Sean Hannity, have urged him to curtail the freewheeling -- and often embarrassing -- barrage of questions. Mr. Trump has been particularly irked by CNN, and other allies such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have suggested banning the cable network. ...

“Several Trump aides, including [Jared] Kushner, Mr. Spicer, Stephen K. Bannon and the chief of staff, Reince Priebus, have made their own phone calls searching for potential job candidates, sometimes not telling others in the building what they’re doing. Some believe that the communications director needs his or her own lane; others believe that the person should report to Mr. Spicer, for whom a new role as a deputy chief of staff has been discussed.” [http://nyti.ms/2spucda](http://nyti.ms/2spucda)

VALLEY TALK -- “Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Quits as Investors Revolt Over Scandals,” by WSJ’s Greg Bensinger: “Uber Technologies Inc.’s co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has resigned after a group of investors pressured him to step down following a bruising six months of scandal and setbacks, marking a stunning turnabout for one of Silicon Valley’s highest-flying startups. Mr. Kalanick, 40 years old, handed in his resignation Tuesday, a spokesman said. Several investors pushed Mr. Kalanick to resign, people familiar with the matter said, to help turn around the company as it works to battle allegations that it has a workplace permissive of sexual harassment and sexism. Uber has no replacement for Mr. Kalanick and is running without financial and operating chiefs and other key executives after several recent departures, including one of the CEO’s top deputies who was pushed out last week by the board.” [http://on.wsj.com/2sUEbZb](http://on.wsj.com/2sUEbZb)

-- UBER’s C-suite overhaul is likely to have a major impact on K Street. The tech company has been losing a number of in-house Washington employees in recent months. While examining the tech company’s D.C. operation and consultant spending is unlikely to be the first thing the next CEO does, it certainly will be high on their list as Congress looks to get more answers from the embattled company.

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- The Chinese Embassy in Washington is exploring hiring new public relations representation as they navigate Donald Trump’s Washington. BLJ Worldwide, a global strategic consulting firm that represents and advises foreign governments, companies and NGOs, is pitching the embassy to do their PR, according to sources familiar with the bid. Qorvis has represented the Chinese embassy since 2014 for $25,200 a month and is trying to keep them on the books. The firm currently does “public relations, media training, survey and polling, advertising, social media communication strategy and implementation, crisis planning, event planning and management, and reputation and search management,” for the embassy, according to a FARA filing.

Representatives of BLJ have been spotted in the Chinese embassy in Washington in recent weeks, according to a source. Mike Holtzman, a partner at the firm, managed the PR campaign for the 2008 Beijing Olympic bid when he was with Weber Shandwick. The current pitch process has taken a few months and no one firm has won out yet. BLJ, which earlier did some work for Syrian first lady Asma Al-Assad (and helped get her an infamous favorable profile in Vogue in March 2011), the Qaddafi Libyan government and the Ecuador embassy, declined to comment. The Chinese embassy did not respond to a request for comment.

TRUMP INC. -- “Trump’s Net Worth Slips to $2.9 Billion as Towers Underperform,” by Bloomberg’s Caleb Melby: “Donald Trump’s office properties aren’t bringing in as much cash as banks that loaned him money had expected. That’s the biggest finding in an updated assessment of the president’s net worth, which has slipped to $2.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, down from $3 billion a year ago. ... The decrease is driven mostly by a drop in the value of three office properties in Manhattan, where financial data compiled by Trump’s lenders offer a consistent picture: They’re underperforming appraisals conducted when Trump was issued loans. The buildings -- 40 Wall Street, Trump Tower, and 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a tower in which Trump holds a 30 percent stake, are victims of a changing New York office market, where gleaming new skyscrapers are attracting tenants and demand for space in vintage properties is falling.” [https://bloom.bg/2trWJxl](https://bloom.bg/2trWJxl)

INSIDE THE WEST WING -- “Despite Concerns About Blackmail, Flynn Heard C.I.A. Secrets,” by NYT’s Matt Apuzzo, Matt Rosenberg and Adam Goldman: “Senior officials across the government became convinced in January that the incoming national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, had become vulnerable to Russian blackmail. At the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — agencies responsible for keeping American secrets safe from foreign spies — career officials agreed that Mr. Flynn represented an urgent problem. Yet nearly every day for three weeks, the new C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, sat in the Oval Office and briefed President Trump on the nation’s most sensitive intelligence — with Mr. Flynn listening.

“Mr. Pompeo has not said whether C.I.A. officials left him in the dark about their views of Mr. Flynn, but one administration official said Mr. Pompeo did not share any concerns about Mr. Flynn with the president. The episode highlights a remarkable aspect of Mr. Flynn’s tumultuous, 25-day tenure in the White House: He sat atop a national security apparatus that churned ahead despite its own conclusion that he was at risk of being compromised by a hostile foreign power.” [http://nyti.ms/2rBWHS6](http://nyti.ms/2rBWHS6)

The decision to remove the previous crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, comes as some members of the royal family have chafed at the rise of the younger prince, who emerged from relative obscurity when his father, 81, ascended the throne in January 2015. Prince Mohammed bin Salman has since accumulated vast powers in the wealthy kingdom, a crucial ally of the United States, serving as defense minister, overseeing the state oil company and working to overhaul the Saudi economy. His supporters have praised him as hard-working and as offering a hopeful vision for the kingdom’s future, especially for its large youth population. His critics have called him inexperienced and power hungry.” [http://nyti.ms/2tMsOzh](http://nyti.ms/2tMsOzh)

6ilagh,1,2017-06-21,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6ilagh/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

**If you have experience with wills and inheritances, your input would be greatly appreciated.**

We don't really know what's normal in this situation, and as complicated as this problem may appear, that's really all we're looking for.

---

My mom was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness. She likely has between six and eight months left. My father died fifteen years ago, she remarried five years ago. We'll call my stepfather Bob. My mom wants to divide assets as fairly as possible, but she is feeling conflicted in light of the issues below.

**Assets and Beneficiaries**

She has a will and a life insurance policy with my stepdad and the three of us, her adult children, as beneficiaries. The major assets (including the insurance policy) are:

* The house in which my mom, stepdad, sister, her husband, and their baby live. We'll call it Magnolia Place. $570K in equity, all in my mom's name.
* The life insurance policy. $100K.
* A 401K, $100K.
* An IRA, $18K, funded from my father's life insurance.

We live in Texas, a community property state. However, the house was bought long before the marriage, and is held in a trust, so community property rules don't apply. *The value in the house is 100% hers.* 

My stepdad Bob is fairly healthy for his age, has a retirement plan, and two children who are younger than we are but still adults (early and late 20s). We don't see or talk to them often, and they are not listed as beneficiaries on the assets above. *However, anything my mom leaves to Bob, he will likely leave to his kids, not to the five of us.*

I am the oldest, married, and my wife and I are young professionals with decent incomes, renting in an expensive metro area but staying for our good jobs, probably going to have a baby in the next two years. My sister and her husband make less but still do well, they have a baby, and they currently live and pay rent at the house (Magnolia Place). My brother is fresh out of college, working a summer internship, currently single, and currently living at Magnolia Place but looking for an apartment. *Bottom line: We're starting our adult lives and families at this point.*

**The Trouble: Bob is being an ass**

Bob is usually an empathetic person, and generally tries to do the right thing. Something might have disturbed him when the news broke, and he has focused probably more than he should on the assets. Shortly after my mom was diagnosed, he asked, rather bluntly, ""What am I getting?""

I don't have the full story from anyone but my mom, who has told me about it on the phone. Apparently he thinks he should be entitled to everything, as the surviving spouse, including the IRA that was funded by my father's life insurance.

Apparently any time the subject comes up, he gets moody, sometimes he even storms out. I know that paints him in a bad light, and the knee-jerk reaction is that he shouldn't be entitled to anything. But he's her husband, he's been there for her for a long time, it's a hard time for him too, and I don't want to be unfair to him even if he's not handling this appropriately.

Having said that...

**Friends and relatives are saying Bob should get nothing.** Basically because he's acting this way, her three kids are not (we all told her she can leave it to charity if she wants, it's her decision), and because we're just starting our lives out. *She does not think that's fair to him.* And frankly, neither do I.

**As it stands now,** Bob and my mom's three kids are each getting 25% of the house, Bob is getting the 401K, and the the kids are getting the life insurance and IRA. My mom is thinking of switching the house to the three of us and putting him on the life insurance policy.

**What we're considering**: The three kids get the house and the IRA, Bob gets the Insurance and 401K. This makes the most sense to me. Assets are roughly divided evenly, if anything Bob comes out slightly ahead. But we have the house, and we don't end up fighting with Bob over what to do with it after she's gone. (However, he lives there. He would effectively be a tenant, which he technically is now, but if we want to sell it and he wouldn't agree, we would have to give him notice to leave.)

**The problem with this plan:**  Bob will be slighted, and it will lead to a fight, then a grudge. And if she changes the will without letting him know beforehand, it might lead to a legal battle for Magnolia Place between us and Bob later on.

**My question for you**:

* Since we the kids are starting our adult lives and families, since anything left to Bob will ultimately be left to his kids and not us, and since Bob is being kind of a jerk about the whole thing, should Bob get anything from my mom at all?
* Assuming he should, is it fair to leave him the insurance policy and 401K (roughly $200K), and each of the three kids a share of Magnolia Place and the IRA (roughly $196K, plus various personal assets)? 
* Would it be more fair, say, to leave him the 401K and divide the insurance policy among the four of us (him and the three kids), where he gets $125K, we each get $221K?
* Since Bob has been hard to talk to, how should she tell Bob that she is changing the arrangement?

----


  
  ---   
**tl;dr**: My mom may not have much time left, and wants to be as fair to everyone as possible in her will. My stepdad, who she married late in life, seems to be demanding more than he should, and her friends are all saying he should get next to nothing. She's feeling really guilty and conflicted."

6inf1r,1,2017-06-21,"I desperately need this internship, but can't afford to work for free. What do I do?",JWoelle,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6inf1r/i_desperately_need_this_internship_but_cant/,"TL;DR – There is an internships that could give me a great career, but it’s unpaid and I need to figure out how to afford rent while I work it.



Since graduating last year with a degree in Video Production I’ve been forced to move back home and work for minimum wage as a janitor.  The town I live in is too far away from any opportunities to work in field and I desperately want to move out.  In Grand Rapids, MI - the city of my alma mater – there is a public access station called WKTV.  This station is unique because they loan out high-end filmmaking equipment and studio space free for non-commercial projects.  Due to this, they are the epicenter of Grand Rapids’ flourishing film and video community.  WKTV offers several internships and many of their alumni have gone on to successful careers due largely to the hands-on training and relationships formed with local creators.  I am also very well connected to them as I interned for a talk show that used their facilities.  Most of the staff knows and likes me, so I stand a very good chance of getting hired in the first place. 



The one major problem is that the internship is unpaid and would consist of at least 20 hours of work a week and my schedule must be flexible.  A full time job would allow me to move out, but I wouldn’t be able to make time for the internship.  With only a part time job, I cannot afford the expenses (namely rent) that I would face.  I can’t live at home and drive to Grand Rapids because the gas would cost as much as renting an apartment.  I considered going back to school for another semester to have student loans pay for my housing, but this wasn’t possible as I’m ineligible for any aide without pursuing another degree.


Why not take a paid internship instead?  Unfortunately, I was stupid in college and put all my effort into getting good grades rather than networking and making portfolio pieces.  As a result, my portfolio is laughable and I’m extremely far behind my classmates: who are now my competitors for jobs.  I’ve tried (and continue) to look for paid internships and jobs in GR and other cities such as Detroit, but I’m yet to get a single interview because I lack connections with employers and my demo reel is on par with a high schooler’s.  I’ve even tried freelancing, no one will work with me because of my inexperience.  I’m doing what I can with networking, but traveling is extremely hard due to my low wage and student loan bills.


The problem isn’t the lack of jobs, as there are plenty, it’s my inability to compete with other job seekers.  WKTV could fix all of this and my chances of being hired are very good due to my connections with them, but I most likely will not be able to work with them.


I deeply appreciate your responses.  Thank you for your advice!

6infv8,1,2017-06-21,Lately I have been feeling like I'm holding onto life my a thin string,PunchYouInTheFuck,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6infv8/lately_i_have_been_feeling_like_im_holding_onto/,"Don't know if off my chest is the right place to post this but here it goes... 
 Life has always felt like a struggle for me. Starting from the early years I had been diagnosed with a plethora of mental issues from Dyslexia to Depression to ADHD to Aspergers and more. Things always were difficult for me in school and in almost any social situation.  I have always felt like an outsider everywhere I go and even in my own family. 
  
  Anyways fast forward through grade school (very difficult time) and many failed romantic and platonic relationships. Here I was graduated from high school and moved out on my own living with a room mate who took total advantage of me and never paid her potion of rent but literally one time. I'm stuck at a dead end job with no opportunity for advancement or pay increase feeling like I'm gonna be stuck here forever. After about a year or so I get a call that my great grandmother has died and willed me some money to use to go to college and further my education. This is super super shitty news but also fucking fantastic news and I end up getting signed up for community college going into automotive technology. I had always been good with mechanical things and puzzles so this seems like a promising career path. Fast forward again I'm through college and had passed all of my classes with flying colors (this is the first time I have ever actually done well in school). I met my current girlfriend of over two years now while in school and she has been nothing but wonderful and helpful with every struggle in life I face. So here I am after completing an internship at a big name dealership with a new job offer feeling like I'm about to start my life off in a positive direction.
  Fast forward about 6 months and I start to realize that this dealership is set up on flag hour pay so that everyone is working over 110 hours a pay period (2weeks) and flagging between 55-70 hours actual paid time. More on the low end than the high end. They are paying us $12 an hour starting and they don't compensate you if you can't flag hours while there at the facility working. They have us doing free work on almost every car with the threat of being fired if we refuse to do shit for free. They are charging people $110 per hour and even after gaining ASE Master status with my degree I had only been at $14.50 per hour. They started limiting what jobs I could do because their old timers started complaining that I was taking all the work and all the hours. Other techs begun to bully me and hide my tools or parts. I would run into road block after road block set in place by my coworkers to slow me down and make me want to leave that place. Another 6 months passes and I lose all motivation to work as a technician. The amount of available hours to flag has been reduced by almost half. Doing the math with my ""over time"" that we are not compensated for I am being paid less than minimum wage. All signs point to finding another job.

  New life opportunity arises! My dad who has always owned a small dealership offers me a position buying and selling cars with him along with doing his mechanical work on all vehicles he needs. Things start out great! I'm making enough money to get by and have lots more free time on my hands to take care of things I could never do while working at the big dealership. 
  Now fast forward a few months and things start getting slow at the dealership. Car prices at auctions start to climb drastically. Car sale prices start to drop drastically as well, cutting down on the profit margins significantly to the point that my dad can't pay me fair enough wage to make it worth my time. More and more repairs need to be made on these cars but there is no margin to account for it so I'm losing mechanical labor pay as well as sales commissions. A few more months pass while we both scrape by trying to make it work. My dad who is also a bio chemist is back in school during this time preparing to enter the medical field again. He graduated school and knew this would eventually be a business that he would pass on to me when the money is there. The money is not there. I can't afford to take it over. He needs to get out quicker than he thought because it's not costing him lots of money just to keep the doors open and lights on. I'm told to find another job but I can still do mechanical work for him and his business partner. It's been almost 2 weeks without a single mechanical job and I can't find any opportunities for employment out there. Rent is coming up and so are bills. My bank account has 10 dollars and my wallet is empty. My girlfriend who I live with is trying to support the two of us with her job but even that is so tight that most days we eat only one meal. 
  This is getting really hard and my depression is getting worse and worse. The more I stress the worse her and I get along due to my difficulty communicating and comprehending my emotions. I'm terrified that I'm going to be homeless and that she is going to leave me. I'm starting to feel like a true failure. I don't really know what's keeping me going anymore other than my love for her and the guilt of what everyone would feel if I ended it all.  I feel like I'm getting worse at dealing with my mental health issues and I'm feeling more and more alienated from everyone else in the world. 

  I don't know where to turn or what to do anymore. My doctor said he would give me a referral to see a coulcelor but that was months ago and I haven't heard from him. Maybe I'm putting out too much personal shit here but I'm getting it off my chest at least.

Tldr: life is kicking me in the nuts over and over and I don't know how many more hits I can take. Nothing has worked out how it should have and apathy/Depression has fully set in. My mental health issues are ruining my life."

I have recently graduated college and have gotten a job making ~$60k a year,
About $10k in student loans which I am working to pay off, 
About $10k invested into a managed portfolio (at a place I used to intern, still have monthly withdrawals adding to it), 
Fully utilized my employers 401k matching (100% of the first 6%),
Have begun saving for a house down the road (monthly withdrawals) 

I am a huge ""car guy"" and have a muscle car that only has about 85k miles, but gets ~12MPG (paid off). Problem is - I will need to commute to my new job daily (350 miles a week) and need something practical and comfortable to sit in traffic in. 

My thought is to purchase a 2013-2014 Ford Fusion with about 35k miles for roughly $11-13k, that should last me at least 5 years. I figure although I have a decent credit score (700), since I am young I will get a rate of somewhere between 3-4.5% which would put my payments at about $220-$250 since I would put $5k down (I would save for a few months to get this down payment). Is this a good idea in my current situation? Thoughts and fresh perspectives are greatly appreciated, thanks!

Edit assuming a 36 month term"

This september i will begin some internships , travel a lot for work and won't have a stable situation for quite a while.
My current very old laptop is leaving me and i think i will have to buy a new one.

I would really love to play warhammer and the other total wars with it. I already have a desktop but bringing it with me is not possible.
Do you know some decent laptops that can run warhammer and similar games with a budget of 500 max 600 euro/dollars?

I don't absolutely ask anything that maxes out the game , since they would cost quite more. Is something that makes the game run at medium setting feasible for that price? Do you have any suggestion?
Thanks"

I spent my first month in a study abroad in China and it was AMAZING! Then the day I got back (jet lag and all) I started my research internship, which is kinda boring. But on top of that, I added an online summer course, which is actually kind of hard. I did it to ""keep busy."" I tried to drop it earlier this week, but it's too late to do that without a W on my transcript.
I always thought being busy would keep me sane. I haven't had a day that I was doing absolutely nothing (besides maybe a couple Saturdays but I was with people) since my fall break last October. I just know that being alone with nothing to do drives me crazy. So sometimes it's school or studying. Sometimes it's running a ton of errands. Sometimes it's even small trips or my study abroad, which are fun and I am lucky to do, but I never just do nothing.

Now I'm finally burnt out, and I just want to relax. But with my 9-5 MWF job, volunteering, and this summer class, I can't. Plus living at home for the summer means helping to cook, running errands for my parents, and taking care of my brother. I wish I had continued traveling and look at all my classmates' photos of them canoodling around Europe in envy. I thought getting an internship that paid $4k for the summer was smart, but I would rather just waste money having fun. I don't even know what I need anymore and if keeping busy is the right thing to do."

6ioju0,1,2017-06-21,22 / M / CST | Who wants to play some games? (+18),i_shot_da_sheriff,GamerPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerPals/comments/6ioju0/22_m_cst_who_wants_to_play_some_games_18/,"What's up, GamerPals. I'm a 22 y/o student with a 9-5 summer internship, so I'm looking for some like-minded people with close to the same schedule as me. 

I play games mainly on PC, and don't play any game exclusively. Lately I've mainly been playing PUBG (who hasn't), Battlefield 1, Rainbow 6, and more. I've got +100 games so chances are we could find something to play together. 


I also just picked up a Switch, so I'm more than down to race in Mario Kart or duke it out in Arms. I'll be getting Splatoon 2 the day it comes out. 


In my honest opinion, games are meant for fun, so if you take games way too seriously and have a bad attitude about losing, I'm not really interested. After all, losing helps you learn from your mistakes. I don't consider myself a good gamer by any means. I usually end up around the middle of the leaderboards, but I'm looking to improve at anything I play!

Comment or PM me and get to know me a little better and let me know if you want to play something!"
6iokyg,3,2017-06-21,"What I want to tell you, dad.",PromVulture,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/6iokyg/what_i_want_to_tell_you_dad/,"Disclaimer: This is basically just my ramblings about what I want to get out to my father. So if you don´t want to listen to a German´s late night rant in maybe flawed English, spare yourself the time :)
(I also got u/Jaz_The_Nagai to give me permission to post directed towards dad, so maybe you lovely folk can be DadForAMinute :) )

Hey dad, by now we haven´t seen each other in about 10 years. I miss you, you had your own struggles but as I was little I never knew that because whenever I visited you pushed them aside to spend the best weekend you could with your son, I still remember the stuff you cooked, to this day I haven´t had a better pizza. You´d bake me one every time I visited, you even made the dough from scratch, I loved it so much it was just so fluffy. You even got scampi every single time I visited to put the on there because I loved them so much. Now that I know how expensive those are I realize it must have torn a whole in your already small budget.

You´d sit with me through endless times of the same old movies and enjoy them with me, just because you wanted my company so bad. We played so many board games, always on the bed because your apartment was so small, but not to small to not put a separate bed in there and keep it all the time just in case I would come by surprisingly. You let me win a lot. You were a great person, incredibly calm and patient with me, and always joking, and you took my constant teasing of your smoking habit lightly. Every time you had a good laugh one of your tooth crowns would almost fall out and you had to put it back in manually, it was adorable and I was proud whenever I could make you love like that.

One time when mom and I moved to a new house in the countryside you helped us paint the interior, you rode 40 km (25 miles) by bike because you could not afford to take the bus and stayed at the yet uninhabited house and prepared everything. I believe I didn´t even visit you while you were there.
When the financial crisis hit you became jobless because you never got any kind of education after school, this ruined your financial situation, I never knew why you cut contact, but the last time I visited you, you did not even have a telephone connection anymore.
A month after I last saw you I made the travel by bus only to discover that a new family was living at your apartment. My mother says you likely cut contact because you were always a proud person, trying to keep your head high, so you never even enlisted for the welfare you should have been getting. Also the constant time without jobs made your alcoholism worse (or so I assume), I never even noticed you were alcoholic as I was naive and to young to understand.

Now that I got how I feel about you out of the way I just want to tell you what I achieved so far, because I love you and I want you to know about me.

After I lost you, I became really depressed and withdrew from social contact, which got me bullied a lot in school, as my mom was always working I had no one to turn to but video games, which is a hobby you instilled by the way, and it helped me immensely, I made friends online who understood me and cared about me, having them was the only reason I turned away from suicide at the age of 15-16. Still I muscled through school with all the effort it took, and finally graduated with the highest school education you can get in Germany.
I was unsure what to do with myself as my only goal in life was to make it through school alive, tho, school got better after I got into a new class and approached them with a confidence I build up by practicing with strangers on the bus during summer break. I made friends, a lot of them. Sadly the drug use in my area was rampant and while I always kept my use in check (and continue to this day) thanks to me wanting to avoid ending up addicted to any substance like you had, but a lot of my friends got addicted and have not gone anywhere in life.

Still after graduation I was lacking a sense of direction, so I volunteered on a farm in Estonia, a facility which helps troubled use. And, man, having no electricity and no running water sure wasn´t for me, so I came back fairly soon and work a meaningless job just to make some money. By that time I was already with my second girlfriend, we were an awful couple, but we kept trying. I lost my job as the company I was working at moved away and was unable to find a new one in my area, as they can be fairly hard to come by without any job training. My mother moved in with her new boyfriend and refused to take me with her, because I was not doing anything as I had no work and no school, so I moved in with my GF for a month. I went to Berlin because I landed an internship at an IT firm, found out software development is not a job I would like, came back home and had to move in with my GF and her family again, she started abusing me but I had nowhere to turn, so I took it.

After almost 2 months of this I reached out to a good friend who had a room to spare so I moved in with her, using my time there I started studying for a test to get into a Bachelor program for Psychology in Vienna, in which you have to be in the top 500 out of over 5000 applicants to secure a position. I made it, and was so happy to leave my drug infested hometown and my mother who I had huge fights with throughout all my adolescence behind. She still loves me tho and supports me in my study financially. I go visit my hometown which is almost 1000km (600miles) away about every half year, just to enjoy the time with old (and new) friends I still have there, and catch up with my mother.
I build quite the big circle of acquaintances, but I lack real friends here in Vienna. I am really depressed living and studying here and am going nowhere. Which makes me feel like a failure, and not to be rude, like I am slowly following in your footsteps, the lack of drive you had to pursue anything better I see in me more and more, but I don´t want to end up like you, I want to provide for my future family and fulfill the potential I have.

Anyway, I love you and whenever I am home I´m doing my best to pursue any trace of you and I got a fairly good lead, so maybe I will see you again this summer. &lt;3

In January of this year, we hired a new intern to work with us over the spring.  I had gotten a strong sense that he was hoping and probably expecting to be offered a full time position come summer.  Unfortunately, he wasn't quite what we were looking for and was informed that he would not be returning.   It was pretty clear by his dispirited demeanor from thereon that he was crushed.  Anyways, on his last day, my boss had offered to take everyone out for a team lunch in commemoration.  Lunch time rolls around and we had all gathered by the office doors to land on a place to eat. Now, its important to note that 99.9999% of the time my boss takes us out, it is for someones birthday.  Once gathered, my boss asked if anyone had any ideas on where to eat and, without thinking, I reply ""What'll it be birthday boy?"" (directed towards the intern).  I immediately realized what I had just said.  I could think of nothing to somehow justify or alter the context of my words.  Everyone just sat there in silence, completely stunned.  After a few seconds of awkward silence I ended up just suggesting a place to eat in order to end my own suffering.

### What We’re Following

**Video Evidence:** Minnesota officials have [released another video](http://ift.tt/2rS2pnb) taken in the aftermath of the traffic top where former police officer Jeronimo Yanez fatally shot Philando Castile. The footage shows Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, with her 4-year-old daughter in the back of a squad car; Reynolds is handcuffed, and her daughter pleads, “I don’t want you to get shooted.” Today’s release follows that of the [dash-cam footage](http://ift.tt/2sQEjcD) that circulated yesterday, which shows Castile telling Yanez he is armed and is licensed to carry a weapon. Yanez shoots him almost immediately—and the NRA’s silence after the officer’s acquittal now raises questions of whether anyone will stand up for [African Americans’ right to bear arms](http://ift.tt/2tO1Eb9).

**Ossoff’s Loss:** Republican candidate Karen Handel [won last night’s special election](http://ift.tt/2sR8Ero) in Georgia’s sixth congressional district with 51.9 percent of the vote to Jon Ossoff’s 48.1. While Democrats, [as Molly Ball reports](http://ift.tt/2rQOuhk), had hoped the election would be a referendum on and, a rejection of, Trump’s policies, Handel’s victory [suggests the president’s party is standing by their man](http://ift.tt/2rPkh2a). That doesn’t mean Democrats should lose hope for the 2018 midterms, but it does suggest [they have more work to do](http://ift.tt/2sBHdPl).

**Ride Cancelled:** Travis Kalanick, the founding CEO of Uber, [has resigned](http://ift.tt/2tspEBD) after shareholders revolted following [a string of scandals](http://ift.tt/2pr6kp6). He’ll stay on the ride-sharing company’s board of directors, however. The ouster—[long-awaited and yet seemingly abrupt](http://ift.tt/2rUOFTJ)—illustrates the power of money in Silicon Valley, and the fact that to fix its deep systemic problems, Uber has [significant and costly changes to make](http://ift.tt/2sBHp13).

### Evening Read

[This is your brain on power](http://ift.tt/2tgtGwv), writes Jerry Useem:

Subjects under the influence of power, [the UC Berkeley psychology professor Dacher Keltner] found in studies spanning two decades, acted as if they had suffered a traumatic brain injury—becoming more impulsive, less risk-aware, and, crucially, less adept at seeing things from other people’s point of view.

Sukhvinder Obhi, a neuroscientist at McMaster University, in Ontario, recently described something similar. Unlike Keltner, who studies behaviors, Obhi studies brains. And when he put the heads of the powerful and the not-so-powerful under a transcranial-magnetic-stimulation machine, he found that power, in fact, impairs a specific neural process, “mirroring,” that may be a cornerstone of empathy. Which gives a neurological basis to what Keltner has termed the “[power paradox](http://ift.tt/2cah55q)”: Once we have power, we lose some of the capacities we needed to gain it in the first place.

### Look Back

Pope Paul VI was elected on this day in 1963. [In our September 2004 issue](http://ift.tt/2srTpE7), as the search for a new pope was in progress, John Elie looked back on his reign:

Paul VI was dubbed “the pilgrim Pope,” and in the early years of his pontificate he made the moniker fit. He initiated many practices now associated with John Paul II—he knelt and kissed the ground during a visit to Colombia, celebrated mass in Yankee Stadium, and internationalized the College of Cardinals, in which Italians predominated.

Paul was more complex and less vivid than [his predecessor] John, at once a master and a captive of the Curia from which he had sprung, and this circumstance informs the work of Peter Hebblethwaite … He rated Paul (whose biography he wrote) a great man and a great Pope for supervising “the implementation of the Council” and keeping peace between European traditionalists and New World radicals; but as the council receded, there was less and less to report. Hebblethwaite quoted a Vatican official’s tart assessment of the relationship between the Curia and the aging Pope: “They treat him as though he were already dead.”

### Reader Response

After Hayley Glatter wrote about [why she chose to work at a summer camp](http://ift.tt/2rzZueQ) during her high-school summers, 17-year-old Nell shares her impressive summer plans:

I attend one of _those_schools—one where when the name is uttered, eighth-graders tense up. Many of my fellow students do pursue an academic program over the summer. I am not above the fray. This summer I will be working on a huge research paper for an institute at my school. I will also be an intern at my state house of representatives. And currently, I’m in the second of three weeks in Russia, where I’m living with a host family and seeing lots of Putin imagery. Each of these activities is strategic. It allows colleges to know more about me just by looking at my activities list. And everyone at my school has a strategic summer planned out.

Last year, I worked at my local grocery store. I didn’t hate my job, but I felt so astoundingly bored. My summer this year promises not only to be intellectually engaging, but also will give me more free time and ability to see friends.

&gt; GOP Senator Tom Cotton&amp;#039;s intern is not shy about spouting off incendiary comments, as the young Republican calls Speaker Paul Ryan &amp;quot;a cuck&amp;quot; and the British &amp;quot;Faggots.""

&gt; In a recorded conversation with this reporter, Hill intern &amp;quot;Nate&amp;quot; blasted Ryan for not having a hardline immigration stance, saying &amp;quot;Paul Ryan is a cuck, he&amp;#039;s a cuck, get him out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Paul Ryan: cuck first and Yankee second.""

&gt; In reference to Ryan, the &amp;quot;Cuck&amp;quot; slur towards him originated on alt-right and white supremacist websites.

&gt; Ryan has been deemed a &amp;quot;Cuck&amp;quot; from white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.

&gt; Ryan even received the title &amp;quot;Cuck of The Year For 2016.&amp;quot; by the Reddit page President Trump used to host.

&gt; A spokesperson tells us that Nate &amp;quot;Is no longer an intern in Senator Cotton&amp;#039;s office. Beyond that, I cannot comment on personnel matters.""

6iprcq,0,2017-06-21,[22] Advice on Leveraging Current Savings,That_Guy403,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6iprcq/22_advice_on_leveraging_current_savings/,"I've been meaning start taking this seriously for around two years, so I suppose now is as good a time as any to start.

Currently 22, finishing undergrad in computer science in December.  I was fortunate enough to earn a scholarship that covered the bulk of my tuition, and my parents helped match my contributions on the remainder to where I have no student loans.

I currently have an internship that pays $30/hour, which I started at the beginning of 2016.  I'm quite frugal overall and I've manage to save about $24k.  Living at home in this point of my life, my expenses will never be lower than they currently are.

So that brings me to how I should start leveraging those savings.    One thing I'm realizing after almost burning out is that I want work/life balance and somewhat early retirement (55 at the latest).  I would also like to have 1-2 children one day.

I don't currently have a credit card (used debt for everything), so I obviously need to get one and start building credit.  I was talking to a friend about Roth IRA and from my research it seems to be a pretty good option.  With my lifestyle I could max out the $5500 a year currently.  My internship doesn't offer a 401k but when I get a full time position I would try to max that out.

Apart from that I honestly haven't done much research though.  I mostly have just been grinding through college and saving, which has gotten pretty exhausting to be honest.  I also need to buy a different car soon since my current one is the same age as me.  I feel like it might be a little too soon to dump a lot of money into that though even if I would like to start building equity.

I set up a meeting with a financial adviser for next week that specializes in early investments (kinda pricey but probably worth it) so any advice I should take with me to that appointment would be greatly appreciated!"

I am moving to Orlando in July. I just finished with school last semester, except for one thing: I need an internship! (It is required). Looking for an IT / Comp Sci internship position (software engineering intern, preferably!)

I have to move to Orlando so I need to find one in that area...student loans will be coming for me soon, unfortunately. I never got one during school because I work full time and needed a certain amount of income every week. My area never had many openings and one that I almost accepted was only minimum wage, 5 hours from where I live.

Anyway, if no one has any suggestions for internship positions, how about jobs in the Orlando area? I'm hoping I can find something around $12/hr but who knows.

Thanks for the help, everyone. "
6ipx9u,5,2017-06-21,I have 0 objective value in any respect. Why shouldn't I die?,TheNightHuntress,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6ipx9u/i_have_0_objective_value_in_any_respect_why/,"I used to suffer from terrible depression with plenty of suicidal thoughts, manic episodes, breakdowns, and antisocial behavior. After having a LOT of support from people and taking a year to do almost absolutely nothing except contemplate, I was well on the road to recovery. I even made a couple of new friends, which is almost unthinkable for me. Then the depression crashed into me again much like the train I wish I could walk in front of one of these days.

This time round I don't cry as much. I've been spending a lot of time doing research on how to kill yourself by means of what they call an ""exit bag"". You know, the one where you fill a bag fastened around your head with helium or nitrogen so your body doesn't realize what you're breathing in isn't oxygen any more, and you gradually get unconscious and die soon after. For all my suicidal ideation I'm still pretty terrified of pain and would like my death to be as peaceful and clean as possible. I'm currently at home and would feel quite guilty about doing it here, and plan to purchase the required items after returning to university. 

Why? Because as the title says, I have no value at all. I've taken a long, hard look at myself, and come to the conclusion that anyone with my bitter, self-defeating, and pessimistic personality would only be an emotional burden on anyone. It's really no wonder that most people in my life leave after realizing how ridiculously fucked up I am. It's no wonder the men I fall in love with -- like the intensely attractive and extremely warm-hearted man I am in love with now -- don't reciprocate my feelings and use me for sex and/or emotional validation instead. It's no wonder I don't have more friends than I can count on one hand, despite being a university student who is supposed to be in the prime of her life. Literally all I do is spend my parents' money and half-ass my degree -- half-ass everything, actually. I have no passions -- I write a poem or two occasionally and play some video games once in a while. 

I've tried, and tried, and TRIED to be someone who has a stellar personality. I've gone to therapy, I've tried mindfulness, I've done the whole positive thinking thing. I've eaten healthy, worked out, forced myself to socialize, tried to overcome anxiety. I've applied for internships, joined societies. Literally nothing ever works out and I am left to be mediocre while everyone around me does more and more and MORE. This summer I have a short and fairly meaningless internship that I didn't even get by myself through the typical interview process -- I secured it through someone's contacts. Meanwhile everyone I know is doing a massive four-month long internship where they're going to learn a ton of skills I won't have. In my penultimate year of university (next year) this will give them a massive edge over me in applications and I will be left behind to do something useless instead. I am trying to work on learning web development by myself in the free time I have but even though I study day and night I progress very slowly, nothing like someone with an assigned project at an internship would. In the end I'm going to be mediocre and fucking useless again. 

I've made lists and lists of all the qualities I should work on and all the things I should do to be ""normal"" or have some semblance of a normal life. Somehow I always stumble and fail at these things or never really get anywhere because I am shit at time management and having any motivation at all. Today I was on LinkedIn and started crying because literally everyone my age has more experience than I do and I haven't done enough to achieve my dreams. So I'll end up being useless.

I'd at least feel like I have some value if I was an attractive woman. But no, I'm pretty plain when it comes to my features and I have a hormonal disorder that's given me stubborn acne for about 9 years now. None of the men I've been attracted to have actually wanted me back in the same way. The last one said he was attracted to me but took advantage of me to get over his ex. The one I am into now, the most attractive guy in our entire year -- flirted with me like hell, fucked me, and continues to fuck me and pepper me with kisses and affection, and still just wants to be friends. I've spent around two years now drowning in heartbreak over one of these two guys. 

Compared to everyone I know I have far fewer friends. Most nights I spend alone in my room in front of the computer. Oh, and don't fucking tell me I don't try to make friends, because I do. I just fail to find connections with people. They don't seem interested in me and I have nothing to say to them. I don't have a ""group"" and never did. I don't have any friends back in my hometown. I rarely ever get invited to parties. I don't form any lasting connections with all the multitudes of people I am friendly with -- just go back to my room after all the smiling and cry alone. I suppose I am just not interesting enough, and that's a rational conclusion. I rarely talk about the things that interest me because they are so few and far between. I don't exude the sort of passion and love for life you see in interesting people. All I have to talk about is dark things, obsessions, and pain. Lots and lots of pain. I complain to people a lot because I'm so assaulted by negativity and self-hatred all the time, and I know this is a burden on them. But after lots of time of trying to be kind and happy I keep failing at it. I know I can't make people happy.

So tell me, now, rationally, why I shouldn't die. Tell me what objective value I bring to the world that requires me to stay. A few people will be left behind in pain if I die, but they're in pain already now that I exist. Throughout the internet I see people saying they ""care"" and that it's worth it to hang in there. I can't help but think this is serious bullshit because you wouldn't care about the same person if they recovered from depression anyway. Why do you pretend you care now that they say they're sad? You don't even know them.

It has never been worth it to ""hang in there"" for me. I've been depressed almost entirely throughout my life and happiness is so rare and fleeting. All my dreams always die. 

I hope I'll have the courage to slip that bag over my head and finally be done with everything soon enough. I often imagine my best friend (the man I love) walking into the room and discovering my body slumped over the bed, the same bed we spent so many happy nights in. I imagine the shock on his face and I imagine others finding out about the news and realizing they never knew I was such a weird and fucked up person. I imagine their faraway pity.

I cannot stand living a life of abject mediocrity and loneliness any longer. I've done everything to improve it and nothing has worked. I continue living in pain and bringing pain to others. It never ends, ever. Everything major I have ever wanted -- I have lost. "

Im currently on my 4th year (done w/ internship; no subjects left) and was supposed to graduate this August. Unfortunately, we weren't able to finish our thesis in time, we are hoping to finish it by December to attend the February graduation. 

We can only work on our thesis at least once or twice a week since we're still in the proposal phase and our adviser is so damn hard to find and will only do consultations every WF. So here's the deal.. I managed to save 10k from my previous internship and it's what I'm using to finance my expenses right now. I am bored and running out of money. 

I tried applying for paid internships, and got accepted in a MNC with a really competitive allowance, BUT part of their requirement for the internship program is an endorsement letter from school. My school won't issue me one since I already finished my practicum. Company said they couldn't push through w/o the endorsement letter. Tried applying to other companies, endorsement letter is a requirement too.

So I considered applying for an ASE position but I'm worried I don't meet the requirements for the job since my expected date of graduation is like 8 mos away pa. 

I'm seriously tempted to apply for a position in a BPO/Call center. Would they hire me if i'm only planning to work part-time for 3-4 mos? 

TL;DR delayed graduation, planning to apply for a part-time position in a BPO for 3-4 mos. Any advice? Thanks in advance!

I guess I just need a place to vent that isn't a family member of my girlfriend (who I love more than anything in this world and is the only thing keeping me tethered anymore).

I've been feeling like I'm spiraling again lately, even with medication. I'm in the art career, and have been applying to so many studios, more than I can even count. Each rejection burns just a little bit more than the other one, and I'm starting to worry that I'm going to end up a complete failure, a burden to my parents and to everyone that knows me. I'm scared because its been two years since I graduated...I worked my ass off in college and was a straight A student. I passed every test. I did so well and even got an internship. Then nothing. Contract work, but nothing full-time.

It's hard seeing former college friends go off and get full-time jobs. It leaves you wondering what you did wrong. Why you're not there with them. 

It's even harder when those people don't talk to you anymore. Like they've moved on with their lives and only talk to fellow 'we got a full-time job' friends. I don't know. I'm not sure what to do. Start over from scratch?

I've not gotten a lot of sleep past couple days, because I'm trying to work every day to get better and get a job. Every couple of minutes I refresh my email to see if I have any replies. I'm absolutely terrified of my future, and have had thoughts of suicide. Saving up so that if that day comes where I realize I will never get a job...well, no one has to suffer with me.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm so scared. I want to do well, I want to be a good worker and help others. I really want to live, but I don't want to live a failure.

Thank you for reading. I appreciate it."
6ispxm,32,2017-06-22,172 days of no gaming and my current experience in stopping my gaming addiction,ForceMajeure40,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/6ispxm/172_days_of_no_gaming_and_my_current_experience/,"Hi all, 

Long-time lurker in both my current account and my previous one.  I'm writing because I've been reading a lot of posts about starting to get rid of games and starting your journey but not many by redditors that feel like they have succeeded in overcoming their addiction.  So I just want to talk about my journey and my experiences and hope that I can inspire people or draw a connection so that they understand what's going on as they go through the journey.

So just a little bit about me and what made me start my journey.  I have to be frank, I admit I wasn't as addicted as some in this subreddit but I feel like my experience is still relevant, since we are going on the same journey so its just the magnitude that is different and I applaud you for taking that first step.

So, I've been playing games from primary school to beyond my graduation.  My dad was in IT so I got access to a personal computer from a very early age and there I started my gaming.  I loved real-time strategy games and first-person shooters, particularly the age of empires and age of mythology franchise.  But what really jump started my addiction was Dota (the original).  I got introduced to it during university and boy I was addicted.  I played it till midnight every night and tried to even fit in a game in the morning just before class.  My marks were pretty good before but afterwards there was a distinct break, I passed everything in the end but it was a close call.  I didn't get a job after graduation, so I started a postgraduate course.  At this stage I was pretty depressed since I was one of the few people in my friendship group that didn't get a job straight out of uni and it didn't help that my parents voiced their displeasure at my failure.  But some good news, in the end I managed to get a job, although in a field that looking back was extremely helpful in my development but it definitely wasn't somewhere I initially considered since I could had the opportunity to work in a major investment bank (I even scored an internship there) if I didn't game as much.

Once I started work, my life was clockwork, I got to work and afterwards I would turn on Dota and eat dinner while waiting in the queue and played one to two rounds before I went to bed.  Somehow during this stage I got a girlfriend, who stuck by me even now and I love her for being with me and supporting me all this time.  At first it was pretty fun, I sometimes played with my friends but afterwards it was just playing out of habit. I was just playing a few heroes that I was good at just to win, I wasn't even in the game and my MMR was just terrible so I definitely wasn't playing to prove something.

What snapped me out of it was that Dota introduced a new map late last year and I found out that I couldn't be bothered learning about it anymore. On new year’s eve I told everyone at the NYE gathering that I was quitting computer gaming.  Some were sceptical, like who actually keeps their new years resolutions these days? Others just plain out told me I'll break in a months’ time.  My girlfriend was also sceptical but she was definitely supportive of me not being glued at my screen all day.  So, this began my journey that so far had three distinctive stages:

1. The void
2. The search
3. The stabilization

The void

The void was definitely the hardest to overcome.  From that moment I was bored, cutting out gaming freed up so much time.  Cutting out 3 hours of gaming per weekday and 5 hours per weekend, so 25 hours per week generates a huge hole in your life. I started looking around me and cleaned up my room and then working later but it was still not enough to fill the void.  In addition, nothing that I did gave me that quick fix hit that gaming gives you.  So, I quickly moved onto the next stage.

The search

With such a void I started searching for things to do.  Luckily I have a friendship group, but that wasn’t enough 25 hours per week is a lot of time to fill.  It also didn’t help that my girlfriend had a project overseas so she couldn’t hang out with me as often.  One thing that really helped was Meetup.com, I started signing up to numerous groups from board games to entrepreneurship and real estate investing (since housing is big in Australia).  I even started going to the library and got a library card, I haven’t had a library card for over a decade, I used to love reading and was a massive bookworm.   In one month I read more books than the last 5 years combined, it wasn’t much but I felt like a huge accomplishment since I did something that I haven’t done for a long time.   One of my friends invited me to a DnD social night which I now join weekly and I made a completely new group of friends that I have never expected.
I have to admit it wasn’t easy, during this time I was daydreaming about Dota and even had dreams about playing it.  But I was glad I moved onto this stage as quickly as possible and kept myself out of the house by reading books everywhere else including at the gym.

The stabilisation

After around three months, I think I finally stopped searching since I finally filled the void up with things that I enjoy doing and give me a purpose to rise out of bed.  During this time, I learnt about real estate like drinking water out of a firehose and currently spending a lot of time looking at investment opportunities, although I’m still yet to put in a bid.   As mentioned before I also go to a DnD session every week and since my girlfriend doesn’t go on reddit I’ll mention it here, I got my act together and got a ring and planning to propose in two weeks, fingers crossed.

Also I forgot to mention, I still haven’t uninstalled dota or deleted steam, its still sitting in my computer.  But I don’t even have the desire to boot it up anymore but it definitely served as a reminder of a past life and I can remember how far I come in just a few months.

So my advice is this,

1.	Before you start be prepared for the enormous amount of free time that you will suddenly have available.  Try to jot down some stuff that you want to achieve, you don’t need a plan you’ll have plenty of time to plan it out afterwards.

2.	Be prepared for your lack of attention span, do stuff that doesn’t require too much thinking at the start like going to the gym because I still can’t read a novel, I’ve only read self-help books so far.

3.	Use social media to your advantage, don’t go on reddit or Facebook. Instead, go on things like Meetup.com and attend them, get yourself out of the house and meet people.  If your bad at general conversation or just shy, go to ones that involve learning about something so you don’t need to talk that much and if you do, you’ll definitely have a topic at hand.  You might be pushed to buy something but once they start pitching their product you can just leave.

4.	And most of all, start reaching out to your friends, no matter how far removed they seem.  I caught up with people that I haven’t met for over 8 years and I afterwards I got invited to go rock climbing and other social gatherings.  So, it definitely doesn’t hurt, if you want to have an excuse to talk to them, say happy birthday to them on their birthday, but go a little further and ask them how they have been and arrange a catch up over coffee or lunch (or if you want to wake up earlier, breakfast)

I know its been a tough journey and I wished someone could have given me advice on what to do.  My friends were definitely supportive but they didn’t really understand how bad it was.  So if anyone has read this far I thank you for reading and if you want to know anything more or want some general advice feel free to comment or pm me.  

Good Luck!

I was wondering if you guys have any suggestions on any software engineering positions (or web developing) around the capital region. I'm even open to internships just to get my foot in the door. I've been looking at places like LinkedIn and indeed but there seems to be the same positions and the same repeating companies. I just graduated from Manhattan College a few weeks ago.

*****
&gt; GOP Senator Tom Cotton&amp;#039;s intern is not shy about spouting off incendiary comments, as the young Republican calls Speaker Paul Ryan &amp;quot;a cuck&amp;quot; and the British &amp;quot;Faggots.""

&gt; In a recorded conversation with this reporter, Hill intern &amp;quot;Nate&amp;quot; blasted Ryan for not having a hardline immigration stance, saying &amp;quot;Paul Ryan is a cuck, he&amp;#039;s a cuck, get him out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Paul Ryan: cuck first and Yankee second.""

&gt; In reference to Ryan, the &amp;quot;Cuck&amp;quot; slur towards him originated on alt-right and white supremacist websites.

&gt; Ryan has been deemed a &amp;quot;Cuck&amp;quot; from white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.

&gt; Ryan even received the title &amp;quot;Cuck of The Year For 2016.&amp;quot; by the Reddit page President Trump used to host.

&gt; A spokesperson tells us that Nate &amp;quot;Is no longer an intern in Senator Cotton&amp;#039;s office. Beyond that, I cannot comment on personnel matters.""

6iu779,18,2017-06-22,"Does anyone find themselves doubting what happened to them? (CPTSD, long-term abuse) (xpost from r/abuse)",DesmondTapenade,survivorsofabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/6iu779/does_anyone_find_themselves_doubting_what/,"I posted this on r/abuse earlier but figured this might be a better subreddit for this. It's kind of long...basically, an early morning mind-dump.

My childhood was fucked, with a capital ""F,"" but I also have a few happy memories. I wonder a lot if my life was just...normal and that I overreacted to all the shit that happened.


**Basic rundown:** Alcoholic mother who beat the shit out of my grandma (with whom we lived) when I was a kid. Multiple DUIs, ended up in prison for two years after the assault. Possible CSA (childhood sexual abuse), but I feel like I've blocked a lot out. Relationship from 17-19 years of age that was abusive in every way, followed by a miserable marriage to a different person from 21-25 (relationship ran from 19 to about 23, when we kind of started hating each other).


I remember feeling guilty a lot as a kid. My aunt moved home from what I always thought was an awesome life (but probably wasn't as awesome as I thought) to help my grandma take care of me. Occasionally, I'd get the guilt trip about how she made sacrifices for me, but it wasn't like an every day thing. There was also some physical bullshit, which I know is not acceptable, but again, not like I was getting beaten every day. I can probably count on both hands the number of times anyone put their hands on me.


Christ, even to myself, it sounds like I'm minimizing the hell out of this, and that's because I am.


As an adult, that guilt is still there--I feel like I always have to feel bad about something, and if everything's going fine, my brain will bring up something that happened years ago (I'm 28 now). My life is finally awesome, but I still have all these damn neuroses and have mad PTSD symptoms. (Currently working on finding a therapist who specializes in trauma disorders, but I'm in grad school to be a counselor and want to work in trauma myself, so finding one without shooting myself in the foot re: future internship sites and the like is difficult.)


**Side note:** The personal trauma thing doesn't mess with me when I work with people who have also been abused. I compartmentalize really well. I'm an online crisis counselor and hear horrible shit all the time, and it never hits me on an emotional level. On the contrary, I love helping people get to a better (or at least slightly-more-okay) place. I accept that I can't save or ""fix"" anyone, and I enjoy what I do. I'm very excited to start my practicum in the spring! Trauma disorders are my passion, man.


In my personal life, I generally just bury all the shit or make jokes about it when I do mention it offhand to someone I'm close to (fiance, friends, etc.) because man, that's how you survive. I have kind of a hard time actually connecting my emotions to the memories because that opens the damn floodgates and it's hard to close them. I have a good cry every couple of months or so, which seems to be sufficient.


I'm currently on mood stabilizers (I have rapid-cycling bipolar 1 too, lucky me) and have lorazepam for anxiety attacks, but I'm generally pretty chill.


This ended up being kind of rambling, but my question is, does anyone else feel like they're overreacting to shit? My grandma and one of my aunts raised me and while I was always cared for in terms of basic needs, they didn't really understand the shit I'd seen (which, by age eight [when my mother went into the pokey] was a hell of a lot).


I had nightmares all the time. I was nervous and jumpy. I cried easily. I was bullied extensively and a few teachers got in on the fun, too. I didn't start seeing a therapist until I was 18 and made an appointment for myself--my family thought about finding one for me right after the prison-mother incident because I was having horrible nightmares, but decided I didn't need one and would be okay. I didn't even find out about that until I was in my mid/late teens.


These days, I'm mostly okay. Not much triggers me because I've got a couple of dissociative disorders along for the ride (depersonalization and derealization), so nothing feels 100% real to me. It's my new normal, and it's been chronic for going on six years. I am totally fine with the symptoms, though--now that I've gotten used to what it feels like to feel slightly unreal, I'm very functional. I'm in an actual loving relationship and am going to a relatively prestigious school, so I feel like things are working out and I finally have the life I deserve.


But man, when that self-doubt creeps in. Can anyone relate?"
6iukoj,3,2017-06-22,How do I[F/21] deal with these traits of bf[M/22]?,xXRedSin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6iukoj/how_do_if21_deal_with_these_traits_of_bfm22/,"I apologise for the wall of text, each paragraph is basically a trait. In general, I would describe him as someone unreliable and not disciplined due to these traits, and they often make me upset though I don't know if I should be, but they make me slightly wary of the future.

Firstly, he often ""goes with the flow"" and is stubborn. For example, when travelling to a destination (within my country, public transport is good and everyone uses it), instead of checking google maps like the average person, he just takes any route that he is familiar with (which often takes twice as long as the optimal journey, resulting in him being late), and if he doesn't know of any route, he will take a taxi (expensive in my country). He is a computer science student, he should be tech-savvy enough to use google maps but he just refuses, saying that's too troublesome, or if we verbally tell him the optimal route, he will also complain that that's too complicated (even when it's one 10 min direct bus to the final stop) and brush our comments off before we can even full explain. 

This brings me to my next point of punctuality. When I rushed him because we were gonna be late for the meeting time, he just brushed it off saying that it's fine if we're late, and that other people will be late too, and if they aren't then they can just wait for us. Which I thought was really rude, and told him we shouldn't let our friends wait for us like that. To which he responded, ""Whenever I meet my friends, I always go late, since they'll always be late too"".

Third point is money. My friends and I are all pretty thrifty, we do go out and do stuff that costs money, but we don't splurge unnecessarily. For example, he would take a taxi for a 10 min walking distance, or spend $3 on a bottle of mineral water because he insists it's ""high class water"" (you can normally get mineral water for under a dollar). Just today, because he wanted to relax for 15min extra, we had to take a taxi which costs over $25 when we could have took a train for $3. When a friend said that they are working part time to earn some spare cash, he would even say to them, ""I'll pay you more than your workplace to not work."" and another time he literally paid a guy $50 just for a dare which the guy would have done for free anyway(and bf ended up not watching the dare anyway because he was too embarrassed). Also he spends money on things that doesn't even have any use and just sits in his room collecting dust just because he thought it was cool at that moment. If he was earning a steady income I wouldn't have that much qualms but he is a student who isn't even doing an internship or freelance, so he has literally zero income, yet he spends so thoughtlessly. Whenever I remind him to be more thrifty, he says ""never mind, I still have savings"" (though most of it is gone...)

Next point, his sleeping habits. He has literally gone to sleep at every hour of the day before. Like there have been times I'm going to sleep at 2am and he just woke up ready to start his day, or times when I wake up at 10am and he's going to bed. His sleep cycle is...literally a cycle, it keeps moving (because he is kind of an insomniac and can't fall asleep sometimes). This has an effect on our relationship in the sense that sometimes I feel like he just can't be there for me because it feels like he's living on the other side of the earth. Another effect it has is on his school life, as he often misses classes (sometimes a whole week of class) and he doesn't catch up on the content while he is awake either. When he IS awake to go for classes, he still doesn't go for them as he says he would have no idea what is going on (which led him to fail most of his classes the last semester)

Last point, he is very oblivious and easily offends people. Like, people literally say to him upfront, ""How many people do you intend to offend?"" in a semi-joking way to which bf will laugh sheepishly and say ""huh?"". He doesn't read the mood well, he can't tell when people are being sarcastic, and often says things that might make people feel worse or not help the situation. To me, he will say things like ""I don't know what I should type into this chat, what if everyone hates me???"" (about a group of people who hasn't met him) He literally showed me an announcement message he wanted to send, asking if he should put the word ""going"" as it is or ""goinggg"" with two extra g's LOL. He always refuses to do things because he says ""everyone hates me"", but in front of others, he acts over confident, saying he is super skilled in xxx area and that they cannot beat him blah blah. But most of our friends, knowing him, just laugh along with him because they have told me that honestly they don't take what he says seriously at all. (He has said to me that he always says stupid things -- almost as if it was a good thing)

Recently I have been showing my displeasure in these areas, but he doesn't get it, he's just like ""huhhh what's wrong with that???"" or ""I can't help it!"". I know there's whatever saying that you should love a person for who they are and not expect them to change for you, but I really want him to change these traits, for the better for himself as well.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: BF has bad spending habits, a permanently screwed up sleep cycle, not disciplined, stubborn and oblivious. We both love each other very much, how do I deal with this or make him change for the better???"

* 1.Start a log to record what is deleted

* 2.Import a CSV

6iv3rs,21,2017-06-22,[Need Advice] I wanna see a therapist but I don't wanna hurt my parents' feelings by not talking to them first,donbataillon,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/6iv3rs/need_advice_i_wanna_see_a_therapist_but_i_dont/,"Hello dear all who read this,

Only two or so years ago I really started thinking about who I actually am in life and who I want to be. I have never been really able to express what I wanted in social situations but also just for myself. When I finished school I had no idea what I wanted to be. I did some voluntary work, after that I enrolled myself in university just because I though that's what I had to do, just picked a subject and thought yeah, I might be able to do this. Right now I'm trying a third time to find my academic passion. This and several internships have not brought me a step closer to knowing what it is that I want in life.

So for the past two years I've been starting to really think about this, questioning basically everything that I do in my free time and why I don't use this free time to pursue the path that I had chosen, namely studying. I can't really say ""nah it's not for me"" and try another thing without even really trying the first thing. And yet, when it comes to working on things that might help me in finding my way in life, I would always just rather choose doing nothing instead. And I mean literally nothing. Watching A TON of youtube, netflix, and, sorry to say this, porn. Things with no valuable content whatsoever. This is what I kill my time with just to at the end of the day say to myself: why didn't I do anything today? Next time I'll have to. I really have to... And repeat.

Sorry, I'm wandering off. So in the last two years I have learned a lot of things about, things that don't particularly make me happy but I'm thankful for knowing because now I can work on my happiness. Step by step. But my afore mentioned lack of motivation makes me think that I should talk to somebody. Somebody who can ask the right questions to make me realise what is the part of me that is holding me back. Somebody who helps me get on track so that I can work on myself.

But then I'm thinking a step ahead, after I start seeing a therapist I will have to tell people, close friends but especially my family. I know my sisters would understand and not judge me. And somehow I also feel that my parents would fully understand it, but still I think that I might hurt them with it. On the other hand I don't think I could talk to my parents about all my worries and insecurities. I worry that it would also hurt them to see me so clueless and helpless in the world...

Am I just using the I-don't-wanna-hurt-my-parents-dilemma just to manipulate myself back into my apathetic state of surrender?

I don't know if you have even read this far. I just needed to vent a little.

Maybe someone has similar problems? I'm thankful for any advice.

I don't know how to end this... Regards?

 by Elisha Brown via Master Feed : The Atlantic

Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams wants to be her state’s first Democratic governor in over a decade. Thus far, the gubernatorial candidate, who moonlights as a romance novelist, has dedicated her time in political office to increasing voter turnout in the state. Abrams created the voter-registration nonprofit [New Georgia Project](http://ift.tt/1NkUCwC). (In 2014, the organization faced allegations of voter fraud leveled by Abrams’ opponent. The investigation technically remains open but has not resulted in any finding of wrongdoing**.**) She also leads the [B.L.U.E. Institute](http://ift.tt/2sVqJUu), an organization that aims to increase diversity on campaign staffs.

Despite her storied political career, the leaders who inspired Abrams along the way were often from outside of the political realm. For _The Atlantic_’s series on mentorship, “On the Shoulders of Giants,” I spoke with Abrams about unconventional mentors, writers she looks up to, and what makes a good mentee.

********

**Elisha Brown:** Who was the first person to give you advice about your political aspirations?

**Stacey Abrams**: I rarely actually asked for advice about politics writ large. I came of age before formal conversations about mentorship used to happen. Instead, what I carved for myself were people who had different skills that I thought would be important for me to have. When I was in college the first time I actually ran for office, I ran for student government. That came about in part because of Dr. Johnnetta Cole, who was the president of Spelman College. That’s the first time I had the formal set of experiences that would lead to my effectiveness in running for office. Working with Dr. Cole, I learned how to fundraise. She would let me watch and attend events. I also learned to be fearless in asking for money. She was extraordinary at Spelman and helped raised more money for black colleges than had been raised in years past. She sent me on my first informational interview.

**Brown**: How did that mentorship evolve after college?

**Abrams**: There was so much to learn from her. I remember sitting in the kitchen in the president’s house, just listening to her and asking questions and learning about how she got to where she was and how she navigated the challenges of running that college. A few weeks ago, I was privileged to receive an honorary degree from Spelman, and Dr. Cole flew in for that awards ceremony. I consider her family. Even though she wasn’t in politics, she was the person who told me I complained too much at Spelman and if I wanted to change things, I needed do something about it and run for student government. Mainly I think she wanted me to stop bothering her.

**Brown**: You’ve had two careers, really: one in public service, and one as an award-winning novelist. Have you had any leaders in that other career path that guided you along the way?

**Abrams**: No, that’s been mostly by reading really good writers. Aristotle’s _Poetics_ is how I think about how good writing is done. The second is Pearl Cleage. She’s an award-winning playwright and author. I took playwriting from her at Spelman. There were things she taught at that class that I found to be invaluable in constructing novels. And Nora Roberts was really the first novelist I read who understood how to marry suspense and romance in ways that didn’t underestimate her audience. I wanted to be that kind of writer who wrote smart novels that people wanted to read that had their core, romantic suspense element, but they weren’t diminished because of their genre. Nora Roberts was the way I learned how that could be done effectively.

**Brown**: How do you involve young people in some of your initiatives, like the New Georgia Project and B.L.U.E. Institute?

**Abrams**: In the political sector, I have been very intentional about creating internship programs. We’ve graduated more than 300 interns through our intern program at the caucus, which is a fairly aggressive but important number. I wanted young people to understand what we do. You can’t encourage people to go into government if they don’t know what it looks like. [We created] the B.L.U.E. Institute, which is designed to train young people to be campaign operatives, especially people of color, who are often not given those opportunities. For me, mentorship is less about a formal relationship and more about how you create opportunities for people to learn and to experience things that their normal lives wouldn’t let them access. In every facet of my career, I’ve been privileged to offer those opportunities to young people.

**Brown**: As someone who didn’t necessarily seek out formal mentors, but found them, and now has mentees, what makes for a good mentee?

**Abrams**: Own the relationships. What I learned early on is if someone said I want to help you, believe them. But I understood what they meant is help me help you. Recognize that the person has a number of other holds on their time. Don’t wait for them to offer, ask what you need. Do not worry about reaching out too much. You don’t want to be a stalker, but you want to be aggressive in your curiosity. Ask important questions that you need answers to that you can’t find anywhere else. The corollary to that is don’t ask questions just so you can sound like you have something to say. Be thoughtful about putting together a sort of board of advisors. That’s the way I approached it. I never formalized it.

But as I said, I didn’t have one person who was guiding my career. Shirley Franklin, who served as mayor of Atlanta, has helped me understand how I want to be as a governor because I saw how she operated as a mayor. Working for her I was able to learn how important it is to balance effective administration with clarity and vision. But I didn’t rely on her to be the only person to help me know how to do these jobs. So, don’t just pick people because they have the jobs you want. Pick people because they have the skills you want to develop and emulate. Especially if you’re interning, take that opportunity to try to gather that information, not only from the senior person, but also from your peers. We ignore peer mentorship to our detriment. I learned how to be a good entrepreneur from my business partner. She’s my age, but she had experiences I didn’t have.

6ivsg6,1,2017-06-22,Which internship should I take? Could really use some help.,thecrimsonlotus,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6ivsg6/which_internship_should_i_take_could_really_use/,"Hey guys, long time lurker here, I could really use some help in making a decision between two internships.

Ok a little background: I am a 23 year old college student from New York (Long Island).  I am going to a local State University for a dual Bachelors in Accounting and Management Information Systems. I have two years until I graduate with the dual degree. My hope/plan is to get into IT Audit/ Risk Assurance and earn my CPA within my first year of working full time.

So, I have been looking for internships related to Accounting or IT that would look good on my résumé and help me land a positions at one of the Big 4. After about a month of searching, I've been accepted to two totally different positions that I think will both offer a unique learning experience, but I would like your help in deciding what would look better and help me prepare more for the future.

Option 1- ~~ 15 hours a week (3 hours a day M-F) at a local CPA firm. They told me that they need someone to do receptionist type work (their receptionist works 9-2 they want me to work 2-5). They also said though that there should not be too much receptionist work and that when I am not at the front desk they will teach me multiple facets of accounting such as Quickbooks, bank recs. , preparing financial statements, computing payroll, and so on and so forth, a lot of things you would expect from a small 4 person firm. I think this could be a great opportunity to get some hands on accounting experience and would look great as far as knowing the basics go. My one big con is starting pay is $11.50/hr. 

OR


Option 2- Customer Services Intern for a Real Estate Software Developer Company. I'll just copy and paste the job description. 

•	Test and reproduce program/database issues – understand, identify, reproduce client reported issues and propose resolution
•	Create and maintain issues logs – enter and update client issues logs and cases through resolution
•	Report Writing – edit and/or create SQL, Crystal, and SSRS reports
•	Financial Tie Outs – understand and identify client reported issues and propose resolution
•	Quality Assurance – participate in ad hoc testing sessions to identify and report program bugs
•	Training – provide program application training to clients
•	Documentation – document client issues, resolution steps, processes, and training materials


So for this job I will learn SQL and get more an IT background with more customer interaction. Another major factor is the pay is practically double, 20$/hr starting.


Alright so my question for anyone who works in Accounting/ Accounting Information Systems/  IT Audit/ etc. what do you think will be the best path to take to help me with my future goals of entering the Accounting Information Systems sector? I know this was kind of a long read so thank you in advance to anyone who took the time to read this and respond. "
6ivtcp,1,2017-06-22,Convergence of posterior when likelihood is sampled from a surrogate model?,gyrovagueGeist,AskStatistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/6ivtcp/convergence_of_posterior_when_likelihood_is/,"In a previous research internship, I ended up with an expensive computation that I wanted to explore the parameter space of when given experimental data with MCMC. To make this more computationally tractable I tested various surrogate models (GP and gPC with different sampling techniques and coverage) to use instead of a full forward evaluation in a MCMC step.  In most cases (when the surrogate was well formed and the sampled chains were 'good') the first and second moments of the posterior seemed to converge well to exhaustive runs with the full model. However higher moments had a terrible bias. With kurtosis consistently being three orders of magnitude different (I think smaller, but my memory is a bit shakey and I no longer have my research notes) irrespective of the surrogate and the sampling pattern on which it was trained. This has been bothering me for quite some time, and I'm wondering if anyone here could point out something obvious that I'm missing or should look at to help me understand what was going on. "
6ivuq2,1,2017-06-22,M4A - Trap me in my cheating wife's head,dangerboner,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6ivuq2/m4a_trap_me_in_my_cheating_wifes_head/,"My name is Paul, I'm 31 and I married my childhood sweetheart, Chloe when we were both too young. Now we live together, have boring jobs, and, well... she's changed. She's no-longer that innocent, sweet little thing I married. In fact, she now goes to work [looking like this](http://i.imgur.com/PgFqDxB.jpg) most days. Call me slow on the uptake, but I just started to suspect she might be cheating on me. I pretty much know it, I just don't trust her anymore, but I have no proof!

That's why I came to visit you. People say you're a dodgy, conniving hypnotist, that you pretty much deal in black magic and that you're not to be trusted, but paranoia got the better of me and now I'm here, asking for your help. I need to know the truth for sure, I need that proof!

I lay back on your couch, as instructed, close my eyes and inhale as I follow your instructions. When I open my eyes, I'm not in the same place. I'm not even in the same body anymore. I'm a passenger, trapped in Chloe's mind!

I see her naked body in the mirror as the shower runs behind us. I hear her thoughts, I know what she's thinking. The sensation of being in a body I'm not controlling makes me uncomfortable, along with the unfamiliar feeling of breasts as she touches them, of there being nothing hanging between my legs, and being a few inches shorter.

The warmth of the water on her back feels soothing, and the feeling of her fingers massaging her thick long hair start to relax me/her/us. That's when I hear her private monologue and thoughts. Naughty thoughts. Thoughts about that guy in the office she flirts with. Thoughts about that hot new intern kid, ""but no - he's too young - someone might find out, he might brag?"".

The bubbles landing on her crotch give a tingling sensation I've never felt before, and it intensifies once her fingers gently start to rub her clit. Cold glass of the shower wall on her bare ass cheeks, I feel her pinching at her own nipple. She closes her eyes and I see mental images, of a muscled, shirtless male torso unbuttoning his jean fly, letting them fall and revealing a frighteningly long, thick, hard shaft.

Her breathing gets heavier and I'm feeling her getting this urge, totally foreign to me, for some reason she really needs something in...

And then she does it. Two fingers slide into her pussy causing me to moan aloud and wake back on your couch.

Chuckling to yourself, you prepare to send me back under.

My eyes close again. Where will you send me next?

***

I'm hoping you can take the role of the hypnotist, and perhaps other characters that you introduce by sending me off to relive Chloe's naughtiest experiences through her body and mind. You're sort of a GM, setting up the scene and the behavior of other characters.

I'll be playing as her, or rather as myself living through her, like the above! You could land me in the middle of another one of her solitary fantasies, or perhaps the intense, sexual build up, where she's being seduced, or doing the seducing. Or maybe just as her bra hits the ground? Or as she puts her ass in the air?

I don't like extreme stuff, like scat, piss, vomit, excessive violence, but I'm otherwise pretty flexible."
6iw3af,1,2017-06-22,Is there such thing as ''too many exams''?,razorbilly7,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6iw3af/is_there_such_thing_as_too_many_exams/,"I graduated few months ago with an Internship and a poor GPA (around 2.95), 2 exams and I just passed MFE last sitting so 3 exams now. I applied to many places since I finished school. I got an Interview at a big company but was turned down few days later but they offered me another opportunity which does not support exams, Interviewed and still got rejected. Few weeks later another interview at another company not actuarial, I got rejected too after they asked me if I had actuarial exams and why I didnt put them in my resume . One of the interviewer was an FSA and I am pretty sure he thinks I want the job for the experience. I don't know what I'm doing wrong here, I am pretty confident at the interview, I answer the questions correctly but get turned down pretty easily.
My question is, should I keep doing exams while I try to find work? I think that 3 exams is good for getting a job. I don't want to do them and be told that you have no experience but 5 exams etc.

What should I do?

6iwfd3,3,2017-06-22,Me [29 M] wants to move but my wife [25F] doesn't. (Long),notfanothin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6iwfd3/me_29_m_wants_to_move_but_my_wife_25f_doesnt_long/,"Throwaway because sometimes we share a computer, and I usually leave reddit open in a browser.

My wife and I have been married almost a year. So far it's been more good than bad, but we have had our share of rough times this past year. We have chalked that up to mostly other peoples assurance of that's just how the first year of marriage is, as well as the fact we are both in school full time and working part time.

For the background: My wife and I met about 4 years ago while working together. I ended up packing up everything I owned and moving to a remote part of the country, as I had been itching to get away from my hometown. My sisters have traveled and lived all around, and the furthest I had been was a few states over to visit family. Long story short I hated the new location and transferred back to my hometown, with the plans to get my shit together and pick a new city to adventure to. That's when my now wife and I began hanging out. She was actually really excited when I came back, which caught me off guard because we weren't close before then. But we started hanging out together often with a few other people from work, and then eventually, ya know. Our relationship was great once it started. I had been open from the get go though that I still hate this city and intend to move. By the time my lease expired we had been together about 7 months or so, and me still wanting to move was something we avoided talking about, but eventually did. She said she wasn't ready, and that I have to do what is best for me. Even though I was ready to get out to a new city, I wasn't ready to move across country with a girl I'd been with for 6 or 7 months. So I stayed. I wanted to see where our relationship went. I signed another lease  and about halfway through that, when it became clear we were both madly in love, and it would be a forever type thing, I started talking about the possibility of us moving again.We weren't in school yet and just both working in a restaurant, but that restaurant chain is nationwide and has an easy transfer policy. I wanted to transfer to somewhere in Cali, Pittsburgh, San Antonio, whatever. When I get bored my escapism sets in and I just research and learn things about various cities. She just let me plan away, getting sorta quiet when I would talk about it. As it got closer and closer she eventually told me just how scared she was, saying that she didn't want to move, but if I insist, she will follow me anywhere. Looking back, that seems like such a BS thing to say, like she gets to say the move is a bad idea but 'hey I'm down I'll do anything for you', only to be in a position to say an 'I told you so' later on if the move didn't go super smooth. Somewhere along the line we decided we needed school too. With her extreme reluctance to move and my experience to know that ya don't always like a new city, I refused to move us across country and take full responsibility for her happiness, I made a deal with her that we would get our educations on and then move ASAP after school.

There's just one problem- this city is eating me alive. My anger is getting out of control, rents are rising, I hate the place I work now(even though I know it is just getting me through school, I don't think I can even last that long there), and I just overall hate the people in this city. We've(I) toyed with the idea of moving since then, but always pushed it aside due to that meaning we would have to pay out of state tuition or take a break in school, neither which we want to do. We actually are not speaking right now, as we are in the middle of a fight. I got fed up and started venting again about how much I hate this city when she said 'well come up with a couple different options and let me know and we'll talk about it'....If you only knew what a slap in the face that was-all I have done in the past is give her options. I am okay with living almost ANYWHERE but here. Here we are again with me wanting to move (I have found cheap out of state colleges that are comparable to our in-state college in quality. They are actually cheaper on tuition, but since we would be losing her state financial aid, our total costs would increase a bit.), but her not wanting to. And now we are not talking.

Why do I want to move so bad, right now? I'm turning 30 this year. I am too old to be putting my life on complete hold for another 2.5 years for us to finish school. I want to get new hobbies, make new friends, own property, etc....What's the point in any of this if this is just an extended countdown to moving? I can't put my life on hold another 1.5 years until we graduate. Say I do, then what? Grad school, well we will want in state tuition for that too right? Done with grad school, better make sure we get our internships converted to paid jobs or get otherwise recruited, we should work a year at our first post-college job, right? Oh look, we got pregnant, we should probably stay here until we have the baby right? You see what I'm getting at here, life happens and if we don't move now it may not happen, at least not while I consider myself young enough to go out and do the things I enjoy.

This along with a couple other things we have fought on and off about over this last year has me worried that we have some inherent differences between us and it will require more sacrifice and compromise than either of us anticipated to merge our future together.

Sorry this was so long but pleaaaase someone advise.

 **tl;dr**: Wife knew before we even started dating I didn't want to be in this city too long, have tried several times to get her to move and have always caved and said okay just X amount of time longer. I'm miserable. She knows it, and we're not talking."
6iwtjp,1,2017-06-22,SV/NSV Nearing my one year of weight loss,RoadToBeingBetter,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6iwtjp/svnsv_nearing_my_one_year_of_weight_loss/,"This post might be long so I apologize in advance. Haven't posted on here in a long time and it is about time I start again. 

http://imgur.com/gallery/tLlMD

Next week on the 27th will mark my one year of myfitnesspal. So far I have lost 61 pounds and holy shit it has been a journey. My weight loss started right as I got out of high school. I would eat two 8 serving bags of chips along with a 2 liter soda and a 64 ounce a day. Once I graduated from high school I moved in with my aunt and started by cutting out soda and chips for a few weeks then I finally started to use MyFitnessPal last summer I lost 25 pounds and once college started, I didn't track my weight as much. I still ate less than I was but just not tracking it. I weighed myself twice at the gym and those are those long lines in the graph. Then in March is when I really started picking it back up and finally saying I was on a diet. I started going to the gym more and since then I haven't been seeing the scale move, but I have been gaining a lot of muscle and losing fat!

Around march is also when I started going to therapy because of a bad trip I had on acid. Every bad memory that happened to me seemed to occur again and I realized where I was mentally was much lower than I thought. I had a low self esteem and a way I started to fix this was by going to the gym a bunch. At first it sucked going and I sometimes would feel sore for a week after and not be able to move my arms much. I got to the point at the end of my first year where for 4 weeks straight, I was going to the gym 6 times a week and was feeling really good. Combining that with therapy and I was set. I was running 2.5 miles (up from 30-45 seconds last year) when I got shin splints and wasn't able to run :( And I took this as an excuse to not go to the gym much when school ended which I am not regretting. 

Then two weeks later of relaxing after a stressful year of college, I started working at the same place I worked the year before. And this place gave me back pains last summer and this was something that I forgot this time around. When I first showed up everyone was congratulating me on my weight loss and for the first week, I felt really good. I couldn't really see my weight loss much before then but after that, I am really starting to see it now (the only beneficial part of this job). And this job is a crappy factory job where 90% of the employees are Hispanic and 40. I am white, and the only other white people were the upper management family who owned the company. This job was horrible and everyone their hated it. And while I was working there I didn't have the energy to go to the gym much or watch what I ate. I was stuck at the same weight since I started working there and I felt horrible every day. And this past Tuesday (Thursday today), on the bus ride over I felt horrible and actually threw up while walking to work. I decided that if at the first break after 2 hours I still felt bad I would go home sick. Two hours passed and I felt worst so I went home. On the bus ride back I thought long about quitting and all of the pros and cons of working. I had 11 cons, and one pro of $$$. And since quitting two days ago I already lost 4 pounds when for the past 3.5 weeks I was stuck between a 2 pound range. Since quitting I have been making sure to eat healthily, work out, and most importantly meditate!!!

If you already aren't meditating you need to start now. I started by finding guided ones on youtube for 10 minutes and it feels so good once you finish it. It is a time just to clear your mind and it helps with just making sure you are better every day. And when I was working I didn't have much free time and I mistakenly took meditation off my important list. Since starting again I just feel so much better and can truly see the impact it can make. I used to think meditation was stupid and only for hippies (yes, this is what I thought...) but it really isn't. If you have never tried it just try it for one week doing it everyother day and you will see the difference. Just go into it expecting nothing, and you will feel so much better after it. 

So, I still need a job though. Luckily from these past few weeks of working I have enough money for rent, the gym, and my phone for the summer until I get financial aid next semester. So if for some reason I don't get a job, I can survive. But I do want to find a job to work at and instead for something with computers. I've had two internships with computer companies and they have been a lot of fun to do (also majoring in computer science). I need to find a job that makes me happy so that I can still better myself. 

Let's wrap this up. This past year I have changed in ways I never thought I could. I lost 1/6th of my body weight, am no longer 60 pounds obese, and 20 pounds of the way to my goal weight. I still have a lot of muscle I need to gain, and a lot of fat also. I'm hoping that by the time I make a 2-year post next week, I can look back and see all of the changes I made and be proud of them. Thanks for reading if you still are! This sub is great and I am glad that I was able to find it when I did. Really helped me. And I also want to thank u/Shibana. A few months back I saw his post on his weight loss journey and this made me restart mine up. I remember messaging him saying how his story inspired me to start losing weight again and I feel I owe part of this to you! Good luck to everyone else in your weight loss journey. No matter how many times you stop, you can always continue again. I've had 4 or 5 breaks of weight loss and the breaks do help. Make sure you don't push yourself too hard to the point where you don't want to lose weight.

6ixg2i,1,2017-06-22,Terrie the Montana Cowgirl (and my boss) - a MILF seduction fantasy,Fiftyandclueless,TheEroticStory,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEroticStory/comments/6ixg2i/terrie_the_montana_cowgirl_and_my_boss_a_milf/,"I stumbled on the internship at a pickup softball game one June evening.  I had been back home from college for two weeks, and feeling pressure from my parents, whose couch I was occupying, to get a job.  Lo and behold, my friend Harvey told me that the office across the half from his was looking for a file clerk/intern.  He winked and told me there was a super hot lady running the office, and I better watch out to not get a constant boner.  I figured Harvey was just being a douche canoe with that remark, and he kind of was, but nonetheless, the next day I walked into the office of Frame Mechanic and Utility LLC with a resume.  

I was startled when a tall, slender and very busty woman stood up and met me at the door.  She was in jeans and sexy cowboy boots, with a shapely blue knit shirt that emphasized her slender waist and two huge, high breasts, held in place, obviously, by a heavy bra.  She had dark brown hair, tanned skin, a pert nose, and flashing blue eyes.  She seemed friendly, but not overly so.  

I introduced myself and told her I was interested in the internship.  She took a moment to glance at my resume, then looked up, grinned. and told me that the files where getting out of control, and they needed someone soon, and when could I start?  “Um, now?” I said.  “Great,” she said.  “You’re hired.  My name is Terrie, and I’ll be supervising you.”

She reached out and shook my hand, and her touch was cool, almost electric.   Terrie took me back into the office and waved an arm at a table full of paper files.  “Let me show you what we need,” she said.  “If you can get started, I’ll figure out the paperwork we need you to sign. Any questions?”

“Does this job pay?” I asked.  Terrie laughed.  “Yes. Eight bucks fifty an hour.  That okay with you?”  I nodded, pleased.  I dug in and began work.  It was the middle of next week before I had actually caught the filing up.  Additionally, I had some small research and running around tasks each day.  Terrie kept me busy, and it was almost like I was becoming her assistant.

Each day she would be in jeans and cowboy boots, and wear a different shirt.  However, they were all tight and showed off her amazing tits, and she didn’t seem to mind that her nipples were never fully locked down by her bra.  The points on her tits were almost always showing through her cloth.  I tried not to stare at her body, but that was unsuccessful, especially when she was sitting on the other side of the room, working at her desk, and there was no way those tits would not be popping out sideways, or visible from behind, shaking a little as she wrote.  I think more than once she caught me looking, but I’m fairly certain she was used to men not looking into her eyes.

I discovered that Terrie was a western girl, a transplant from Montana.  Her story slowly came out in conversations over the first few weeks.  She moved here from her home state with her husband, who was now her ex-husband because he had cheated on her and then left her for her best friend.  She confided one day in the middle of a conversation that she had “trust” issues.  I figured she was 35 years old, which was more than a decade older than me.  She had no children, and had a double degree in office management and accounting.  I am certain our relationship would have stayed boss/worker forever, if not for one particularly hot summer afternoon.

It was Friday, and a slow one.  We had everything done by about two o’clock.  There was nothing on the calendar.  I saw her at her desk doing a crossword puzzle.  Finally she set it aside and looked up at me. “Fuck it,” Terrie said.  “I’m not staying in this office on a sunny Friday with nothing to do.  Do you drink beer?”

I looked up in shock. “Um, yes, some.” I said. “I’m only twenty though.  Sorry.”

She nodded. “Well, I’m not going to sit in a bar alone.  Come on, lets go.”  I followed her out as she locked up the door.  “Leave your car here if you want, and come with me.” Terrie directed.  “Sure, that would be fun,” I said, and climbed into the passenger seat, a little self-consciously.

“Jay, you are a nice boy.” 	Terrie said.  I looked over at her. “Can we get one thing out of the way?” I nodded, a little confused.

“Lean closer to me.  There.”  Her face was about three inches from mine.  She was just incredibly beautiful, her eyes deep sapphire blue, her skin so smooth and creamy.  “I have very nice eyes.  I also have lovely curly hair.  Its one way to keep your eyes off my tits, if they make you uncomfortable.  Focus on my hair, eyes and face.” 

“I’m sorry,” I muttered, embarrassed.  “I didn’t mean to stare at the office.”

She giggled as she started the car. “You couldn’t take your eyes off them.  I have half a mind to just find a quiet place and lift my shirt so you can see them and get it out of your system.”  We pulled out, and started driving.

“You have a girlfriend?” she asked.  “Nope,” I told her.  “I dated a couple of girls at college, but nothing stuck yet.  I’m really looking forward to getting back to school this fall.”

“And away from the old woman in the office with the embarrassing huge titties?” she asked quizzically.

“Oh no,” I said quickly. “That’s not what I meant.  I just miss a lot of my friends.  You don’t seem old to me, and you are definitely much sexier than the girls I hang around with.”

Terrie pulled into the parking lot of a liquor store.  “I’ll be right back, “ she said, even leaving her car running with me in it.   She returned two minutes later with a 12 pack of Coors Light, and tossed it into the back seat.  “Hope that works for you, dear,” she said, nodding back at the silver cardboard box.  I nodded. “I like it.”  The truth was that I didn’t know much about beer and hadn’t really had much of it in my life.

“Cool beans,” she smiled at me, and winked. We drove to her townhouse, about ten minutes away.  She asked me about my dates with the girls my age, and I told her about them, in quite a bit of detail.  “Any of them have tits like these?” she asked at once point, thrusting out her chest and looking down at herself.  I shook my head.  “Not even close.”
“Any of your gals able to lick her own nipples?”   I coughed a little.  “I don’t know. I never asked.  Probably not.”  

“Well I can,” said Terrie.  “And if you get me drunk I’ll probably show you.”

The two of us kept up a fun banter as we walked into her house, which was messy, very much not like her workplace.  She took a minute and scooped out some cat food for a small black cat, and then she joined me in the living room, sitting beside me.  Terrie drank her first beer in one long sustained gulp, and slammed the bottle down on the coffee table.  “I can’t do it like that,” I told her.

“No need,” she said.  “I just want to get a little buzz going quickly.  I’ll slow down after two.” Then she guzzled another beer.  This time it dripped a little down her face and made a spot on her shirt, on top of her prominent right breast. “Oops,” she grinned.  Then she bent her face down and a long tongue snaked out of her mouth and licked up the drop of beer.  “Wow,” I said.  “That’s fucking hot!”

I suddenly clamped up, embarrassed at my outburst, but Terrie seemed to relish my praise. “Watch this,” she said, and without further ado, pulled her shirt over her head.  Her pendulous tits were jutting out, held by a large pink bra.  She reached behind her and unsnapped the bra, and pulled it off, and those monster titties of hers bounced free. Terrie’s nipples were also huge, dark red round circles of swollen flesh, capped with points that might have been an inch long.  Terrie looked over at me and then lifted a tit up to her mouth, and began sucking her own nipple.  My jaw dropped. I had never seen anything like it.

After a second, she stopped and giggled.  “Its cause my tits are so big, but also because I have a really long tongue.  Come here.”  I leaned forward, and her face touched mine, our mouths and lips opening, and then I felt her thrusting that hot, moist, long fleshy tongue into my mouth.  It flickered against my tongue and teeth.  I felt my hands travelling up and playing with what felt like ten pounds of titflesh, and felt and heard her moan a little as my fingers squeezed her nipples.

My cock was uncomfortably poking against Terrie’s blue jean hips, and as I played with her tits, her fingers were working at my zipper.  She broke the kiss and leaned back.  “I’ve got bad news for you, sweetie,” she said, her eyes on mine, her breasts still heaving with her heavy breathing. 

“Oh, its ok,” I said. “I am so sorry that I….”

“Oh fuck that,” she said.  “The bad news is that I am on my period right now, so we aren’t going to fuck.  The good news is that I am about to show you how I can wrap my tongue almost around the shaft of a cock.”

And with those words still hot in my ears, Terrie, the transplanted Montana cowgirl, my co-worker and boss, a woman twelve years my senior, pulled my cock out of my pants,  and descended upon it, and in her moist, wet mouth, I completely forgot about those marvelous tits of hers.

*Rikido Sato vs Izuku Midoriya
   both specialized in close combat, both quirks augment strength, it  
   it will help to show off how strong both have become and overall 
   I think it will be a cool fight.

*Ochaco Uraraka vs Tsuyu Asui
   Both being doing their internship with Ryukyu thus gaining 
   strength and battle experience plus probably strengthening their 
   quirks would be a great fight, also by knowing each other strategy  
   and weakness will force them to try new things during their battle.

*Fumikage Tokoyami vs Eijiro Kirishima
  Tokoyami quirk being really powerfull and kirishima 
  probably getting a power up in these next chapters will make a 
  fantastic fight tokayami using Black Ankh vs kirishima Red Riot 
  Unbreakable is something i would like to see.

*Neito Monoma vs Katsuki Bakugo
  Both having difficult personalities and after what happened in 
  the sports festival would be cool to see a fight both having become 
  stonger and Monoma using Bakugo quirks againts him again plus
   Tetsutetsu quirk and any other quirk he can gets his hands on will 
  make a great fight."

(I hope I don't come off as an asshole in my story).
At my last job I had my Birth Certificate and SSN Card together and misplaced it. Never to be found again.  So I'm stuck in a little bit of a predicament because my internship is in one state, my dad lives in another, and my mom was the catalyst to my ranty-to-do list.  I'm trying to hold myself accountable to these things, but I'd really appreciate it if someone could maybe hold me accountable as well.  I just got pushed over the edge and went and typed up just about every possible feeling I was having at the time, every nag ""you need to do this"" ""make sure you do that"".... I mean, sure, I fucked up and got fired, but life goes on, and I appreciate you're ""encouragement"", but it's so much easier for you to say something for me to do than for you to do it, and you know it Mom. (sorry, just going into the character I suppose, a telemarketer called me and just pushed my last button after I had actually calmed down)
I went off and listed nearly everything I could think of that I needed to do, and it's just so overwhelming to me.  I know I'll get it done, but I always put myself in situations of nasty rooms, short timeframes, and ""procrastination"" as my mom calls it (i found out I was moving today and she wanted me all packed up by now..)
So I ended up ranting in a message to her but in the long run it turned out to be a very nice ""to do"" list. (With hopefully a happy-ish ending)

So, my list begins here:

I need to go to the dentist

I need to get new glasses and new contacts

I need to quit fucking up and wake up on time

I need to make it to where I say I'm going to be on time

I need to get my social security card

I need to make sure my identity wasn't stolen and that's why I was locked out (website wouldn't let me request another one, long story)

I need to order my birth certificate

I need to make my bed

I need to finish my laundry

I need to fold all my fucking clothes and pack them in the vaccuum bags I bought so they'll fit nice and snug

I need to look for more jobs

I need to stop worrying so much about money because in the end it's truly the root of all evil. nothing good comes from it

I need to pack all of my stuff into my car

I need to fix the check engine light on my car even though it's apparently nothing huge, a P0408 in an Acura

I need to change my oil soon.

I need to make sure all my forms are sent to Dad's address i suppose and find a job out there somewhere

I need to just unwind and stop compartmentalizing every single fucking thing into a box that makes it seem like it's a huge deal

I need to probably take a nap but I'm only halfway tired

I need to actually come up with a hobby I can do, like fixing cars or get a motorcycle

I need to quit worrying about money because at this rate the interest on any loans I have is roughly the same as the inflation rate

There, is that good enough of a to do list?

And last of all I need to be thankful for the life that God's given and blessed me with

Do you see why I feel like I'm constantly overwhelmed? I don't forget anything at all, I just put it off knowing that even if I try, it's not going to be good enough

Mom:One step at s time,  as you make progress, you'll feel better.  Procrastinating just makes it worse.  And you are always good enough!  You are loved by God and your family!


**So** now I just need help with breaking through my bad habits, my panic attacks about my situation right now and....

I really do need to get all this shit taken care of."
6iy9y7,4,2017-06-22,Am I racist?,iwearliquidliner,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6iy9y7/am_i_racist/,"Ok, I need some serious advice. I'd really like to hear some other people's input on this. I've never had an issue with black people until recently. Or maybe just black girls. I don't know. I know that just sounds horrible, but hear me out. I've had multiple black friends in my life and these relationships all have had very unique outcomes.

As a junior in high school, I met black girl named Breanna and she became one of my close friends. We were in marching band together. I always thought she was really funny and she had a sarcastic attitude which was fun to be around at first. As I got to know her better though, I started realizing she was becoming a huge drain on me emotionally. She was overweight, and she was extremely self-conscious about it. I tried to reassure her all the time that her weight didn't matter and she was beautiful the way she was. But she just always reeked of un-confidence, no matter what I said or did. She never joined our friend group in the pool because she was worried about people seeing her in a bathing suit. She also was worried that people would judge her for not being able to swim and that her hair would get messed up. One day we went to the store and as I was getting out of the car she said, ""OP, wait, don't get out of the car yet."" And I said ""what, why?"". She said, ""There's a white family right next to us."" I said, ""uh... is that a problem?"" She said, ""They'll see me."" I said, ""Why does it matter if they see you?"" She said, ""Because I'm black."" I couldn't believe she was afraid of getting out of the freaking car because she was black and she didn't want a white family seeing her. I cant imagine the level of insecurities she had for her to be afraid to get out of the damn car because of her race. My heart broke for her. We had so many come to Jesus talks about self-love, not caring what people think and just being yourself, but nothing I ever did helped her. I tried for 2 years to help her. It got to a point where with the combination of her crippling insecurities and her horribly negative sarcastic attitude, that I could not be around her anymore. It was so emotionally draining for me and I just didn't know what else to do. 

When I was in eighth grade, I met a girl in my lit class named Kayla. She is black. Her and I became great friends very fast. She was super into reading fantasy novels and drawing cool characters just like me. We bonded over art and making fun of our lit teacher. She truly was a great friend. We never got to hang out outside of school unfortunately because her mom was extremely overprotective and essentially wouldn't let her leave her house. We didn't really get to actually hang out until like sophomore year of high school. We kinda phased in and out of friendship up until then (guy/friend drama, etc.), but when we were tight like we used to be her mom finally started easing up on her and letting her leave her house to hang out with people (with extremely strict curfews). We really got close when her mom started letting her leave, and it was awesome. When we got to college, we couldn't see each other that much because we went to different schools and she didn't have any source of transportation (her mom STILL wouldn't let her drive). We drifted a little, but I made an effort to come drive to her college about once a month to sleepover, hang out and catch up. For a while it was cool and everything was fine. Now, Kayla had always been a very active equal rights activist for black people, ever since I met her. In fact I very much admired her for that. She is one of the smartest people I've ever met and she used her knowledge to spread awareness about egalitarianism, racial profiling, etc. Well, when we got to college, she became extremely active in the black activist movement. You know, black lives matter, stuff like that. I thought it was really cool of her and I was proud of her. Well, I slowly started to notice that she started becoming very bitter towards white people. Every time I'd come see her she would have multiple rants about how white people annoy her and how they are trash. I didn't say anything to disagree with her regardless of the fact that I'm white, because I mean I just felt bad. What she was saying wasn't completely false but she was just adding so much extra hate than there really needed to be. One day I was with her at her college and we were watching one of those rom-coms with an all white cast, and throughout the entire movie she was making comments about how ""white"" the people were and they were acting so ""white"". She would say, ""God, white people are so fucking annoying."" or ""That's such a white people thing to do."" I did not mean anything hurtful at all by saying this, but I was irritated after hearing her make those comments and so I said, ""Kayla, you're being awfully racist for someone who's so against racism."" As soon as I said that, she got extremely quiet and extremely passive aggressive towards me. I didn't really know what else to say, and the quietness got really awkward, so I just left. We have not been in touch since then. I don't think either of us really know what to say. 

And finally, most recently. My first roommate in college was a black girl named Ciara. We get along great and like Breanna, she had a fierce attitude. It was fun to be around at times. She was super spunky and knew what she wanted, which I really liked about her. However, sometimes it was the bane of my existence. But I always tried to look past her really horrible attitude, even though sometimes I felt like I was talking to a 5 year old. We were roommates for two years, and we developed a close friend group during that time. Sometimes I found that I needed to take a mental break from being around her attitude so much, since we lived together. Either way, she was mostly fun to be around in moderation, and she quickly became one of my best friends. Towards the end of last year, we got some new people in our friend group. They were black girls like Ciara. I didn't care that they were black, I was just happy to have more people to hang out with. For a while everything good and fun. Slowly I started to hear some similar stuff to things Kayla had been saying. Saying things like, oh my gosh that's so white, damn she acting white af, etc. One time we went to go see the movie Get Out, a racially charged movie about a black guy who escapes some racist white people trying to brainwash him into being a servant or something. At the end, the black guy escapes and all the white people die or something, I can't really remember. Ciara and the rest of our friends looked over at me (I was the only white person there) and said, ""So, OP, how does it feel?"" I literally didn't know what to say. I just kinda laughed and didn't say anything. Like what was I supposed to say to that? Afterwards we went to get that fancy rolled ice cream at an ice cream shop nearby. I was looking at the flavors and saw they had matcha flavor, and I said, ""Ooh they have matcha! I wanna try that!"" And one of our friends said ""Oh my god OP, that is so white of you."" At this point I was getting really irritated again, but didn't say anything. After that they continued to make these kinds of comments (i.e.: white people are so annoying; haha look how white she's being, etc.) for the next couple of weeks, until finally I just decided I was sick of it, and I stopped hanging out with them. 

Since then, I haven't spoken with them much, and I'm focusing on finding new friends and doing things I like to do without worrying about if it's too ""white"" or not. So here's where my concern is. I recently was given an opportunity to work as an intern at a company where the pay is good and I get to work with girls my age. Expect there's one thing. All the interns are black. I know this because my dad works for the company and he is actually the one who gave me the opportunity; he told me they're all black. And I'm not going to lie, that honestly makes me extremely nervous. I am seriously considering turning down this offer because I don't want to be around black girls. Not because I have an issue with the fact they're black, but because I'm white...  I feel like shit for turning down an internship solely because of race. But I don't want to be in a position where I go to work everyday wishing I wasn't white. Or that I wasn't around black people. Or both. Does this make me racist? "

Prior to this, I also worked another internship for about 45-50 hours a week for 20 weeks. I have never felt so drained in my life. Not complaining at all because once I start full time, it'll be worse especially since I will be salaried.

6iyfdv,55,2017-06-22,Hairball teaches me all about sex,lowsodiumcrackers,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6iyfdv/hairball_teaches_me_all_about_sex/,"I was reminded of this by /u/supermonkeyfanclub ’s post. 

Hairball has always been very weird about sex. I've learned a lot from her over the years. /s

Hairball and FIL were “Christmas Catholics” for most of DH’s childhood. I’m not even sure if DH and his younger brother were baptized as babies. That changed when DH was on the edge of puberty. Probably right around the time DH’s voice started changing, Hairball morphed into a Super Catholic. Suddenly, they were at church ALL THE TIME. Due to this newfound interest in Catholicism, Hairball decided that DH and BIL (they are only 1 year apart in age; DH is older) would not take sex ed during junior high. I asked DH if his parents gave him any information about sex as a substitute for the school curriculum that he missed. Predictably, they did not…except to say, “Don’t have sex until you’re married. It’s a sin.”  

And that's how I learned that DH and I are big-time sinners.

Hairball claims that she kept her sons out of sex ed because Hilary Clinton changed the public school curriculum of the 1990s to include endorsements of gay sex. Hairball didn’t want her boys exposed to that kind of blasphemy.

And that's how I learned that when I tool public school sex ed in the 1990s, my teacher apparently skipped over a lot of juicy homosexual details!

Speaking of gay sex…when DH hadn’t been dating long, I was watching TV at Hairball’s house. I turned on MTV’s The Real World. It was one of the earlier seasons, back when MTV was trying to make a positive social statement, not just show attractive young people getting drunk. One of the housemates on the show was gay. Hairball said to me, “You know, I’m pretty sure that even if one of my sons were gay, I’d still love him.”  (Both DH and BIL are straight.) 

That’s how I learned that Hairball is a huge homophobe, and fears the Devil Penis Magic maybe even more than the DVM. 

Hairball seems to be under the illusion that I deflowered her poor baaabbbyyyy. I don’t know why she has this idea. I was barely 18 when I started dating DH. He was 21, and his previous girlfriend was 24…and she sported a tongue ring. 

That's how I learned that even though I believed I was virgin when I met DH, I was wrong. I was already a dirty temptress. 

The first time I stayed with DH at Hairball’s house, I asked DH where I should sleep. I would have been fine staying on the couch if us sharing a room was not cool with Hairball and FIL. DH told me it was no big deal, I could stay in his room. I assumed this was the setup he had with his previous girlfriend. I found out several months later, from BIL, that neither of the boys’ girlfriends had ever shared their rooms. Hairball had been very upset about me sleeping in DH’s room, and had cried to BIL about it. But she wasn’t upset with DH - oh no, she was mad at ME.

That's how I learned that 18-year-old virgin me had orchestrated a wild sex-capade in her sweet, innocent little boy’s childhood bedroom while Hairball slept across the hall. (You'd think I'd remember that...)

About a year later (after I had finally given up the goods to DH), DH and I spent a weekend at his parents’ house while they were out of town. He was away from school on an internship, so it was sort of a half-way meeting place for us. Because we had the place to ourselves, and we were in a long-distance relationship, some sexytimes were had. We must have dropped a (unopened/unused) condom behind the bed or something. The next time we visited, Hairball made up the bed for us, and left the condom sitting right in the middle of the nicely fluffed pillows. DH saw it before I did and put the condom away. Hairball never said a word about it, but I can only imagine her CBF when she found it!

That's how I learned that safe sex was actually more dangerous when Hairball might find out about it.  

Several years later, I was driving to the grocery store with FIL and Hairball. DH was not with us. Out of nowhere, Hairball said to me, ""You had better not be doing any of that sex texting. I heard on the news that all you kids are doing it. It's very bad!"" I asked her who exactly she thought I would be sexting, seeing as how I had been married to her son for years. She just made a noise, like ""hmmpphh."" 

And that how I learned that I'm not a faithful wife. I'm a dirty, sexting-addict slut. "

## [“The Busboy”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Busboy)
Production code: **203**

Episode no.: **S02E12**

&amp;nbsp;

Here we have the third episode written/produced for season 2 but the final episode to air in that season. According to lore, NBC wasn’t particularly fond of this episode because of Jerry’s minor role taking a backseat to Jason and Michael’s characters, so the execs made a decision to push this back in the broadcast order. But because this project is proceeding by production date, it comes in here.

6iyosz,0,2017-06-22,Recovering from busy season internship,redditor1126,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6iyosz/recovering_from_busy_season_internship/,"When I interned at PWC I worked an upward of 85 hours a week for the last couple of weeks. Although I averaged 75 hours a week for the entire internship. At the end of the internship I was so tired that I lay in bed for about 4-5 days until my exit interview just to catch up on sleep. Prior to this, I also worked another internship for about 45-50 hours a week for 20 weeks. I have never felt so drained in my life. Not complaining at all because once I start full time, it'll be worse especially since I will be salaried. I remember going to sleep immediately after my last internship to ensure that I was well rested for PWC knowing how stressful it was going to be. Has anyone else felt so exhausted after their Big 4 internship? Did you catch up on sleep? If so, how long did it take?!"

6iz71k,12,2017-06-23,Any tips on paying for college?,Sadmanslumps,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/6iz71k/any_tips_on_paying_for_college/,"I'm sick of the unbearable control my parents have on my life. It's to the point of daily arguments and me feeling like I'm to blame for every action I take. In light of all of this, I've decided to cut ties with my parents next semester after this summer break. I've just completed my first year as a computer science major,and I've managed to aquire an internship at a tech company. The money I get from this should allow me to sustain myself for a whole two semesters. This is much welcomed news for my grand plan, which is to achieve total independence. However, this will only work for the coming school year because I've received financial aid due to my parents signing FAFSA documents. If I've cut ties with my parents, I could live comfortably for my sophomore year, but I will have to think of a plan for junior and senior year because my parents won't be in the picture to sign those documents. How should I plan ahead moving forward? I hope to aquire another internship next summer to keep me from being homeless, as well as having a job during the school year to save up. Anyone have any other suggestions?

6izhmg,5,2017-06-23,Good times eventually end,captainkerrfluffle,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6izhmg/good_times_eventually_end/,"For the last month or so I thought I was doing ok. Still depressed, but functional. I went to my internship, I talked to friends, I went outside, I was even sleeping better than i usually do (which is 12-2 instead of not sleeping at all but still) and suddenly it all went away. I can't  sleep at night and end up sleeping all day, I cant get out of bed, I quit my internship, I've been trying to clean the house for a week and I just can't seem to do more than a tiny bit and the dishes have been piling up and I just can't do them. I haven't left the house hell I haven't even had a shower in a week. And I'm fantasizing about dying again which isn't good. I just hate how every time I feel better and I start doing ok and getting things done I just end up fucking them up because I can't keep my depression away. Why bother trying if I can't keep it up right?"

The processes are quite lengthy as they involve online application and questionnaires and then an online test, a phone interview, a video interview, and then a final interview if you pass all the previous steps. 

I've gotten through to the final interview twice with two different companies. The first one I thought went meh so I got rejected there, I was sad but I moved on and tried to see where I could improve. 2 weeks ago I got invited to another final interview and this time I improved upon my first final interview and thought it went superb. However I just found out yesterday they rejected me as well. I know I'll be expecting more rejections in the future, but as a young person that tried and improved myself when I failed, only to fail again has been really disappointing. "
6izia6,3,2017-06-23,I [20F] am an intern and have a crush on my mentor at work [30M],confusedgirlatwork,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6izia6/i_20f_am_an_intern_and_have_a_crush_on_my_mentor/,"I've been interning at a biotech firm for a few weeks now, and I work really closely with my mentor - we interact all the time, every day. I wasn't physically attracted to him initially, but after getting to know him better, I started to become really fond of his personality. He's very knowledgeable, but is also humble, funny, and unassuming. He's pretty popular at work and is always helping others or socializing with coworkers (our workplace is 90% male).

Having feelings for him makes it difficult to work sometimes. We're in close proximity in the lab, and I definitely feel kind of turned on at least semi-regularly. (It doesn't help that he wears this amazing deodorant/cologne and it wafts over to me all the time). I haven't flirted with him at all because I don't think that would be seen as appropriate in the workplace.

Part of me really wants to, though, and I'm afraid I'll do something stupid if we go to an after-work event together, especially if alcohol is involved. We're both single, and he isn't my boss (I have a manager as well). On the one hand, I know that the wise decision is to keep it strictly professional, which is what I've done so far. But on the other hand, I think that I might have a chance with him, and it's hard to like someone a lot and have to see them so often, and not act on it for an entire summer. I don't think I will be returning to this company in the future, but I want to leave a good impression and definitely not have things blow up while I'm still working there.

Basically, I need a pep talk or tips on how to survive the summer when I have a massive crush on a guy I work really closely with! Ugh, this makes work so much harder :( I know I should get rid of any thoughts of being with him, but I can't.

  **tl;dr**: I'm an intern and have a thing for my mentor, who's older. I have to see him all the time, and am really struggling with keeping things professional. Any advice?"
6j039p,1,2017-06-23,Do I have enough maths apply for a masters in computer science?,reddit_user193,cscareerquestion,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestion/comments/6j039p/do_i_have_enough_maths_apply_for_a_masters_in/,"Hi, I'm currently studying computer science (undergraduate, just finished sophomore year) at a top 5 UK university. I'm currently on the masters program so I have the option of continuing from my bachelors straight into a masters. I'm happy to take my masters here but I also want to apply to a few other universities (top 3 in U.K., ETH and then maybe some good ones in the US). I would be especially happy if I could get into ETH.

I currently wanting to do a masters in AI, possibly Computer Vision. I'm doing an internship currently this summer involving AI and have done a semester of undergraduate research involving computer vision recognition libraries. I will be (hopefully) doing assistant research with HCI and machine learning in the year coming with a researcher who is at very top of the HCI field. I also have been completely projects in my own time including an image classifier, a tv script generator and language translator. I'll be trying to continue these types of projects in the future. My gpa for last year was 3.9 although our grades don't go towards our degree until 3rd and 4th year.

The only thing I'm concerned about is that I only took one maths module and can no longer take anymore due not having a joint major in maths. I took further maths A-Level (http://www.rewardinglearning.org.uk/microsites/mathematics/gce/specification/index.asp) and then took one maths module in university.the description for that module is as follows:

""This module is designed to introduce students to the ideas, methods and techniques which they will need for applying mathematics in the physical sciences or for taking the study of mathematics further. It aims to extend and enhance their skills in algebraic manipulation and in differential and integral calculus, to develop their geometric insight and their understanding of limiting processes, and to introduce them to complex numbers and matrices.""

When I look up masters applications on Reddit and online I see sometimes you need to have done maths. Have I done enough maths? I'm pretty sure in ETH if you haven't got knowledge in a certain area you can like 2 modules to catch up when you do the masters. Are other universities like this or am I a little fucked? Anything free online courses that would allow me to achieve the maths requirements if I don't have them? Also what should I expect in the application process? I assume there are interviews? What sorts of questions will they ask?
Thank you!!"
6j0pd0,2,2017-06-23,"[Modern] Friday Night News Bloopers! Or, How Everyone At Work Learned The New Intern Had An 18-Inch Cock",Lv99Pervert,Lv99RoleplayPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lv99RoleplayPrompts/comments/6j0pd0/modern_friday_night_news_bloopers_or_how_everyone/,"It was the usual Friday afternoon. Half of the office starting to shut down, either literally or figuratively as productivity slowed to a near crawl. Lunches weighed on bellies or workplace friends speaking to each other out of their cubicles. The local Yes-Man trying to organize some lame-ass get-together than no one would show up for. Someone's spilled Skittles making a rainbow on the carpet for the janitor to vacuum up once the office closes for the night. 

The newest intern, Pyrrha, sat at a computer. A workplace project finished and already sent upstairs, along with some financial finagling he desperately hoped would get him an actual job rather than the half-assed internship's so-called salary he was getting. 

A window open on the desktop played flash games while he waited for 4-o'-Clock. Better known as the time he'd mow down half the people in the workplace to get to the elevator first. It was cute, considering he stood at 4-feet-7-inches tall, wore glasses and looked like a petite girl. He even walked, talked, sounded, and acted like one too. He all but wore women's clothing, and that was mostly because no one saw a panty line under the baggy pants he'd worn during his time there. 

""Yeah. I'm just going out drinking, though. Technically *just* hit 21 last night! There's still enough time to get me a present, y'know."" Joked the brunette. Using a pen to brush the dark red bangs that often covered his eyes as he spoke over the phone. The occasional giggle and tittering drawing a couple eyes. And for those, he'd shyly shrink further behind his desk. Speaking in hushed tones until the attention was off before letting up once more. ""D'aww, geez~ You're welcome to come, too! It's just this little bar we're going to! Called *VA-11 HALL-A*! Don't' ask me why it's named that. I think it's cute! Like, might dye my hair neon green cute!"" 

His conversation continued until the alarm on his phone beeped. A bit unprepared, he wasn't the *first* out of the room, but not one of the last. Forced to wade through the sea of bodies he'd been hoping to avoid with his 'first out' attitude. It was fine, though! The weekend was going to be fantastic! 

**...**

""This is Victoria Winthall with the CoC News. We're downtown, outside of a bar called Valhalla, where a crowd of college students protesting the lack of In&amp;Out Burger in the South, along with the lack of White Castle restaurants. You'd think they'd be likely to build more restaurants where snackfood-hungry college students could buy them."" 

The camera pans outward, focussing on the reporter and the crowd gathered behind her. There're a few dozen people, mostly young but a few in their later years. The timestamps at the corner of the screen superimposed from the camera feed shows it as 11:02. A blue-haired man steps out of the bar. Visibly intoxicated, he giggles as he weaves his way through the crowd. The red of his hair barely visible as he shoved his way through, reappearing behind the newscaster with a wide grin on his face. 

He turned toward the crowd, throwing his arms high above his head, shouting. ""I LOVE WHITE CASTLE!"" much to the crowd's agreement before facing the camera again. Moving both hands down, slipping one under the hem of his shirt and the other tugging off his pants. He flashed the camera as if it *wasn't* a dumb idea. His inhibitions let loose to show off the cute, black bikini top covering his chest, along with a similar bikini bottom. The latter unable to contain the massive cantaloupe-sized orbs of flesh along with a huge slab of flesh slapping hard against his thigh, long enough to hit his knee in its flaccid state, sloppy and wet with what must be saliva dripping off the alabaster pillar. 

He let it hang out for a moment, the newscaster unaware as he pulled his clothes back on. Giggling even more as he slipped out of frame without a word more, shouting more about his love of White Castle off the camera. ""This was Victoria Winthall with the CoC News."" 

Cold cut to a stunned News Cast, more than a couple jaws dropped and one drooling before being brought back with a few snaps of fingers off camera.

It was a little before noon that Monday when Pyrrha came back to work. Nursing an obvious hangover if the sunglasses and sound-canceling headphones he wore to his desk were of any notice. He even *looked* ragged, sipping from a water bottle as he sort of just laid at his desk for a while. Sitting up momentarily to keep up the appearance of being a hard worker, but otherwise, he was more than out of it. 

His only solace was the Chinese takeout he'd brought for lunch. Slurping cold noodles and munching on cold chicken, pork, beef, and whatever else was in the numerous boxes on his desk while he tried relaxing might've been the only thing keeping him alive. At least it looked like it, considering the weekend one could only imagine he'd had.

Okay, this is 255% shit. I apologize for even *letting* someone read this, let alone post it. Seriously, it must be total gobshite... I don't even know *what* I was thinking. 

It was inspired by watching those news blooper things, and you know those select few who flash or kiss the newscaster and stuff. Don'tcha just wonder what their day after was like after being an idiot on national television? 

Well, this is a sorta romanticized version of it. Like, he wasn;t immediately fired or something. Plus, y'know, having a romance spawn out of something so dumb would be kinda cute. &lt;3 

I wrote this at almost 7 in the morning, so I already know it's shit. XD. Don't worry, I know. 

But, y'know, it seemed silly and dumb and I felt like writing it. So, yeah. 

I dunno what else to say. So, here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/iQxf9jl.png) and Imma go sit in the corner and wonder what the hell is wrong with me. XD. 

Have an awesome day. See ya. &lt;3"

They liked me so much that they skipped the interview process, but there will be a background check. Now I'm not expecting to get the internship because I have three alcohol-related summary offenses on my record from when I was 19, 20, and 21, which were (2) disorderly conduct and (1) public intoxication. I'll be 24 next month and am working a program of sobriety, but I don't think that'll be enough to convince them that I'm fit to work for their firm. Unfortunately my state's laws prohibit me from expungement until 5 years after my last offense, so I'm kind of screwed.

Any advice for how to go about addressing this? Anyone here been through something similar? I'm planning on being honest and hoping for the best since that is pretty much the only thing I can do. I had a professor tell me he knows many people who lost their offers for as little as one non-traffic summary offense."

6j3euo,3,2017-06-23,Getting into IT auditing,bravisbrott,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6j3euo/getting_into_it_auditing/,"I'm a senior Business Analytics &amp; Information Systems and recently I've become fairly interesting in IT auditing through my current internship. I'm interning at a very large manufacturing company doing some web development and business intelligence (possibly some more technical IT projects as well). 

Anyways, there are presentations on the different departments of finance for the interns, to explain what they do, how it is, etc., and the auditing team went yesterday. It got me interested in IT auditing. I made it known that I was an IS major and I was interested in the position and they mentioned that I'd be perfect for the job. 

I'm more interested in having an IT career, but the idea of possibly having to do helpdesk in a call center for a year before getting a decent job makes me want to die. With auditing, I think I'd be able to get placed in a good position right out of college. I also have seen that some posts on here mentioned that you can exit into infosec (which I'm really interested in). 

I was planning on following up with one of them just to get my foot in the door and let them know I would be more than open to joining the team if they had an opening. A lot of interns here get hired for full-time, which is pretty reassuring as full-time, with one of them being part of the team now.

I guess what I'm asking is if it would be a good fit for me based on what I want to do with my life (and if there's anything I should know). Sorry if this is all over the place!

6j3gk2,86,2017-06-23,"Guy who saw Homecoming here. Alright, here's your spoilers post.",PrestoMovie,MarvelStudiosSpoilers,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/6j3gk2/guy_who_saw_homecoming_here_alright_heres_your/,"I'm the guy that made the post saying he saw Homecoming in /r/marvelstudios yesterday. 

You barbarians have been tearing my poor inbox a new one, so HERE'S YOUR DAMN SPOILER POST, YOU SAVAGES. 

- It's been revealed that Toomes has been running his operation since the battle of New York, once Damage Control comes in and shuts them down. They had already been working the site for a day or so before Damage Control shut them down and took their stuff. They start off with stuff they had from day one back at their warehouse that they didn't turn over. He's already Vulture before the modern day story starts and has been using his suit just to steal materials without getting caught. 
- Happy is appointed to be Peter's check-in guy, so he has to go through him to talk to Tony and Happy hates Peter. 
- Avengers Tower is being sold. Happy reveals that they sold it and are moving everything over to their new upstate facility in a few days. 
- Tony doesn't do any of the fighting. He really is not in the movie that much. Iron Man shows up twice, once to save Spider-Man after Vulture drops him into a river and he's trapped in his parachute (Tony isn't even in the suit, he's in India controlling it remotely), and then again at the Ferry scene. 
- Toomes uses alien tech that Tinkerer messed with to steal things. They have a cube thing that can separate into four smaller cubes, and when positioned on a flat surface, it creates a door, so it's like a phase shifted. This is how Toomes has been able to discretely steal stuff for years from Damage Control delivery trucks. The trucks don't know they're being robbed and see no evidence of it after the fact. 
- Peter gets trapped in one of these trucks while trying to stop the Vulture in DC, and when he breaks out of the crate, finds out he's in a huge concrete warehouse that's locked and devoid of personnel until morning. He uses this time to get acquainted with all of the features of his suit. Ned unlocked the training wheels protocol back in their hotel room. 
- Peter and Ned hold onto a glowing purple alien thing from a piece of a weapon that fell off during a chase scene. Peter finds out later that it's almost like a bomb and is activated with radiation. Ned has it in his backpack when he goes to the Washington Monument and the X-ray from the security screening sets it off, but it doesn't start to blow up until they're in the elevator. 
- Peter discovers it's a bomb while talking to the AI in his suit in the warehouse. He freaks out and uses an electrical panel, a graphing calculator plugged into it, and the AI in his suit (that he names Karen) to help override it. It takes him hours and is a good example of how smart he is. This causes him to miss their decathlon. 
- Yes, Toomes is Liz Allen's dad. Peter saw his face on the Ferry, and then is terrified the entire time he's picking up Liz for their Homecoming dance. 
- Toomes drives the two to their dance and asks Peter what his plans are for after high school, and Liz tells her dad he's got an internship with Stark And mentions that he knows Spider-Man. Toomes doesn't think much of it, but tells Peter he recognizes him from somewhere and says it's his voice. Peter brushes it off as him seeing him on Liz's decathlon team, then Liz starts talking about Peter not being there for their D.C. decathlon competition, or how he disappeared at her party. From there, Toomes connects the dots. He keeps Peter in the car once they get to the dance and tells him that since he saved Liz's life in DC, he's not going to hurt him, but if he interferes again, he threatens him and tells him to leave him alone. 
- Peter makes the tough choice to leave Liz at the dance to go fight Toomes before he leaves for his ""flight"" he says he has to catch. Peter leaves his spare suit (and the web Fluid he makes in chemistry class) underneath a thing of lockers at his school that only he can lift because of his strength. 
- Peter gets attacked by Shocker outside the school before he can get his webshooters on. Vulture sent him to make sure Peter didn't leave the dance. Ned ends up saving him by using his webshooter to hit Shocker. 
- Peter confronts Vulture at his warehouse, where Vulture monologues to distract him and get his brand new wings up and running, and he uses them to chase Peter and break the load-bearing columns in the building and brings the warehouse down on him. 
- Peter is trapped under the concrete rubble and manages to use his strength to lift himself out of it, like the classic shot from the comics of him doing the same thing. 
- Toomes is using his new wings to intercept the plane moving everything important out of Avengers Tower, including the Hulkbuster suit, a new prototype cap shield, and an asgardian belt that belonged to Thor. We also see the Mark 42 suit from IM3 and arc reactors in the plane. 
- The plane has retroflective panels, like the helicarrier, so the whole plan flight looks cool because the panels are freaking out and flickering the whole time. 
- The plane crashes near Coney Island and Happy sees it happen from Avengers Tower. 
- Toomes is fighting Peter and tries to make off with a crate of arc reactors when Peter notices that his wings are about to explode like the alien battery in D.C. Did. He tries to ground Vulture using his webs, saying he's trying to save him, but Vulture cuts his webline and doesn't make it far before the wings blow. Peter runs into the fire and pulls him out of the crash and he's alive. 
- happy arrives on the scene later with Damage Control and finds Toomes conscious and webbed up to the crate of the arc reactors, with a note saying something like ""Caught that Vulture looking guy,"" and signs it as Spider-Man
- Back at school, Liz reveals that her and her mom are moving to another state, saying that her dad didn't want them near during the trial
- Peter goes to a decathlon meeting. Liz was their former leader but since she's gone, they elect a new one and it's Michelle. She says her friends call her MJ. Someone makes a joke that she doesn't have any friends and she acknowledges that fact. 
- Happy meets Peter in the school bathroom and thanks him for what he did and said that he wouldn't be anything without his job. Happy tells Peter Tony wants to meet him upstate and he drives him to the Avengers facility. 
- Tony tells Peter he did a great job and he really proved himself. He walks him over to a giant container, revealing a brand new suit for him. It's very shiny and has mostly the same basic red and blue pattern, but with a lot of Iron Spider elements. There's a giant spider covering the whole torso that's blue with a gold outline. 
- Tony tells Peter that beyond the next door is a room full of reporters, and tells Peter to get the suit on because he's prepared to introduce him as the newest member of The Avengers and says after, Happy will show him to his new room. Peter thanks Tony for the offer, but tells him he'd prefer to stay close to the ground and be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Tony respects his decision and tells him that Happy will drive him home. As Peter walks away he asks Tony if it was a test and if there were really reporters. Tony says yes it  was and no there aren't. 
- After Peter leaves, Pepper Potts bursts through a door with press cameras going off in the next room and asks where he is. Tony says he left and that he can think of something better and Happy gives Tony a ring and says he's been holding onto it since 2008. Pepper tells him not to and Tony takes the ring from Happy as he follows her back into the press room. 
- Back at home, Peter calls for May, who doesn't answer, thinking she's not home. He sees a bad from Tony on his bed with his original Stark suit in it. He tries it on and takes his mask off with his back to the door. The door is open, and you can see May standing in the doorway watching Peter, who doesn't see her. She screams ""WHAT THE FU-"" before the credits start rolling. 

CREDITS: 
- the first shows Toomes being walked to his prison cell. He's approached by a guy with medical pins in his right arm, a scar on his face, and a scorpion tattoo on his neck. He asks Toomes if he knows who Spidey is, because he has some friends on the outside that want him dead. Toomes takes a moment and tells Mac that if he knew who he was, he would've killed him already. I assume he saved Spidey's identity because he saved his daughter and saved his life so his daughter wouldn't go without a father. 
- The second is a joke scene. It's a white screen and Cap walks up and faces us. This is him filming a PSA. He tells us the importance of having patience, and it can be important when you're waiting for something you think will be important, but is ultimately a waste of your time (poking fun at us for sitting in the theater, waiting for some big reveal when it's just a joke). He then looks off camera and asks how many more of these he has to do. 

Other things: 
- Donald Glover plays Aaron Davis/Prowler. He's seen trying to buy weapons from Toomes' team but tells them he doesn't want anything that extreme. Peter's watching from a bridge and his phone goes off and the sellers think he brought someone to jump them and they pull a gun on him. Peter jumps down and tells them to aim at him instead. Later, Peter goes to Davis for info about the guys and tells them that he doesn't want those weapons in his neighborhood because he has a nephew that lives nearby, confirming that Miles Morales exists in the MCU
- Michelle's character is playfully mean to Peter, but you get hints that she subtly likes him. She's also one of the few characters that's always paying attention to him. 
- The Osborns and JJJ and Gwen are not referenced at all in the movie. I didn't see any Bugle references. 

If there's anything else, please don't PM and just ask it here. I'll try and answer you. "
6j3ig1,3,2017-06-23,"Me [22/F] with my workmates [&gt;23 M-F] after 10 months in the office, is it normal that I feel bad or am I just being childish ?",TinyLittlePanda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6j3ig1/me_22f_with_my_workmates_23_mf_after_10_months_in/,"So it's been around 10 months that I'm doing this internship in a 9 000km-away country.

Working conditions : great. They paid for my flight and for my hotel and I earn really well for my young age, especially when you compare my wage to the rest of the country's. It's kinda messy sometimes (like the tasks are not always clear and sometimes I spend the day on FB because no one gives me anything to do) but apart from that it's interesting.

My colleagues : Even though it's a big group, we are only 30 in this office and there are very close bounds between the colleagues. We have a whatsapp talk called ""Family"" and we give each other nicknames quite easily. It might seem weird for the US readers, but here it's quite normal. Since I'm the youngest in the office, they all call me ""nena"" which stands for ""little girl"" and is very careful.
My boss even calls me ""hijita mia"" (my daughter). She never had a child and she's the most caring person you can dream of. We go out for drinks and we did party a couple of times together. When my Mum came and visit me, they insisted on meeting her. I sorta considered them like a second family.

The issue : So on the office's fridge there's this piece of paper with everyone's birthday duly written. When a birthday comes, the administration guys just asks everyone for a bit of money (let's say, 5 dollars) and at the end of each month, sometimes earlier if the money was collected, we do a ""party"", gather at 3pm, drink coca, eat a pie and give the present. We do that at EVERY BIRTHDAY, incluing the one of the lady that cleans the office or the one of the guy that repairs computer and I always participate even though I'm the one earning less money. 
My birthday was on June the 14th. On the day, I had baked a pie and...there were almost no one in the office. Well, this happens, and after all, it left more pie for the others right? And the day later my boss, the one that calls me ""hijita"", did bring me a little present for my birthday, but we didn't celebrate at all with the office. Oh well, I figured out that we'll do that at the end of the month with the other birthdays, like we do most of the time.

This week, the big boss of the group was here. She was also born in June. A few days earlier, another colleague was celebrating her 15 years in the office.
So yesterday, at 3, we all gathered like we do on every birthday. There was champagne and two presents. One for the boss, the other for the colleague. It was like my own birthday didn't happen.

Some of the colleagues did toast like ""oh hey it was your birthday too !"" but it just felt kinda awkward so they didn't go on. I heard stuff like ""oh it's good that we don't have anymore birthday coming because I'm going to put on weight after that"" so I now think that they won't offer me any present and didn't do the usual ""money gathering"". We do that for everyone else, remember. 
I don't know if I'm being childish or whatsoever but I feel quite bad since then. I feel kinda forgotten and this specially hurt knowing that I always participated in everyone else's birthday, regularly bake for the office and just give my best at work, overall.

Am I overreacting this ?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm feeling bad since my colleagues forgot my birthday and Idk if it's okay to feel this way or if I'm overreacting the situation because I'm being so far away from home at the moment. "

6j63f6,17,2017-06-23,Salary Questions,Folie_A_Un,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/6j63f6/salary_questions/,"Hi folks,

**An Introduction**

I'm a frequent reader of this subreddit, and this is my first post here. As I'm aware that students interested in the practice of psychotherapy frequent the forum, not to mention ongoing practitioners, I wanted to post about the topic of income derived from psychotherapy. I know I was curious and concerned about this subject before entering the field.

This topic, therapists' receipt of money for their services, is often a controversial one.

There is a wide range of salaries that people in the field can make. 

* Graduate interns tend to make nothing. 
* Post-degree / pre-licensure folks tend to make a pittance.
* Post-licensure brings a wide range of salaries.

Full disclosure. I'm a master's level psychotherapist working in the U.S. with about five years of experience. I have my license, I live in the north east, and I am male. All of this likely affects my potential income. Other things that affect it include: how well I sell myself to potential employers, how I'm paid (cash, insurance, salary, etc.), whether I'm in private practice, the fact that I'm reimbursed at the master's level and not at a doctoral level, etc. Finally, for those in private practice, how much we're willing to charge, and how many clients we give discounts to does matter.

**About me**

I've laid out some of the major factors that can impact salary. Now 
I'll talk about my experiences.

As a graduate intern I made nothing, which is standard for the field, not that this is a great thing.

My internship site allowed me to continue working for them after graduating, though initially I was still paid nothing. My benefit was supervised hours towards the license. 

Eventually they hired me part time, and I made around $26,000 that year. This was a non-profit notorious for its low wages: Full time staff made income in the mid 30s.

The next year things got better as I got full time work, and then given a raise later in the year. That year I made around $40,000. That was also the year I became licensed. 

Jumping ahead, this year I'm in the process of interviewing with group practices that should bring in somewhere between 60-70,000 per year. The group practice route helps me by supporting me through insurance paneling, receiving clients, and the like. The downside is fee splitting (I get 60 / they get 40 typically) or fee-for-service (I get $35 per session, if the client shows up).

If I started a solo practice, it might take a few years to establish a healthy base of clients, but in that case I could make around $100,000. Insurance companies in this area tend to reimburse around $50 to $90 for a 60 minute individual psychotherapy session. Certain affluent places in this region also have a thriving cash-only client base, where therapists basically bully each other to not take insurance. Some of the most expensive cash-based therapists charge upwards of $300 a session. I know this from multiple friends working in such areas.

**Some other thoughts**

A frequent comment among therapists is that we ""don't go into the field for the money"". Comparing ourselves to medical doctors, lawyers, pharmacists, actuaries, and the like, belies the fact that there are ways to make good money in this field, and ignores the reality that we can, ultimately, make incomes that are notably higher than the median income. 

I do agree that there are easier ways to make a high income. The hard work that goes into becoming, and staying a psychotherapist does not lead to ""easy street"". Given our average salaries, the economics of our field seem to suggest that we do not ""deserve"" upper class incomes. This is disheartening, but if all you care about is financial independence, then you really went into the wrong field.

The psychological and interpersonal reasons to enter this field are so closely intertwined with our salaries, that I feel I have to mention them. The stereotypical (and legitimate) reasons people enter the field include things like a desire to serve others, a desire to help the suffering, using significant interpersonal skills to some meaningful end, etc.

But let's not forget that psychotherapy is also a business. Insurance companies don't give us money for helping clients because they ""care"", but because it's more financially advantageous to pay us than to make people deteriorate until they need inpatient care. That's a bit of my own cynicism.

Likewise, while I feel psychological satisfaction from the work itself, my good feelings don't pay my bills or support my family. I think our work is worthy of some degree of financial comfort, but expecting it to lead to a lavish lifestyle is part of a bygone era. 

On the other hand, I don't like the notion that novice therapists need to ""pay their dues"", as if to say that they deserve little incomes as punishment for their lack of experience.

And while private practice therapists have the luxury of seeing clients for free or at reduced prices, most poor people (at least in the U.S.) can only afford to see novice therapists - often pre-licensure, or otherwise incentivized - working at clinics tailored to receive medicaid reimbursement. I'm not exactly an experienced psychotherapist, so I don't mean to disparage those of us early in our careers. What I do mean to suggest is that the income disparities, money politics, and psychology of money are all very fascinating and concerning topics, both as they relate to clients and psychotherapists. 

Please, lend me your thoughts."

- The infamous panties!
- I think this is the first time Alex has been over to Meredith’s house???
- Tiny baby and flu not a good mix.

- George and Derek - Odd Couple Quarantine
- Sitting Shiva for Denny. Mmmkay. So…was Izzie in her dress for 7 days? I felt like it was just one.
- That Derek/Addison fight scene was intense, y’all
- Flashback episode - the ticking is real subtle, Grey’s
- Was Burke a player pre-Cristina (because that seems out of character)? Who was that girl next to him?
- Omar and Bailey’s connection - I loved that scene with the hands. However, when she was sitting outside his door at the end of the episode I couldn’t help but think go home and see your baby.
- Finn, exclusive or not, you don’t want to be with someone that’s still hung up on their ex.
- Meredith and Derek shippers got the moment they were waiting for. HEA in sight.

**Questions**

- If ten years ago, they were in high school. I did the math and by season 14 they should be adults now. Right?
- What do you think about all the flashbacks to the mixer before their internship started? Why do you think the writers chose to show that instead of flashbacks of Denny? Izzie was saying one thing about how much she missed Denny but her mind kept flashing back to that night.

6j74hl,1,2017-06-24,Have Anet A8? Worried? Solution Comrade!,Plane_pro,3Dprinting,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/6j74hl/have_anet_a8_worried_solution_comrade/,"please read the following post in an outrageously cheesy russian accent. Even though I have no connection to russia.

Come on comerade!

So we have been hearing a lot about Anet housefires, normal fires, and in general...fires. So I recently built an Anet A8, and I found out about this problem afterwards. I was a very sad for a while...until I realized that I am engineering intern! Time to Celebrate comrade! 

obligatory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8hvyjZWHs

Onwards.

How do we fix this problem?

Step 1. Make sure your thermistor is in the little hole in the printhead to measure temperature... If not you will have my problem, in which the nozzle will heat up to over 300 degrees C and the printer will no longer be able to register the temp. If you did this, let it cool down for 30 minutes and re-start the printer. (russia is cold like my heart. If in moscow, wait 30 second)

Step 2. That power supply does not look safe. Let's fix that.

method a) replace power supply with a (computer) server PSU. These are thinner and more suited to this application compared to normal PC or other PSU's. Preferably a PSU from a reputable brand such as DELL or HP.

Method B) 
1. ADD FUSES TO EVERY WIRE COMING OFF THE PSU.

2. Attach a heat sink to the upper left side of the PSU to prevent overheating. (stalin reccoment tape)

3. check all the traces in the PSU, and if you feel scared (like Ivan) or notice that the PSU is still very hot, refer back to method A.



Congrats, your A8 is now safe(r) (marginally). note: you may have difficulty doing some of the above if you don't have access to a tech lab...oh well. Consider adding a smoke detector connected to an Arduino and alarm (or servo connected to fire extingisher) to your A8.


Though I am still using my default PSU, if you have ANY problems with it , seriously consider a server PSU.

or simply put your printer on a bed of concrete...with concrete walls...with a fire retardant roof."

6j7jcy,247,2017-06-24,"""I thought your father told you""",PsychVamp,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6j7jcy/i_thought_your_father_told_you/,"Hello everyone! I'm super excited to be here!
I've been lurking for a while now and absolutely love some of the tales that come through here - and utterly horrified the shit that some you go through. I love them cos they make my mother look a little less crazy, but the stories have made me realise a few of my own may be worth being on here.

I really hope it follows all the rules, I've like triple checked and my anxiety is causing me to doubt it all!

Note: I don't speak or see much of my mother anymore, my life is less stressful without her and she lives 1 1/2hrs away so it's easy enough to do. These will be tales of old things that have happened and I hope writing them out will be cathartic. Thanks for listening, they may be long!

So I'll start with this story, the one where my manipulative mother spoke on my behalf and showed no empathy to her wrong doings.
A few years ago, when I was in my final year of uni I travelled to another state to complete an internship. I stayed with relatives of my dad for some of it. I lived for a month in the house next door to Dads cousin, along with her dad. We spent a bit of time together and got along alright. Before staying with him my mother warned me about him, that he was a grumpy man and not very nice. I found that wasn't the case.  
Issue 1: she pushed her thoughts of others onto me and didn't let me decide for myself - not cool

So my time there was good and I enjoyed it. 
Fast forward a year and I receive a message that he has passed away. I cried. I tell dads cousin to let me know when the funeral was so I could go (they are back in my state with the rest of the family). I don't hear anything which is fine because her dad has just died. A week or so goes by and it's my birthday! Yay...nope. My lecturers made me cry, was not fun. 
The next day I found out from my brother that the funeral had happened. Yesterday. On my birthday. And I wasn't told. 
I am furious. Because I wasn't told.

Here's where it gets good llamas. Well, bad for me.

A little while later I find out that my mum was there and had told dads cousin that I was sorry I couldn't make it.
I couldn't make it cos I wasn't bloody told!
So I am livid at this point. How dare she not tell me then say that.

Side note: About 6 months prior my mum and dad separated. It was UGLY. We saw sides of our parents that we wish we didn't. Relevance, both mum and dad found new partners.

About the same time as the funeral mum tired to get us to meet her new partner. (That's a WHOLE other kettle of fish, and a tale not to be told here today). So at this lunch I decide before things start that I would bring up to mum about my hurt feelings about the funeral. The exchange went a little something like this:

Me: mum, I'm very upset that I wasn't told about the funeral, I would have liked to go
Mum: oh, I thought your father told you
Me: no he didn't, but you could have told me 
(Me getting upset at this point)
Mum: well it's his family, and you had uni
Me: well it's up to me to decide to go or not, uni was crap anyway, my lecturers made me cry
Mum: well I'm sorry you didn't know (in the most flat, monotone, not caring voice ever) 

I walk off at this point outside because I can't handle it anymore. My older sister comes out to check on me and was appalled when I told her. My bf was also comforting me because I was pretty close to tears. I avoided her for as much as I could all through lunch.

Later that day I told my dad that I was upset that he didn't tell me. He burst into tears telling me he was so sorry he didn't tell me and he didn't even think of it (mum used to organise everything, dad never did, was just learning to remember things like this, still annoying but more understandable, especially cos he apologised).

I'm still pissed at my mother for this. I didn't get to say goodbye, I didn't even get the option. And if anyone asks me why I don't like my mother (there's some fun stories there too!), this comes up every time.

Thanks for listening, I'm sorry I'm not the best story teller, but if you'd like to hear more I've got plenty!

6j7oxy,6,2017-06-24,"I got pushed outta the friendzone by my self-proclaimed ""best friend""",a_plane_guy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6j7oxy/i_got_pushed_outta_the_friendzone_by_my/,"My ""best friend"" unfriended me on Facebook yesterday. I knew we couldn't ever be as close as we once were, but damn! Wasn't expecting that. Apologies in advance; this post is a bit long.

We've been friends for years, best friends almost all that time --even dated intermittently last semester. We'd flirted with each other ever since we'd met, but it wasn't until this February that we both realized that we actually were a great match for each other. We both loved and respected each other, and already had a strong history of friendship. We kissed the night of the Super Bowl. Only took me 25 years, but I had gotten my first kiss.

The week that followed was great. I got a kickass engineering internship with my dream company, we went out on our first real date --things were looking up. Second week rolls around, and she realizes she's still not ready for a committed relationship (she'd broken up with ex that summer), and that's cool. Problem: we'd both crossed an emotional line, and we found it a hard line to return to a ""just friends"" state. We'd make resolutions to refrain from romance, and break them, and make them again. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. There was no commitment implied (she told me about all her other datings around), but affection was there.

Fast-forward to May. I'm wrapping up junior year and moving out-of-state for my internship; she's graduating with her bachelor's degree. At this point, we've reached a relatively stable plateau of ""just friends""-ishnes. There was a problem, though. She's an international student, and has restrictions on her work hours. I knew she wouldn't be able to afford to live over the summer, so told her she could move in with me over the summer until she started grad school. Didn't think she'd take me up on it, but she did. Apparently her mom thought it was a great idea...? 

I move in mid-May; she flies in two weeks later. Second day here, she tells me she thinks she's gonna try to go steady with one of the other guys she'd been seeing. 
""Cool. I'm happy for you two, but why didn't you just move in with him?"" 
""Because I'd promised you, and you'd offered right away when you knew I needed help, and he didn't until much later.""
She starts crying, I comfort her, and secretly am a bit happy for some finality, some closure in this situation. However, she'd made no official commitment to him yet, and...we suddenly fell into our previous amorous pursuits, only much more intensely so.

Two weeks after that, her soon-to-be beau comes to pick her up, so they could ""vacation"" together for a couple weeks in our college town.. I'd known this was coming since she'd moved in, and told her she might wanna consider staying there if she was serious about starting this new relationship. She insisted she would return. When I get back from work the day they left, I saw she'd made the , apartment spotless, and left this long florid letter in my bedroom, going on about how grateful she is for my ""unconditional friendship,"" and how she was coming back in two weeks. ""Can't be rid of me that easily! Signed, Your Best Friend (Name Not Needed),"" she wrote in that letter last week. 

""I told him about us, how close we got those weeks I was living with you,"" she texted me three days ago. 
""That's good to hear. I think that's important. I mean this from the bottom of my heart, if you feel it's better to stay the summer with him, do it! I'll take care of your stuff."" 
""He's really upset, and doesn't want anything to do with you again.""
See, this part is funny to me. They'd only been official a few days. I had no illusions of exclusivity, and anyone with eyes, ears, and a brain would have had none, either. I knew I wasn't the only guy she was seeing. But feelings are feelings, and people handle them differently. 

The next day: ""Can you get my stuff together for when you come back? I appreciate it. I know I promised I'd return, but I don't think I will. Everything's messed up. I am sorry."" Only healthy, really, and I assure her as much. ""He's still upset. It doesn't need to be this way. I apologize for how you and I are gonna be,"" she continued. ""You have my number. For now."" Then she unfollowed me on all social media.

I've not cried over these revelations. In some ways it's a relief, and it was in no way unexpected. All the same, we were close on a strictly platonic level long before any stumblings into romance came about. To have all of that swept away to appease an overzealous boyfriend  --it's rough! 

I have many acquaintances. I have few friends. Sad to see the one who most loudly proclaimed her love to vanish so quickly."

**Hero themes:**

* Buff and debuff (bonus challenge attempted)

* Dps/DoT (bonus challenge attempted)

* I know there was a hero with the name Faust before. Sorry for that, but it’s too cool to not use :P
 
#**1. Personal data**
 
**Name:** Jan Twardowski  (polish documents); Ian Twardowsky (Swiss documents)
 
**Gender:** Male
 
**Age:** 47
 
**Nationality:** Swiss &amp; Polish (double nationality)
 
**Affiliations:** Talon
 
**Base:** Various secret laboratories spread in Europe
 
**Lore:** Ian was a son of a polish ambassador in Switzerland and a Swiss governor. His parents' high social and financial status, coupled with boy’s perfect grades, made it an obvious, even if unwilling, choice for him to attend Bern’s Medical University.
 
Ian was easily one of the most talented students that has ever applied to the college – with his unusual memory and almost intuitive understanding of human body, he topped all courses he attended to, earning admiration of both fellow students and professors.
 
However, closer to the end of his education Ian has started to display some disturbing qualities. During internships he showed very little empathy towards his patients and it was becoming clear that he lacked passion to help others.
 
Until he was a student it was a minor issue, but when Ian had graduated and was taken in by one of the Switzerland’s most renowned hospitals, it had become a serious problem. Doctor Twardowsky’s attitude and impatience towards his co-workers had put him at odds with institution’s personnel, patients and other doctors. Ian’s eagerness to try out risky and experimental therapies was of no help in this case.
 
After not even two years he was quietly dismissed. The head of his hospital ward had left such a note in his private records: ‘While doc. Twardowsky is surely a talented man, he lacks this “something” that differentiates the person with medical knowledge from a doctor.’
 
With the help of his old mentor, Twardowsky had managed to get back to the University, this time as a lecturer at the Cathedral of Modern Medicine. There, he was teaching about newest medical technologies, closely supervised by the dean.
 
It was during this time, that Ian had met the person who was to change his life forever – barely fifteen years old Angela Ziegler.  Medical prodigy, and an overall genius, had been attending Twardowsky’s course for over a year, when she had asked him for help. She was trying to develop a project, that could potentially lead to breakthrough in still young field of nanobiology.
 
Ian had agreed to that, though with much more malicious intent than young Angela had expected. After helping Ziegler to develop the technology, Ian, who at this point desperately strived to cement his position in the academic environment, had attempted to take the credit for the invention for himself entirely.
 
Fortunately, Ziegler outwitted Twardowsky uncovering his scam and leading to man being fired from the University. Incredibly sour and vengeful, Ian was contacted by Talon, which had its eyes on the project he and Ziegler were working on. They offered him a great reward for helping with stealing the invention and using it for their cause – the proposition Ian had gladly taken.
 
With the nearly limitless resources, Ian had managed to reconstruct Ziegler’s technology and twist it to serve the needs of Talon. Tasked with designing a way to turn organization’s soldiers into living weapons, Ian had started experimenting with new applications of nanorobots and genetic therapies.
 
And that was the moment when everything had changed. Indulging himself in the unnatural pleasure that hurting his test subjects gave him, Ian had threw away any moral limitations he might had left in himself. Assuming the identity of Faust, he had begun working on his magnum opus – an artificial pathogen, capable of altering biological structure of living organisms.
 
 
**Trivia:**

* Faust assisted in Amalie Lacroix’s brainwashing and is responsible for her biological alterations.

* Gabriel Reyes was rescued by Faust, by the usage of incomplete technology that later became known as Nanovirus. Due to its former limitations, Reaper’s body was put in state of constant decay, counteracted by his enhanced regeneration. (On the side note - it is a confirmed fact, that Mercy was not the one to rescue Reaper. However, having Faust rescue him with technology stolen from Mercy fits well Reaper’s line ‘You tell me doc.’ as his state is side effect of Ziegler’s invention.)

* Faust’s latest creation is a terrifying hybrid of human and machine known as [Dread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchHeroConcepts/comments/5rvcbu/hero_forge_dread_the_hand_of_devil/)

* Faust also experiments on himself, hence his left hand is merged with nanorobots to the point of no repair

* Jan Twardowski was a figure from polish legend, whose story bears strong resemblances to the history of Johann Faust

 
**Character:** Faust is overly confident and very cynical person. He bears no sentiment towards his allies and cruelly disposes of his enemies. Ian lacks any empathy or social skills, communicates with others with witty one-liners and is generally considered a person who is better off left alone.
 
However, these displeasing qualities mask a logical mind underneath. Faust thinks incredibly coldly and calculates his chances of success perfectly. He never acts on impulses and is not hesitant to eliminate any person that stands in his way.
 
**Moral affiliation:** Chaotic Evil
 
**Appearances:** Faust is a tall, unnaturally slim man, with black, shoulder-length hair, tied in a small ponytail on the back of his head. He has pointy chin, high cheekbones and piercing blue eyes.
 
He wears dark shirt and trousers, mostly hidden under the lab coat he is never seen without. Said lab coat used to be snow white, but is now covered in stains, mostly red, but also yellow and violet.

#**2. Hero’s weapon, statistics and abilities**
 
**HP/Armor/Shield:** 150/100/0
 
**Base movement speed:** 5,5 m/s (standard)
 
**Classification:** Defence
 
**Role:** Anti-pusher, anti-flanker, cc-machine
 
**Difficulty:** 2/3
 
##**Skills:**

**Passive 1 – Nanovirus:** Faust’s skills and primary fire infect his enemies’ bodies with volatile nanorobots, that attack them from the inside.

* Nanovirus is a debuff, that can stack up to 3 times

* Each stack deal 25 damage over 1 second and reduce the movement speed by 7 percent for the same duration

* Movement speed reduction stacks linearly (i.e. 3*7% = 21%)

* Stacks of Nanovirus are independent from each other (i.e. applying a new stack does not refresh timers of older ones). However, when target has already three stacks on him/her and the new one is applied, the oldest stack is replaced

 
**Passive 2 – Biotic Upgrades:** Faust had used his wicked technology to enhance his body.

* Faust constantly regenerates HP at the rate of 10 health per second

* Out of combat (i.e. after not taking damage for 3 seconds) Faust’s movement speed is increased to 8 meters per second

 
**Primary Fire – Pestilent Darts:** Faust fires an infectious dart from his sidearm.

* Type: Linear projectile

* Damage: 40

* No damage falloff

* Landing a shot applies a Nanovirus stack to a target

* Missile speed: 60 m/s

* Rate of fire: 2 shots per second

* Ammo: 15

* Ammo usage: 1 per shot

* Reload time: 1,5 second

* Headshots: Yes

 
 
**Ability 1 – Contagion Flare:** Faust briefly turns his left arm into a cannon and fires the missile, that after 0,7 seconds or upon impact explodes and spreads the cloud of Nanovirus suspension in the air.

* Missile type: Arcing projectile

* Missile speed: 65 m/s

* Shooting animation duration: 0.6 seconds

* Cloud duration: 3 seconds

* Cloud applies a stack of Nanovirus every 0.33 seconds

* Cooldown: 10 seconds

* Behaviour: The cloud behaves as the normal smoke would. If the missile explodes in the air, the cloud will retain part of the projectile’s horizontal momentum and then fall down to the ground, spreading in air. It roughly means that the higher the missile explodes, the later the cloud will touch the ground, but will also cover bigger area.

* Minimal radius: 3 meters

* While initial missile will be stopped by barriers, the smoke will not be

 
**Ability 2 – Crippling Sting:** Faust briefly transforms his left hand into a long sting and thrust it forwards stabbing and infecting first target it touches.

* Range: 7 meters

* Damage: 20

* Cooldown: 5 seconds

* Applies three stacks of Nanovirus

* Animation duration: 0.3 seconds

 
**Ability 3 – Adrenaline Burst:** With his left hand Faust throws a syringe with inhuman strength. If it hits his ally, he/she will receive a damage reduction buff and movement speed increase.

* Shot’s type: Linear projectile

* Shot’s speed: 120 meters per second

* Buff duration: 3 seconds

* Throwing animation duration: 0,3 seconds

* Damage reduction &amp; movement speed increase’s behaviour: both start very high and decay quickly over Adrenaline Burst’s duration

* Percentage pattern (applicable to both): 100%-&gt;50%-&gt;25%-&gt;12.5% (respectively: at the start-&gt;after 1 s -&gt; after 2 s -&gt; after 3 s)

* Cooldown: 12 seconds

 
**Ultimate Ability – Plague:** All hell break lose as Faust disables the security protocols limiting Nanovirus’ effectiveness. The artificial pathogen goes haywire and spreads rapidly between targets.

* Behaviour: Faust’s next action that would apply the Nanovirus debuff, will also apply the Plague debuff. If the ability or shot that is supposed to apply Plague misses, the ultimate charge will be consumed anyway

* Plague debuff modifies the mechanics of Nanovirus. Under its influence Nanovirus can stack indefinitely on target (movement speed decrease up to 70%, damage without limitations)

* Additionally, enemies with Plague debuff will also pulse every 0.5 seconds, applying Plague and Nanovirus debuffs to all applicable targets in the 8 meters radius, including themselves

* If that is still unclear - Plague debuff only removes stack cap and spread Nanovirus' and itself. On its own it does not do damage or slow down

* Duration: 10 seconds (the amount of time Faust has to apply the first Plague debuff after activating Ultimate); 4 seconds (time that Plague debuffs will last; counted from the application of the first one)

* Contagion Flare will apply Plague to only one target, the one closest to Faust.



* Charge cost: 2000
 
**Pros:**

* In middle range combat can effectively cripple enemy heroes

* Good at shutting down pushes

* Decent anti-flanker

* Quite tanky

* Well timed Adrenaline Burst can bail Faust’s ally out of the worst situations

* Plague can be used both as the initiating move and as the finishing one (it will make it significantly harder to escape Tactical Visor, but can also wipe out team caught in Graviton Surge)

 
**Cons:**

* Medium damage

* Projectile weapon fares poorly in long distance fights

* In combat Faust is a very immobile hero

* Plague activation may be shut down by the likes of D.Va, or by Faust simply missing the triggering ability

* If enemies spread during Plague its effectiveness is greatly diminished

are now red. Coat itself is pitch black and covered in red biohazard warning signs,
including one big on his back

and wears matching cylinder.

* Prince - mostly red recolour of Duke

6j84yk,1,2017-06-24,Three years later and I am finally ready to talk about my sexual assault.,B1THROWAWAY,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6j84yk/three_years_later_and_i_am_finally_ready_to_talk/,"I met this guy on OKCupid. He lived about three hours away from me, but he could easily take the ferry over to my apartment. He was also about four years younger than me, but it didn't bother me. I was 24 at the time. My fiance now is three years younger than me. Anyways, we connected on a deep level.

Our first date consisted of cuddling on my couch watching HER. I vividly remember him whispering in my ear ""I just want to stay in your arms forever."" I thought it was wildly romantic for some reason. 

Our second date consisted of walking around the Big Apple and going to museums and acting cute and holding hands. It was very cliche movie-life. Afterwards I had bravely asked him to be my boyfriend in which he said yes. I was very scared of rejection, but remember beaming when he said yes.

Our third date is when it happened. We were in my apartment playing a video game together while I made his favorite dish from scratch. He was tired after eating so we curled up on my bed. He started forcing me to suck him off and all these things I didn't want. I said I didn't want to, but he made me anyways and then he left and I never spoke to him again.

He left his email address accidentally on my computer so I was able to trace his last name and find his Facebook, but nowadays I can't find it. Maybe he found out I had searched him or something. I don't know, but I can still see his internship photo on Google.

I just thought I could never talk about this incident or tell anyone because he was an intern and now a scientist for a very famous gov't program. I don't want to publicly say which one, but if I told you to think of Alpha Industries jackets you would figure it out.

I recently saw his face in a Fast Company or something magazine for his work as a scientist. It just made me feel really sick. I wish I had been brave enough to report him back then, but I just thought I wouldn't stand a chance because of his internship.

I'm happy now and in a much better place. I hope people going through something similar understand things do get better."

I've[31F] been with my bf[36M] for a little over a year. We're so in love and have talked about children and getting married many times. I've met most of his family and they love me. His mom and dad have even asked when we're going to get married and have kids :) he's met some of my family, they all love him too. He's got one more year of grad school and then we'll probably move for work.

So my question is, how do I ask him when, without pressuring him, will we get married and have kids? I just want to have his babies so damn bad. To make our own little family. My womb is aching for it. :)

Edit: right now he's out of state for an internship so I'm going to wait to discuss this in person. We've talked about everything involving raising kids so I feel really good about this!

**Tl;dr: everything is perfect and I want my own little family. Please give me advice on how to ask when we can get started!**"

6j8l31,2,2017-06-24,[MF4f] Peter and Paula: On the Hunt!,FoxeyRoxey,DirtyStoryWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyStoryWriting/comments/6j8l31/mf4f_peter_and_paula_on_the_hunt/,"""*Three* just entered her second trimester, Peter.  Isn't it time to start looking?""  Paula put on her teasing smile, actually more a grin than a smile, and added ""Or are you slowing down old man?""  Peter looked pensive and slowly drifted toward his wife.  ""I have to say"" he said slowly ""turning forty does change things a little.""  He paused to shake his head dejectedly.  In a quick move he bent his knees, put a broad shoulder in Paula's middle and hoisted her up.  He roared ""Peter want woman!  Peter take woman!"" and repeated the refrain as he carried Paula, thrown over his shoulder, into their bedroom and dropped her on the bed.  He hurried into position above her on his hands and knees and grinned down at Paula.  ""Yeah, things do start to change at forty, but *that's*  not one of them!"" Paula gave him a sultry look and threw him a kiss.  ""Oh yeah?  Prove it, old man!""

Peter and Paula were a typical surburban couple, affluent, well educated, and so, so, happy in their beautiful, large home surrounded by their manicured yard.  They just *liked* each other in so many ways other than just the hot sex everybody knew they must share.  After all, just look at them!  Peter was tall, dark and handsome and Paula looked like a movie star!  They were *best friends* as well as lovers.  They were *soulmates*!  Yes, to be candid, the best way to describe them was ""Yucky Sweet"".  At least that's what their friends and neighbors thought.  

There was a bit more, actually quite a bit more, to Peter and Paula than their friends and neighbors realized.  Yes, they were affluent, but truth be told they were very much more than just affluent.  Everybody knew they must have some money.  After all they have that farm house upstate and it sits on a few acres, doesn't it?  Yes, five hundred thrity three of them to be precise.  The farm house was modest, only sleeping six but the barn was big.  Forty stalls before they renovated to make the space more useable.  They kept a dozen stalls even though the plan only required six.  There were other outbuildings too.  But the neighbors didn't know much about the farm.  Peter and Paula referred to it often because they spent alot of time there.  But somehow, although they talked about the farm, they never really said much about it.  But was that surprising?  Peter was modest and Paula was never one to put on airs or show off.  Naturally they didn't go on and on about the farm in front of the neighbors.  That would be boastful, wouldn't it?

""Hmmm!  That was nice Peter.  I wasn't expecting it this afternoon and that made it all the more special.""  Paula pressed up on Peter's chest and said ""But, I need to move.""  Peter rolled off and lay on his back.  After a quick stretch Paula snuggled up to him, laying her head on his chest.  He knew she would bring up the plan again.  

""I hate to bug, but you remember how long it took us to find *Three*?  We don't want to settle for just anybody, so if we don't get a move on we might miss the timetable.""  She was right, as she usually was when it came time to lay out strategic plans, flow charts and task lists.  After all, she did it for a living and her company was very successful.  Peter recited the plan so Paula would know he understood it.  ""We find *Four* this quarter and then train her while I cover *One* next quarter, and *Two* the following quarter.  By then *Three* will be ready again.  Ant then, hopefully *Four* can join the rotation.  Yes, let's hit the city weekends and round one up.""  Paula smiled.  She just loved it when her plans came together.

Peter sighed and closed his eyes.  He thought back to college, sitting in that Political Philosophy classroom and seeing the most beautiful woman he had ever laid eyes upon arguing with a short, skinny  boy as they took seats next to each other.  They seemed to be together.  Were they a couple?  Didn't matter.  Even before this class firmed up his thinking Darwin's theory had told him he could have anything, or anybody, he was strong enough to take.  This class provided the philosophical basis.  It was only proper for individuals in a society to pursue their self interests.  Buy pursuing their self interests they  would amass power and wealth and then they could use those assets and resources to forge a better way for mankind to follow.  By taking the dark haired beauty away from the boy he was doing the skinny kid a favor.  Who knew what I can accomplish with a woman like that by my side, and some of the benefits that accrue to me will trickle down and shower the losers like the skinny boy with wealth and riches!  Very few people understood this and that just enhanced the power of the ones who did.  Peter had some very strange ideas.  He was delighted to find that Paula shared them!  They were the perfect match.  A match made in heaven?  Or, maybe, uh ... someplace else? 

Peter took the lead when they hunted.  He was a natural, looking over the herd from a distance and being very methodical and cautious before selecting his prey.  Paula was his blind.  Who would ever think a man with a woman like Paula at his side could possibly be looking to score.  Of course Paula's opinions also counted.  First, she could read people pretty well and second, she had her urges too.  Paula had come up with the description.  Under thirty five so she'd have at least a few productive years left, intelligent, nurturing and caring, fit and well toned, and, most importantly broad hips well suited for childbirth.  Peter came up with the profile.  Ideally, out of school and working a minimum wage job, heavily in debt, not close to family and no lover or even very close friends.  Peter thought the best place to find this type would be coffee bars and cafes near colleges.  Lots of women making do while they are looking for a better job.  Maybe some graduate students tired of being broke.

After six weeks of sitting around watching countless cups of nearly untouched coffee go cold we find our first real possibility.  You are a good looking girl who greets us with a bright smile and cheery ""Welcome to Goldie's!  Want some coffee?""  We say ""Yes, please"" in unison and watch you walk away to get the coffee.  I say ""Pretty girl, pleasant smile good hips"" and Peter continues ""Great ass, slightly downtrodden look as she walked away, looks to be mid-twenties.""  As we see you strart back toward us  Paula chimes in.  ""Nice tits that would be great if they were engorged, kissable lips, ooh, long legs!""  We decide to place a food order and take another look at your retreating ass.  ""I want to fuck her"" says Peter ""and I think you do too.""  Paula nods and says ""Let's give her a try."" 

Paula slips you her card when you return with our muffins.  ""Hey, I'm Paula Price and I run an image and lifestyle consulting company.  We are looking for research interns for a long term project we are running and I think you might fit our profile.  Would you like to hear a little about it when your break time comes around?""

You are a bit flustered, but also intrigued.  This will break up a mundane day!  You glance at Paula's card.  *Paula Price PhD, President and CEO* and in the bottom right corner  **A Better Way, Inc.**  ""Well, yeah, I guess so.  I can take my break now if it's good for you.""  Peter takes charge.  ""That would be perfect.  Get yourself some coffee and we can get started.""  

When you return Paula slides over so you can sit facing Peter.  ""I'm Peter, Paula's husband.  Her research project explores an idea we came up with when we were in college, an idea that sparked her business.  That's her interest in researching the idea, to grow and develop her business.""

""We are exposed to a set of ideas from birth to death.  Those ideas, those principles, define the lives we lead and the very world we live in.  Well, Paula and I don't like the world as it is today.  We think there is *A Better Way*.  We think there are other ideas and principles which result in a very different world.  A world where people have control of their destinies.  They are not buried under debt, restricted by unnecessary rules and regulations, or enslaved by the multinational corporations and the oppresive governments they own.""

Paula takes over.  ""So we want some volunteers to try to live by those ideas and see what kind of life they lead to.  I guess volunteers is the wrong word, because we pay our subjects and we provide free room and board, so they can save quite a bit of money while in the study.""  Peter interjects.  ""See, that's one of our *different* ideas.  How many friends do you have who are working for free on internships for the Corporations or their lackey Government?  Our idea is if you work you should get paid.""  Paula picks it up again.  ""What do you think?  Want to hear some more?  If you can get some time off we can spend the weekend at our home discussing it, or get you a room if you would be more comfortable with that.""

[Yes, it's a breeding prompt and no, it's not noncon.  Peter insists everything be voluntary, and, if we really are going to create a better society it will only work with people who want to live in it!  So, there's some world building too.

Feel free to introduce yourself OOC and then respond to Paula.  Or if you just want to discuss something, that's fine too.  We are not locked in to anything in the prompt.   

I'm Paula, 5'6'', 34C, 36'' hips with full, round ass, shoulder length brown hair, blue eyes and 36 years old. My 24 inch waist makes me a bit curvy.  I'm fairly well toned and have what Peter describes as a beautiful butt, complete with well placed dimples.  My breasts are full enough to be shapely.  They are nearly perfectly symmetrical but the right one hangs just a bit lower than the left.  My nipples are nearly invisible until stimulated and then they stand tall and proud, sticking out about half an inch beyond my slightly puffy areoli which are just slightly larger than quarters.  My legs taper nicely down to smallish feet.  When I do squats you can see the muscles ripple in my legs.  I have a full bush of luxurious dark hair, trimmed just enough to be neat.  

Peter is 40 years old, 6'1'', muscular build with short brown hair and piercing dark brown, almost black eyes.  He is very strong.  He has very broad shoulders and a thick chest sitting on top of very sturdy hips.  He is quick to smile and flashes a mouth full of perfect white teeth when he does.  He can also freeze you in place with a frown.  His soft and gentle voice will make you melt as he tells you how pretty you are but his deep, hard, stern voice will tighten your ass if he needs to tell you you have displeased him. 

Hope to hear from you.  Even if you just want to talk about this new sub.  We are excited about it!  Paula] "

***
## [“The Baby Shower”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baby_Shower_(Seinfeld)
Production code: **204**

Episode no.: **S02E10**

&amp;nbsp;

Here we have the first episode written by Larry Charles, known for “contributing some of the show's darkest and most absurd storylines”, which can be enjoyed in the 15 episodes he would go on to write for the show (his last being season 5’s “The Fire”).

&amp;nbsp;

As a result of Charles’ contributions, in this episode we have the appearance of several new characters, including a memorable minor character (more on that in a bit) and a couple of characters that appear in a dream sequence. This sequence, wherein Jerry is being busted (and subsequently gunned down) by the FBI for his illegal cable hook-up, features FBI agent played by George C. Simms (who played Man #2 in season 1’s “The Robbery”), and FBI Agent Stone played by Vic Polizos (who plays Tabachnik, the cable guy). Even though both characters appear in a dream, they are separate entities from the other characters both actors played – AND with scripted lines – so I’m considering both in the official Character count.

&amp;nbsp;

We also have (what I believe to be) our first movie reference of the series, and our first two historical references. And also the first mention of Bosco chocolate syrup, a food item that would feature prominently in a season 7 episode.

&amp;nbsp;

As for the memorable minor character, how awesome is the Mary Contardi outburst! The way she walks right up to Jerry and proceeds to absolutely lose her shit on him for not calling her after a date “three years ago”:

&amp;nbsp;

MARY: Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows….told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day…


JERRY: Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your…


MARY: Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz through the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?! Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!”

&amp;nbsp;

Oh man that’s good stuff! Anyway, on to the lists…

&amp;nbsp;

6j9one,1,2017-06-24,"Me [27 M] with my SO [25 F] of 6 years, wants to break up, unsure if I'm the right one for her.",Throwaway123HelpSeek,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6j9one/me_27_m_with_my_so_25_f_of_6_years_wants_to_break/,"Hello,

I'm using a throwayay because my SO knows my reddit ID.

I met my GF and it was love at first sight for me, we started dating and all was going well for the first 2 years of our relationship. Then I started to have some troubles dealing with depression and stress from school/work (We both were medical students, now finished our studies). I was not a good companion, I wasn't in the mood for going out or do any kind of activity with her and on top of it I would lash out my anger on her sometimes. It lasted for almost 2 years with periods of happy times. She put up with it for a while then started going out more and more with her friends. Thats when she started putting distance between us, saying that she was more comfortable with her friends than with me.

Last year she went for an internship out of the country and it was really hard for me to deal with her absence. She started to think that I was not the right one for her and that she wanted to break up but still stay friends because she says she still cares about me. Now I am in a better place, I dont want our relaionship to end. I truly love her and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. When we talked about mending our realtionship she said that she didn't have the strenght to deal with my moody behavior anymore.

I don't know what to do. How can I mend to my relationship? Am I ready to anything to not lose her. Our plan was for us to get married next year, but now she put it on hold while we figure things out.

Do I give her space and let things settle down ? How do I deal with this? Any and all advice is welcome.


EDIT : I did seek professional help for my depression, went to therapy until me and my doctor were satisfied with my progress.
  
  ---   
 tl;dr: Was having a rough period in my life when I made my SO suffer, now she's unsure if she wants to keep her relationship with me."
6j9wrk,3,2017-06-24,So scared and guilt ridden. I need to change.,Readytogetbetter777,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6j9wrk/so_scared_and_guilt_ridden_i_need_to_change/,"So I took a once in a lifetime internship in a big city this summer. I took it as a time to stop drinking, start working out again and finding my joy outside of alcohol. 

I've been doing a pretty good job but we had a work party the other night. Free drink coupons were being shoved into my purse and like with junk food, I have a complete inability to say no to alcohol when it is presented to me, even if I have every intention to not drink. 

I was pretty intoxicated but my friend had had her wallet stolen and was distraught so I decided to drive us back to her house. I remember starting to drive but everything after that is black. 

While on the highway, she told me someone clipped us from behind and I lost control of the car. It slammed into the median and the entire back of it is wrecked. 

My friend told me to get out of the car and she drove us the 10 minutes home. I didn't think the damage was that bad until the morning when I went outside and saw how horrible it is. I took the car to a shop and it's $5,000 worth of damage. 

That is one thing and it sucks that I'm dealing with that now but I feel SO HORRIBLE about my decision to drive that night. I feel so guilty and shameful and can't stop thinking of all of the ""what if's"" and how much more horrible it could have been had I hit someone else and the police came and did a breathalyzer on me, etc. 

Or if I would have hit the median head on, we could have been killed. I just don't understand how I was so stupid and it scares me. 

I have to stop drinking. This is a wake up call. I just don't know how. I've said so many times that I'm done and this is it but I never follow through. 

But this guilt and the feeling in my stomach is almost unbearable. I have such an amazing life ahead of me and such incredible opportunities and I almost threw that all away and I can't get over how truly truly STUPID I was. 

I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I really truly don't. My life is too valuable to continue risking it like this. Please offer advice. Please help me "
6jacgn,5,2017-06-24,Spider-Man Homecoming ALL SPOILERS (SOURCE: Marvel Studios Spoilers),MugglePrincie003003,Spiderman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/6jacgn/spiderman_homecoming_all_spoilers_source_marvel/,"It's been revealed that Toomes has been running his operation since the battle of New York, once Damage Control comes in and shuts them down. They had already been working the site for a day or so before Damage Control shut them down and took their stuff. They start off with stuff they had from day one back at their warehouse that they didn't turn over. He's already Vulture before the modern day story starts and has been using his suit just to steal materials without getting caught.


Happy is appointed to be Peter's check-in guy, so he has to go through him to talk to Tony and Happy hates Peter.
Avengers Tower is being sold. Happy reveals that they sold it and are moving everything over to their new upstate facility in a few days.


Tony doesn't do any of the fighting. He really is not in the movie that much. Iron Man shows up twice, once to save Spider-Man after Vulture drops him into a river and he's trapped in his parachute (Tony isn't even in the suit, he's in India controlling it remotely), and then again at the Ferry scene.


Toomes uses alien tech that Tinkerer messed with to steal things. They have a cube thing that can separate into four smaller cubes, and when positioned on a flat surface, it creates a door, so it's like a phase shifted. This is how Toomes has been able to discretely steal stuff for years from Damage Control delivery trucks. The trucks don't know they're being robbed and see no evidence of it after the fact.


Peter gets trapped in one of these trucks while trying to stop the Vulture in DC, and when he breaks out of the crate, finds out he's in a huge concrete warehouse that's locked and devoid of personnel until morning. He uses this time to get acquainted with all of the features of his suit. Ned unlocked the training wheels protocol back in their hotel room.


Peter and Ned hold onto a glowing purple alien thing from a piece of a weapon that fell off during a chase scene. Peter finds out later that it's almost like a bomb and is activated with radiation. Ned has it in his backpack when he goes to the Washington Monument and the X-ray from the security screening sets it off, but it doesn't start to blow up until they're in the elevator.


Peter discovers it's a bomb while talking to the AI in his suit in the warehouse. He freaks out and uses an electrical panel, a graphing calculator plugged into it, and the AI in his suit (that he names Karen) to help override it. It takes him hours and is a good example of how smart he is. This causes him to miss their decathlon.
Yes, Toomes is Liz Allen's dad. Peter saw his face on the Ferry, and then is terrified the entire time he's picking up Liz for their Homecoming dance.


Toomes drives the two to their dance and asks Peter what his plans are for after high school, and Liz tells her dad he's got an internship with Stark And mentions that he knows Spider-Man. Toomes doesn't think much of it, but tells Peter he recognizes him from somewhere and says it's his voice. Peter brushes it off as him seeing him on Liz's decathlon team, then Liz starts talking about Peter not being there for their D.C. decathlon competition, or how he disappeared at her party. From there, Toomes connects the dots. He keeps Peter in the car once they get to the dance and tells him that since he saved Liz's life in DC, he's not going to hurt him, but if he interferes again, he threatens him and tells him to leave him alone.


Peter makes the tough choice to leave Liz at the dance to go fight Toomes before he leaves for his ""flight"" he says he has to catch. Peter leaves his spare suit (and the web Fluid he makes in chemistry class) underneath a thing of lockers at his school that only he can lift because of his strength.


Peter gets attacked by Shocker outside the school before he can get his webshooters on. Vulture sent him to make sure Peter didn't leave the dance. Ned ends up saving him by using his webshooter to hit Shocker.
Peter confronts Vulture at his warehouse, where Vulture monologues to distract him and get his brand new wings up and running, and he uses them to chase Peter and break the load-bearing columns in the building and brings the warehouse down on him.


Peter is trapped under the concrete rubble and manages to use his strength to lift himself out of it, like the classic shot from the comics of him doing the same thing.


Toomes is using his new wings to intercept the plane moving everything important out of Avengers Tower, including the Hulkbuster suit, a new prototype cap shield, and an asgardian belt that belonged to Thor. We also see the Mark 42 suit from IM3 and arc reactors in the plane.
The plane has retroflective panels, like the helicarrier, so the whole plan flight looks cool because the panels are freaking out and flickering the whole time.
The plane crashes near Coney Island and Happy sees it happen from Avengers Tower.


Toomes is fighting Peter and tries to make off with a crate of arc reactors when Peter notices that his wings are about to explode like the alien battery in D.C. Did. He tries to ground Vulture using his webs, saying he's trying to save him, but Vulture cuts his webline and doesn't make it far before the wings blow. Peter runs into the fire and pulls him out of the crash and he's alive.



happy arrives on the scene later with Damage Control and finds Toomes conscious and webbed up to the crate of the arc reactors, with a note saying something like ""Caught that Vulture looking guy,"" and signs it as Spider-Man
Back at school, Liz reveals that her and her mom are moving to another state, saying that her dad didn't want them near during the trial


Peter goes to a decathlon meeting. Liz was their former leader but since she's gone, they elect a new one and it's Michelle. She says her friends call her MJ. Someone makes a joke that she doesn't have any friends and she acknowledges that fact.



Happy meets Peter in the school bathroom and thanks him for what he did and said that he wouldn't be anything without his job. Happy tells Peter Tony wants to meet him upstate and he drives him to the Avengers facility.
Tony tells Peter he did a great job and he really proved himself. He walks him over to a giant container, revealing a brand new suit for him. It's very shiny and has mostly the same basic red and blue pattern, but with a lot of Iron Spider elements. There's a giant spider covering the whole torso that's blue with a gold outline.
Tony tells Peter that beyond the next door is a room full of reporters, and tells Peter to get the suit on because he's prepared to introduce him as the newest member of The Avengers and says after, Happy will show him to his new room. Peter thanks Tony for the offer, but tells him he'd prefer to stay close to the ground and be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Tony respects his decision and tells him that Happy will drive him home. As Peter walks away he asks Tony if it was a test and if there were really reporters. Tony says yes it was and no there aren't.
After Peter leaves, Pepper Potts bursts through a door with press cameras going off in the next room and asks where he is. Tony says he left and that he can think of something better and Happy gives Tony a ring and says he's been holding onto it since 2008. Pepper tells him not to and Tony takes the ring from Happy as he follows her back into the press room.


Back at home, Peter calls for May, who doesn't answer, thinking she's not home. He sees a bad from Tony on his bed with his original Stark suit in it. He tries it on and takes his mask off with his back to the door. The door is open, and you can see May standing in the doorway watching Peter, who doesn't see her. She screams ""WHAT THE FU-"" before the credits start rolling.



CREDITS: - the first shows Toomes being walked to his prison cell. He's approached by a guy with medical pins in his right arm, a scar on his face, and a scorpion tattoo on his neck. He asks Toomes if he knows who Spidey is, because he has some friends on the outside that want him dead. Toomes takes a moment and tells Mac that if he knew who he was, he would've killed him already. I assume he saved Spidey's identity because he saved his daughter and saved his life so his daughter wouldn't go without a father. - The second is a joke scene. It's a white screen and Cap walks up and faces us. This is him filming a PSA. He tells us the importance of having patience, and it can be important when you're waiting for something you think will be important, but is ultimately a waste of your time (poking fun at us for sitting in the theater, waiting for some big reveal when it's just a joke). He then looks off camera and asks how many more of these he has to do.



Other things: - Donald Glover plays Aaron Davis/Prowler. He's seen trying to buy weapons from Toomes' team but tells them he doesn't want anything that extreme. Peter's watching from a bridge and his phone goes off and the sellers think he brought someone to jump them and they pull a gun on him. Peter jumps down and tells them to aim at him instead. Later, Peter goes to Davis for info about the guys and tells them that he doesn't want those weapons in his neighborhood because he has a nephew that lives nearby, confirming that Miles Morales exists in the MCU - Michelle's character is playfully mean to Peter, but you get hints that she subtly likes him. She's also one of the few characters that's always paying attention to him. - The Osborns and JJJ and Gwen are not referenced at all in the movie. I didn't see any Bugle references."
6jarlz,26,2017-06-24,"My friend [25/m] has ghosted me [24/f] three times. Every time it happens, it hurts beyond belief but he keeps ending up in my life",Ghostbusterthrow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jarlz/my_friend_25m_has_ghosted_me_24f_three_times/,"I first met Ryan when I was a freshman in college. He was a sophomore and gave me lots of advice. I'm not sure how it happened but we became best friends. In fact, we were so close that lots of people (even some professors) thought we were dating. We would just laugh it off. 


That summer we had an internship in the same city so we shared an apartment and our friendship got even stronger. However when the fall semester started, I noticed that Ryan was trying to ghost me. He wasn't really responding to my texts and always had an excuse for why he couldn't hang out. I saw on Facebook that he was very active with his other friends since he had new photos almost everyday so I knew it was something to do with me. I wasn't going to beg him to be my friend so I just blocked his fb page so I wouldn't have to see the photos.



I started examining our friendship and trying to figure out if I had done anything wrong. I thought that maybe it was because he was popular and I wasn't? Although we were in college, there were definitely social hierarchies and Ryan belonged to a prestigious ""secret"" society while I was a nobody. 

I definitely gave him space so it wasn't like I was clingy. I had my own life and my own priorities. It really wrecked my self esteem because I kept trying to figure out what was wrong with me to make him end our friendship. 

Anyway, an entire academic  year passed and my parents announced they were moving to a new city that happened to be Ryan's hometown. Shortly after school ended, I sent Ryan a text telling him that my parents had moved to his city. I think I was really hoping to just rekindle our friendship and this seemed like something relevant.

He said that he would only be  home for one week because of an internship abroad, but he offered to give me a tour of the town. When he left for his internship, he kept in contact with me and even surprised me with tickets to visit him.

Okay so it seems like things were okay but by the time Ryan was in the final semester of college, he started doing a slow fade. I recognized it and just gave up. His mom invited me to his graduation party but I didn't go. This was back in 2014. 

A few months, I got a call from Ryan because we got into the same PhD program. I was really excited and I'm not going to lie, I was thinking that maybe this is just a sign that we're meant to be friends. I know that the cosmos doesn't really give a fuck but I had missed him a lot.

We never brought up the ghosting  (and I never mentioned it the first time, either). I desperately wanted to ask him why he felt it was okay to enter my life whenever he pleaded without thinking about how I feel. Everything felt fragile and so I just spent time with him as if nothing had ever happened.

I was afraid to send him long messages or talk too long on the phone with him because I wanted it to seem like I didn't care too deeply about him.

Now, he's doing it again. It's been an entire week since he's responded to my message. I have been crying a lot today because I'm so tired of him doing this to me. He doesn't do this to anyone else. I would just like a reason, you know?

Every time he does this, it wrecks me. He's the only person to ever do this to me and I make and retain friends easily (except for him, of course) so it's not like I'm a shitty person.

Can someone please help me figure out what to do? I'm going to be seeing him for the next few years and he has caused me so pain. 

**tl;dr**: Friend that I've known for six years pushes me away when convenient. It hurts and makes me feel like trash. I'm stuck seeing him for the next 5ish years. How do I deal with this?"
6jaw1c,8,2017-06-24,Just another wave,smelerby,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/6jaw1c/just_another_wave/,"Had a stressful day at work. I work a side job in the weekends and some evenings and sometimes it's just a little too much next to my internship and dealing with a heartbreak (maybe even depression). 

We went to grab a bite with coworkers when we were done and I had no appetite, I was feeling sick and exhausted. I wanted to cry for ""no reason"", but luckily I didn't. 

I'm home alone for 10 days, so when I got home around midnight it hit me even harder. The silence hurts. I let it all out and now I'm here again. 

I could say I want to reach out to my ex now, but that urge doesn't really increase when I start feeling worse. There's just a general wishing that she would reach out to me most of the days. I'm not going to do it. I just keep wishing she would and I don't know how to stop that. 

Anyways, I keep telling myself that these feelings are just the waves. Being home alone is going to be a struggle, but it's temporary. Overall I've been feeling better. Thinking or hearing about her doesn't hurt as much anymore, but I still love her and miss her a lot. I think that's going to take a freaking long time to fade. I'm having a hard time adjusting to the new reality, but I'm starting to head in the right direction I think. 

Just wanted to write down my feelings in this low moment. Thank you for reading."
6jb190,0,2017-06-24,Boyfriend doesn't want to relocate. What do I do ?,Honeybee37,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6jb190/boyfriend_doesnt_want_to_relocate_what_do_i_do/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years now; however, for all but a few months we have been long distance. He came to my hometown in the US from Europe one summer to do an internship, and we met and fell in love. At the time, I was 20 and still in college and he was 24 and finishing his Masters in his home country. He then decided to apply to a graduate program in the US, but he was a 2 hour plane ride away so we saw each other only about once or twice a month. 

When he finished his grad program, he lived with me for a few months, and then found a job in another city which is also a 2 hour plane ride away. He didn't even really search much for jobs in my city (ex: I think he only did 2 interviews here) because he was in a rush to find a job before his student visa expired. 

Since he has moved there, it's a similar situation in which we both only see each other once/twice per month, but we Skype and talk on the phone for hours, during which we have extremely interesting and stimulating conversations and we laugh hysterically and it's just awesome. When we are in person it's similar and it is always so hard to leave and gets more difficult each time. 

The problem is when we talk about our future and how we will finally find a way to be together permanently, he always suggests I move to where he is now. However, this would mean having to quit my job (which I worked really hard to get and is quite a good one considering my goals) and leave my family, who I am very close with, and all my friends, many of which I've known since childhood, to go to a city where I don't know anyone and where he doesn't really have any ties either. Also, my dad is terminally ill so I want to stay close to him and my family for that reason. Whenever I say this, however, he gets mad and says that he left his home and country to be with me and I won't move just a 2 hour plane ride away to be with him, and that he has made many sacrifices and I haven't made any. When I suggest that he lives in my hometown, he says it is too expensive (he makes 100+k a year so he could definitely afford it) and that he thinks it's important for couples to be independent of their families, which is ridiculous because my parents are not overbearing and would respect our privacy completely, and we wouldn't be living with them! 

Lastly, whenever I say I want an engagement ring one day (since he talks about us getting married), he says I am materialistic, even though I am not at all. I have never asked him to pay for me for anything or buy me anything and I take pride in being an independent woman and I don not want him to spend some obscene amount. Don't you think it's a bad sign that he is unwilling to do something simple to make me happy? Do you think I am really being selfish by not moving to him? Do you think I should leave him since we both seem unwilling to compromise? Maybe we should take a break to see what we both want? Please give me advice!

Tldr; my boyfriend doesn't want to move to where I am. Should I leave him?"

Sorry, I just need to vent a bit...

I just spent 3 hours alone with my mother to talk about the problems of my little sister.
Both of them live alone and they dent through a LOT of terrible things.  Things like rape, being abused by mean people, cops trying to ""stock"" them so my little sister follow the right path... 

My sister is now an intern at high School and has huge troubles to fit in her class. She has some friends but doesn't feel accepted. She knows she's not dumb, but she has zero confidence.

My mother is trying to help to tell her how to dress or behave, but I feel like it's just trying to fix the symptoms of a disease instead of the actual disease (my sister's lack of confidence).

I just spent two hours speaking with my mother. I'm now upset because she doesn't listen to me and always try to argue on everything I say, as if I was my sister's ""ally."" I left when she was almost crying because I told her not to repeat what the cop said to my sister because it hurted her.  That she should do everything to make my sister see a psychologist even though she doesn't want to...

All I was doing is trying to help them. It was almost 3 extremely frustrating hours. Got nowhere.
I don't know what to do. I feel bad and useless. 

My brother doesn't care ans doesn't do anything. I'm just suffering for nothing. I'm feeling so bad and I don't know what to do."
6jbt7g,4,2017-06-24,Just graduated! Any advice for a future film editor?,einaqua,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/6jbt7g/just_graduated_any_advice_for_a_future_film_editor/,"Hi everyone!

So I just graduated from Film Practice (London) and I am hugely passionate about editing. I have edited several short films and a few trailers, and I have a good CV (a professional producer helped me to improve it), I have experience (I did an internship at a high level post production company, I volunteered for the Homeless Film Festival, and I have been working for almost three years at the communications team of the SU, making and editing videos amongst other things).

I have been applying for post production runner jobs for a while now, and with every new application I write a new cover letter, always mentioning the company I am applying for and taking the time to carefully check what I'm saying. And I'm just getting rejections. 

The other day we had an industry screening at our university and I ended up giving my business card to Jan Harlan and Niall Moroney, and that was a boost of confidence!

Even though, I'm feeling a bit down. I know I need to be persistent, but I could use some advice, or maybe hear some of your stories? I know it's not supposed to be easy, but it would be great to see a clearer path to follow. 

Thanks a lot in advance!"

6jc3yz,7,2017-06-24,First time posting - looking for support during a hard time,scythelove,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6jc3yz/first_time_posting_looking_for_support_during_a/,"I have lurked on this board for a while. As a small introduction, I am a 22 year old transgender man who is currently in the process of graduating college (while also working.) I moved out of my parent's house at 17 (for reasons im sure you all understand from being on this subreddit) and am currently living with the most amazing, wonderful, kind, understanding, and healthily supportive partner I have ever had. I'm also polyamorous so at this time both my partner (call him D) and I are friends with benefits/casually dating our friend M. 

I recently left home to attend an internship for six weeks in another state so I'm away from them. Luckily there are some very nice interns here that are friendly to me as well; but at the same time I find myself doing really badly without my support system. At the same time, I understand I wasn't doing so good even when I was back home. As the semester started to end, I found myself dissociating and having more and more trouble focusing or dealing with anxiety. I have six more hours next fall and then I will have my degree so I have basically graduated and am dealing with that life transistion as well.

I find myself angry and upset that even though I do well in school, have good internships, like my work, have good partners, and am doing alright-ish financially, and am generally liked by my friends, I still find myself hating myself so much. Its become this werid situation where it feels like my life with my family (extremely abusive, my mother especially is a narcissist and very stressful and toxic to be around) was a dream (more like a nightmare). Any time I have to interact with my family or talk to my younger siblings and hear about the ways they are being mistreated (unfortunately legally mistreated for the most part) it triggers feelings of anger, self-loathing, stress, anxiety, and sadness. I was in counseling during the school year and will return next fall, and have been diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, and depression. I am on medication for it as well.

It's becoming so hard to reconcile what feels like the two halves of who i am. I feel like when im around my friends and at school I can often be happy and outgoing and feel good about myself and im generally a very entertaining and charismatic person. Not like in a weirdly boastful way, but in a way of saying im definitely not an introvert when Im able to forget some of the stressors in my life and feel supported.

Interacting with my parents makes me feel like a completely different person. And im angry at myself for that. I feel powerless when having to deal with my narcisstic parent's past abuse of myself, currently frustrations, and the current way she treats my siblings. At the same time i feel bad for her because I can tell she is not well. For example, she recently had to borrow over a thousand dollars from me to help my sister. My sister is trying to get her life back together after some legal trouble. She has to live with my mom who steals all of her earnings by pressuring her or explicitly telling her to give her money. She then spends the money on stupid things she doesn't need even though my entire family lives in extreme poverty. My sister can't save up to leave or to pay me back because my mother forces her to work and then takes all of her wages and if my sister tries to stop her, even politely, my mom goes off on her and starts insulting her. My mom treats my sister so badly, similar to the way she used to treat me. Name calling, guilt tripping, making a scene when they go out, etc. She also has started buying baby clothes for my sister's ""babies"" even though my sister has NO intentions of having children because she's trying to get her life together and on top of that her boyfriend is in JAIL. My sister is incredibly loyal to her partner too so it's not as if theres really a possibility of her getting pregant any other way. My mom is 40 but it feels like she is getting so out of touch with reality i wonder if she's got some other condition that is altering her ability to interact with reality or if her attention-seeing, narcisstic behaviour just makes her want to go to the store and buy these things so she can talk to people at the store about it. I've learned a long time ago she will waste precious money we dont have on things like getting her hair or makeup done (despite being a literal trained hair stylist herself) just so she can either abuse/yell at the people that work there, or gossip to them either a) about how proud she is of her kids/weddings/babies other things that make her feel important or b) complain about how awful everyone in her life is.

Thanks to anyone who is still here and reading. I just don't know how to deal with my mother. My whole family is pretty toxic in general, but I just get my anxiety triggered so much anytime I think about them, that situation, or any of it at all. I know people say to cut contact but it's not that easy for me. I have another even younger siblings that lives with them and I want to be there for that sibling which I can't do if my parents are upset with me. 

Sorry. I guess I'm just looking for support more than advice because it's not something that has an easy solution. I just feel better being able to vent/talk to other people so I don't feel so isolated in this suffering. I don't know how to navigate dealing with the ghost of such a stressful past. I still don't know how I got out and am doing okay. I don't feel like I ever know who I am because I feel like my entire life has been so fragmented/repressed/horrible. It's this werid thing where I'm definitely a functional adult, but in many ways I feel like a stunted child. I was just wondering if other people have felt this way and how they've learned to cope.

I'm just tired of the anxiety attacks, the health anxiety (a weird symptom of my stress that tends to pop up) and engaging in other harmful behaviours because when I get that stressed/out of it I start to worry I'm going to end up like my parents and be 'crazy' too. :("
6jc56k,1,2017-06-24,Advice needed in getting over a (quite) long term relationship? INFP x ENTJ,laerethel,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/6jc56k/advice_needed_in_getting_over_a_quite_long_term/,"Hello all, just needed to gain some insight... perspective.. or perhaps it's because I have nowhere else to turn with this and I'm looking for listening ears. I've been with my SO for 2years and we're bordering on 3 years already and just the other day we had a discussion that landslided into the situation I (we?) am(are) in. For context, I am 20 and he is 23 (&amp; an ENTJ, which really explains his behaviour). He is in university while I am working full time hoping to save money to eventually go back to university, although I still haven't decided on what to study. I have however, shortlisted 2-3 possible courses.

Basically, I could feel us growing distant and so had a discussion with him and it turns out he has been feeling like that for months. Without me knowing. With me thinking it was me who did something wrong. He feels that as we are not growing together in this relationship; he feels that he is the one constantly growing while I am still lost and confused about life. I have no goals/ambition, no idea where I see myself in 5 years while he is has goals to attain a scholarship since he is in school now, eventually intern at an established company to further his resume.... excel at his newfound hobbies like rock climbing. Meanwhile I am just easily contented. Perhaps too easily contented for him. He feels like I am not growing as a person, that I should explore all the hobbies I possibly can, expand my social circle, pick up a new skill etc. He also feels that he cannot share his joys and woes with me because I will ""never understand"" which is ridiculous to me, because I never saw this as an obstacle when he is so vastly different from me and he, likewise, never did and never will understand how I am feeling. I never saw this as an obstacle because I feel not everybody is going to like the same things as you, or feel troubled about the same things as you; but I felt that as long as we supported each other whether it's financially or emotionally, it will be ok (well apparently not). He says my emotional support is not enough, since telling me about his problems won't solve it anyway; but honestly if everyone could solve each other's problems nobody would be praying to God. We are on a 2 months time out right now and honestly, with how hurt I am right now, I don't know if we could ever get back again. 

I get where he is coming from as an ENTJ since they are sooooo obsessed with productivity and success.... but I feel like he is being unfair because he is projecting his ideas of growth onto me. Am I just being immature? I don't feel like I will significantly grow or progress by just randomly selecting hobbies to ""try out"", while it is true that you won't know you like a thing or not until you try it out, I feel that I am generally more in tune with my own emotions, likes and dislikes so if I am certain I don't like playing chess, I certainly never will? I feel like it is extremely unfair for him to say that he already has so many commitments in life which he is finding hard to juggle and he STILL has to worry about me being lost in life (??????) it feels like his own management problems to me? He also mentioned how I am too reliant on him for solutions, which really puzzled me because I have always vented to him because I thought he was my listening ear. Perhaps he thought his responses were solutions? It's almost as if he feels like my life will go to shit and I CANNOT live without him (which is certainly untrue, because honestly, I survived just fine alone before he came along.) He has siblings and have always been close to his parents while I am an only child; I feel like he always had people to look at to try and figure out what he wanted in life while I never did, so naturally of course I wouldn't know what I want in life at 20? 

I don't feel like I deserve these words because I feel like at least I am trying to earn money to support my university goal, I don't see how it is not growing when i am in an industry (something like nursing) I have never dabbled in &amp; everyday I am learning something new, whether it's related to what I want to do in the future or not. Medical jargon and procedures are really not simple and hence this is also why I can't understand why he thinks I don't challenge myself/am not up for challenges. I am sure he feels like I am not growing because he knows this is not going to be my career, but let's be honest I am doing this for the money so I can advance to my degree PLUS if I quit halfway not only is it hard to find a job again, he will probably use this as a point to argue that I am being immature to give up halfway. 

I just can't believe how he said I am no longer the version of a lifelong partner he envisioned when he is the one who suddenly shifted his life commitments/goals. Why is the blame projected onto me? I feel confused, because I most definitely have NEVER shown ANY signs that I am an overachiever or an ambitious person throughout the 3 years. It feels like he has something missing in his life and I am just a convenient scapegoat for the suffocation he is feeling. I feel like I can only figure out what I want when I have stability in life, and he was just that. My life does not revolve around him, but I knew if I needed his shoulders he would be there and I would do just the very same. Perhaps the most cruel thing of all was when I was sobbing so hard while we discussed on the phone and I gently asked him if he still loved me, to which he answered he ""doesn't know, and I haven't known for the last 4-5 months"". Then why did you waste my time? I feel so unbelievably hurt, not because I cannot live without him, but because for a moment I let myself believe I could be loved and have such a great relationship. I don't even know when he meant it and when didn't he. I don't know what to do and I don't know how this time out is supposed to help me. Am I being childish? What can I possibly do to salvage this? I am not crossing out salvaging this relationship as an option because I KNOW people change. Feelings change... but afterall, is love not about choice? To choose to consistently and constantly choose a person regardless of their flaws? 

P/S: just to clear things up, 
- he understands it is perfectly alright for someone to be easily contented with life, to just live day by day.... but that's just not a quality he realised he wants in a lifelong partner. 
- we are on a time out to figure out what ""we want in life"" and decide 2 months later if we still are for one another
- he says he feels angry with himself too, because we are just being ourselves but by just simply doing this we're making each other miserable. To this I agreed, because I always felt like I could see from his point of view but he will never understand I am coming from. 
- I feel like INFPxENTJ can work out because from the general characteristics, we do seem to complement.... but I just don't know anymore. I can't sleep and I can't eat."

6jca0b,0,2017-06-24,Help me start smoking again,NotHighButWillBeSoon,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/6jca0b/help_me_start_smoking_again/,"Hey r/trees, I need your advice!
So I took a break from smoking about two and a half months ago (for job purposes) but I think I'm close to being able to start back up again.

A little backstory:
Last summer, I got an internship with a government contractor. I live in a legal state, but I still had to take a break so I could pass their drug test. After I was hired, I went maybe another month before I started smoking  regularly. Fast-forward to last week, and now that I've graduated college, they hired me full time.

Because I worked at least once a week since I've started, I was told that I would not have to go through the rigorous background check again (which included the drug test). I stopped smoking just incase there would be another test, but after my first week, nobody has mentioned anything about it.

My question is how long would you guys wait? My plan was to wait another week before I stop by a dispensary, but wasn't sure if that's pushing it. This is my first full-time job, first time getting benefits from a company, is there anything I should be careful with? I've picked up from long term employees that random drug tests don't happen unless they have reasonable suspicion, so I think I'll be safe in that regard. Thanks in advance for any advice on my situation

6jcdc2,1,2017-06-24,My Boss is an Assclown And My Supervisor is a Twit,Red_PillCosby,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/6jcdc2/my_boss_is_an_assclown_and_my_supervisor_is_a_twit/,"I am currently working at a hotel restaurant 40 hours per week (sometimes as a houseman for banquets and sometimes as a restaurant host) even though I have a bachelor's degree and have a paid internship 20-30 hours per week in my field (at the hotel to try and get health benefits). 



I am a host. The supervisor is a blonde in her late 40's who hovers over me and gasps and starts panting heavily when a party of 5+ comes in. The day she got hired, she stuck her head up my ass and started telling me, ""Stand up straight, get your hands out of your pockets, etc."" like my mom or something. She asked me to train her at the host stand even though I had only been there 3 days and was trained by an incompetent employee who texted during her whole shift and had her baby daddy call the hotel's landline at the host stand during business hours. Let's just say we lost over a dozen restaurant staff within 2 weeks from the supervisor's first shift. She decided to put all the staff in a group text message (without notice) even though none of us have each other's numbers. I get texts about properly wrapping forks and knives in the restaurant's napkins (something that is the servers' job and not mine or any other host's job) at 12:30 AM on my days off. Some of the servers passive aggressively state in the group message that they cannot work and try to feed on the others for sympathy and convince someone to cover their shift. Normally during business hours, we are lucky to get 3-4 tables. 



The chef treats me like the dishwasher with down syndrome. He looks for reasons to get angry and take his emotions out on his staff. The incompetent hostess who finally quit (no call no show) during one of our busiest weekends took a reservation for 10 more than the restaurant's capacity and when the chef found out, he told me ""no more than 12 guests without confirmation from me or the supervisor."" A guest walks in weeks later and says he wants to dine with a party of 15. I go back and check with the chef and he says ""Well that's just common sense, you need to take some guests to cover your wages. Maybe you could call and shouldn't take more than 12 if I'm not here."" and the hotel manager said, ""You should know that already.""



The hotel purchased some board games for the lobby to attract guests to the restaurant and the chef came out to the host stand today and threw a fit about them being nearby as if I had anything to do with them. A week before, he chewed me out for having gum in my mouth and(had an episode in front of many guests). A couple weeks before that, he chewed me out for having my phone out, even though a few of the servers charge their phone at the bar in plain view. 



Earlier in my shift, he came out five minutes before the restaurant reopened for dinner and said, ""I need you to gather all the dinner menus and throw them away. I am printing some new menus and will bring them to you in a few minutes."" I said, ""No problem, I've got some menus right here."" He then said, ""I don't think you heard me correctly. I need you to take all the dinner menus and throw them out because I am bringing some new dinner menus out in a few minutes."" ...OK...


This evening we had a guest make a web reservation for the exact hour that the restaurant closes. We have no control over these reservations and the closing server(s) are not scheduled to a particular hour or time but until the guests are finished. The servers (who were scheduled to close) said they weren't going to wait for the reservation and that I needed to talk to the chef. I walked back to the kitchen and said, ""There is a web reservation for 10 PM and neither of the closing servers said they would stay for the reservation."" This is after our last table left around 8 PM and he would not let either server or myself leave. He looked me up and down like he was sizing me up for a good minute and had me send them back to him and not a word was said afterward. 



My internship ends on June 30th and there are no other jobs in the county. I don't deserve all of this, I was just trying to get some health insurance. I have been applying to various jobs in an hour radius from here for 6 months and have had grocery stores 30 minutes away from me email back 3 weeks later and tell me they found more qualified candidates (mind you I have a bachelor's degree in a media related field and 8 years of grocery store experience). 



Not sure what to do at this point. I do not need to list this place on my resume since I worked here during the same time frame as my internship, but I can't find any other work. I may move back home and pay my rent here for 6 more months (since I'm stuck in my lease and don't want to ruin my spotless credit) since I know I can find work there. 



I have strongly considered showing up during my 3rd shift houseman shifts where I am setting up for 200-300 people and it takes my entire shift to setup (and I finish 30 minutes to 1 hour before the banquet) and tearing everything down and leaving and screwing them. Have also considered just no call no showing and Google reviewing/Yelping the place from an employee's perspective and telling them how messed up it is. Soiling the chef's reputation in the small town I'm in. Maybe reaching out to the local newspaper about it. 



I'm tired of being treated like an idiot even though the chef went to vocational school and the supervisor has no education and I have a bachelor's degree (am the only person in the place who has one IIRC). I'm tired of the passive aggressive and condescending communication and people using me as an outlet for their negative emotions without cause or concern.



I have developed respect for all of you kitchen and restaurant workers who treat this as a real profession and have to deal with all of that. I don't know why it has to be such a hostile work environment or if it is like that everywhere, but I am not going to last here. 



If you read this far, thanks for listening. Felt good to get that off my chest. Goodnight!"
6jcjja,1,2017-06-25,Crisis puts future of Saudi reforms and GCC in doubt,assousa,MiddleEastNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiddleEastNews/comments/6jcjja/crisis_puts_future_of_saudi_reforms_and_gcc_in/,"By James M. Dorsey

A three-week-old, Saudi-UAE-led diplomatic and economic boycott of Qatar threatens to complicate newly promoted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reform plans and undermine the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the Middle East’s most successful regional association.
Designed to impose Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘s will on a recalcitrant Qatar, the boycott suggests that power politics irrespective of cost trump the need for reforms in Prince Mohammed’s world.

The stakes for 31-year old Prince Mohammed and Saudi Arabia’s ruling Al Saud family are high. Failure to deliver sustainable economic and social reforms could undermine the prince’s popularity whose age has allowed him to connect with significant segments of the kingdom’s youth, who account for two thirds of the population, in ways his predecessors could not.

“The isolation of Qatar is but one example of how the politics of the Gulf Arab states are getting in the way of economic diversification and transformation,” said Karen E. Young, a senior scholar at The Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, in an analysis of the impact of the Gulf crisis on the region’s economic reform plans. Ms. Young noted that the depth of the crisis and the hardening of positions on both sides of the divide “suggests that economic growth and the liberalization of these political economies are secondary priorities for all parties involved.”

Irrespective of how the Gulf crisis is resolved, it already has damaged institutional as well as informal building blocks of a restructuring of the Saudi as well as the region’s economy. The GCC that groups Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain, has suffered a body blow that it may not survive.

Continued Qatari membership is in doubt with the Gulf state’s refusal to accept Saudi-UAE demands that would end its at times provocative policies and render it a vassal of the kingdom. Kuwait and Oman are likely, in the wake of the crisis, to be more reticent about further regional integration, having long charted relatively independent, albeit less boisterous, courses for themselves.

The fragility of GCC unity beyond Qatar was already on public display three years ago when then US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel backed a Saudi push for greater military integration. In a rare public statement against Gulf union, Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef bin Alawi al-Ibrahim, a one-time representative of a separatist movement, rejected the proposal in no uncertain terms.

""We absolutely don’t support Gulf union. There is no agreement in the region on this… If this union materializes, we will deal with it but we will not be a member. Oman’s position is very clear. If there are new arrangements for the Gulf to confront existing or future conflicts, Oman will not be part of it,"" Mr. Al-Ibrahim said.

The Omani official argued that the Gulf’s major problems were internal rather than external and should be the region’s focus. Earlier, Ahmed al-Saadoun, at the time speaker of the Kuwaiti parliament, also rejected a Gulf union, saying that as a democracy Kuwait could not unite with autocratic states.

This week, UAE State Minister for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash suggested that Qatar and the GCC would have to part ways if the Gulf state refused to accept demands by its detractors that effectively emasculate it and put it under guardianship. It’s unlikely that Kuwait and Oman would back such a move, which could split the six-nation association down the middle. Kuwait responded to the crisis by seeking to mediate while Oman helped Qatar circumvent the boycott by allowing Qatari vessels to dock at its ports.

Complicating Prince Mohammed’s reform plans, laid out in a document entitled Vision 2030, is the kingdom and the UAE’s handling of the crisis as well as a renewed 20 percent drop in oil prices since January. The crisis, beyond the balance between power politics and economic necessity, raises questions about key issues needed to inspire confidence in an effort to diversify the kingdom’s economy, streamline its bloated public sector, and strengthen the private sector.

Sanctions imposed on Qatar challenge concepts of equitable rule of law, the principle of freedom of movement, security of private ownership, and a modicum of freedom of expression in a region in which that basic right is already severely restricted. The sanctions include a ban on travel to Qatar; ordering Saudi, Emirati, and Bahraini nationals to leave the Gulf state; expelling Qatari nationals; shuttering offices of Qatari companies and ejecting Qatari-owned assets, including thousands of Qatari camels and sheep; prompting expelled Qataris to fire sell assets held in the Gulf states opposed to it; and closing airspace for flights to and from Doha.

Restrictions on freedom of expression were taken to new heights with a ban on expressions of sympathy for Qatar that in the UAE could earn someone sporting an FC Barcelona jersey with the logo of Qatar Airway, the sponsor of the Spanish soccer giant, 15 years in prison. Space for creativity, a prerequisite for building a 21st century knowledge economy, was further cast in doubt by the Gulf states’ unprecedented effort to force closure of more freewheeling Qatari media, including the controversial Al Jazeera television network.

As the crisis drags on, concern is likely to rise among the Gulf’s trading partners, oil and gas customers, and migrant labour suppliers. Those concerns are reinforced by fears that protagonists on both sides of the Gulf divide are likely to emerge from the crisis bruised and with their reputations tarnished irrespective of how the dispute is resolved.

A survey of young Saudi men conducted by Mark C. Thompson, a Middle East scholar at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals laid out what is at stake for Prince Mohammed. Mr. Thompson concluded that youth in the kingdom were willing to buy into Vision 2030’s concept of providing economic deliverables in exchange for acceptance of an absolute monarchy that limits basic freedoms.

“There was consensus amongst these young men that reducing unemployment, providing affordable housing and decent healthcare should be the government’s ‘top priorities’ as these issues are considered the most contentious and problematic in wider society: as one young man argues ‘basically if we have these then everything else is satisfactory’,” Mr. Thompson said.

The scholar noted however that initial enthusiasm for Prince Mohammed’s vision “has evaporated amongst some young men, who complain that whilst they were hopeful when the Vision was launched, as the months have passed they see few tangible results.” Mr. Thompson argued that performance was crucial because Prince Mohammed’s reform plans, the boldest to date, come on the back of earlier promises of change by Saudi leaders that never materialized.

Further undermining confidence is the fact that Prince Mohammed’s plan involves a unilateral rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract that offered a cradle-to-grave welfare state in exchange for political fealty and acceptance of Sunni ultra-conservatism’s austere moral and social codes. “The problem is that Vision 2030 has become synonymous with cutting salaries, taxing people and stop-ping beneﬁts,” Mr. Thompson said.

Saudis have, since the introduction of cost-cutting and revenue-raising measures, seen significant rises in utility prices and greater job uncertainty as the government sought to prune its bloated bureaucracy and encourage private sector employment. Slashes in housing, vacation and sickness benefits reduced salaries in the public sector, the country’s largest employer, by up to a third.

‘I was an intern at a SANG (Saudi Arabian National Guard) hospital and most people there were angry about the Vision because their salaries were being cut. The soldiers around here are also angry because they work all the time. It’s unfair to take SAR 1000 ($266.50) from a 5,000 salary. My military father is angry because most of his salary and allowances have been cut. Some people’s incomes have already been reduced by 30% (except if you are a soldier in the south). It seems that the government wants to solve the current economic problems by force. They are doing this by raising taxes but not explaining anything to us. Prices keep rising regardless!” Mr. Thompson quoted a medical student as saying.

Increased grumbling and online protests persuaded the government in April to roll back some of the austerity measures and restore most of the perks enjoyed by government employees. Mr. Thompson cautioned that to succeed, implementation of Prince Mohammed’s “vision needs to be accountable and transparent, in other words a model of good governance… It is the government’s responsibility to ensure that young Saudis feel they are part of the National Transformation Plan, because if young Saudis believe they can make meaningful contributions to national development, then they will contribute.”

A foiled attempt this month by the Islamic State to attack the Grand Mosque in the holy city of Mecca was likely an effort to undermine Prince Mohammed’s reform plans that involve a loosening of Sunni Muslim ultra-conservativism’s strict and austere social codes and morals. A siege of the mosque in 1979 prompted the government to give the kingdom’s ultra-conservative religious establishment greater control of public mores.

The kingdom’s religious establishment has criticised Prince Mohammed’s social liberalization effort, including introduction of modern forms entertainment, but largely endorsed his economic plans. Social change has been embraced by a significant swath of Saud Arabia’s youth.

A 24-year-old speaking to The Guardian, cautioned however that ultra-conservatism maintains a hold on significant numbers of young people. “You know that the top 11 Twitter handles here are Salafi clerics, right? We are talking more than 20 million people who hang on their every word. They will not accept this sort of change. Never,” the youth said.

Also I have zero idea what my chances are. I double majored in bio and psych, minor in chem. I've previously compted x-ray school and have about 900 volunteer hours. I also completed a patient care internship. But... My GPA is right at a 3.0. I have a full month to commit to prepping for the GRE and typically do well with verbal/reasoning tests. I'll have to brush up on my math. 

Any advice or input is appreciated. Basically I'm panicked because I feel like I'm late to the party and don't know what's going on!

It's getting tougher and tougher as we both moved to new countries and it's hard for both of us to keep up old routines and calls. Lately we've been fighting a lot because I feel like he's not putting in enough effort as he used to for the relationship since he's always out socializing with friends rather than calling. He tells me he's frustrated that he doesn't know how to show that he cares when we're physically apart and he can't just hug me and make things better. We're going to be like this until next April when I'm done my internship and he's done military, then we're moving in together so I can finish my last year of school. I'm happy that we have an end date to this long painful distance, but sometimes it feels really lonely and it's hard to keep believing that it will work out or that it will be worth it at the end...
I wanted to ask you guys, what are some ways for you to show your SO that you care and love them when you're apart? The little things that keep the flame alive and makes them believe that you still care and that the relationship is worth it?"

From 2014 until this time last year, I lived away from home while my girlfriend pursued her graduate degree. While there, I had a difficult time finding work because of severe anxiety/depression. 

To make a long story short, I started a computer science program and racked up $10k in student loans while there. We moved back home about a year ago, and I transferred to a nearby university. I had temporary work in the fall - related to my IT background - but they ran out of work for us. I blew through the rest of my savings over the spring semester. I had about $10k saved up from working part-time 2012 to 2014 when I moved.

Luckily, I began a software development internship toward the end of May. I am making about $15/hr, 35 hrs/wk. My current monthly expenses are approximately $1100/mo, so I feel like I'm doing okay. The internship can extend into the semester, but I will only be working about 20 hrs/wk which doesn't leave much room for other things - whatever's not covered after financial aid, books, etc.

I also have about $4500 in an IRA, but I haven't made any contributions in a couple of years. Last I remember, it was a 0.33% CD, so I know I need to figure out how to roll that over to somewhere with better rates.

My girlfriend and I would like to get married in the near future, so I am basically trying to figure out what actionable steps I can do now to start helping our financial future. We are both low-spenders and live below our means, so I feel good about that. I'm familiar enough with PF from several years ago when I was able to save nearly 90% of my income, but my finances have become more complicated since then. I think the next thing is looking at getting a cashback credit card that my bank (Ally) offers to use for gas &amp; groceries. 

My student loans are currently in deferment, so I'm not sure if I should start paying down on the unsubsidized loans now, or if it would be better to put that money into savings until after I graduate and start working full-time again.

Are these reasonable steps to take? Do you have any other suggestions that might help us?"
6jdh9w,12,2017-06-25,"frigid reads, a review ""Monstress Vol I: Awakening By Marjorie Liu, Art by Sana Takeda""",frigidmagi,Fantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6jdh9w/frigid_reads_a_review_monstress_vol_i_awakening/," Monstress is an dark epic fantasy comic published by Image Comics, it has been running since 2015. Its author Marjorie Liu was born in Philadelphia to a father from Taiwan and a mother from the United States; she spent her early life reading. She attended Lawrence University in Appleton Wisconsin, which is where she first got into comics books. While she was familiar with the X-Men due to the 1990s animated series (if you haven't seen it, try it out!) it wasn't until college that she started reading the comics and writing... well, fan fiction. Fan fiction for those of you who might be entirely aware are stories written about fiction universes by fans, like if your little brother wrote his own Superman stories for example. Honestly I'm rather supportive of fan fiction, it's a good place to practice your writing skills and learn how to write other characters. Anyway, after graduating, Ms. Liu went to law school at the University of Wisconsin and even did intern work for the US Embassy in Beijing. She grew disillusioned with law practice after that however and returned to writing.  First she wrote poetry, short stories and novels but after seeing a small boy in a Spider-man costume, she thought it would be awesome to write for Marvel. She ended up writing a number of X Men tie in novels and NYX, an X-Men spin off comic. Sana Takeda was born in Niigata Japan, while she started out as a CGI designer for SEGA, she is now a veteran comic book artist, having done work for Aspen, Image and Marvel comics (most famously doing the art for the Ms. Marvel comics (the blonde one, before Marvel decided to do the obvious thing and make her Captain Marvel). Now let's talk about the comic, shall we?


 The world of Monstress is a sharply and likely unnecessarily divided one. On one side we have the Federation of Man, ruled from the shadows by the all girl religious order of the Cumaea. The Cumaea are women with psychic powers and access to a hidden science which allows them to extend their lives and enhance their powers at a hideous cost, but I'll come back to that. On the other side we have the Arcanics, who really aren't a race, yes, I'll explain. Leading arcanic society is a group of beings known as Ancients. They're--to be blunt on the matter--immortal beast men, who have a number of magical powers and from time to time like to dally with humans. The Arcanics are the offspring of such unions, some look entirely human, most don't. They live divided into two courts, the Court of Dusk and the Court of Dawn. This leads me back to the method through which the Cumaea get their extended lives and powers. It's called Lilium and the only way you can get it is by rendering the bodies or bones of Arcanics or Ancients. The “witch-nuns” of the Cumaea would use their Lilium fueled powers to take over the Federation of Man from within and goad it into war with the Arcanics. It was a brutal and devastating conflict made all the worse by the atrocities the Cumaea would lead humanity into in order to feed their need for Lilium. Arcanics were enslaved, experimented on, murdered and chopped up,  not always in that order. The war ended in a truce, when something caused utter destruction at a place called Constantine. The Arcanics convinced the Cumaea that it was a new magic weapon and they would use it again.


 Our main character Maika Halfwolf was at Constantine and survived, the war did not leave her unscarred however; she lost her mother and her arm. She also gained something, what she gained is more of an open question. It is not an open question however, of how insanely dangerous that thing is, for something sleeps inside of Maika Halfwolf and when it wakes, people die. It's not like Maika really understands what's lurking inside of herself either, in fact she spends the entire story on a quest for answers. Answers like “what did you people do to my mother?”,  “What did my mother have to do with you?”, and  “What did my mother do to me and what the hell is going on?”. This quest is going to involve Maika going into the very sanctuary of her enemies to find clues to the answer and then to escape with what she's learned. Meanwhile everyone else is starting to figure out what is going on and their reaction is to panic and Maika's quest may restart a war that no one human or otherwise can afford to have restart. Joining Maika in this quest is Kappa the young Arcanic who Maika liberates from the illegal slave pens of the Cumaea and Ren the cat (cats are a mystic race, who seem to add tails as they get older and more powerful).  Kappa doesn’t really do much but act frightened but determined, while Ren serves as the voice of reason in the group.  Which means his job is to be utterly ignored until everything Maika has tried has failed, which is less often than you would think.


 Most of the book is taken up with Maika's rampage, subsequent escape and the consequences of both. Now Ms. Liu has avoided the trap of making everyone on one side to be monsters and everyone on the other side shining paladins. We run into good humans (one minor character named Emila is frankly the moral and upright character in the book, risking her life to save people she doesn't know simply because it's the right thing to do) and bad Arcanics. Even our bad guys for the most part show positive emotions like love and affection. Which only highlights the terrible effect that racism has on both sides have when you see characters be loving and gentle and then turn into cold blooded torturers because they've decided their target isn't a person and has no rights. What underscores for it me is that this has all been deliberately stoked and fed (there are repeated mentions in the book how Arcanics and Humans were once much closer as little as 3 generations ago) so a small elite group of women can have an excuse to use fellow sapient beings as fuel. What I do like is this is never spelt out for the reader, you're not clubbed over the head with an Aesop as Ms. Liu seems to trust you can figure this out on your own once you've been informed of the facts.


 The art is amazing, it's manga influence but avoids the excesses of the styles (just about everyone is drawn fairly realistically) and blends in a heavy influence of western style creating something rather lovely to the eye in my opinion. Ms. Takeda should be praised for her work. Additionally the writing is very well done, the characters have layers to their personalities, the dialogue is interesting with different characters having different speaking styles and the story is entertaining and manages to avoid being too predictable. I am constantly shown not told things and the setting is peeled back slowly and carefully. Folks, take notes this is how you do an epic fantasy in comic form. Ms. Liu was nominated for an Eisner for best new series and I think she earned that nomination. Monstress by Ms. Liu and Ms. Takeda has earned itself an A. I'm already lined up for volume II which will be coming out this year.    Keep reading!

6jdl7o,160,2017-06-25,"My [22 M] GF [21 F] is intent on medical school, but I'm not sure it's the best path for her.",throwaway234897923,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jdl7o/my_22_m_gf_21_f_is_intent_on_medical_school_but/,"**BACKGROUND**

My girlfriend and I recently graduated* college. We met sophomore year and have been dating since then (~2.5 years), living together for ~1 year. She's always been intent on being a doctor. She majored in biochemistry, but had significant trouble keeping up with her classes. Her GPA was pretty low (barely above 2.5) and the * next to graduation is because she technically didn't graduate because she didn't pass two of the core biochem classes. Her MCAT scores were on the low end, and she lacks the extra-curricular activities to create a solid application even if her grades/test scores were high up. This isn't me being pessimistic/negative towards her, this is how she explained it to me as I'm not familiar with what's considered a ""good"" MCAT score, or the degree of extra-curriculars you need for a proper med school application.

I ran internships throughout our time in undergrad, and I'm starting at an extremely competitive job next month. Worth noting, the job is competitive because it's low-stress and pays well, so I'm not worried about starting there putting strain on our relationship by it wearing me out. That being said, I know she feels put off by me starting work and graduating. I was able to graduate without any debt, while her parents took out loans to pay for her to go to school. They aren't very attentive (they shouldn't need to be since we're adults), but after she told them she didn't technically graduate, they were livid. They yelled at her for it and her mother barrages her with messages about how I will never respect her and that I won't love her if her career is inferior to my own. I reassure her as much as I can that I love her for who she is, and that I don't care what job she has as long as she's happy. She's insistent that she wants to be a doctor, and I believe her.

**THE PROBLEM**

Now, given her low GPA, MCAT, and extra-curriculars, she didn't apply to any schools for this upcoming year. I think that makes sense, based on the statistics she showed me it would've just been a waste of money. However, she's decided to work part time as a medical scribe and complete a Master's program at another local university to bring up her grades and create a stronger application. In her own words, the Master's program is technically part of a prestigious school, but they make it extremely overpriced to accept anyone who applies and can pay.

That being said, I know this is what she wants, and I want to support that. Her father is a successful entrepreneur. She randomly comes up with incredibly strong business ideas that I think have tons of potential, to the point where I'm confident someone must already be doing it. I look up her ideas, and usually it's already being done to strong success, but there are a few that I think she should take advantage of. I told her maybe it would be worth pursuing them, and if she can make some more money, then she can go to medical school without all the debt/stress/pressure.

However, she sees this as straying from the right path to becoming a doctor. She only wants to do medical internships/jobs, and for someone with just an undergraduate degree (not even a degree right now), that leaves extremely low-paying work, which would take an obscene amount of time to allow saving for medical school.

I've talked to her about everything mentioned in this post, except for one thing: I don't know how she'll even be able to handle medical school. Undergraduate was extremely easy, it's *supposed* to be easy, and she didn't pass those core classes due to not turning in work. I know medical school is supposed to be a million times more difficult, but she laughs off the difficulty like it's a joke because she knows ""it's what she really wants."" I don't want to tell her she can't do it, when we met I was at a low point where no one thought I would be able to graduate, but she carried me through it to the amazing point I'm at right now.

I care about her, and she's always stood by me. I want to be supportive for her with this, but I feel like I should be showing her that this is a mistake. She understands the danger, but she just doesn't seem to care. What do I do?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend seems unprepared for medical school. Still intent on going despite the the pressure that failing to graduate would leave her with debt and few job prospects given the route she's set on. She doesn't care, is insistent on pursuing it this way because it's her passion. What do I do?

Edit: I realized I initially flaired this wrong because the dating tag is for &lt;1 month. Sorry about that.

Edit 2: Got rid of the finance stuff. Thanks everyone!"

So it makes no fucking sense to me that they'd do something as illogical as this: They put me in a full-time Quran memorization (hifz) program. I fucking despise every second of it. I was pulled out of education almost two years ago at the end of eighth grade and started this retarded program when I was supposed to be starting high school, and have barely gotten any education beyond since, so I've had to rely on myself and the internet for education, using resources like udemy, Coursera, Khan academy, etc.
I'm just sick of it. Every single fucking day for the past two years I've been forced to read that book in a language I don't understand, listen to retarded hadiths, and memorize that awful book, in a class taught by two psychotic Maulanas. They have a girls program too, but of course it's segregated. 

But fortunately, being in this program gave me a lot of ammo against them and Muslims in general. I decided to study the Quran in English, and read up on hadiths. Ive learned more about Islam in these two years than most will in their lives. Of course it came off as insane drivel, which isn't surprising. But over this time, I've gathered up some main points to use against them:

• The scientific ""miracles"" are bunk (scientific and miracle shouldn't even go in a fucking sentence together) 

• The Quran is full of ""science"" that is completely retarded, and since the Quran is accepted as absolute truth Muslims believe in these ludicrous things. (The entire story of Adam basically, Noah, Allah splitting the moon, the entire story of Nuh, Mohammad flying to jennah on a horse, jinns, angels, the earth being flat, I really could go on) 

• Islam's treatment of women. From women essentially being seen as objects who need to be covered since their bodies are seen as fitna and shameful, to having little girls be forced into hijab (One thing that sickens me is seeing girls as young as 6 in a hijab, which inherently demeans and sexualizes them). To them being seen as inferior and needing men as maintainers, to Mohammad himself commenting that a woman's intelligence is inferior, to women having half the court testimony, and requiring four males to prove rape, again I could go on with examples, Islam is a ridiculously misogynistic religion. Again, the Quran is seen as unquestionable word of God and the (sahih) hadiths Come straight from good old village-slayin child-marryin' Mohammad, these are accepted by the Muslim community. 

• Speaking of which, CHILD MARRIAGE. Mohammad married Aisha when she was six and consumated at nine. Need I say more? Why was the model for all of mankind marrying and fucking a kid? The excuse I heard at one Khutbah was ""divine inspiration"" LMAO as if. 

• The self serving nature of Islam. Mohammad tended to receive very self serving revelations, such as when he made his adopted son divorce his wife to marry him. Also how since he was the messenger from none other than sky sugardaddy Allah himself, he was entitled to 11 wives while other men get four. (Although men getting to have 4 wives in general is fucked up enough). Also how the rewards in jannah seem to serve men like 72 virgins (Don't give me the mistranslation bullshit). Is there anything remotely like this for women? What so they're just gonna sit around getting cucked by their husbands in jannah? 

• Mohammad's character in general. Overall Mohammad was a very smart man, but he was a control freak, warlord, misogynist homophobe, and hated joy. I've already gone into misogyny, so let's cover other bases. He was a major control freak and narcissist, he slaughtered entire villages, and he had his critics assassinated. He was incredibly suspicious and narcissistic, and called on his followers to attack people who oppose him. From islams beginnings in Mecca, contrary to popular belief Muslims were the ones stirring up problems in Mecca, being the ones to attack the quraysh. Islam was intended to be the dominant religion, not an equal to the ones in Mecca. Similar to modern cult leaders. He also seemed to despise joy, labeling them many things from fitna, bidah, or shirk. He banned alcohol, music, dancing, dating, chess and other board games, making art that went beyond lines, so painting, sculpting, or things like that, having dogs around the house, hell even laughing too much. I know there's some that I'm forgetting. He managed to convince his followers that the best use of their time was to constantly pray, read Quran, and praise Allah unquestionably. This made him a great cult leader. Again, not to be questioned since cognitive dissonance is a fundamental part of Islam. 

• Regression in general. Being the control freak he was, Mohammad hated free thought. This is why Islamic societies don't create much of anything technologically, economically, scientifically, culturally, or socially. He banned music and severely restricted art labelling them as fitna and art as gateways to idolatry. He was also anti science since being proven wrong would make him lose his grip, and scientific discoveries contradictive to what Islam teaches like evolution or the earth being round, the moon not being split in fucking half, are often rejected completely. This leads to modern day Islamic civilizations punching far below their weight. Also, Islam doesn't frowns on debate, which also holds it back, since these practices go on unquestioned, and ulema are considered the most respected, perfect, blessed in the community and go unquestioned. 

• Homophobia. It was seventh century Arabia and Mo was definitely a product of his time. Men who ""commit"" homosexual acts are sentenced to death. 

• Allah Subhana wa taala Himself. This guy is a fucking charity case. He created an utterly logical world and expects us to believe in shit like 950 year old men, 50 foot tall men, splitting the moon, men being made of clay, etc? And he sent a pedophile warlord in arabia as his messenger, which isn't the most efficient way to get your message across. He also seems to be majorly insecure, requiring his followers to be in constant unquestioning submission to him, and constantly be spreading his message to his other ""creations"". Speaking of which, he seems to hate a huge amount of them. Jews, gays, women, people who leave his religion, kuffar in general, proud people, artists, etc. He constantly seems to want his followers to be kissing his ass constantly as if he has someone to impress. Doesn't seem very holy or beautiful to me. 

So basically, these are my main points against Islam. Of course there's plenty more. Way more. Sorry for that long ass wall of text but yeah. So what the hell should I do? I'm at a loss. I know good arguments against Islam, and I'm tired of stepping in that fucking masjid everyday to memorize that book of shit surrounded by other kids screaming that drivel. I want a real education, a real chance for employment, but I feel like being in this class, surrounded by boys, often younger then me, and being forcefed this hateful drivel has had an effect on me. I feel like I've socially regressed. Idk how if I was re-enrolled in education I'd be able to do socially, especially around women. I just fucking hate it and thinking about these things drive me up the wall! I want to get out. I live in the USA, the land of opportunity. Why in the fuck should I be going to a faith school here??? And why are so many other kids forced into it too by their idiot, fundamentalist parents, whose kids intern become fundamentalists, who probably will integrate with society far worse than I will, if at all! Please help guys I don't know what to do, I already have depression and anxiety, just good at masking it, and frankly I just don't know what to do. It would break my parents hearts to hear me speak against Islam, but idk what else to do at this point. I'm so fucking tired of it. I kinda wanna come out dramatically, like during a recitation of surah Al kafirun scream ""Ayy this is a shout-out to me"" or something lol, but that won't work. Please help guys, thank you in advance.

6jeonm,8,2017-06-25,Digital documents minimalism,frogkisser,minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/6jeonm/digital_documents_minimalism/,"Hi all!

I wouldn't say I'm specifically a minimalist in my life, but I've always had a very strong focus on only keeping the things I really need, especially when it comes to paper and documents and such. I tend to toss class notes at the end of the semester, sell off textbooks I no longer need, etc. In everything, furniture, clothes, books, whatever, I aim to reduce clutter. It's pretty nice.

I do have one thing, what I call my ""memory box"" - basically an old shoe box where I've tossed some old things I can't bear to throw out or *may* need - very old health records, or acceptance letters to college, old diaries, etc. Everything that is a memento goes into this box, and even so I tend to clean it out once a year or so and toss out things that've lost meaning for me. 

Today I turned my eye on my digital files. I do keep careful paper records of stuff I need (contracts, diplomas, etc.) as well as scans of them, just in case. I also have the typical computer stuff - music, photos, stuff I've saved (usually wallpapers). 

I have two big folders I'd love advice on. One is my old artwork / creative stuff. The other is a folder of all my academic work of nearly 10 years - from junior year of high school to the end of my Master's. 

The old art folder I've cleaned up a bit and would like to keep - even if I'd just love to print stuff out and stuff it back into my memory shoe box. 

I'm a bit stumped with what to do with my academic stuff. I've just graduated ~ month ago, and I've just realized that aside from the current active semester, I've never once gone back and looked through my academic stuff. These are folders with digital notes, course lecture powerpoints, case studies, etc. I've kept most textbooks (always ebooks) separately in Calibre. 

I don't know what to do with these. If I specifically open them, I might be like ""OH! i'd love to read this"", or to see which courses I had taken that specific year or semester, as each would be very carefully labeled. On the other hand, aside from ""big"" work like me senior projects or my bachelor's thesis, I doubt there are any files there that have anything more than sentimental value at this point. 

I'm a business major, so not really an engineer or STEM who might have a lot of use from old class notes, as I can find pretty much everything online nowadays. 

I don't know whether to just leave and keep all the academic stuff, or sift through and only save the ""really important stuff"" like senior projects or some internship portfolios or theses, or print those out and delete the rest. 

I like having a clear line between my ""memory bin"" stuff and everything else, including my hard-drive. I feel that it's much easier to get digital clutter because there's always that little question of ""why not keep not, not like it's taking a lot of space!"" especially when I have a 2TB hd. Space isn't the problem - the problem is the emotional weight of these documents and the clutter they can result in. 

Would love to hear how everyone else has organized this!"

6jev4a,3,2017-06-25,"I [27 F] separated from my husband [32 M] of 6 years, and I'm not really sure where to go from here",falling86,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jev4a/i_27_f_separated_from_my_husband_32_m_of_6_years/,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years, and we just separated about a week ago. He has always been very controlling, and it caused a lot of issues in the marriage. I've been unhappy and thinking of separating/divorce over the past year, but he wasn't too responsive. I talked to him about various things that weren't working in the marriage, but he always seemed to blame it on me. 

He was a family guy and wanted kids. When we were in a good spot financially, we got pregnant and he was so happy. But that seemed to be the end of that. I was a stay at home mom for a while to a girl that NEVER slept and always wanted to be held/nurse, etc. The few moments she did sleep, I'd pass out from exhaustion and he'd come home and give me crap for ""not sweeping the living room"" or ""not having dinner ready"". At this point our baby was about a month old and he did not help at all. I was staying home, so I figured he was right and I needed to step up my game. This kind of behavior continued throughout the rest of the marriage with various things.

I've always been a career oriented person, so I decided to go back to school when out daughter was about 1 (she's now 4) and I am a year away from graduating with my engineering degree. It's been a crazy tough road juggling a high GPA, a daughter, being a wife, and working as an engineering intern, but I did it. My husband's goal for me being in school was to get a job, so now that I have an offer lined up, his view is that I should slack off in school and just get by with C's because I can. But my education is a huge accomplishment for me, especially since I did this with a young child. It feels like he doesn't value it.

He started going out a lot more, including Easter which I thought was going to be a family day. So I did the Easter egg hunt, egg dying, basket, etc while he was out all day hiking. When he got home, he said I can go relax while he watched our daughter. It felt more like we were taking turns babysitting her than spending family time together.

Without going into too much detail, he's majorly lied to me twice. One about a girl he was flirting with and talking to every second of the day. He texted her first thing in the morning, all day at work, at the dinner table, all night, etc. The texts weren't like he was cheating, but very flirtatious. He say ""good morning beautiful"" or ""good night, text you in the morning. mwuah"" type of thing. He named her a guy's name in his phone to mask it and denied it when I confronted him. We worked through it and a few years later he lied again about taking steroids (he wants to be a bodybuilder). I found his steroids and again, after confronting him, he lied to me about it for a week. He said that a doctor prescribed them to him, they weren't illegal (a google search found that to be a lie), and they weren't steroids. He finally came clean a week later.

I just wanted to give some examples of what lead to the separation. I've been so unhappy with him for so long, but I was scared to leave because I was early in my education and didn't have a job, etc. I wanted to work on things for our daughter, as well. Finally last Sunday I just couldn't take it anymore. I talked to him about being unhappy, which he turned around as usual and made me the bad guy. So I left. 

Now he is constantly calling/texting me crying. He's ""so sorry"" and he's ""changed so much"". He wants me to give him another chance and recognizes he did not treat me well.

But the problem is I don't think I'm in love with him anymore. I feel like whatever we had died after being unhappy for so long. At this point I feel like I just want to move forward with the divorce, but I'm scared for our daughter and about making a mistake. It's only been a week since I moved out, and we've been good at taking our daughter 50% of the time, each. But I haven't missed him once. He came over yesterday to talk about our marriage and he was crying and begging me to come back, and I didn't feel sad or bad or anything.

I'm not really sure where to go from here. I'm hoping to get some direction, or other people's similar experiences.

Thanks for reading the long post!

The Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
Alice: I don't much care where.
The Cheshire Cat: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.


So this is basically how I feel now, I am in the middle of deciding whether to enroll in grad school or just start my internship in order to become a qualified lawyer. I am a bit depressed because of those setbacks I got from several interviews. It is so hard to tell friends around me, and it makes me wanna escape all the social events to avoid mentioning my failure. 

Sooo I am looking for people who are going through this, or had gone through this(career or future confusion) 
I am relatively positive  and outgoing person😊Therefore, I wish we could chat with each other in daily or weekly basis, share emotions, try to pull ourselves up, and become better version of ourselves. 
(It is alright you have different goal in life you wanna achieve. Just as long as you wanna share with me!)

More about me:
* I speak Chinese, English and a bit Japanese.(we can do language exchange;)
* I love watching drama, ex. The west world, the Big Bang theory, the expanse, sense 8...etc
* I enjoy discussing social issue and international relationships. I watch Last Week Tonight every week✌️
* I am a terrible singer, but I still enjoy singing while showering haha
* I go swimming regularly, and want to learn surfing this summer 
* love traveling. I had been to France, Germany, Czech, Japan, China and Korea.


So if you are interested, why not pm me and introduce yourself to me:)

6jf5xo,1,2017-06-25,F4M - The Alpha neighbor boy,Jessdabest1738,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6jf5xo/f4m_the_alpha_neighbor_boy/,"I've had this fantasy for a while now, about a boy next door who developed a little too quickly for his own good, and now as an 18 year old high school senior, is wreaking havoc all over the place. I'm talking like an absolute Adonis. Tall, huge muscles, big dick (of course), and a sex drive that can't be contained. I would play the neighbor who he's always had a crush on, and now he's going to me me his. I'd like to play a bit older than I am, like 25 or 26. For some reason, that type of age difference is super hot to me. 

Another aspect I really want out of this is my boyfriend to be totally humiliated by this high school kid. I want him to feel helpless as his girlfriend gives in to a boy 10 years younger. 

Here are some scenarios I've been thinking about:

1). The obvious neighbor boy. I was thinking maybe your parents ask me to check up on you while they're out of town. And every time I come over you're in a compromising position. Eventually, I succumb to your charms. This one could be exciting because we could work in another brother if you're into that.

2). Camping trip. Our families go on a camping trip together. I bring my boyfriend along, but you're laying on the flirt a little too heavy. This would be fun to do a slow burn until my bf wakes up one morning to me bent over in front of you in your tent.

3). Internship. You get an internship in the company I work at. Though we're in different departments, I see you around the office a lot of the day, and your appearance catches my eye. I hear about how you've already fucked half the other interns, and many employees, and I start to get a little worried. Then you come for me...


I hope those are interesting! I'm also open to hearing some ideas you have! The main thing here is an aggressive, overdeveloped, younger guy who makes me cheat on my boyfriend or husband. I'm Jess. I have brown hair, white skin, 34D breasts and a pretty big butt. I'll send a pic if you're cool.

Hope to hear from you!

I'm a 22 yo female undergrad student at a university. I am not taking summer classes, but I do live in the area year round. I am currently working about 60 hours a week this summer to save up for school.
Here's where the living situation gets interesting- I rent a farm. We have some acres of pasture as well as a sheep pen. I have four sheep in the sheep pen. I have one horse in one of the pastures. I have two roommates (for security, I'm going to give them pretend names. Megan has been living with me for over a year, she is currently living in a different state for an internship. Kelly is my other roommate that just moved in on the 1st of June.) we also have indoor pets. I have two small dogs and two guinea pigs, all of which stay in my room at almost all times.

While Megan is gone, our newest roommate Kelly moved in. We created a roommate agreement and she is on the lease. She has signed the roommate agreement as well. We allowed her to get one pet as long as we approved of the pet, well she has not followed the roommate agreement and got one pet that we did not approve of. He's mean to the other animals and he pees on everything. As I have been living here for two years, I have been the one to furnish everything. 

Kelly also brought a horse when she moved in. This was fine with us, and she told us that she planned to keep her horse in a smaller pen within the pasture that my horse is housed in. Well, that horse has since broken the pasture fence and is now in my horses pasture.

Last night I received a text from Kelly, asking if we would be able to share hay this year during the winter to feed our horses. I said no, because I do not like sharing hay as it can cause conflicts. Her plan was to keep her horse separate, and both are strictly on grass right now- we will not need to start feeding hay until about September.

Here's where the problem comes, after I stated ""no thanks, I've done that before and I don't think it is a good idea"". Her response was to call me an unhelpful, unfair, mean bitch. 

She is now moving almost all of my stuff around in the house to her liking, allowing (purposefully) her dog to pee on my things (her twitter is public and she posted about it to brag) and she has thrown some of my stuff because she seems to be really pissed off over this. I tried to approach her and she either hides or yells at me to leave her alone. She won't stop doing this stuff even if I ask. Her dog is not good with mine, so I have to be very careful when I let them outside to use the bathroom, of he will harm them. 

I'm sorry for how scattered and possibly this story might be, I'm happy to answer questions. I'm really stressed and uncomfortable in my own home. She will not let me talk to her. 

Edit: I would move, however I have been here for two years. I also have livestock which make it really hard to find new places for, otherwise I must sell them. 

**Update: I emailed my landlords to ask if the dog she got was even on the lease. Our lease states that we need to have all animals approved by the landlord and pay a pet deposit. I told Kelly this. I got an email back saying that no, she has not paid the deposit or let them know. So now they are telling us that Kelly's dog needs to go. Not sure how to handle this, as I think she might try to just ignore the email. (When the landlord responded they also emailed my roommates.)"

Started with literally 0 knowledge of programming. Like, none whatsoever. Didn't even know what CSS meant, had no clue what HTML was. I've progressed a good amount but am still very basic, and my intern salary is nowhere near enough to pay for a family. Ive fallen in love with programming and want to make a good living doing it. I got accepted into FullStack and the earliest I can attend is the Fall, but i am wary due to the high cost. I have some help so I will only need to pay about 8k or so, but it is still really hefty. Anyone have advice on whether attending FullStack will help me find a career and gain meaningful opportunities? For those wondering, I have numerous things i have built in html, css, Javascript, Jquery, Angular, and C# that i can put towards a portfolio, but they are presumably rudimentary. "

It was really overwhelming time I didn't know what I want to do I was going to school and it seemed like it was pointless. I kept playing around with different subjects and topics in school I just like I had a strong passion for software engineering because I like the idea of creating something of your own from scratch from nothing into something.

The scariest part about doing anything is the seconds after you do something. It's the very second after you cross the line of no turning back that scares you the most. 

I found out there's 1 million reasons to say no but you just need to find that one reason to say yes and act upon it. 

One year ago I hated myself I had serious financial problems and I had no future with school I just knew it wasn't for me. So that's when I decided to just jump across the line of no return and I was scared shitless I stopped focusing on my classes I stopped focusing on almost everything my girlfriend hated me for it. But now one year later I landed my first software engineering internship I have just about finished my internship and I've already got a new job lined up. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is don't be afraid to take a risk don't be afraid to lose everything because everybody has a path and everybody has a destination and along that path to reach your destination you will have ups and downs and you're going to think your an idiot for doing this but you're not you're following exactly what you want to do your following your passion so it's time to cross the line and start pushing forward.

I recently had my phone (Oneplus 3t) stolen and now have to go about buying a new one. However, when I went to a few retailers here in Shanghai (Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung), I found that almost all the android phones sold here (besides the samsung s7, which is out of my price range) do not offer 4g support for AT&amp;T in America, which I would need once I return to the US.

In addition, I understand a lot of phones made for selling in China are locked out of google play/ google services. 

Can anyone here advise on how to go about purchasing a phone that can be used in China and America, and how to access google play in China on a new phone?What models do you guys recommend? I have access to a VPN enabled wifi connection and have a chinese sim card. 

Thanks!"
6jivhz,1,2017-06-26,Need advice for Transferring out of state Undergrad.,Studmuffin64,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/6jivhz/need_advice_for_transferring_out_of_state/,"Hello all, I am coming to a crossroad that I should have thought of back in January. I believe that I can still defer my attendance to my chosen college. I can either take a private student loan to cover the rest of my needed money or I can defer and apply for instate for a year. I want some opinions on my options, for I am looking for the best choice. Anyways, I am premed and the college I want to attend has a very good program. I know I want to attend this college but I do not know what is smarter I can either have a larger undergrad debt and focus more on my grades. OR I can have a smaller undergrad debt and a more crammed schedule

Here is my pros and cons list so far:

Pros of being out of state 
 
Stay in WWAMI, 
 
get instate for idaho’s upcoming medical college 
 
Get an Idaho seat at U of U SOM
 
Get WUE scholarship and chance at upgrading my general scholarship
 
Stay in dorms and create new friendships (need friends, small town of idaho didnt maintain helpful friendships)
 
Easily move around for summer internship programs and volunteering 
 
More vacation time with family
 
Less summer responsibilities, more time to study for MCAT
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pros of being in state
 
Be instate for utah’s medical schools
 
Moved out, more time in college town, summer internship and research at college
 
Instate for RVUCOM- UT
 
Have apartment 
 
cheaper tuition because of instate
 
Possible hospital job at hospital
 
More time in college town, more lasting relationships and more ways to make friends
 
Utah costs are cheaper
 
Long term job positions
 
Longer feel at a hospital, more time at same place
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cons of being out of state
 
Highly dependent on parents
 
Possibly hurt parent’s credit because of private student loans needed
 
High Tuition Costs
 
More student loans
 
More undergrad debt
 
$86,000 degree vs possible $24,000 degree 
WUE scholarship would bring it down to about $55,000 degree vs $25,000
 
Not instate for Utah, grad programs are more spendy because of out of state
 
Tied down to parents 
 
No real chance to learn how to be dependent/grow up a little
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cons of being instate 
 
More responsibilities 
 
Less time for free time
 
No longer valid for WWAMI
 
Tied down more to college town, cannot travel as much
 
Less time to study on mcat due to job
 
Tight schedule and spending habits
 
Less visits to home town 
 
Apartment living
 
Loose WUE scholarship but possible gain at instate scholarship

6jjlln,1,2017-06-26,I've been wanting to talk about my situation.,AxelDGee,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/6jjlln/ive_been_wanting_to_talk_about_my_situation/,"So I’ve wanted to put this down off my chest and onto paper for a while, but didn’t know where to put it. I’ve wanted to talk to somebody about what’s been going on in my life, to get other opinions and helpful suggestions, and to discuss about my thoughts and feelings with someone. 

So my fiancé and I have been together since 2013 July 29, and I have considered this to be my first healthy-and-functional relationship with someone. I (23M) have ‘dated’ 4 other people previously (or as close to ‘dated’ as you can while still in middle/high school) and I lost my virginity to one of them and that was the only time I had ‘sex’ before Allison (technically we had ‘sex’ since there was penetration, but it didn’t really feel like it because the other person never looked me in the eyes the entire time). Allison (23F), on the other hand, has been with and/or had sex with about 30 people in her life, and has done things like flirting and kissing to countless others. We had both been serial monogamists before we got together, we started out being mutually exclusive, then we tried having an open relationship a couple of times, and now we’ve fallen into a ‘V’ poly relationship and are still figuring things out. 

It was around January(?) this year(2017) that Allison confessed that she had a crush on Gary (23M). One of the reasons why the open relationship didn’t work was because the guys she wanted to do stuff with were people that I didn’t know and didn’t like when I heard about them or met them in person. Gary, on the other hand, is a friend of ours and he is freakishly similar to me in body type, personality, and interests. So when she told me that she had feelings that were “more than friends” with him, I definitely approved of it. I told her this, and I suggested that we should have threesomes with him too. This is where my fiancé and I had a bit of a speed bump; I was expecting her to be friends-with-benefits with Gary and to ‘do stuff’ with him about once every other week since her sex drive is lower than mine. Instead, what happened was she started texting him every-other minute,  went over to his place to hang out and spent the night about 3-4 times a week, went on dates to small restaurants and movies 1-2 times a week, and was messing around with him about 2-3 times a week. She was doing this the entire month before she was flying out to do an internship for the 2017 spring semester. I wanted to spend as much time with her as I could before she left, so I was upset when I spent a lot of that month alone. Because of Gary and one other incident, we have since learned about laying out expectations before anything happens with anyone. I’m now fine with her being with Gary, and it helped when I realized that the kind of relationship that they formed is a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship and not the FWB relationship that I assumed they were going to have.

Now, this is my dilemma. I am a very sexual person, I have a higher sex drive, lots of things turn me on, and I am very sexually explorative. With my fiancé, because of school or work, we tended to have sex about once (sometimes twice) a week, which usually is good enough for her. For me, I masturbate about once or twice a day; it is an addictive stress-relief for me. Unlike my fiancé, I am not a very social or outgoing person at all; I have a hard time finding time to hang out with friends, much less make new ones. My fiancé is also fairly vanilla, while I have a far greater amount of kinks than anyone I have seen on the internet (although most of my kinks can only live in the imagination, or should only live in the imagination). Because of all this, I really want to find outlets for my sexuality. Gary and I are not sexually attracted to each other, but I was really hoping that we could do sexual things to my fiancé together like threesomes, DP’ing, watching/sex taping, role playing, et cetera. But it turns out that they both are uncomfortable doing sexual stuff together while in front of people, especially if the person is a friend (me and Gary are friends). I didn’t have a good outlet for my sexuality, which manifested as me being over eager and obsessive about Gary doing things with Allison and us three doing things together, both sexual and non-sexual. This led to Allison feeling pressured by me to do things that her and Gary aren’t comfortable with, and her feeling that her and mine relationship is only revolving around sex and Gary, and nothing else. After our talks, I’ve realized that I need to put away and forget about the idea of involving Gary into Allison and mine’s sexual relationship, so that if/when they become comfortable enough to involve me in things, it will be a happy surprise. We also concluded that I should try to find a person and/or online community to use as an outlet that I can plug my energy into. For the person part, we were going to make a tinder account together and try to find a local person, so that I have someone to do stuff with too and possibly involve Allison as well. I was also thinking about going to a swinger’s site or okcupid as well to find someone. For the online community part, I used to be heavily active in the adult section of answerbag before it closed shop, so now I was thinking of maybe using this sub-reddit to talk to people.

All the best,

-wtffng
____________________________________________________________

I arrive 30 minutes early to find my ID badge won’t unlock the double wide magnetically guarded doors to the ED. It’s the morning shift, so someone should be close behind me- therefore, I pull out my phone, furrow my eyebrows, and completely pretend to be doing something important.

A nurse walks by briskly and successfully swipes through the door with me stealthily following behind her. I walk to the resident workroom to find my key doesn’t work there either. A PGY-3 spies me fumbling and with a laugh pulls the door wide open. 

He’s smiling. He’s excited for us to be starting. It’s genuine. He runs me through some basic charting requirements that haven’t been covered in 2+ weeks of HR classes and orientation, which at this point have all blurred together, interwoven between each night’s social adventures.

My shift begins at 07:00, and at 6:45 there’s a loud page “TRAUMA ACTIVATION, ROOM 4.” A grinning attending appears from nowhere, introduces herself- and instructs me to go to the trauma bay.

A life threatening gun shot wound is arriving via ambulance and we’re tying our gowns down. The room is calm, but swelling with people and heat- everyone mutually understanding that this will most likely be futile. 

An older nurse peers around the room, trying to ascertain who to eliminate.

“WHOEVER’S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, LEAVE NOW,” she instructs, likely insinuating me. Several people scurry out the doors and I turn to leave, finding myself facing another attending who firmly says: “Stay here.”

The nurse starts circulating, instructing people she doesn’t recognize to leave. I’m fully gowned with a mask, but I know this won't protect me. As she nears, I turn to the trauma cart and pretend that I’m seeking some device which will be useful in the near future. She passes and I turn back, an escapee.

The patient is rolled in and movement starts. Intubation, CPR - but within minutes it is determined that yes, this is most certainly futile, and the patient's time of death is called. 

I walk back to my ED section to receive sign-outs. The attending looks up warmly:

“Welcome to the Emergency Department, Dr. Wtffng.” 

There are three Interns, one PA, and one Attending. The attending looks around and wonders aloud “Do we have no senior here? No? Looks like a busy day.” 

We’ve been informed that as interns our expectation for these first shifts are simply this: Do an HPI. Learn the system. Be honest.

I haven’t done an EM shift in 2 years now, and my excitement is tempered by the growing realization that after 8+ years of education, I might know nothing. 

I push back against this thinking and set to work as the clock strikes 07:00. I look up at the patient board and see red rapidly disappearing as the team logins to the EHR. I scan the list and pick up the first one I see- a seizure. 

The patient’s from out of town, no history available. No worries, I’ve done seizure work-ups plenty of times in the past, right? 

As I walk towards the room the nurse pulls back the curtain and exits.

“Hi! I’m WTF, the intern working with you today for the first time here.” We exchange formalities and he is kind. He’s patient. I ask him to let me know if he needs anything and what he thinks about the patient. 

So here it goes. The first patient seen with an MD straggling along behind my name. 

“Hello, I’m Dr. WTF FNG, call me WTF. I’m the resident doctor taking care of you this morning.” 

The patient is younger. Engaged. Smart. Here for work and he certainly knows more about seizures than I do. He informs me he’s got important things to do, and he hasn’t slept well the last couple nights and had a couple drinks the previous- likely the cause. 

I do an HPI and order labs. I’m trying to contact an outpatient neurologist in some far away state who I soon realize doesn’t want to respond to pages sent from East Coast Time. 

I pick up another patient, dizziness. I whisk into the room to find a pleasant older woman who is here only because her son was concerned. She’s got important things to do, and wants to escape this place to her cabin for the weekend. 

I tidy up things for my first patient and discharge him. He looks at me says “Hey- Thank you, that was really quick and thorough.”

I laugh and respond “Hey I appreciate that. Don’t tell anyone on your way out- but it’s my first day as a doctor.” 

I smile, shake his hand and leave before I can see if his face drops into disappointment. I exit the room to find the nurse standing there, obviously overhearing this statement, with an expression somewhere between amusement and scorn. 

I am admitting the woman with dizziness and break the news that she likely won’t be making it to her cabin this weekend. There’s soft pushback. I explain that if she were my mother I’d want her to stay in the hospital for further evaluation, and I would.

There’s a small pause and I blurt out “if you want, you can call me Dr. WTF FNG, RUINER OF WEEKENDS. I propose a weekend of awful hospital food and cable TV rather than a relaxing weekend at the cabin.” 

She stares at me for a moment, and begins to laugh. She agrees to stay. I exit the room again to find the nurse holding onto an expression somewhere between concern and breaking laughter.

These damn curtains. I speak loudly and everyone can hear my weak passes at wit. 

I step backwards onto a small neurologist who has somehow snuck behind me. He does not feel that another patient of mine warrants a neurological consult but he’s already here in the ED and he’s trapped. Success. A tap on my shoulder saves me from the debate and I set to fix one of the many problems I’ve created from bumbling through the EHR.

I don’t know how to document properly for billing, admit correctly for admissions, and discharge sufficiently to get the patient out. The PA is a saint. Seriously. Every question is answered patiently, from phone numbers to drug dosing. My attending, also up for canonization- is juggling every patient in the section while teaching three interns. The nurses are supportive, and graceful as they inform me of each small misstep and how to fix it. I can tell I'm slowing them down, but they're as understanding as over-worked nurses can afford to be, and I'm damn appreciative of this. 

I sit and try to catch up on non-existent notes and again my shoulder is tapped as I’m halfway through a sent-

“That’s you.” The nurse informs me.

“What?” I respond confusedly. 

“Trauma to Bay 4.”

“What?” 

“You. That’s you. Go to Trauma Bay 4.” 

It clicks. Those overhead pages now address me at this time. 

The rest of my shift blows by, fueled by pretzels and coffee. I see the sick and ill alongside the worried well. I witness the aftermath of tragedy that will surface darkly in the newspaper days later. 

Each time I sit to chart, my phone rings or my shoulder is tapped. I incorrectly place and fix orders. I am slow. I feel I know nothing. Things that went so fast as a medical student take longer now, and are so much more complex. There was no magic click or growth following the MD that was placed behind my name a month ago. I am still just me, with the same knowledge base. As I work I realize the auditioning medical students likely, or perhaps certainly- know more than me. 

I can feel hard in my gut that I don’t have a flow, nor method to manage the tasks constantly flooding me. My shifts ends and I melt into a chair in the resident workroom to catch up on my mangled notes. 

Two senior residents slide into the room and flop down on the couch. They are on an off-service rotation and enjoying the periodic downtime and freedom. 

“So how’d it go?”

I explain my concerns about flow and knowledge, pace and expectations. 

They laugh. 

“It comes with time. You guys are doing great, seriously. It’s a whole new approach and we all do it a little differently. In a couple months you’ll be managing all of this and more with ease.” 

They pause and one asks “So what did you think?”

I sit for a second and scan my hazy memory of the past 9 hours. For a moment my gut relaxes.

“It was awesome. I made the right choice.” 

They laugh. 

“wtf, Welcome to Emergency Medicine.”

6jl1e2,1,2017-06-26,My 4th week in and already praise this like a life saver,RaimundoSilva,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6jl1e2/my_4th_week_in_and_already_praise_this_like_a/,"(I apologize for the long text in advance, I like to trail of or include a lot of details in my stories) 

So my friend introduced me to noFAP 4 weeks ago, he said he has been trying it for a couple of months and usually failed around two months. Now I always had like a problem with this, when I was a teen I used to fap like four times a day, everyday. The last year I was more aware of what I was doing and got it down to once every 3 - 5 days with spontanious relapses to everyday. So when my friend brought it up I was really interested to try this because my general motivation in life is 0 and I feel like I only do things because others require me to do so. 

So together with noFAP, the channel motivation pill and a new thing I discovered called ""buteyko"" breathing (which I really recommend by the way) I started my journey. 

Now I am on an internship in Portugal so my environment is new which I think is really helpful. Last week I experienced some mayor urges to fap again since I lately get aroused by normal living women again, which I am very happy about. Luckily I survived the wave without much difficulty and I think I am ready for more to come. In just four weeks not only have my stress levels significantly decreased, I also feel comfortable around almost everyone no matter if I never saw them before. To me this is amazing because I always had trouble with this. I greet people when I come to parties or when I see them on the street, which I would normally always avoid and just run to the people I know best. I started going to the gym here or running in the park and perhaps most surprising of all for me, this weekend I didn't touch my laptop at all, even though I normally play lots of video games. I tried to get rid of this habit for 4 years already with reasonable succes (I no longer play MMO's). When going to Portugal I got rid of hearthstone and now when I start up a game, I feel like I could make better use of my time by cleaning my room, which is something the previous me would just hate doing. Slowly together with exercise and meditation I am getting control of my thoughts of selfdoubt and just be productive all day, I fall asleep easier and even look forward to reading my books at night. Now it all seems very happy and all but my last three weeks have definately been with their ups and downs as I slowly get used to my new life style. But I can say for sure that I can notice more progress every week. 

This weekend I tried talking to girls I thought are attractive, since I always had problems because I would get really nervous like when you stand on a cliff 10 meters high and others tell you to jump in the water. So friday I talked to a french girl in the club, I had seen her around but I didn't talk to her yet. We had a nice conversation for about 20 minutes and I tried some things like touching her softly on the arm and waist. When I touched her waist however she moved back a little. Surprisingly I didn't even mind, actually I was just happy I even noticed this subtle hint that she had no interest. Normally I would have never seen this and would have continued talking to her and trying to touch her like some creepy guy. So I ended up going home very happy because of this. In the weekend before this I already rejected one of her friends, we had a lot of fun but I just thought she was not attractive at all and I just don't want to kiss girls I think are not attractive anymore. At first this made me very upset because I just hate hurting others. But it's even more dishonorable to kiss someone and tell them while you think they are not attractive in my opinion. I did this sometimes in the past and I am not proud of it and felt like I needed to change this at all costs. Don't get me wrong I didn't tell the girl I thought she was unnattractive to me or anything. We just had a lot of fun and I avoided her advances to do anything or ask her number. 
So this saturday they had some rock concert here on the square. I always told myself I would rather speak to people at things like this or just on the street rather than in the club because I don't really like the atmosphere and I just want to treat women with respect while being assertive. Me and my friends were all a bit tired because of the last night so when we were about to leave early because we were tired I was fine with it. But then a really cute girl came to stand in front of us and in a second I was just like fock it. So I walked around some people so I would approach her from the front and I asked her when the concert would be finished and what time it was, since my phone was empty so it seemed like a nice excuse. She seemed very friendly so I continued to talk to her asking her were why she was here, where she came from etc. For the first time in my life I held a conversation like they explain it on those youtube videos, hoping from subject to subject with ease and getting to know her really well. She laughed at my jokes a lot and her eyes seemd to sparkle when I looked at her, we continued to talk for an hour and I thought it was going great. At this point I was trying to figure out what to do because my phone was empty so asking for her number would be pointless and she lived in a city about an hour from mine. But before I could think of anything this guy comes up to us and she introduces him as her boyfriend. Instead of being devastated which I normally would have been I just thought oh crap, oh well too bad. I proceeded in talking to the guy for 10 minutes or so to not seem like a douchebag (actually he was a really nice and interesting guy, travelling a lot etc.). Then the concert was finished and my friends signalled they were going home. So I said goodbye and followed them. They were saying no no stay it's going great! but when I told them he was her boyfriend they all burst into laughter. So even though I didn't the girls number or anything I still feel awesome about the whole thing since I talked to some nice people and had fun doing it and afterwards. I will definately continue in doing these things and I will even try to do things like this with girls at my university, we'll see what happens. In general I just have much more energy and enthousiasm for everthing and I am excited for what is to come if I keep this up.

6jl3jk,46,2017-06-26,"Most TBMs ignore that they have the burden of proof. I wrote this in response to a FAIR blog post, thought this was worth sharing.",zornosaur,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6jl3jk/most_tbms_ignore_that_they_have_the_burden_of/,"The Burden of Proof

A Response to ""[The Enlightenment of Neo-Mormons](https://www.fairmormon.org/blog/2017/06/11/enlightenment-neo-mormons)""
 
The issue with much of the argument is that it compares the pills as two equal cases, which they are not. Any time that you are arguing for the veracity of something extraordinary, **the burden of proof lies completely on the *extraordinary*, until it is proved *ordinary* at which point the burden of proof reverses, and now it is required to prove that something is in fact not *ordinary*.** With good reason, this is ubiquitously applied in all rational arguments from the scientific method to a murder trial

Imagine for instance that I told you that I can teleport. This is undeniably *extraordinary* because it’s not something that we observe people doing on a regular basis. If the burden of proof lies on you to disprove that I cannot teleport, you will never succeed (how could you, especially if I don’t want to participate in your tests?) and so the truth will remain that I can, in fact, teleport. Obviously, this is a bad model, hence the need to prove the *extraordinary* and disprove the *ordinary*.

I, too, disagree with the red and blue pill analogy, but for an entirely different reason. In this scenario then Neo’s life is the ordinary, whereas that the new idea that he lives in a simulation is extraordinary. This generates an issue in that the ordinary is a false ordinary, because Neo’s fake world that he lives in is all that he knows. Even though his world is fake, it is real to him, which is why for him the burden of proof is to prove that he is in a simulation. He has been perfectly indoctrinated into this false ordinary, which is what makes it so hard to escape. The same is true in the church. From infancy we were taught that belief in God (not to mention the rest of Mormon doctrine) is the ordinary, the truth, the undeniable, never changing will and word of God, and thus we were indoctrinated into this false ordinary. Let me illustrate this through a different metaphor.

Imagine that you live in a Toyota family. Your entire life you grow up riding in a Toyota. Ever since you can remember you are taught about the superiority of Toyota over other automobile brands. You sing Toyota songs, and read Toyota manuals from an early age. Every week you go to a 3 hour Toyota meeting where you listen to other Toyota drivers passionately reinforce the ideas taught at home. As you get older your parents teach you to also share your knowledge of the amazingness of Toyota. As you stand in front of 100 other Toyota drivers your mother whispers in your ear, and you softly repeat her words “I know that Toyota is true. I am grateful to be in a Toyota family.”
 
You are taught to fear other brands because they have set out to deceive you and lie to you. Sure there are some good car brands out there, but they only have part of what makes Toyota so amazing. Toyota has everything, it is the perfect car, and no other car has that. Anyone that tries to tell you otherwise has evil intentions and you shouldn’t listen to them. You are instructed to stick to Toyota materials when it comes to choosing what car to drive. The Toyota website and manuals are what will keep you grounded on the right path. 
When you turn 8 you are accountable enough to drive, and the time for you to choose to drive a Toyota too! When you are interviewed for your driver's’ license you aren’t asked which kind of car you would like to drive or even if you would like to drive at all, just a simple question: “Do you want to choose the right and drive a Toyota?” How could you imagine driving any other car? The day you take your first step into the driver’s seat is a celebration. Everyone congratulates you on making the right choice, and tells you how wonderful it is, even though at 8 you really don’t even know much about cars at all. You don’t know about potential dangers of driving, you don’t know how the car works, or any of those mysterious things under the hood. You are told that all you need to understand is the steering wheel and the two pedals, because Toyota is beautifully simple. 

As you age you are incorporated into the Toyota organization more and more. When you turn 18 you receive the greatest opportunity of your life, you can now choose to be a Toyota sales intern for two years. You have looked forward to this moment, because your entire life you have been instructed to prepare for it, you’ve even sang songs about it! This is when you become a man. This is when you finally get to share the truth of Toyota with the world. What a blessing it will be to convert even just one person to drive Toyota. It’s a good thing that you used your freedom to chose to become a sales intern, because only unworthy Toyota owners turn down the opportunity.

How could someone like that ever be converted to another car brand? Could you imagine trying to have a conversation with that Toyota owner about how Toyota isn’t actually the best car you can drive? The Toyota owner would most likely be so deep in their indoctrination that they might not even seriously consider that Toyota might be wrong, because they have been raised in an organization where conviction without a strong rational foundation being requisite is valued and applauded, almost more than anything else. 

Sure, this is a cute metaphor, but it does outline the indoctrination that occurs in the church. I know that you take great care in choosing a car to purchase, so if such a scenario would lead to a completely biased, and therefore probably wrong decision in buying a car, why is it an okay model to follow for something as serious as eternal salvation? The church says that agency is the greatest gift, but is there real agency in this model? Does an 8 year old really know what they are getting themselves into, and even if they do, do they really have the room to say no? **Why does religion get an exemption from normal standards of rationality?**

The article falls short in that it considers the claim that the church is true and that it is not true as being on an equal playing field. The claim that the church is true is an extraordinary claim and therefore the burden of proof lies there. It’s not that I have a strong conviction that the church is not true, it’s that I have little to no reason to conclude that it is, and thus I must default to the ordinary.
People should be free to choose to believe what they want to believe. I take issue when they place that belief in line with (or even worse, above) general standards of rationality. Because of this we should be careful in how our belief influences our decisions and our life, because in the end, if we’re going to be intellectually honest, no one can be as sure of their belief as the church encourages its members to be. If anyone wants to believe in the church, that’s fine, but it is intellectually dishonest to support your belief with the fact that proof to the contrary does not sway your belief, because that is not where the burden of proof lies.

Below are some excerpts from the article that I took special issue with, accompanied by my response.
 
Excerpt|My response
:--|:--
First, the red pill vs blue pill analogy implies that ex-Mormons are not only open to the truth but can see the truth, while believing Mormons stick their heads in the sand (taking the blue pill) and don’t want to see the new information that comes with taking the red pill. The fact is, however, that myriad of LDS scholars, lay members, and believing students of Mormonism, are equally as informed about the supposedly troubling Mormon information.|I don’t think it matters so much how informed a myriad of LDS scholars, lay members and believing students are, but rather how informed is the general membership? The general membership has the church as their sole source of information. Is that an acceptable way to receive information to make good decisions?
 Despite seeing this same information they still accept the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith and the continuation of modern prophets today. There’s no hiding of heads in the sand, no rejecting the red pill because they don’t want to see allegedly challenging issues.|You can see information and dismiss it or work around it without giving it a fair consideration. Sometimes this can give a false sense of security, because you have seen the counter argument, and decided it was wrong, your beliefs are reinforced,, where in reality you may not have given fair consideration to both sides. In my experience there are plenty of people in the church who ignore challenging information or dismiss it as anti-mormon literature, because this is what they have been instructed to do by their leaders.
The eyes of informed Latter-day Saints are at least as wide open to all the same information as any critic.|Informed Latter-day Saints have a testimony of the restored gospel. This means that they operate from an assumption that the church is true. This is not what I would consider wide open eyes. That assumption gives the observer strict tunnel vision.
The fact is—and a growing number of studies bear this out—intellect alone does not impel humans to believe or disbelieve. In other words, despite the ridicule by some critics who claim that believers rely on “feelings” while they (the critics) rely on reason, the simple fact is that all people’s beliefs are influenced, at least to some degree, by “feelings.” No human is a purely rational creature.|This is the same argument that you have proposed that there is no such thing as true objectivity.  Of course there isn’t because we are all subjective observers, but the aggregation of our thoughts applied to  testable and observable scenarios  is what leads us the closest to objectivity that we can achieve. Just because no human is truly rational doesn’t mean that you can equate your religious beliefs to long proven scientific observations because all beliefs are influenced by feelings “to some degree”. The fact of the matter is that a testimony of the church is in the end 100% dependent on feelings. Yes, someone can claim to have an empirical testimony but in the end that is a single very subjective observer, and there is really no way to introduce any greater measure of objectivity into the matter.
In which phase of their change can they claim to be the surest of their beliefs? Obviously, it would be the most current phase. They can look back and tell themselves that in their earlier phase they were duped, but this time they got it right. The problem is, however, that we all tell ourselves this same story (it’s a form of confirmation bias). Studies show that our memories of the past are influenced by our present selves—in other words, we can’t accurately remember how we felt about our past situation because we can’t escape our current situation.|And in here lies my thesis. The claims that the church is true and the church is not true are not equitable claims. The first is the extraordinary and the latter is the ordinary. We must assume the ordinary until you can prove the extraordinary. I was actually much more sure of my beliefs as a true believing mormon than I am now, because it’s not that I strongly believe that the church is not true, it’s that I have no rational reason to believe that it is true, so therefore I accept the ordinary.
For me, the same data that causes some members to falter simply illuminates the world I already knew. I absolutely had to modify my worldview by absorbing new facts, rejecting common myths, and by recontextualizing some of the things which didn’t seem to fit my previous world-view (which, by the way, is the same modification process we find in the evolution and revolution of scientific paradigms). From my current perspective, however, I find that most of the data fits comfortably within a framework that I embraced.|It sounds like the author will go to endless lengths to twist and turn his thoughts in order to make the veracity of the  church fit somewhere. This is what we call mental gymnastics, and it is not a good pathway to truth. If we want truth, usually we start with a question, and seek to answer it. This method, on the other hand, starts with a conclusion and forces a path to it.
While some of those who have left Mormonism (or who consider leaving Mormonism) believe that they can see reality, the truth is that their eyesight is no better than that of believers. Their logic and reasoning is no better than that of believers. And they certainly are no more open to the “truth” because they decided to reject Mormonism, than those who accept Mormonism. Swallowing the red pill simply means that you consciously chose to reject Mormonism because of how you interpret the data. Swallowing the blue pill means that you consciously chose to accept Mormonism because of how you interpret the data.|He’s right, their logic is no better, but it doesn’t have to be! In fact there really needs to be no argument supporting the claim that the church is not true because there is no way to prove that the church is true. The doctrine of the church is set up to always be extraordinary, which is where a believing member would say faith steps in, which is fine. There are billions of religious people all over the world who believe all sorts of things, some of which I’m sure you would agree are made up. There is no evidence to show  that a Mormon’s faith is different from a Sikh’s faith.

I am 6'2, 185 pounds, I am a runner who also does weightlifting. You like to dress business slutty. Tight dress, high heels, dressed shirts that highlight your assets.

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

It's late, 8pm, and the whole office is empty except us two. You're extremely horny and you want to see if this can get further. What do you do?"

May just skip to the exit strategy.,petriswifemaidmom,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/6jlxey/still_havent_given_petri_dish_an_ultimatum_may/,"Ugh. I'm embarrassed to come back here and report on my jelly spine, but I want to use this sub to keep myself honest about the situation.

I don't have a problem calling Petri Dish out in the heat of the moment or during an argument, but I don't really want to have this conversation when we're already arguing. But then every opportunity I see where I could talk to him about everything, I choke. I can't get the words out of my mouth. He has also been a lot more helpful around the house than usual (maybe he has started to recognize that I am totally fed up?), and that makes it feel extra awkward to abruptly be like ""Hey, thanks for all the help, but I'm totally going to leave you if you don't keep it up."" I've written several letters to him to prepare what I want to say, I've printed out the She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by the Sink, an article about [Walkaway Wife Syndrome](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/divorce-busting/200803/the-walkaway-wife-syndrome), and then several reddit comment threads where women talk about having left their husbands for being selfish and unhelpful. But I still can't do it. I feel like such a coward.

However, I'm also starting to wonder if it's really even worth it. The resentment is a cancer on my feelings for him. It may go into remission one day, but it will always be there, waiting to take over again. Even if I do successfully get him on board with taking on more responsibilities around the house and cleaning, his drinking will still be an issue. I also had a moment yesterday when it finally clicked that he will always put his own happiness first, regardless of the situation or whose needs will not be met: 

One of our cats has a UTI and has been peeing around the house--and I've been diligently cleaning it up--but at first I thought he was avoiding the litter boxes because PD had put some plastic pieces of [egg crate](https://www.google.com/search?q=egg+crate&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH_r7N4NvUAhXD2SYKHUPhBSYQ_AUIBygC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=984#tbm=isch&amp;q=egg+crate+lighting+panel) on the ground in front of the boxes (I promise this is relevant) so that it would knock the litter off their feet, and I imagine it hurts their paws to walk on. So I moved it for a day or so to see if he would use the boxes. It didn't change anything, so I put it back. Of course now we know it's a UTI and he's on some medicine for it, but it's something that could happen again and I want a long-term solution. I did a lot of reading up on diet changes for cats with UTIs and I realized that we've been feeding them too much dry food, and we should be avoiding fish-based wet food (I'd be happy to explain in the comments to anyone who is curious about this). So after making these determinations, I went into the bedroom to chat with him/wake him up while DD took her morning nap (at 9:45am, while I had already been up since just before 6am ...and he didn't actually get out of bed until about 11am. Because that's fair. /s) and told him about the changes I thought we should make for our cats, and he rolled his eyes so hard I thought they'd pop out of his head. Then we had this exchange:

PD: No, we're not doing that.
 
Me: And why not?  

PD: I don't like the idea of having to deal with canned food for breakfast

Me: I don't like the idea of a cat pissing all over the house. And you don't even feed them breakfast!

PD: It's just ridiculous to do all of that just because of a UTI. You always think you find these magic solutions and it's not the problem. Like the egg crates. You thought that was the problem and you were wrong! He will be fine.

Me: I thought it might be the problem, so I tested it. It didn't work, so I put it back. 

PD: *grumblegrumbleeggcratebitchbitchbitch* [I stopped listening and walked away]

And that was my *click*, at his very core he just doesn't give a shit about anyone or anything other than himself. I don't know why I overlook it when it comes to my own happiness or needs not being met, but I can't ignore someone disregarding the well-being of a pet. Fuck that noise.

So that brings me to my exit strategy. I am in the middle of an internship for graduate school right now that won't be over until the end of August, so I don't want to move out before that. It's part time, but I'm there 5 days a week. I am fairly certain that my parents will welcome DD and I with open arms (I will talk to them first, of course), but they live a little less 1.5 hours away. But once I finish the internship, I still have my actual part time job that pays very well, but it's only twice a week, so I would probably commute for those days just to keep that job while I'm finishing up school. 

Meanwhile, I'm going to submit an application to the pro bono law office to see if they will work with me. I've also started making a list of the things I would like to take in the divorce and I'm going to start tracking the cost of DD's things in the hopes that he will give us some temporary child support while we have to wait the full year to finalize the divorce (my state requires 1 year and a day of spouses living in separate residences before you can file). 

**tl;dr** I'm too chicken to confront PD with an ultimatum, but it may not even be worth it because there are bigger problems than his cleanliness and helping around the house. However, I'm not doing anything drastic until I finish my internship at the end of August.

Slang is rarely used when speaking with Ezfi. A lot of the time, it's purpose is so that humans can communicate with one another without the Ezfi completely understanding what they are saying. Words referring to taboo concepts, such as blood, violence, weapons and Earth religions, tend to go out of style as soon as an Ezfi decodes what it means. Less loaded terms, like as words describing positive things or names for subcultures, have a longer lifespan and may become part of the general lexicon even after the Ezfi decode it.


---

**Big Daddy:** (n) A person's Ezfi caretaker.

&gt; *Explanation: Ezfi are very big, and caretakers are sort of like parents. Ezfi are gender neutral but their culture considers the masculine to double as gender neutral, hence why they're Daddies.*

**Bimbo:** (n) A tough guy who embraces traditional standards of masculinity.

&gt; *Explanation: While we're used to Bimbo meaning a dumb woman, this is closer to the definition that existed when the first humans left for Esria in the 1930s.*

**Brat:** (n) Someone who throws fits to emotionally manipulate the Ezfi around them. Behavior like this is seen as cruel, unnecessary, and socially unacceptable to the highest degree. This is one of the worst insults you can throw at someone, and it is treated as a serious swear word. 

&gt; *Explanation: It's similar in meaning to the earth version, but that meaning takes on a much darker connotation given how much human tantrums physically hurt Ezfi.*

**Feef:** (adj) Cute, adorable. Variants include *foof, feefy,* and *foofy.*

&gt; *Explanation: Baby Ezfi are called ""feefees"". They're awfully cute.*

**Fifter:** (n) A member of the Fifter subculture, which idolizes 1950s American culture and entertainment. They tend to be very traditionalist and prudish compared to other Esrian humans, insisting on archaic gender roles among their ranks and often not having sex outside a serious relationship.

&gt; *Explanation: Fifter comes from the word Fifties, obviously.*

**Gavelman:** (n) Either Jesus Christ or Prophet Muhammad (they tend to be interpreted as being the same person on Esria)

&gt; *Explanation: The term came out of how these religious figures judge people's behaviors to determine where they go in the afterlife. Connecting them to court-related imagery emphasizes this.*

**Glocken:** (n) A firearm.

&gt; *Explanation: Comes from the word Glock, but modified so that Ezfi might get confused and think they're talking about Glockenspiels.*

**Gob:** (v) To physically fight or attack someone.

&gt; *Explanation: From the Klingon word ghob, meaning to fight, do battle, or wage war. Conlangs are often used as a source for slang.* 

**Grund:** (n) A person who doesn’t like to break the rules.

&gt; *Explanation: From the old 1930s slang term Ms. Grundy, meaning an extremely conventional or priggish person.*

**Gulp:** (n) A drink with THC. In some cities it’s specifically for shots that are swallowed all at once, in other places it’s for any drink. 

&gt; *Explanation: From the gulping noises you make when you drink it. Also, munchies.*

**Hooch:** (v) To do something that your therapist hasn’t certified you to do yet. Usually refers to taking drugs that you aren’t cleared on. If the object is a person, such as with “I hooched Rachel”, it implies that the two of you had sex when one or both of you weren’t legal. 

&gt; *Explanation: Evolved from an older definition of hooch: alcoholic liquor, especially inferior or illicit whiskey. Originally just used for drugs you're not supposed to take, the sex-related meaning came later.*

**Hooch:** (n) A rebel. Alternatively, an impatient person. 

&gt; *Explanation: People who hooch (according to the last definition) tend to be either rebels or impatient.*

**Hugbot:** (n) An Ezfi security drone.

&gt; *Explanation: Security drones have a method of neutralizing upset or rebellious humans by opening up their bodies, wrapping the human up in their cushioned inside, and then putting them to sleep with drugs.*

**Iron:** (n) Blood. 

&gt; *Explanation: Blood has iron in it.*

**Issy:** (n) An injury, such as a cut or bruise.

&gt; *Explanation: Took the word ""injury"" and manipulated it beyond recognition. May have be influenced by the word ""hiss"".*

**Light:** (adj) Cool, good, great, high quality. Used for objects and events, not people.

&gt; *Explanation: Light is generally seen as positive by humans in general.*

**Lorry:** (n) An attractive person.  

&gt; *Explanation: From ""lor"", the Na'vi word for beautiful.*

**The Low-down:** (n) The black market; the network of human sharing and trading uncensored media and other contraband. 

&gt; *Explanation: Derived from ""keeping something on the down low"".*

**Pood:** (n) A vain, unpleasant person. Vulgar.

&gt; *Explanation: A shortening of ""poodle"". Due to Ezfi influence, Esrian humans don't have a very high opinion of dogs.*

**Quinga:** (n) A firearm.

&gt; *Explanation: From the Quenya word for bow, as in bow and arrow.*
 
**Rabbish:** (adj) Overbearing, nosy, annoying. 

&gt; *Explanation: From rabbit. Ezfi tend to associate themselves with bunnies to make themselves look friendly to humans, especially when they are trying extra hard to get close to a human. Ezfi, especially ones this desperate, are seen as all the things in the definition.*

**Red:** (n) Blood. 

&gt; *Explanation: Blood is red.*

**Redline:** (n) A badass human. Usually for females, but can be used for anyone.

&gt; *Explanation: A reference to periods, which lead a line of blood (red) on the underwear. Being able to bleed without it hurting like a cut does is seen as badass.*

**Scrooched:** (adj) High or drunk.

&gt; *Explanation: A revival of a 1930s slang term, which just meant drunk.*

**Shrew:** (n) A security camera.

&gt; *Explanation: Government security cameras tend to have a symbol on them that looks like the nose of a star-nosed mole. Esrians switched to shrew after the government figured out what mole meant.*

**Sleepwalk:** (v) To have something bothering you and making you feel bad.

&gt; *Explanation: Esrian humans are encouraged not to speak when they're feeling bad or upset, so if they go about their day quietly almost as if they're sleepwalking, that can be cause for concern.*

**Soapy:** (adj) Secretive. Someone who’s soapy is hiding something. 

&gt; *Explanation: There is a secret society inspired by the movie Fight Club who would meet in secluded places and beat each other up. Their excuse for knowing each other in day to day life was being part of a soap-making hobby club.*

**Softie:** (n) Someone who loves being pampered. Implies that they are very complaint with Ezfi wishes. 

&gt; *Explanation: Someone who likes being pampered probably enjoys soft things..*

**Sweat Iron:** (v) To bleed. Variants include *sweating red* and *hard sweating.*  

&gt; *Explanation: Iron or red means blood, and sweating is the only situation where fluids excrete from the skin and the Ezfi don't automatically panic over it.*

**Terner:** (n) A bumbling person. Implies inexperience. Often used to describe new, inexperienced caretakers and assistant caretakers.

&gt; *Explanation: From the word ""intern"".*

**Tourist:** (n) When used for a local, it means that they aren’t deeply involved in the social scene and aren’t really a part of the community. 

&gt; *Explanation: If they're not involved in the community, they might as well be a tourist, especially when they go to parties or other events.*"
6jm8eo,16,2017-06-26,I just used Vyvanse to fast forward an internship,dssdhdshsdhhdds,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6jm8eo/i_just_used_vyvanse_to_fast_forward_an_internship/,"I am in law school, but I don't really want to be a lawyer.  My parents are pretty much forcing me to do it.  I am about to graduate this year.  I am going to get a JD degree and then figure out what I am going to do with my life.

I had an internship at a law firm for the past two months.  It was really stressful and frustrating.  It was about 1.5 hours drive each way from my house, and then I had to spend about 9 hours writing research papers for lawyers to use in court.  I couldn't have gotten through it without Vyvanse.  I am prescribed it for ADHD.

I took Vyvanse every day for about the last two months straight (except for weekends), and it made the internship feel like it went by really quickly.  I made a decent amount of money and am now just relaxing at home for the rest of the summer.

I feel like I got really out of shape doing this because I haven't been to the gym in over two months.  I actually gained some fat because I would eat nothing all day and then eat junk food at night.  I'm going to the gym now every day and eating a healthy diet to try and recover.  I still don't feel the greatest, and I'll I'm really doing now is going to the gym and playing Xbox.

On a side note, I feel that both Vyvanse and Adderall make me less likable then I am normally.  They make me really serious and quiet.  I am less personable and just do work.  This isn't really good for a lawyer because most lawyers are successful through the connections they make with others and not really what they write.  I also feel like even when I'm withdrawing from Vyvanse that I don't really have a likable personality.  I just feel irritated and tired all the time.

What can I do to get back on track over the next few weeks before I go back to school.  Thanks!"
6jm919,1,2017-06-26,cumulative gpa vs technical gpa? Which one to put on resume? GPA questions?,notc27,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/6jm919/cumulative_gpa_vs_technical_gpa_which_one_to_put/,"Applying for an IT internship position that's asking for a minimum GPA of 3.3.

My cumulative GPA is 2.9(including my gen ed and CS courses), my computer science GPA is a 3.5.

However, I've only completed two computer science courses(ill be taking two more next semester). Is calculus included in my comp-sci GPA? I earned C's in both calc 1 and calc 2, therefore it would drop my CS GPA to 2.5.

I'm a junior credit wise, but a sophomore in the computer science program because i changed majors my second year at the university. I will graduate on time oddly enough, just these last few semesters will be stocked full of CS classes. 

I also was thinking of adding a math minor, since my school only requires me to take up to calc 2 and linear algebra isn't a requirement for my major either. But, that will add 12ish more credits that are more demanding than others(calc has never been my strong suit). If I drop the math minor and focus on raising my GPA that might be more helpful for future job prospects. If I can get a 4.0 these next two semesters(which is very doable because I will be finishing up my elective and non-cs requirements such as stats, English, and some history courses + some CS courses) my GPA will be boosted to 3.22.

tldr
Don't know which gpa to put on my resume. My comp sci gpa is a 3.5 and my total gpa is a 2.9. But i've only taken 2 computer science courses so far(im a junior but switched majors, can still graduate on time). Don't want to come off as sleazy if they compare my comp sci gpa to my total gpa. 

Should I add a math minor but risk not increasing my gpa, or drop the math minor and focus primarily on raising my gpa these last few semesters?"

6jmtl7,8,2017-06-26,My GF [25F] will move in to my [27M] place after 3.5 years of LDR. More than just second thoughts - just told that I suffer from depression. Desperately seeking for advice.,guilty-throwaway56,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jmtl7/my_gf_25f_will_move_in_to_my_27m_place_after_35/,"So, this is rather a difficult story. (Even though this is a throw-away-account, I will reply asap to any replies. Many thanks in advance anyways.)


My GF and me are dating for now a little bit over four years I would say and we are in a LDR for about 3.5 years now.
The past 14-18 months have been hell for me. I was exposed to a lot of stress at work (60-80 hours a week), one of my family members died unexpectedly, worrisome health problems on my side (which got a little better in the past 6 months, but are still present 24/7).


I have noticed myself about 6 months ago, that I usually had a fake laugh at all occasions - even when I was with my family, who I see maybe twice a year. I noticed that I force myself to laugh.


And I noticed that I can't cry anymore. I have not cried for about 1.5 years. I could not even cry when I was informed about the loss in my family. Could not cry during the funeral. I was only able to force myself to watery eyes. But there was not a single tear that came out in any way.


Why am I telling this? Throughout all my problems in the past 1.5 years, I never really felt the support of my girlfriend (anymore). Don't misunderstand me please. She's really nice and I adore here. I just feel like she ignores all the problems I am suffering/suffered from currently or she just forgets about them the next day and never mentions them again or barely does anything to make me feel better. In this period she was constantly abroad (with abroad I mean not in her home country) for projects and such (she is in university), it was hard to maintain contact no matter how good the internet connection, she never really engaged contact when she was abroad and such. Currently she is abroad again and we have not talked once on the phone for about now two weeks - just texts (I have not asked this time for talking on the phone, since I mentioned that I don't see a point anymore in engaging that and plus, I don't feel like that I deserve to be in such a needy position).


I always feel like that I have to engage everything. Every problem we have. She just ignores things and hopes that I take care of it/that problems solve themselves and such. I feel being taken advantage of. Not only emotionally, but to a certain degree also financially. I feel like I have suffered so much in this relationship...I don't know what do to anymore.


When I first talked to my doctor about how I feel (regarding my happiness/sadness), he quickly came that to the point that I suffer from depression and that I should seek professional help (which can take up to 6 months in my country). I tried to tell my girlfriend about it, but she didn't really realize what is happening I think. I told her the other day that I was feeling really bad and she did not even ask about it in any way.


I don't know how to continue this relationship. My GF has an internship here which starts in September. All her things are at my place already. I am so afraid of the day that I will see her again. I don't know how to feel about her anymore. I don't know if I still love her.


And I know that I will be the a**hole for telling her all that and ask her not to live with me. But then again, I just can't see that happening right now. I am so desperate right now. I just can't continue like this. It is this time right now where I just want to pack my things, leave everything behind me start over.


Please help me. I desperately need advice. I don't know how to handle this all anymore.


TL;DR: In a ldr, gf is about to move in into my place for her internship, I feel being taken advantage of, she does not care of how I feel - or at least does not ask about it, I am terrified of living together at the moment.

6jnb4v,2,2017-06-26,Advice for Moving Out of Parent's House?,OnMyOwn105050,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6jnb4v/advice_for_moving_out_of_parents_house/,"Hey all, longtime lurker of this subreddit, picked up a lot from here.

I'm (21/M) set to graduate this December from a state University with my BS in Computer Science. I currently work as a software engineering apprentice at a large company near school (and my parents house).

My girlfriend (of over 4 years) and I have been wanting to move out and get our own place for a while now. I'm the oldest child and my parents are very conservative, Christian people which leads them to be very controlling/""do as I say"". We also just don't have any privacy.

My girlfriend (21/F) graduated this past may with a BS in business administration. She just received an internship offer from a company in our city. The internship runs 12 weeks and they obviously want her to move into a full time position at the end, but no guarantee. She will get $18 per hour (40 hrs per week) during the 12 week internship, no benefits. 

My apprenticeship means that I work 40 hours per week during the summer and 20 hours per week when the school semester is in session (the last week of August this year). I also receive $18 per hour, but I get full benefits.

Enough with the background. I've done hours and hours of research over the past few months to get what I think is a good idea of what to expect, expenses wise for us to move into an apartment together. Please tell me if you think I'm missing anything, have any misconceptions or wrong ideas, or if you just have any insight/comments/opinions!

PROJECTED MONTHLY EXPENSES FOR 2 PEOPLE (2BR APT IN MIDWEST)
Rent: $1150
Electric/Water: $100 (on average, no gas in apartment, trash is included in rent)
TV/Internet: $125 (I game a lot and would like good internet speeds, if we drop cable, we could make this about $70 for just internet)
Car payments: $250 + $250
Gasoline: $200
Groceries/household items (paper towels, toilet paper, etc): $400
Renter's insurance: $15
Netflix: $10

The total for this comes out to $2500 per month before savings or other entertainment spending.

According to a take home pay calculator, we should bring home $3350 per month when I'm working part time and $4500 per month when I'm full time (until the end of August).

Extra information:
The apartment is brand new, finishing being built right now. We would be the first tenants in the unit we get. They are running an opening special that includes the following:
-First month's rent free.
-No application fees.
-No Admin fees.

To get this special, you must move in by July 15. If you prorate out the free month of rent, it basically saves $100 per month on the rent, making it an effective rate of $1050 per month.

Our parents will cover our cell phone bills and health insurance. Her parents will pay her car insurance, I'm not sure if my parents will or not, but if they don't, then that is another $100 per month.

Does this seem doable? Upon graduation, I should be making a salary of around $70k per year. 

My hesitation comes from the fact that she doesn't have a guaranteed position at the end of the internship, but she will be able to apply and interview at places in the tail end of the internship, so I think she should be able to find a permanent position by the end or shortly after.

We have about $7k in liquid savings right now between us. The $250 for the second car payment is an estimate because she needs a new car ASAP. Her current is basically falling apart (240k+ miles, nearly 20 years old). My car has no maintenance costs, as it is a lease running through next spring.

THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE!


EDIT1: I have a credit score of about 750, she is around 710.

EDIT2: To budget for worst case scenario (my parents pay for nothing, hers have already said they will pay her health/car insurance and cell phone), add $100 per month for my car, $50 per month for my health insurance, and $60 for cell phone. So makes expenses about $2700.

The deposit for the apartment is $250, but depending on rental history/credit check, it could go up to $1150."
6jno18,1,2017-06-26,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6jno18/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Then after these 6 months, you have to get your own stuff (bow, arrows etc...) and a membership at the club (dunno the price). Now I know that it depends on the season of where you shoot (Summer-Outdoors/Winter-Indoors). So I kept thinking that, wouldnt it be the best idea to start this ""internship"" in January as I then get to experience the Indoor AND Outdoor shooting? So roughly 3 months each, I believe? What do you think?

Hope you can give me some advice on that^^

EDIT: I might aswell just start this september because....why not?  More waiting=Less time to train (If I like archery and want to continue)"

I'm a ChE student with less than a year's worth of courses left before I graduated with my B.S.  Early on, I didn't handle the transition to college life well and let myself get depressed about what I was hearing about the ChE job market.  I had a couple of bad semesters (all F's) and my GPA dropped to around 2.0.  I have since had about 50 hours of classes (even a couple 400 level) and have maintained a 4.0 for this portion, averaging out to my current GPA which is just almost 3.0.  Projecting, my GPA should be about 3.1-3.2 max by the time I graduate.

As for experience, I've had no luck getting internships.  My GPA was 2.0 by the time I started looking sophomore year, so it's impossible to get my foot in the door.  I did manage to secure a (paid) research position this summer under one of my professors who knows me...but I just can't seem to convince anyone in industry that I'm not an unreliable failure.  I want to move into industry after graduate, and I'm concerned that my only experience being this research will lock me out of options that aren't more academia.

Does anyone have any advice or encouragement?  I'm getting depressed at the lack of fruits of my labors.  I know it's because of those bad semesters that just tanked my GPA, but it is feeling like I'll never stop being punished for it. "

6jox44,220,2017-06-26,The Other Side of the Other Side: An Anesthesia Intern's last days Off-service,illaqueable,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/6jox44/the_other_side_of_the_other_side_an_anesthesia/,"*I saw /u/wtffng's incredible post about his first day as an EM intern and I wanted to contrast with an end-of-the-year anesthesia intern's experience. What follows is today, but it could easily have been any other day. I warn you--there is some cynicism ahead. I have dialed it up a little bit, but it is something you will all experience at some point.*

Today is my Friday. Tomorrow is my Sunday. I arrive at the hospital shortly after 5:30 am, park half a mile from the hospital, and place my parking placard--expiring in 4 days, no replacement in sight--on my dashboard so security doesn't leave a $90 ticket on my windshield.

Today is the fourth-to-last day that I will ever spend on internal medicine wards. Each day has been more like picking a scab than the last, and my scab is particularly raw today: I have a new attending today, another fucking nephrologist; my co-intern and med stud--one of the useful ones--have the day off. It's me and the PGY2-slash-3 (it's all very confusing at this time of year) carrying our 9 inpatients plus 1 overnight admission, which is not terrible, but I'm not an internal medicine intern, and on July 1, 2017 I am starting on general OR and haven't seen the inside of an operating room in 5 months or more. 

The incentive to be present and accounted for is non-existent, but I like my resident and he likes me, so I work for him. I don't work for my patients any more; if you live and die by how your patients feel about you, sooner or later you get crushed by the realization that nothing you say or do sticks with them for long. 

Caveat: I have one patient right now and have always throughout the year had at least one patient for whom I work. This guy, in his mid-70's, has over 100 pack-years to his name, is sporting a RLE wound vac on his transmetatarsal amputation that will shortly become a below-the-knee amp, has dry gangrene to his knee on the left, and is paralyzed on his RUE from a stroke some years ago. He has fresh drug-eluting stents from two weeks ago and he's growing bacteria of every kind from every source imaginable. He is nonetheless awesome; kind, funny, adaptable. He is sad today, because he has heard every day for a week now that we're taking his right leg. He knows that he's losing the right leg. He does not know that he's probably losing the left one, too. I will have to tell him, most likely.

Anyway. I pre-round on my 6 patients including the FNG; I slouch in my computer chair as I mindlessly click through vitals, labs, imaging. I scribble notes about abnormals, pertinent negatives, trends. I type these notes into my note skeleton. I print my note skeleton, make notes on the note skeleton. I am compassionate and kind to every one of my patients, but I don't want to be here and I don't want to be doing this. I fear they know, but I can also see in their faces that they do not.

On rounds with the new attending, she pimps me about beta blockers in dialysis patients--just me, the resident, and the attending, and the off-service intern is getting pimped. OK. I answer, ""atenolol..? no, that's renally cleared... uh...""

""Metoprolol,"" she says. I don't think she is being condescending, actually. She trusts me to report abnormals and normals to her, on day one. I appreciate that, but I also know that she is checking boxes and probing where I've left things out of my presentation.

Note that to this point, we have not done any medicine at all.

Once we have rounded, late morning-ish, we are free to chase down consults, place new orders, and put our notes in. My new attending can't read them, because her computer access lapsed while she was on maternity leave; she trusts us to carry out the plan of the day, by necessity. She says ""call me with anything"", and then she disappears. We won't see her again until 2 pm.

For the rest of the day, I am chained to a pager, a desk, and a phone. If I get further than 5 feet away from any of the three, I miss the opportunity to push my boulder another 3 feet up the mountainside, and that opportunity may never come around again.

Most of my phone calls are with the social worker, because most of my patients are awaiting disposition to various levels of skilled nursing facility. I spend most of my day talking about ""medical necessity"", which is modern era jargon for turfing. I am turfing my patients to skilled nursing facilities, because at one point they were all GOMERs, and if there is one thing that we all know about GOMERs, it is that they never die. 

As if on cue, one of my GOMERs goes to ground, dropping an episode of orthostasis on us right after lunch to keep things interesting. She is fine. She is old and unsteady; she just tumbled, and there is no lasting damage. She may not be able to dispo today, however. Hour by hour, our very skilled, very engaged social worker is forced to admit that not one of our potentially 5 discharges will be leaving the hospital today. Her small death is our small death.

We essentially spend the entire afternoon bullshitting, me and the resident, the two of us and the other team in the room, the resident and his incoming chiefs, me and the other off-service interns counting the minutes. After the bullshitting has run out, we round on our patients again, informally, at 2 pm, and then the attending says, ""call me if you need anything"". She disappears again, and will not be heard from until the next morning.

At around 4 pm on every single day during medicine wards, something fucky happens. Today, one of our dialysis patients becomes briefly unresponsive in dialysis. She emerges from sternal rub, then dives back down again. Her SBP drops from 180 to 112 in a matter of seconds. She's probably stroking, we rationalize, so we toss her in the CT scanner--which won't show us a stroke, of course--and when it comes back normal we are not shocked. Her exam is normal. She was transiently hypotense, most likely, and will be fine; however, she now jumps to the top of our sign-out to night float, because old ladies having strokes that no one sees or cares about is very poor form. This is how GOMERs die: they drag everyone else down around them.

Almost contemporaneously with stroke lady is our C. diff lady, whose potassium has been hemolyzed 3 separate times. It finally comes back at 2.8, which is not fine. I spend about an hour talking to her, getting an EKG, starting her on repletion--Mag first, K next--and making adjustments to our sign out because we now have *two* Watchers on our list where before we had a big ol' pile of disposition issues. 

My resident has been trying to sign out to me and leave for over an hour at this point. He changed into street clothes, then back into scrubs for our pseudo-stroke, then back again, tentatively. I do not begrudge him the opportunity to leave early, but I wish that he had enough compassion to recognize that I am done caring about medicine wards.

It is 5:30 pm and I need to sign out. I am frantically updating our patients and mashing print so that I can rush to the night float room and beat someone else to the intern covering our team. I am too late to be the first, but I am earlier than some. I try to sign out carefully, methodically, but I am interrupted by what sound like very non-urgent phone calls that the night float intern returns, other teams making non-urgent updates to their non-urgent sign outs, and a very rude nurse looking for her iPhone charger. This experience is routine at sign out. I am only thankful that I have no med studs signing out with me tonight, because god love them and I understand the need, but I don't want you practicing sign out on my fourth to last day on wards while I'm *this close* to leaving on time.

As I walk out of the hospital, it is a beautiful, warm, cloudless Monday evening. I would love to enjoy it, but it is already 6:30 pm and my wife hasn't eaten dinner yet. 

Today is my Friday. Tomorrow is my Sunday."

I'm worried I won't find an internship until it's too late because I won't be taking the database course until next fall. Which means I won't have that SQL knowledge, unless I learn on my own. 

My advisor says I will graduate on time, even if I don't take summer classes.

Anyone in a similar situation? I'm going to try and get some sort of internship or experience during the school year. Any business in FM area that take CS interns that anyone knows of?

6jpdy0,3,2017-06-26,I [21F] am too attached to my boyfriend [20M].,5093682,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/6jpdy0/i_21f_am_too_attached_to_my_boyfriend_20m/,"Before I start about my relationship, I should say that I have severe general anxiety disorder as well as depression. I attend therapy and I take medication for these things. I try my best to get out and do things I like and hang out with friends. Yet I still face this problem and I need some advice.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now. I know that we are young and the relationship is still quite new, but I really do like him and I want to be with him, which is why I'm willing to improve. He and I started dating while he was in the city I live in. He was here for about 4 months for an internship, and then he had to go back to the city he studies in, which is in my country but quite far away and expensive to travel to. Currently, he's doing another internship, but in another city closer to his school. We had made plans for me to visit him this summer, however, I'm not able to do that because of financial issues. The next time I will see him is when he's done with this internship and he comes back to where I am for about 2 weeks before leaving for another school term.

It was really tough for me to face the realization that I won't be able to go see him and the city he lives in right now, mainly because I was looking forward to it for a long time. Over time, I'm realizing that I'm getting overly attached to him and it's becoming unhealthy. I wasn't really like this in the beginning as much. But now I'm constantly feeling alone being far away from him, I'm jealous of people that get to see him and talk to him every day. Or even of his friends (which I haven't met because they're from him school) who are visiting the city he lives in and hanging out with him. Sometimes when he's with friends, he doesn't text me for hours or he stays really late with them at night. I feel absolutely hopeless during those times. I try to distract myself and watch or read something, and that does help, but the minute that I'm left alone with my thoughts or I try to sleep I get incredibly anxious and I end up crying or having an anxiety attack. I feel like he's on my mind almost every minute that I'm awake.

He and I are both busy because we're both working, but I still feel like I'm spending more time trying to contact him. We text each other often, but sometimes he goes the entire day at work without contacting me. I don't think that's an issue, I understand he's busy at work, and he does text other times. Before, we used to do video calls 2-3 times a week, we used to stay up and talk on the weekends, but now he says he's too busy for that and he's trying his best. I think ever since he started this internship, he hasn't really initiated a call, it's always me that asks him if he wants to call tonight or this weekend. If I don't initiate it, we'd probably go weeks without calling.

I really do want to be an understanding girlfriend to him. He knows the issues I'm facing, and he does his best to accommodate for them. I proposed that maybe we should just dedicate one weekend night where we call and we can just stay up and talk to each other. Honestly, I feel like one is too little for me but I don't want to pressure him.
I'm not scared of him cheating on me or leaving me suddenly while we're apart. My biggest anxiety with the relationship is just that he's going to become more and more distant from me and he'll stop liking me. I know maybe it's irrational, but anxieties usually are irrational. I just want to understand what I should do. I know some people would probably recommend that I have an entire life ahead of me and I shouldn't let one relationship affect me this much and maybe this isn't good for me. I've considered that too, but I don't want to just give up without trying. I want to be with him, I know that he wants to be with me too. I just want to stop worrying about us all the time. I want to be able to go hours without hearing from him and be okay with it, and I want to be okay with him spending time with his friends, or the fact that we can't call as much as we used to. I just don't know where to start."
6jprxk,4,2017-06-26,PSMF 6 Week Accountability Log! (21M),Encendi,PSMF,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSMF/comments/6jprxk/psmf_6_week_accountability_log_21m/,"Hi everyone! 

**Why I'm doing this:**
I'm a college student going into my senior year who's trying to lose weight for a vacation in exactly 6 weeks. This trip is incredibly important to me as it's a chance to reconnect with an old friend. I want to look my best when I see her again. 

**Stats:** 5'10'', 173.4 pounds, ~21-24% body fat. Body fat was tested using calipers over a course of several days a month or two ago. However, I was getting oscillating numbers between 21-24% during the testing period, so I dunno what it really is.

**Goal Weight/Body Fat%** Looking to hit about 160 pounds and 15% BF by the end of this diet, which is roughly where I was when I was on the swim team in HS. A bit ambitious, I know. 

**Experience:** I've been dieting and lifting hard for the past few months, but I was always a bit lax about my calorie intake when it came to my social life. Now that I'm taking summer classes and doing a full time internship, I don't have a social life, so let's make that final push! 

**Exercise Plan:** I've been doing the 6 day PPL split for about 1.5 months and Stronglifts 5x5 before that. I will be doing a full body workout this time around, but I haven't fully hashed it out just yet. I was still doing PPL up until this week. 

**Diet:** I think I'm extremely advantaged in this regard since I'm Chinese-American and living with my parents over the summer. My mom supports me on this diet and she's a great cook so I get to have delicious veggies. I'm still responsible for the meat, but even then she helps with recipes. I don't have a structured meal plan, but this is what my diet consists of:

* 20-24 ounces of chicken breast OR 
* Equivalent amount of fish (salmon/tuna) 
* Veggies as desired 
* 2 Fish Oil capsules per meal
* Calcium/Magnesium/Potassium Supplements
* Multi-vitamin
* Water/Tea ONLY 

I will be doing a refeed every 2 weeks, but no cheat meals. 

**Why the accountability log:** While part of it is for me to stay on track and motivate myself, it's also for people in similar situations who are thinking about trying this out. I searched online for hours and found such few people who have made it through this diet for an extended period of time (but the ones who did look amazing). I want to be another example that people look up to. 

I am currently on the second day of the diet, which means absolute jack in terms of my credibility, but I can already feel that it will test the boundaries of my willpower and self-control. It's so easy and tempting to fall off the rails, especially when you have shit like school and work to worry about. 

The way I've been getting through is just clenching my fists and thinking about what's important to me and why I'm doing this. I don't search for shortcuts or loopholes to mitigate the pain. I welcome it and accept it as the price for achieving what I desire.

**My plans for this log:** I will be posting daily updates with my weight and diet, along with a mini-diary summary of how I felt during the day.

**PS:** I have read Lyle McDonald's book, and I know that this diet is not a permanent one. However, I have already changed my eating habits significantly over the past year and I think that I can maintain my gains after this diet.

Thanks for reading, and wish me luck!"

Always keen to see where a partner will take these things so feel free to play it how you like!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Option 1**


Your phone buzzes in your hand as you walk through the busy office. The young new intern trying to make her way in the world as my latest secretary.


You unlock the phone and read my message


*""How does it feel to be walking through the halls with your panties filled with that thick load of sticky warm cum""*


You can feel your face burn red as you read the message, each step you take reminds you of the sticky mess in your underwear.


It was only 10mins ago that you were in my office, bent over my desk with your mascara running down your cheeks as you quietly whimpered and begged for me to fill your tight little pussy.


Instead I slowly pulled my cock from you and began to fill the soft underwear caught around your young thighs.


I didn't say many words as I groaned deeply as I stroked my thick load into the material before pulling them up, a feeling you weren't familiar with as I pulled your skirt back down over your tight little ass.


You did as expected, turning and dropping to your knees wrapping your lips around me to clean up the mess you'd made just like I'd insisted in our previous encounter.


buzz buzz another message


*""My little slut. Walking the office with drenched panties. Next time it'll be that perfect little ass""*


**Option 2**


You suddenly wake up. You panic. Where are you? What's happening? What's that smell? Alcohol?


And then the fear really sets in as you slowly begin to wake up properly you realise your small wrists are pinned down and there's a heavy weight on top of you, pressing you face down into the couch.


You scream for me to get off, your small frame thrashes under me. Suddenly I have both your small wrists pinned above you in one big rough hand.


The stench of alcohol strong as you feel my other rough hand slip under your skirt, pushing it up as my fingers slide between your thighs and roughly run along your underwear.


Shit... You must have drifted off.


But you trusted me... But you realise you were wrong as you squeal at my touch. Who Am I?


**Option 3**


I've been watching you for the better part of a few months now. The gorgeous girl next door who suddenly seems to be developing into one hell of a woman. Heck, you must be at least a good 10 years younger than me but I can't help but look at every inch of your body.


People joke about the classic ""Girl next door"" look but I swear to god you were it. Tits that I could only dream about what they must look like when not covered up by one of your running tops or that perfect little ass I just want to sink my face into.


If I didn't know better I'd think you were a tease too, you've often caught me off guard with a chirpy ""hello"" that drips with sugar as you bounce down the driveway.


Then again, there are times where I feel like i've caught you blushing when I've been able to bring myself to saying a friendly hello back and asking about your day.


Today I decided I was going to take my chance. My wife was away for the weekend and it was going to be now or never. You had just come back from a run, it's crazy hot and the beads of sweat grab my attention as the drip down your firm cleavage.


""Hey, looks pretty hot today"" I say, looking up from my gardening as you catch your breath.


My big broad shouldered frame standing up as you turn to reply. You feel small as you have to look up at my big frame towering over you.


""Hey, I was thinking... days like this you know you're more than welcome to come over and use my pool right? Great way to cool off"""
6jqpy0,201,2017-06-27,I [29 M] haven't spoke to my Dad [63 M] in 10 years. I'm now in an ICU watching him die of liver failure and probably won't ever to get the chance to speak to him again. NON-ROMANTIC,NYCFC4LIFE,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jqpy0/i_29_m_havent_spoke_to_my_dad_63_m_in_10_years_im/,"This situation is just beyond fucked.  He and my mom split up before I was conceived, mostly because he is an unrelenting asshole.  On top of that, he is and has always been the most severe alcoholic I have ever witnessed.  He also has bi-polar.


There are a million reasons why I cut off communications with him.  He used to leave me drunk ""fuck you"" messages.  He had a habit of treating those closest to him like shit.  The one time I asked him for help (financially, I was offered a very reputable internship in my field that didn't pay and I needed to find a way to survive in Manhattan) he accused me of using it to buy drugs, even though he didn't send me one cent.  He threw a party to celebrate the day he didn't have to pay child support anymore.  I had a going away party the next week which was celebrating my birthday and my going away to join the Air Force.  He didn't show up for that one because he decided last minute to go to the beach with his girlfriend.  This is the kind of guy he is.  Everyone loves him and he's the life of the party, but if you are in his immediate circle, he treats you like dog shit.   Like I said, a million reasons and these are just a few I can remember right now.  I stopped talking to him about 10 years ago for this reason and I made a promise to myself that I would not let him back into my life unless it started with a massive apology on his end.


EDIT:  Just remembered another one, after my grandmother died (his mother) it took a week before anyone told me.  I was deployed to Korea at the time and his friend thought it might be nice if I knew.  When my mother asked him about it his response was, ""Don't worry, she didn't leave him any money.""


Family members have been asking me to get in touch with him for awhile saying he's been on an endless bender that looks like a death wish because he's pushed everyone away.  He never really bothered to initiate contact, so neither did I and I was holding my ground.  He called me apparently a few weeks ago and I was going through arguably the most difficult time in my life.  I was (am) drowning in debt from finishing my degree at an ivy league school and getting evicted from my apartment in Manhattan.  He literally called me on the day I was breaking up with my girlfriend of 4 years and moving into my Mom and Step Dads house in the middle of fucking nowhere where I knew no one at the age of 30.  I could not have cared less about his phone call.  It was the first one I've received from him in probably a decade.


Now I'm 5 feet away from him while he's clinging to life through a respirator.  Odds are his liver is so fucked, he'll never regain consciousness.  All I want more than anything is for him to wake up so I can tell him I love him, and how even through this I still don't forgive him for being the asshole he is.  A part of me thinks I'll be fine if he dies without me getting a chance to say good bye or literally anything at all, and the other part of me wonders if I'll ever let it go.  I've always been a stoic though.  This is life.  I think I'm just mostly upset because I wish literally everything between us was different.  Thanks for reading.


TL;DR: My dads an asshole and I haven't spoken with him in a decade.  I'm now in the ICU while he's dying from liver failure.  The whole situation sucks and I wish everything between us was different.  That's what upsets me the most.

EDIT: 7/04/17 -  My father passed away today.  There were brief moments where he was cognizant; I told him I loved him and he responded by saying he loved me.  That is good enough for me.  I can't thank you all enough for your support. "

6jrwh7,0,2017-06-27,My #1 complaint with FO4: the pacing of perk unlocks is HORRIBLE,AFlyingNun,Fallout,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/6jrwh7/my_1_complaint_with_fo4_the_pacing_of_perk/,"Recently bought FO4 on sale. I knew it'd have problems even before it released and avoided it because of that, and I bought it now expecting some disappointment and expecting that it wouldn't be the greatest game ever, but hey, it's the Steam summer sale right? These games are still vast and expansive, so even a terrible Bethesda game is still hours of entertainment, right...? Surely it's worth the sale price!

Man, what a terrible surprise I was in for. Sorry, but there's just no way around what I'm about to say: I absolutely hate this game. I've (mostly) avoided this subreddit because from what I gathered, it turned into a New Vegas circlejerk about how much better it is and people got sick of it. Thing is (hipster mode activate) I circlejerked New Vegas before it was cool; I thought it was the superior game back when *Skyrim* released and was worried Bethesda would continue on a decline. No point in me participating in said circlejerk now because I already did so in 2011; would just be beating a dead horse and telling me what I already knew if I hung out and participated in that daily. Now that I've played FO4 though...? Man screw that, apparently we didn't circlejerk *enough!* I'm shocked, really. I didn't think that was possible!

**But all that to say that for all the problems I fully expected with FO4, I never expected this one: the perk pacing is the single-worst, experience-ruining element this game has to offer.**

I never saw this complained about (surely someone did, but it didn't seem like a main complaint next to the writing, the dialog system and lame quests), but just take a look at some of the classic old Fallout perks that return to Fallout 4. Take Solar Powered for example. In both FO3 and New Vegas, Solar Powered is unlocked at level 20 and the main selling point is that it regenerates health. When I saw Fallout 4 previewed, I figured that all you needed to enjoy Solar Powered from the get-go was to get a 10 Endurance character out the gate. It's worse. Much, much worse. In actuality, they've needlessly divided the perk into three. The first rank is that meaningless Str/End buff that can be nice but generally isn't cared about, the second rank deteriorates your RADs in sunlight, and the third rank *finally* awards it's bread-and-butter function of regen'ing HP. What level do you get the third rank? **Level 50.** Jesus fucking christ, seriously?! Level 50 is the entire duration of New Vegas' leveling system! I need to be level 50 to get what was once a level 20 perk!? What the hell is this?!

It gets worse. Solar Powered isn't an anomaly, but rather ALL perks have been cut up in a similar fashion. ALL of them suddenly have 3-5 ranks, and ALL of them reserve their new *ability* for the final rank, which typically can't be unlocked until the late 30s or ~level 50 or so. Paralyzing Palm for example has always been a highly important perk for Unarmed builds. In FO3 and New Vegas, it's unlocked at level 18. In FO4? Level 46. This is **the** defining Unarmed perk that returns in every title, and FO4 won't let you have it until level 46. By then you've beaten the game ffs. Or what about explosive damage? FO3 and New Vegas were generous with explosive damage, allowing a 60% increase in damage by the time you reached level 9 or 10. What about FO4? Again, it's been delayed to level 22. It'll be level 22 before your damage with explosives increases on par with those. 

People like to play RPGs because they like to see characters function different from one another. They want the game to acknowledge who you are and react accordingly. This also means that while character progress may vary in speed, you at least want to deliver a rather gradual and consistent level of progress so that it doesn't take too long before a character begins to feel unique from others. On this count, FO4 might honestly be the worst game at fulfilling this condition I've ever played. I don't say that lightly, because the actual effects themselves are perfectly fine and I looked forward to those old classic Fallout perks....but the game is actively hiding them from me! Why?!

If I want to start a new game and make a Revolver specialist...? Sucks to be me! My progress with revolvers will go along at a snail's pace. Typically all perks start with a ~7 level gap between ranks, and eventually that gap increases to ~15 levels. All being a revolver specialist will afford me is that I'll do 40% more damage with them for the majority of the game, and then later as I'm doing the final quest and about to shoot the last enemy, I hit level 49, my revolvers can finally stagger opponents. I shoot that final enemy and he staggers a bit, and finally my character feels validated by the perk system. Wow, truly a great RPG experience! The majority of the game is spent as a generic character with no unique abilities or effects - just damage - and only after you've done most quests will you start to feel unique. What's the point??  It should also be noted that while perks like New Vegas' Cowboy award 25% extra damage with certain weapons (and you get that perk at level 6, no less!), the game also doesn't suffer from leveled enemies to the same degree. New Vegas balances itself so that that 25% increase remains noticeable throughout the game whereas FO4 doesn't bother balancing itself, so any damage increase perks often feel ""required"" to cancel out increasing enemy health; if you skip such perks you'll feel like your kill speed gets *slower* as the game advances, while taking them keeps your kill speed about the same for the strongest enemies. You unlock the ability to play at the same pace you've *been* playing at rather than unlocking the ability to kill faster than before. Skyrim suffered from the exact same problem.

I honestly wonder if an unpaid intern at Bethesda was assigned a ""perk quota,"" and being an unpaid intern that's not invested in his work and merely wants to finish the intern job so they can move on with their training/studies, they just did the bare minimum to meet their quota in the most lazy way possible for a barely-passing grade. Instead of trying to brainstorm up some fun new perks, they just grabbed all the existing perk concepts, cut them up into three or five seperate ranks with the final rank always being the only truly meaningful one for making your character have unique functions while the first four just make you 20% cooler (which is often meaningless since enemies gain 20% more HP around the same time you get 20% more damage), then they said ""look at all the 'new' perks I made"" and called it a day.


I really cannot express my disappointment in this one problem enough. I have issues with Survival mode, I have issues with the bland writing, I have issues with load times when going outside, I have issues with the clunky controls and I have issues with all kinds of stuff, but all of them simply pale in comparison to this one. I expected weaksauce RPG mechanics, but *this* redefines weaksauce RPG mechanics! I bought this game wanting to see if it was as bad as Skyrim (not fond of it either) or if perhaps they've improved a little. I fully expected them to improve and in a strange way I think an argument can be made that it has, simply because FO4 still has more meaningful perks....but they immediately throw this advantage away and set it on fire by hording all those meaningful perks and hiding them from the player for 50 levels? ***WHY???*** It's such a simple problem and so easily resolved. This game would be loads better if the level restrictions weren't so ridiculous, and that's infuriating to think about cause it's such a simple, easily resolved problem with huge ramnifications!! And yet they didn't resolve it! They tanked the quality of the RPG aspects this game has by needlessly splitting up perks 5 ways and making the first four ranks and the first 50 levels absolute dog shit. The perks are better than Skyrim's, and yet Skyrim STILL wins for better RPG mechanics just because this game hides all RPG elements for the duration of the game. No Bethesda, I don't want to spend 50 levels as a generic character that functions more or less the same as all my other characters. Why on earth would I ever want that? Isn't the purpose of perks to help define characters and help them feel unique from one another...? So why are you hiding all the best perks from me? Solar Powered and Paralyzing Palm were not the most meaningful perks on earth in past Fallouts (they were mid- to semi-late game), so why are we pretending this is end-game stuff now?

I personally don't have the patience to grind 50 levels of a clunky shooter just to get to the few RPG mechanics, and thus I find myself wanting a refund on a Bethesda title, which is something I've never sought before. That? That is truly depressing to realize a beloved game franchise has fallen this far, especially when some of the problems could've easily, ***easily*** been avoided. I'm just speechless about how on earth they could've allowed this to happen without realizing what a huge problem they were creating with these massive level restrictions.

For anyone looking into buying this game during the Steam sale, yeah, buyer beware. You can see the perk list, you can see the RPG mechanics technically exist. What may not be clear is how many hours they expect you to pour in before those come into play, because holy shit, THOSE are ridiculous, and those entirely defeat the purpose of this game having any RPG mechanics at all."

Depression is coming back at me hard. I've started an internship at a prestigious company but im the only person there under 30 and I can't stand it. I come home to an empty house. On top of a full time job, I have exams to study for in August, electrical engineering exams, which are pretty fucking difficult to say the least. I also try to go the gym daily, which is becoming so difficult, because I can't summon the energy after a full day of soul crushingly boring, lonely work. Ny diet and sleep are going to shit, on top of all that. The people I usually lean on for support are going through their own shit. 

My LTR is gone for another 2 weeks and I'm trying my best to keep my shit together with her, through the typical shit tests and drama. It feels dishonest not to tell her how shitty a place I'm in right now. I'm not the calm, fun, in control person I usually am and I don't want her to lose attraction and see me as weak.

6jsf1y,1,2017-06-27,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6jsf1y/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
6jsgz7,7,2017-06-27,Installing filter on a process line,NYC_Heart,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/6jsgz7/installing_filter_on_a_process_line/,"In my internship I'm currently working on a small project to install a filter after a reactor that aims to set off an alarm to alert the operators of unwanted formation of solids in the reactor (fiber and/or bad polymers).  The plan is to put a PI Gauge that can be connected to the PLC and set off an alarm at some low pressure. If the pressure keeps increasing, at a certain point it should put the process in recirc mode. 

I don't have to worry about the process control part as there is a contractor that will program what I want. 

I have developed a System Curve-Pump Curve plot showing the pressure drop the filter will cause during normal, unclogged operation (which is essentially 0).  Based on the operating point, I have narrowed down a GPM range for the various filter models. 

Now I'm a little stuck as to what else I can analyze to convince the leadership team that this is a worthwhile investment and/or to fully scope out the process changes. 

I'd appreciate any suggestions on what I can also look into."
6jsne2,0,2017-06-27,Does anyone have experience in kindly letting a guy down in a way that doesnt provoke any anger or severe hurt feelings? At a loss for what to do in this situation.,MsAvocado96,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6jsne2/does_anyone_have_experience_in_kindly_letting_a/,"Hi ladies. I hope this content is allowed here. If not, go ahead and remove. I was hoping i could get any advice on this matter from people who maybe have more experience with this. I am not quite sure if anything of this falls under harassment in a work place, im not sure if I'm over reacting, I'll try to include as many details as I can. 
I'll probably delete after a bit just to the guy in question doesn't happen upon this. 

I have no experience with these things and i dont want to hurt his feelings or anger him but also I am just not interested in him not even for friendship. I'm a pretty awkward and socially anxious person, I am sort of afraid to reject him and have to deal with that moment and I'm afraid ill say the wrong things. The only prior experience I have with rejecting a man ended badly as he threw a tantrum in a public place and told me he was going to burn my house down. which is why I am sort of scared but I know I'll have to deal with it eventually. 

So I started working at my new job about a month and a half ago. It's a basic office job without going into too many details, in a large building with many people conducting business there. For reference I'm 20 years old. This is sort of like an internship for me and it's a really exciting opportunity for me :) being a college student and all, and I dont want anything ruining it, but this one weird guy is making things uncomfortable. 

About a week into working there, I was getting some coffee in the lounge when a guy, Mark, came over to me and introduced himself. He looked pretty young to me at the time, as he had no facial hair, was pretty skinny and looked to be in his early 20s. He seemed very nice and helped me figure out how to work the coffee machine. 

He asked me my name and how I was enjoying working here. I told him I was a part of the internship program and i asked if he was in my same program. He said he was not in my exact program, but in a similar one and he was going to be there through the summer time, too, like me. 

He says that it's nice he will have a friend, and I agree with him. He then asks for my phone number, just ""in case we ever need to work together or carpool or something"" and i told him I wasn't sure if I was comfortable handing my phone number out quite yet as i had just met him, I told him jokingly i was just a cautious person.

He said no problem and asked for my email address instead. I didn't see the harm in that so I gave it to him. I feel like ive made a lot of mistakes here. 

We then talked a bit about the different things we were going to be working on through our internship programs, then we both went our separate ways. 

That night I received an email, and I didn't know who it was at first because the email address was ""*fooditem*dancinginthewind"" (dont wanna be too specific) 
I assumed it was spam and moved it to the spam folder without opening it. 

The next morning, I receive another email from the same address. The subject title is ""did you read my last email:D"" and so then I open it and i can see the name, it is Mark. I go to my spam folder to see the email. The email is a video in which a man walks around a grocery store and farts in front of people. The video is 16 minutes long. Seeing this, I'm a bit uncomfortable and I think this is where I made another mistake, as i replied ""Oh hi, haha funny"" which may have led him on. 

Throughout the week he sends me a few more videos of stand up comedy routines and similar fart videos. 

Fast forward a couple days, maybe 3 I think, and i am back at the lounge to get my lunch from the fridge. There are other people in the lounge too. Suddenly mark comes out of nowhere and jokingly takes one my chips and rubs my shoulder. Being uncomfortable, I shift my weight a bit away from him and laugh awkwardly. Mark asks if we can have lunch together to become friends so that I can ""properly give him my phone number"". To which I respond (another mistake on my part, I think)  that even though I would like to, I have a lot of work to do today. He says ""yeah sure"" sort of in a joking sad way. He says he will email me tonight... to which I just laugh and walk away, feeling really awkward. 

Literally an hour later I receive an email with subject title ""can you keep a secret"" from a different email address entitled ""*workplace*secretconfessions"" (name of workplace omitted). The email says that there is a special guy in the office with a secret crush on me and I should go look under the water dispenser for a special note for me. Upon reading this I am extremely confused as I had no idea there was some sort of ""secret confessions"" system in the office building. I mean these are all older people mostly working there with the exception of the interns. 

I go to retrieve the note, which is actually there taped under the water dispenser, and the note is some kind of bible verse about honoring and cherishing women. The other side of the note says ""cutie &lt;3"" I turn around and Mark is standing there giving me a smile, to which i smile back and laugh. 

At this point I am feeling very uncomfortable and i decide to talk to one of the girls I am working with in my program. This is where things get a bit weird. 


After telling her the details she says that she is pretty sure Mark isn't apart of any internship program there and that he works in a different part of the building, and that he would need to be at least 30-40 years old. I am very uncomfortable at this point and I decide to stop talking to mark. 

However, he will still sometimes approach me in various parts of the office and make jokes, laughing or trying to flirt with me, to which I never respond much to. Or he will ask to have lunch with me or ask for my number again. I am afraid of outright telling him to leave me alone for fear he will become angry and I'll be seen as a bitch, or he might spread rumors. I'm just an intern so I am sure people would take his side.i also dont know if i should confront him about his lying to me. 

Ive gotten a few more emails and they are more YouTube videos of pranks or whatever, but i also got an email with a selfie of Mark holding a dog caption ""he loves you already!"" Which was extremely strange. 

I also recently found a small envelope on the floor by the same water dispenser that I was told to go to before for the note. In the envelope was what appeared to be hair and a piece of a sticky note that had a heart on it. I have no proof this is from Mark but found it odd. Maybe i am paranoid. There was no name on it so I am sure it's a bit jumping to conclusions to assume, but i was walking away from the water dispenser I noticed Mark staring at me from across the hallway. So who knows i guess. 

So my question is whether i should confront Mark and let him know I'm not interested, and how I should say it. Or if I should report him, but then what if nothing happens and he finds out I reported him. 

I would appreciate any advice or sharing of similar experiences and how you handled it as I am at a loss for words. I haven't received any further emails in a couple  days which is good. 

Thanks for your time!

6jsswb,9,2017-06-27,"Going for legendary TB again, because I blew it.From and including: Tuesday, June 27, 2017 To, but not including Friday, October 6, 2017.",iSpy1234_,Petioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petioles/comments/6jsswb/going_for_legendary_tb_again_because_i_blew/,"So I am still looking for full time work, but needless to say it's been frustrating and rough. My gaming blog https://spilledparchmentblogspotcom.wordpress.com/ is going well and I am going to fight to pursue a career in gaming journalism, as I showed the blog to a gaming company, and he said I could get an internship at a gaming studio if I develop it more fully.

This has been what is keeping me together, because the company I was working for, Poke Republic, basically lied to me about full-time work, and there was zero business in the company, so they couldn't even afford to keep me. I'm getting paid Friday, but after a week sober doing what I intended, the pressure got to me and I fucked up. I smoked two fat bong hits and I will admit, since I had 7 days off, it was intense, even enjoyable. But that doesn't mean anything because in order to achieve my other goal (self-published novelist) I need to save my money to start my own business. I want to do both, gaming journalism and being a novelist. I have so many ideas for books that I have to continue my work and flourish them out, and naturally, this will lead to me likely a 80% chance of having to pee in a stupid cup. I need full-time work for the meaningful structure slightly more than the money, and I want to be with people more, not feeling trapped in my apartment with nothing to do once the day ends.

So I am once again going for my highest goal, a 101-day tolerance break. Once I get this, I plan to reward myself with shorter TB's, then instantly do another 80 to 100 again constantly, until this becomes my natural pattern forever. The fear without work is immense, but I forever know that unless I move through my pain, it will only get worse. Positive faith is all that will save us in the end, because when you let negativity consume you with anxiety and fear, demons whisper lies that you are powerless in your ear, and you cannot see that when one door closes, another one always opens. Staying strong!

Staying sober until October 6th. I have come to accept I literally love cannabis too much to ever want to give it up completely. I simply find too much value in psychedelic drugs to this very day, having given up all other narcotics with little to no effort because of a Salvia trip, knowing I hate them and they nearly destroyed me.Yet truly realizing today, for the first time also that ""just smoking on weekends"" no longer cuts it for me anymore. I want so much more, I want so much better. I want to look in the mirror and intrinsically trust myself and my instincts without a second thought. As a pothead, I cannot trust myself with no self-control, and the fun of everyday toking is so fucking gone, because once my tolerance gets too high, the paranoia does not leave and it ruins EVERYTHING. Stoner thinking doesn't care, disciplined thinking cares by default, and has no room for any concessions. Moderation (what most think of as the weekends or a few times per week) is too easy to make concessions with. I can do moderation easily, but now I want, crave, and need true discipline for the path I seek. I have to convince myself that only through rare use can I move through this, and dismiss all thoughts to the contrary without hating or judging myself for it, and it is so hard. Because I remember my past, when I was living as a human garbage bin with a pathological death wish. I am considering psychedelic therapy down the line once my set and setting improves, to uncover and rexamine my intense traumas that made me develop over a decade of PTSD, and perhaps find the necessary consciousness shift to cultivating a permanently better life for myself.


My addiction was literally so extreme I should have died thousands of times over, and its a divine miracle of God that I am still here. Drinking gallons of alcohol like a fish, smoking K2 Spice at one point fifty times per day in rehabs, halfway houses and even asylums. Blazing marijuana like cigarettes by the pound at 25. Eating so much valium I had seizures for weeks when I came off. Hardcore delirium tremens. 2 months of cold turkey molecular murder dope sickness (Tomorrow I will be 550 DAYS OPIATE FREE COLD TURKEY!!!) Eating only one meal per day for a whole year, gobbling 50 to 100 grams of opiates per day. My survival is literally divine providence. I know gratitude, self-acceptance and unconditional love for myself make the impossible easy, without them, I will not make it.
As an occasional to rare smoker primarily clean, it will become as natural as breathing, even when my old instincts lie to me every day, telling me how much better life is stoned all of the time. Everytime I smoke I want to get an out of this world experience, and there is only one way to achieve it, through self-control and disciplined use, not moderation. I know I have chosen the hardest path, but I cannot fight change anymore, the pain of not changing has become even worse. And I cannot give up psychedelics, because this would not be true to my desire to non-conform at all costs. I absolutely refuse at all costs today to live by dogma, and live with the close-minded and limited results of other people's thinking, but I have to rewire my own thinking forever, without fear to win."
6jsvz0,3,2017-06-27,[CPA Exam] Did I just make a big mistake?,celtic16,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6jsvz0/cpa_exam_did_i_just_make_a_big_mistake/,"I've posted about the CPA exam before and it's probably getting tiresome for you guys, but I just wanted to run my situation by you. I'm starting PwC in a little more than two weeks, and I originally had my FAR scheduled for July 29th. I've just finished F-3 (3 out of 10 units), and I simply felt overwhelmed with how much I'd have to cover in this short time span. Since I left my internship two weeks ago, I've been studying for about six hours a day, and I've done all the lectures (several replays and re-reads), exercises, and multiple choice. I talked this over with a few people and this morning I re-scheduled my exam date to August 31st so that I can cover everything and actually process the information. Has anyone ever done this? Do you think I should've just stuck with my original date? My friend had told me that it probably wasn't a good idea to take the exam right after starting a new job, anyway. The other issue is that I had BEC schedule for the first week of September, so I outright cancelled it and took the loss. Will cancelling an exam date look bad to the state board? I'm also a little wary of not being able to get the CPA bonus in time. Has anyone here completed the exam in a little less than a year (11 months)? Do you feel that almost everyone will have passed the CPA exam and I'll be the only one still studying? I had talked to someone who was a B4 senior manager and he said many subordinates took a couple of years to get their license and even had trouble being promoted to manager, since they didn't have their licenses.

I'm sorry if I sound really anxious but I've been losing sleep over this. "

**-Roles-**


**V:** The CTO of Axeon, a major tech company based in Stockholm. He has recently been featured in international media as the centerpiece of a sex scandal involving himself and a young Axeon intern. He is believed to have used company funds to pay for travel, meals and entertainment for himself and his young mistress. As a person, he is usually firm but fair with a great interest in technology. As of late, he is beyond stressed. He is being investigated by Axeon and understandably in marital difficulties. He has slept little in the past weeks. 


Dress: Suit and shirt. Black shoes. 


**M:** A young professional working for Emergency Elite Services, a company which specializes in providing a wide range of services at short notice to traveling business men and companies in special need. She has less than a year of experience as a personal business concierge and has never worked alone on a high profile assignment. She is eager to please and is often praised for going the extra mile for her clients. She has tried dating guys her own age but often find herself uninterested in them. She is attracted to men much older than her but has never had the courage to do anything about it. 


Dress: Business jacket, skirt and stay-ups. Rest optional


**-Scenario-**


V arrives in Amsterdam early in the morning. His assistant has called ahead to EES to book a business concierge for his stay. V is staying at the Grand Hotel Amrâth for two nights in order to settle legal matters before the Axeon investigation finishes. He is quite stressed and it shows. 

M has received written instructions from EES the same morning with a note from her handler at the agency. She is at first unsure why she was selected for this assignment, but appreciates the chance to work on a high-profile assignment. She glances over the customer profile and recognizes V from the newspapers and TV-news. She remembers him as being very handsome. As she reaches his door, M is nervous but determined. She straightens her blouse and knocks. 

V opens the door and sees a young woman standing outside. At first he doesn’t understand who she is or why she’s here. M introduces herself as “Mal” from EES. V tells her that he expected someone much older than her and looks her up and down in a way that signals disapproval. M feels very small and out of place. She excuses herself as she enters and hurries to sit down. 

V sits down with his tablet and continues editing an email. He doesn’t recognize M further. This makes M more nervous and she considers whether she should say something. Before she can, V tells her to take notes. He starts giving M orders on booking meetings, reserving seats and other things he needs while in Amsterdam. M does her best to keep up with him and scribbles at her notepad. 

When V has finished giving orders, he sighs heavily and asks M if she speaks Dutch. She says that she does. V tells her that he is going to take a shower but that he has some documents that she’ll get to translate for him meanwhile. M says that she’ll do so gladly. She takes care of V’s clothes as he undresses. He doesn’t seem to think of her as a woman, as he nonchalantly strips naked and hands her his clothes to fold. M is used to being treated like either a servant, a colleague or sometimes a slave. The agency carries out a lot of different tasks for a many different clients. Some prefer personal advice and a professional tone, while others just seem to want another person to dominate. 

V enters the shower and M finds herself staring at him as he leaves. M then starts looking around the room for the Dutch documents. She notices a few old news clippings left on the dresser. She recognizes photos of the girl that was called “the young mistress” and realizes she looks almost identical to M. Suddenly, she understands why she’s been asked to serve on this assignment and why she’s here alone. The realization shoots a small jolt of electricity through her and she notices that it makes her excited and a little scared. The idea of being selected based on the client’s sexual preferences over professional experience makes her feel like an expensive toy. This feeling makes her much more aroused than she expected and she realizes how much she wants this. She loves the idea of being selected as the ideal distraction for a man who is obviously in need of it. It makes her feel sexy and desirable in a way she’s never felt before. M is pretty sure that V hasn’t made the connection between her and his young mistress yet. 

M can still hear the water flowing in the other room. She catches herself imagining V naked in the shower. She imagines herself walking into the shower naked with him and dropping to her knees in front of him. The thought makes her blush and she slowly parts her legs and reach for her panties with one hand. As her fingers touch the fabric of her panties, M feels herself lose control of her fantasy and the images just keeps coming in her head. She sees herself on her knees, sucking V’s cock passionately. His hand on her head and water running from his chest, through her hair and down her back. She feels herself starting to rub her pussy and she isn’t sure if it’s fantasy or reality. It all feels so real. She imagines his stomach slapping against her face as he fucks her mouth deep. Her pussy is wet and she longs to be filled by him. Suddenly, she hears the water turn off and she hurries to dress. 

When V steps out of the shower, M is there with a clean towel and dries him off. She now regards his body, not with the eyes of a professional, but with lust. She blushes slightly as her hands touch his skin. M drops to her knees to dry his legs and scenes from her fantasy flashes before her eyes.  

V starts laying out clothes and makes ready to leave the hotel room. He seems quite stressed and asks M if she found the document he asked her to translate. M says that she hasn’t yet. That V will have to show it to her later. V sits down on the bed and looks tired. M asks him to tell her what is making him so stressed. As V starts talking about the investigation and his affair, M seats herself behind him and starts rubbing his shoulders. V groans but keeps talking. He allows M to keep touching him and her hands wander down over his back and his arms. She tells him to relax and let her take care of him for a short while. V reclines and closes his eyes as M seats herself at his feet and starts touching them lightly. V is filled with a relaxation foreign to him. 

M keeps moving her hands in small circles along V’s feet and legs. His legs are parted with nothing but a towel to cloak him. M feels a strong urge to touch herself, but keeps her hands in place. V is hot after the shower and she loves feeling how his body responds to her touch. M then says in a quiet voice “Do I remind you of her?”, “The girl in the photographs”. “I look just like her, don’t I?”. 

V glances down and for the first time looks directly at M. His gaze is piercing and she feels like a deer caught in headlights. Her heart is pounding hard as she looks back at him with great effort. She has never before felt such a strong urge to please a man before. Without waiting for an answer she says “Can I please suck your cock, sir?” with desperation in her voice, “I promise I’ll do a good job”. V’s stoic face shows the hint of a smile when he sees her sincerity. He opens his towel to reveal his naked body. M says “Thank you, sir” and leans forward.

These are important programs for many reasons, and I won't repeat the article in this post.  If you'd like to contact your elected representatives here's a sample letter you can use to send to Senators/Congress-people: 

Dear Representative/Senator X:

I am writing to convey my deep concern regarding the U.S. Department of State’s decision to not provide an opportunity for recent graduates of the Thomas R. Pickering and Charles B. Rangel fellowship programs to enter an orientation (“A-100”) class and assume tenure-track positions in the U.S. Foreign Service.  Significant resources have been invested in the education and training of these young professionals. However, the Department of State has unfairly changed the terms of the fellows' agreement.

As you may know, a decision was recently been taken by U.S. Department of State leadership to freeze all intake classes for new U.S. Foreign Service Officers.  Pickering and Rangel fellows were  instead offered an opportunity to enter the State Department’s Consular Fellows Program.  However, the Consular Fellows positions are limited, non-career appointments and those who accept that option will not have the opportunity to count this important work toward possible tenure or promotion. The Department's original agreement  required fellows to complete a graduate degree and additional, specific training, in exchange for tenure-track employment as Foreign Service Officers following the completion of their education. This has been the standard practice for over 20 years. 

This move by the Department of State hurts the American people and U.S. diplomacy as a whole by failing to allow American taxpayers to fully benefit from the significant investment in foreign language skills, cross-cultural communication and professional training that has gone into preparing these fellows to serve as Foreign Service Officers.  The Department’s new offer, which was put forth with no warning and with little time for fellows to consider it, funnels fellows into the Consular Fellows Program for an indefinite amount of time and  they will do the  same work as Foreign Service Officers without the benefit of their service counting towards tenure and promotion.

The Department of State leadership has the discretion to open up a special A-100 for the sixty-two fellows impacted by this decision. The Department did so earlier this year by holding special orientation classes for people who were made offers to enter the Foreign Service back in 2016, but has opted to not make the same exception for these fellows who entered into contractual obligations with the department to join the Foreign Service in 2015.  As these students were under the impression that their offers would be upheld, many left their graduate programs without pursuing opportunities (such as additional internships or career counseling) that would have allowed them to immediately move into another position following graduation until the next A-100 course was offered.  

Such actions by a federal agency can have significant impact on the federal government’s efforts to recruit and retain talent in the future.  In addition, because these fellowships specifically target underrepresented groups, the disproportionate impact of these actions on underrepresented candidates, including minorities and women, is especially glaring.

I urge Congress to continue to call upon Department of State leadership to authorize an A-100 class to accommodate the Rangel and Pickering fellows affected by this decision. Otherwise, the American people risk losing the financial and intellectual capital that has been invested in these young professionals who are committed to serving our country abroad.

Sincerely,

6jt9ox,8,2017-06-27,had to walk to work ((did i do something wrong)),HungryDirtDevil,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6jt9ox/had_to_walk_to_work_did_i_do_something_wrong/,"Hello everyone, I've posted here before about my Nmom and how I wish to God I could move out, but cannot. Anywho, something happened this morning this I can't really wrap my head around.

My internship, which (acc. to Nmom, their 9-5 hours make it so i can't spend any time with her) hired me on as a student writer during the summer. I'm not getting paid much, but at least I'm making something and spending my day away from my toxic mother. I only live maybe 10 mins away, so usually, (since i don't have my license) my father would drive me up. Unfortunately, Dad has picked up a job that prevents him from bringing me to work, and my Nmom said that she could drive me up because he couldn't.

Now here I am today, getting ready for work. I go through my morning routine and when 8:30 rolls around I see my Nmom grab her keys and head for the door. She says ""i'm going to get coffee, either you can come or you can walk to work."" Now, I'm confused. Not even a day ago she said she was willing to drive me up every day this week, now it doesn't feel like she even wants to take me.

I offer her that I can walk, and she shoots back, ""well you'll be late then."" Then leaves, slamming the door behind me. So I get my things together and walk to my job, she even passes me on the road and doesn't say anything. Did I do something wrong for her to be acting like this? The only thing I can think of is that yesterday I didn't talk much to her in the car and when she offered for me to drive home (when we were literally 2 mins from my house) I declined. 

Can someone help me with this? What should I say when she comes to pick me up? If anything? "
6jtl99,1,2017-06-27,Just got a year placement at a city firm - help me figure out how to invest the money?,TVKMarkII,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/6jtl99/just_got_a_year_placement_at_a_city_firm_help_me/,"So as the title suggests, I've just finished my 2nd year of uni and got a 12 month placement at a city firm that pays quite handsomely that starts in September for a year.

Fortunately my family are based in London and this means I'm able (and willing) to live at home rent-free and commute. I'm not sure what the cost of commuting is going to be yet as I don't know if the firm offers some kind of season ticket loan or something. 

But regardless, I am going to be earning ~£25,000 with very few expenses (I believe lunch &amp; travel only, plus leisure). 

My current financial situation:

* Student finance - maximum loan &amp; maintenance grant awarded. However currently I'm not registered as a student (certain admin issues at uni) for the 2017/18 so right now I won't get anything. I hope they'll be sorted but I'm able to do the placement regardless so I may or may not get the student loan, it doesn't really matter I guess.

* Uni scholarship - if I am registered as a student then I'll get a scholarship of ~£1,600 on top of my salary &amp; loan/grant

* Current account - currently im almost at the limit of my overdraft (went a bit overboard at the end of term). I intend to use some of my savings to clear it and then replenish it from a summer internship I have almost immediately (that internship is distinct from the placement). I have another standard current account that I don't really use anymore except for my DLA payments. But I feel it may be useful for differentiating what my money is for (see below).  

* Savings - I already have ~£12,000 in a stocks &amp; shares ISA organised by my financial advisor. I'm also meeting him on Thursday to discuss my options, see how my portfolio is doing and decide what to do moving forward. 

I already have a few things I want to use the money for:

* Invisalign - I had my braces when I was 13/14 but my orthodontist got changed half way through the process and the second guy was abysmal, took them off too early and didn't re-make a retainer for me when it broke. Subsequently my teeth aren't great, it's a real source of self-consciousness and I want to get them sorted asap. My estimation on cost is ~£2,000, I've got an appointment on Thursday to discuss it with my dentist.

* Holiday - I've committed to a big, once in a lifetime holiday with some friends to celebrate all of us turning 21, which is going to cost ~£2,500. I was going to do this anyway regardless of whether I got the job but I figure it's better to put my wages towards it than dip into savings. 

* Car - I currently have a car from the motability scheme and that lease ends this time next year. I'll need some money for a down payment for the next motability car. How much depends on the car. It can be anything from £50 to £2,000+. I'm expecting hopefully a £100-200 payout when I return the current car too to put towards it. I haven't looked into it too much because the catalogue of cars available changes fairly frequently so there may well be a lot of different cars available by the time I'm choosing mine.

* Rent for my final year - Up to now my mother has been paying my rent while at uni but my younger brother will be at uni by the time I return to uni and I will need to pay it myself. I estimate this to be ~£6,000 although I don't necessarily need to save the whole sum from my salary as obviously I will have my loan in final year to contribute.

* Long term - ideally id like to be a property owner by 30 (Im currently 21, will be 23 when I graduate). I am very fortunate that my parents are reasonably well off and have made noises in that they'd be willing to help me. Although I don't know in what way (whether they would loan/gift part of the deposit for example) or where my life or career will take me though so it is hard to plan too far ahead.  

So I suppose I'm coming here for some help/advice as to what I should do with this money. 

I obviously need some money available for every day things - lunch, spending money on clothes/games but I'm not sure how to balance it and how to allocate things.

Should I be giving myself a monthly/weekly allowance, then putting the test away in various pots? (Eg; holiday, car, Invisalign, rent) and then whatever is left over putting in my savings? Should I just divert X% to my isa for the long term goal of owning a property? And then use my 2 current accounts to differentiate between ""spending money"" and ""money for *specific things*""?

Any help/advice/ideas would be much appreciated, especially ones I can take to my financial advisor and see what he says!

Thanks. 

Edit: Also apologies for not tagging the post - i wasn't sure which to use. "
6jtzvf,0,2017-06-27,I'm [27F] stuck in limbo while my ex [32M] debates reuniting. How do I win him back?,downinthevallee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jtzvf/im_27f_stuck_in_limbo_while_my_ex_32m_debates/,"As the title explains, I really want my ex boyfriend back, but I'm stuck in this weird limbo of hot and cold, and a lot of indecision on his part. It's a purgatory I fully deserve. I'm turning to you because I'm looking for input from people who have been in a similar situation. We've been apart for about nine months.

My ex boyfriend, let's call him Adam, and I dated for about five and a half years, living together for about two and a half of them. We were very happy until about early 2016, when I got this idea in my head that I wanted to switch careers as I was feeling unfulfilled in my job and romanticized another profession that was completely in another field. As you can probably tell, I have a problem where I am too attracted to greener grass and I let it compromise a lot of the great things I already have going on in my life. Adam was initially supportive, but then as I researched more about this new career, it became apparent that we'd probably have to live apart so I could do a lengthy internship in another state. He did his own research about the viability of getting into this new career, asked friends and family members for their thoughts and even connected me to a coworker who moonlights in it. Don't worry; it's a totally legitimate profession and legal, but I'm trying to keep things vague intentionally.

So in the fall of 2016, I wanted to stay together long-distance and do this internship, but Adam did not and so we parted ways. He suffers from and is being treated for depression and anxiety, both of which increased greatly in the months leading up to the break. We were very much in denial initially, still very much in love, sleeping together, crying to each other, both of us independently and as a team thinking about how we could still make it work and get what we wanted: the new career for me and stability for him. I moved out and began to make arrangements for the internship, which would have started in spring of 2017. I tried to move on, but still thought of him constantly. After a few months of re-evaluating everything in my life, I learned that I was so much better off where I am in my current job and that yes, the grass is greener where you water it. The internship didn't happen, I've stuck with my job and it has improved amazingly, and Adam and I live about 15 minutes from each other. I realized that I had a history of messing things up while relying on the off-chance that the new shiny thing in front of me was going to make everything better (I'm seeing a therapist now to help me address and overcome it). Also, during this time Adam's coworker was extremely helpful, but ultimately convinced me that it would be a very hard job yielding little when compared to the huge up-front investment required. I relayed all of this to Adam after we had no contact for a few months and we kind of did the on-off thing/ trial runs to get back together, which leaves me in my current situation.

We are currently off right now and both of us are currently dating other people. Adam and I have met up a few times in the last few weeks to talk and see if there is hope for us getting back together. We've talked about getting married, where we see ourselves in 5 or 15 or 20 years, reuniting with all of our old friends together, and lots of other plans/dreams we have as a couple. With my career insecurity gone, and my desire to completely commit to him and our lives together, I know we can make this work and be happy. We've been there before and can have it again. He's told me repeatedly he loves me and will be happy with me. I've told him that I am in love with him, among many other things, and that I completely adore him: he is my voice of reason and wisdom, my copilot, and my best friend.

A few things are holding him back: his anxiety about my desire to have a stable, content life with him; his depression; and the thoughts and opinions of some friends and family who don't want to see us get back together. Sometimes we are both so grateful and extremely content just be in each other's presence, and sometimes he is too depressed to see me, stating that he feels vulnerable and not in a good enough space to enjoy things. Despite me reiterating my complete commitment to him and offering to do whatever it takes to repair the relationship, he is distant and extremely hesitant. We're stuck in this limbo for now. Adam tells me he wants me to be consistent for him over time while we continue to date other people, which is confusing to me.

I'm trying so hard to be patient for him and reassure him that I'm here whenever he needs me, which he appreciates and values. I know I messed up and it's my responsibility to fix things and start over. I guess my questions are, how do I remain patient and confident despite Adam's very conflicted feelings about me? Not knowing what is going to happen is incredibly difficult. How do I win back a man who loves me, but is depressed? How do I help him become the happy, well-adjusted version of himself?   
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My ex boyfriend of 5.5 years and I broke up in the fall for career- and instability-related reasons. We both still love each other, but he is keeping me at bay while he decides whether getting back together is a good idea, while simultaneously battling anxiety and depression. How do I support him and get him back?"

**Random Thoughts**

- Explosions surprise me on this show every. single. time. I was on the treadmill at the gym when smoking guy blew up his face. I squawked a little and covered my face. I’m sure the lady working out next to me thought I was crazy.
- I can’t blame smoking guy for not realizing oxygen and lighters cause explosions because I was 20 before I realized that gasoline wasn’t brown (I’d only seen gasoline on concrete). We all have things we should know but don’t. Fun Fact: The arrow next to your gas gauge indicates the side of the car your gas tank is on. (Just learned that this year.)
- Speaking of smoking guy…his wife was freaking me out a little with her emphasis on him being a salesman and having a nice face. Hopefully, it was just the shock. 
- And the Cristina/Burke drama continues. I feel like Burke really wanted to tell Derek and Cristina earlier but they were either distracted or busy. Still not a good excuse.
- I wasn’t a fan of Cristina’s decision to keep her helping him a secret. I get that she was trying to be a supportive girlfriend, but if she would have said let’s go see Shepherd and see what he can do I think Burke would have readily agreed to do that too. 
- I had forgotten that early Mark was a jerk to interns and residents. No me gusta his sass to Bailey.
- Also, no me gusta? Him and Callie hooking up.
- And the never ending Meredith/Derek back and forth continues as Derek dumps Meredith “for her own good.”
- Bye Finn! I’m not really gonna miss you.
- I would bet 8.7 million dollars that Cristina yelling “Are you pregnant?” was in the commercial promos all week long leading up to this episode.
- Izzie got some money! Money, money, money, money! We all know what she’s gonna use it for but still that’s a nice chunk o’ change.








**Quotes**

- “I can’t be pregnant, can I?” “With a McBaby!”
- “How’s my favorite dirty mistress?”
- “Mistakes are painful but they are the only way to find out who you are.”
- “It wasn't a date so much as a... disastrously... uncomfortable... sexual experience.”



**Questions**

- She wasn’t pregnant, but do you think Meredith would have kept the baby if she was?
- What do you think about Derek’s decision? Noble or nah?

Last week, my Instagram feed was filled with photos of teenagers wearing blue leggings covered in white stars and tank tops decorated with American flags. It was Olympics Week at my former summer camp, and these counselors were not shy about their support for Team USA. I spent a total of 13 summers at camp—seven as a camper and six as a counselor—and though many of my campers are now counselors themselves, the photos still made me nostalgic for bug juice and tie-dye T-shirts. [We asked readers](http://ift.tt/2rzZueQ) to tell us about their summertime experiences, and both teens and former teens responded with stories of their warm-weather follies.

Like me, a number of readers turned to summer camp to make the most of the months between school years. Rosa cited her job as Camp Leader as the first step toward a kid-centric career: “Those early summer experiences made a tremendous difference to helping me become the educator I became.” Abby, who spent six summers volunteering as a camp counselor,  described the selfless joy of making a child smile: “You don't do it for the glory, or the prestige, or the experience that's going to land you a C-level position, and certainly not for the money. We all do it for the kids.” For Daniel, who will return as a counselor to his camp in the Catskills this summer, camp is a critical part of his religious identity:

Camp’s most important role in my life is as my primary Jewish space. I don’t have many. After my Bar Mitzvah, my family began attending synagogue less and less, to the point that we stopped maintaining a membership. So, Judaism-wise, I am left with this: a congregation of secular Jews in the mountains of New York State, spending the summer living and educating according to Jewish values, if not law.

I certainly relate to Daniel’s response, not only because my camp is overseen by a Jewish nonprofit, but also because so many of my most vibrant summer memories are tied to that religiosity—making challah over a campfire; walking past older girls practicing their bat mitzvah Torah portions; and learning from our Israeli counselors. These experiences strengthened my religious identity because, quite simply, they were fun and social—a balance to my Hebrew school education, where I learned the nuts and bolts of the Old Testament and how to read Hebrew.

Of course, not everyone spends their summers canoeing and making friendship bracelets with campers. Nell, a 17-year-old from Massachusetts, will be wearing many different hats this summer:

I will be working on a huge research paper for an institute at my school. I will also be an intern at my state house of representatives. And currently, I’m in the second of three weeks in Russia, where I’m living with a host family and seeing lots of Putin imagery. Each of these activities is strategic. It allows colleges to know more about me just by looking at my activities list. And everyone at my school has a strategic summer planned out.

Last year, I worked at my local grocery store. I didn’t hate my job, but I felt so astoundingly bored. My summer this year promises not only to be intellectually engaging, but also will give me more free time and ability to see friends.

But Clover, who grew up in rural Idaho in the 1980s, learned a lot from her less-than-glamorous experiences working at a grocery store—part-time during the school year, and full-time in the summer:

My primary job was to clean the meat department each night. I scraped the floor, bleached the butcher blocks and cutting boards, and disassembled the hamburger grinder, carefully scouring each part. I also dismantled the chicken rotisserie and cleaned each part. I bagged up all the scraps, knotting the trash bags securely so they wouldn't attract vermin to the dumpster area.

Help!,dnasto,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6jvbtu/20f_4_years_into_a_relationship_20m_and_unsure_if/,"My boyfriend and I have been together since we were 16, we're 20 now and going to the same school. I am still very much in love with him, and there is no one else I am genuinely attracted to or that I want to be with right now. However, as we grow older things have gotten complicated and I'm not sure if we are going to be able to make it long term. I was kicked out when I was 17 and lived with his family until I was 19. I just got an apartment just over the border of the next state over, close to where we go to school. It was okay until he moved back to his house for the summer once the semester ended, now we see each other less than ever. He's doing an engineering internship all summer that has him working from 7pm-6am weekdays and I am working two jobs including weekends. We only get to talk for about 45 minutes each day, and see each other on weekends. I know this is temporary but he took the job with bizarre hours without even consulting me, plus he's fallen in love with it. I am happy for him for finding his calling but it has put a lot of stress on the relationship to the point where the only way we see each other is if I bend my schedule. We already have had problems with sex in the past, and now those are amplified. He doesn't have as strong of a sex drive and doesn't think about sex as often as I do. He's also less interested in mixing things up. When we do have sex it's usually amazing, but it's so infrequent that it drives me crazy. We've fought about this on and off for years and can't seem to reach a conclusion. 
He also seems to just assume we'll be together 'forever,' but never talks about actual plans with me, like what will happen in two years when we're done with college. Admittedly, I used to mock 16 year olds who planned their lives with their boyfriends in front of him, but we are in our 20's now and should be more comfortable about it. 
Finally, we have never had any trouble with either of us talking to other people and I can confidently say neither of us will ever cheat on each other. But he has been caught lying about what he does with his friends many times. I finally broke and snuck into his phone, and found that his roommate had been complaining about me (which he never mentioned to me, even though I had asked if there was a problem), and that he had been hanging out with a different friend (whom I don't really like) when he said he was home. He used to lie about hanging out with people, whether he drank, and even lied and said he wasn't at a party when he was. 

In general, I feel like I've always had to make sacrifices (skipping classes, passing up jobs or hanging out with friends, maneuvering my work schedule, etc) to make things work with him, and he still doesn't feel comfortable talking about the future, being honest with me, or asking my opinion. Sometimes I feel like I'm dating the same 16 year old. I don't want to break up, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a relationship like this. PLease help!!"

I was working a job making $73.5K per year but I just signed on with a new employer with a promotion to make $93K per year with $3K signing bonus...

I have about $100K saved up in cash with half of that tied up in investments, plus I have several thousands sitting in locked-in RRSP through my work benefits.

I have been driving a 2013 Honda Civic that I bought new as an intern about 4 years ago...and now that I did myself some good, I want to treat myself to a luxury car.

I found a really nice, slightly used 2017 Lexus IS for $43.5K before taxes. I test drove it and instantly fell in love with its sporty performance (drool) and red leather interior. I'll be selling my Civic to my parents so my brother can have it (for $10K) and I'm planning to pay down an additional $10K as well...bringing the total down payment to $20K.

I've always believed in living a sensible life but now that my income just shot up 30% or so, I'm finding it hard to resist treating myself a little (or a lot).

I'm still living with my parents hence no mortgage no rent, and no student loans either. I'm planning to help my parents expand the family business by co-purchasing a commercial property, so I have no plans to move out.

Is this something I can honestly splurge a bit on? Or is this still an unwise choice?"

I'm looking for a first IT job. I have performed desktop support in previous roles, though that was not my primary responsibility, and have experience working directly with end users including training and creation of documentation to assist them. I have experience programming in Ruby on Rails, some front end experience with HTML/CSS, as well as PostgreSQL. In my free time I work on my home lab, where I practice virtualization using Proxmox. I don't like coding enough to want to do it full time and would prefer to work my way into a systems administration or devops role. 

I am in the Denver area but am not opposed to traveling for the right opportunity. I am open to full-time, part-time, internships, apprenticeships, or volunteer work. Just looking for an opportunity to work with good people and get better at my craft in the process.

Please send me a message for my resume, Github, or any other information."
6jw024,475,2017-06-27,The Other Side: An EM Intern’s First Shift.,wtffng,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/6jw024/the_other_side_an_em_interns_first_shift/,"*Preface: I shared this with /r/medicalschool and I wanted to share it here with /r/medicine as well. I have changed certain presentations and details to maintain relative anonymity. I wanted to share this narrative to let people see my perspective as a new EM intern. It is long, so please- feel free to ignore it.*

All the best,

-wtffng

I arrive 30 minutes early to find my ID badge won’t unlock the double wide magnetically guarded doors to the ED. It’s the morning shift, so someone should be close behind me- therefore, I pull out my phone, furrow my eyebrows, and completely pretend to be doing something important.

A nurse walks by briskly and successfully swipes through the door with me stealthily following behind her. I walk to the resident workroom to find my key doesn’t work there either. A PGY-3 spies me fumbling and with a laugh pulls the door wide open.

He’s smiling. He’s excited for us to be starting. It’s genuine. He runs me through some basic charting requirements that haven’t been covered in 2+ weeks of HR classes and orientation, which at this point have all blurred together, interwoven between each night’s social adventures.

My shift begins at 07:00, and at 6:45 there’s a loud page “TRAUMA ACTIVATION, ROOM 4.” A grinning attending appears from nowhere, introduces herself- and instructs me to go to the trauma bay.

A life threatening gun shot wound is arriving via ambulance and we’re tying our gowns down. The room is calm, but swelling with people and heat- everyone mutually understanding that this will most likely be futile.

An older nurse peers around the room, trying to ascertain who to eliminate.

“WHOEVER’S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, LEAVE NOW,” she instructs, likely insinuating me. Several people scurry out the doors and I turn to leave, finding myself facing another attending who firmly says: “Stay here.”

The nurse starts circulating, instructing people she doesn’t recognize to leave. I’m fully gowned with a mask, but I know this won't protect me. As she nears, I turn to the trauma cart and pretend that I’m seeking some device which will be useful in the near future. She passes and I turn back, an escapee.

The patient is rolled in and movement starts. Intubation, CPR - but within minutes it is determined that yes, this is most certainly futile, and the patient's time of death is called.

I walk back to my ED section to receive sign-outs. The attending looks up warmly:

“Welcome to the Emergency Department, Dr. Wtffng.”

There are three Interns, one PA, and one Attending. The attending looks around and wonders aloud “Do we have no senior here? No? Looks like a busy day.”

We’ve been informed that as interns our expectation for these first shifts are simply this: Do an HPI. Learn the system. Be honest.

I haven’t done an EM shift in 2 years now, and my excitement is tempered by the growing realization that after 8+ years of education, I might know nothing.

I push back against this thinking and set to work as the clock strikes 07:00. I look up at the patient board and see red rapidly disappearing as the team logins to the EHR. I scan the list and pick up the first one I see- a seizure.

The patient’s from out of town, no history available. No worries, I’ve done seizure work-ups plenty of times in the past, right?

As I walk towards the room the nurse pulls back the curtain and exits.

“Hi! I’m WTF, the intern working with you today for the first time here.” We exchange formalities and he is kind. He’s patient. I ask him to let me know if he needs anything and what he thinks about the patient.

So here it goes. The first patient seen with an MD straggling along behind my name.

“Hello, I’m WTF FNG, call me WTF. I’m the resident doctor taking care of you this morning.”

The patient is younger. Engaged. Smart. Here for work and he certainly knows more about seizures than I do. He informs me he’s got important things to do, and he hasn’t slept well the last couple nights and had a couple drinks the previous- likely the cause.

I do an HPI and order labs. I’m trying to contact an outpatient neurologist in some far away state who I soon realize doesn’t want to respond to pages sent from East Coast Time.

I pick up another patient, dizziness. I whisk into the room to find a pleasant older woman who is here only because her son was concerned. She’s got important things to do, and wants to escape this place to her cabin for the weekend.

I tidy up things for my first patient and discharge him. He looks at me says “Hey- Thank you, that was really quick and thorough.”

I laugh and respond “Hey I appreciate that. Don’t tell anyone on your way out- but it’s my first day as a doctor.”

I smile, shake his hand and leave before I can see if his face drops into disappointment. I exit the room to find the nurse standing there, obviously overhearing this statement, with an expression somewhere between amusement and scorn.

I am admitting the woman with dizziness and break the news that she likely won’t be making it to her cabin this weekend. There’s soft pushback. I explain that if she were my mother I’d want her to stay in the hospital for further evaluation, and I would.

There’s a small pause and I blurt out “if you want, you can call me Dr. WTF FNG, RUINER OF WEEKENDS. I propose a weekend of awful hospital food and cable TV rather than a relaxing weekend at the cabin.”
She stares at me for a moment, and begins to laugh. She agrees to stay. I exit the room again to find the nurse holding onto an expression somewhere between concern and breaking laughter.

These damn curtains. I speak loudly and everyone can hear my weak passes at wit.

I step backwards onto a small neurologist who has somehow snuck behind me. He does not feel that another patient of mine warrants a neurological consult but he’s already here in the ED and he’s trapped. Success. A tap on my shoulder saves me from the debate and I set to fix one of the many problems I’ve created from bumbling through the EHR.

I don’t know how to document properly for billing, admit correctly for admissions, and discharge sufficiently to get the patient out. The PA is a saint. Seriously. Every question is answered patiently, from phone numbers to drug dosing. My attending, also up for canonization- is juggling every patient in the section while teaching three interns. The nurses are supportive, and graceful as they inform me of each small misstep and how to fix it. I can tell I'm slowing them down, but they're as understanding as over-worked nurses can afford to be, and I'm damn appreciative of this.

I sit and try to catch up on non-existent notes and again my shoulder is tapped as I’m halfway through a sent-

“That’s you.” The nurse informs me.

“What?” I respond confusedly.

“Trauma to Bay 4.”

“What?”

“You. That’s you. Go to Trauma Bay 4.”

It clicks. Those overhead pages now address me at this time.

The rest of my shift blows by, fueled by pretzels and coffee. I see the sick and ill alongside the worried well. I witness the aftermath of tragedy that will surface darkly in the newspaper days later.

Each time I sit to chart, my phone rings or my shoulder is tapped. I incorrectly place and fix orders. I am slow. I feel I know nothing. Things that went so fast as a medical student take longer now, and are so much more complex. There was no magic click or growth following the MD that was placed behind my name a month ago. I am still just me, with the same knowledge base. As I work I realize the auditioning medical students likely, or perhaps certainly- know more than me.

I can feel hard in my gut that I don’t have a flow, nor method to manage the tasks constantly flooding me. My shift ends and I melt into a chair in the resident workroom to catch up on my mangled notes.

Two senior residents slide into the room and flop down on the couch. They are on an off-service rotation and enjoying the periodic downtime and freedom.

“So how’d it go?”

I explain my concerns about flow and knowledge, pace and expectations.
They laugh.

“It comes with time. You guys are doing great, seriously. It’s a whole new approach and we all do it a little differently. In a couple months you’ll be managing all of this and more with ease.”

They pause and one asks “So what did you think?”

I sit for a second and scan my hazy memory of the past 9 hours. For a moment my gut relaxes.

“It was awesome. I made the right choice.”

They laugh.

“wtf, Welcome to Emergency Medicine.”"

If I happened to have missed anything, please let me know.

&amp;nbsp;

Full disclosure - a few more items from previous episodes have been added; (all lists re-sequenced accordingly):

-	""Rags to Riches"" (from “The Ex-Girlfriend”, added to Music Referenced)

-	Richie Brandes (from ""The Baby Shower"", added to Characters Referenced, Not Shown)

-	Pot roast (from ""The Baby Shower"", added to Foods Referenced)

&amp;nbsp;

***
## [“The Chinese Restaurant”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese_Restaurant)
Production code: **206**

Episode no.: **S02E11**

&amp;nbsp;

Possibly the first of the “classic” Seinfeld episodes?

&amp;nbsp;

“*NBC executives objected to its production and broadcast due to its lack of an involved storyline, thinking that audiences would be uninterested. It was not until [Larry] David threatened to quit if the network forced any major changes upon the script that NBC allowed the episode to be produced, though the network postponed broadcast to the near end of season two.*”

&amp;nbsp;

There may not be a lot going on in this episode setting-wise, but there’s a helluva lot going on otherwise. For starters, there are (by my count) nine characters to add to the Referenced, Not Shown list. Of these, three are names called out by the maître d': Lashbrook, Keckitch and Dennison. I think it’s a very fair assumption that each of the dinner parties has at least one member of each name. And then there are mentions of Jerry’s relatives: his uncle, aunt and cousin. Oh, and also his sister, who would not be mentioned ever again in the series. I have to assume that the uncle is not Uncle Leo; since Uncle Leo has already appeared in the series by this point, wouldn’t Jerry have mentioned him as such? By default, that would rule out Leo’s wife, Stella (who doesn’t appear until S03E03). And also rules out Cousin Jeffrey. Hence, these family members are considered here to be three separate characters. The mysterious sister, who we never hear about again, makes four.

6jx5j0,1,2017-06-27,Not sure if I'm[M/18] overreacting but I feel like my boyfriend [M/19] is drawing away from me.,thisisnotathrwaw-y,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jx5j0/not_sure_if_imm18_overreacting_but_i_feel_like_my/,"So here's the backstory to our relationship. You can just skip to the next paragraph if you don't think this is particularly relevant. We've been dating for a total of 4 years, but we broke up for one year during our relationship after we dated for 3 years. The reason for this breakup was because he said he wasn't interested in guys anymore and wanted to date girls and he was, and I quote ""From the gay to straight spectrum, I'm pretty much straight"". The reason I can remember this so accurately is because I was pretty much completely devastated when I heard this and I can honestly recall every minute of our conversation on that day. Skip forward 6 months later, we're back together after me interrogating his relationship he had with a girl about a month after we broke up. I had a huge amount of questions but eventually, I couldn't deny that I loved him so we ended up dating again.

So I'm in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend as we go to different colleges. We basically only see each other for a total of 5 months if we add up all the breaks. Currently, we're both on summer break but he's going on a month long vacation for the next month. As a result, we more or less have only 2 weeks left together. Obviously, I'd love to spend time with him as much as possible as I really do love him. However, it feels like he's not interested in me. I recently got a new job which has rather long hours meaning I don't have as much time to talk to him as phones aren't allowed during work. Also, because of the long hours, we can't play video games together. In addition, he's busy with his internship so we have very few opportunities to see each other. Today was the first time I've seen him in a week as I finally got a day off from work. I was honestly completely drained from the past week but I wanted to spend my day off with him because hey, he's my boyfriend. The past week was pretty bland as we haven't really exchanged many messages with each other aside from pleasantries like good morning/good night so I was really looking forward to seeing him.

Unfortunately, our date wasn't really much of a date but more of a ""watch me play video games in Starbucks"". I get it. He likes playing video games but honestly, I haven't seen you in so long. I'm literally taking time I'd much rather be using to sleep and rest to spend time with you. Aside from playing games in Starbucks and not talking to me, he honestly seemed more interested in the type of teas he could get a free refill from. Two hours after I saw him which just consisted of me watching him play games/us going to the bathroom (I drank a lot of water cause it was super hot outside), we went to eat lunch but by then, I was honestly just so tired because I had a shift until 1 am and was completely drained. Also, while he went to use the bathroom, I looked through his search history, I saw he was looking through the photos of two girls. They're not (at least to my knowledge) particularly close with him so I'm assuming he just looked through them because they contained pics of their mutual friends. But my innate jealousy immediately jumped to him becoming ""straight again"".

We ate and talked a bit and near the end, he ordered another dish after I said I was full and the dish would take another 10 minutes to finish. Not sure why but I was really pissed and I just said to meet me later as I had an errand I had to do so I gave him money for half of the bill and left to do it and told him to meet me at a place later. Looking back, that was pretty mean of me to do as it was more time to spend with him and talk with him so I'm not really sure why I did it. Afterwards, we went to an internet cafe where I just watched him play another game and afterwards, we went home separately (We could've taken the same bus but it would've taken him 10 minutes longer and he didn't want to). Throughout the date, he never kissed me of his own accord. When I first saw him, I basically showered him in kisses because I was so happy to finally see him and he basically never spent more than a minute looking directly at me. I tried to get him to at least look happy to see me and kiss me but my interest waned as time went on. Honestly, I'm just worried that he's becoming ""straight again"". It seems like we never talk anymore and I don't want to do. We're generally very vocal about our concerns but I don't want to seem like an overly clingy jealous boyfriend. He knows that he broke my heart a year ago when he dated a girl and straight up said he wasn't interested in guys anymore and he said he was extremely sorry and would let me know if he ever felt that way but ever since that, I've always felt like he would turn ""straight"" again at any time. Is there any way for me to tactfully present my concerns without seeming like I'm overly jealous and possessive?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Saw my boyfriend after a week of working long hours. Decided to spend my day off instead of just sleeping the entire day (which I very much wanted to do) but he barely showed any interest in me during our date. What should I do?"

6jxo9q,3,2017-06-27,How do i transition to a new job?,howdoisaythrow-away,MechanicalEngineer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineer/comments/6jxo9q/how_do_i_transition_to_a_new_job/,"Hi,
I am in need of some career advice, and wasnt sure where to ask. Im a recent Mech Eng grad (2016), and im stuck between two jobs. In the summer of my junior year and the beginning of my senior year I was desperate to get a full time job lined up for graduation. I had a good GPA and had some internship experience, had interviews but had no offers for about 6 months. Around February 2016 I heard from a big defense contractor recruiter, went to the interview and got an offer. Since i was desperate, and was back in the same area where my parents lived it seemed like the perfect match. The work was controls heavy (systems engineering) so it seemed like i would enjoy it. What i didnt understand was that the job was contingent on receiving a security clearance and the length of security clearance investigation. I had a job offer, but I couldnt work until I got cleared. I talked to the hiring manager and he said that there was nothing he could offer me to do if i had no security clearance, and the recruiter said the same thing. I was informed that i shouldnt work anywhere else since it would delay or potentially stop my security clearance. They also informed me that a TS SCI would only take 5-7 months. Turns out that was not the case. I applied for my TS in March thinking that by the november of 2016 at the latest i would be working. I waited, and I waited. Nothing happened, and after contacting the hiring manager all i got was: the process takes a year now, the process takes 13 months now, etc etc. I know he had no control over it, but I couldnt sit at my parent's house without doing anything for a whole year. I applied for a job in a smaller construction company as a systems engineer thinking I would at least be getting some experience. I got the new offer and the title said office engineer. I asked the manager of the construction company about it, and he said it was just for HR to handle salary and such. I started working and turns out they put me in construction management, and never got exposure to anything i did in school. I was sad for about 2 months, but i thought i should make the best of it. I have been working here for about 6 months. The work is basically sending out bids for projects to GCs, and we mainly specialize in Electrical work (I have some electrical background but dont know much about switchgear, and automatic transfer switches for generators). I have teaching myself every aspect of the job, and have finally started making sense of the components. However the work is extremely dull.

Now after months of working at a different job, I heard back from an investigator and got interviewed. Then a new hiring manager from the defense contractor contacted me, and told me the old hiring manager left the company and that he would like to bring me in. Soon after that i heard from him about a week later that my security clearance went through, and Im cleared. He gave me dates to start and be on boarded. I thought about staying in my current employment but i dont feel excited about the work and i dont feel like i fit in even after 6 months. Im ecstatic and want to move on with my career but dont want to leave my current employment without something concrete. I have the old offer that was signed in 2016, but im not sure if thats as good as a brand new offer. How do i transition from my current company to the new company?"
6jxqkg,2,2017-06-27,Nothing interesting to add. Just discouraged.,Gforce904,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/6jxqkg/nothing_interesting_to_add_just_discouraged/,"Per the title, don't have anything constructive to contribute, I'm just pretty discouraged at the moment.

I'm 22 (nearly 23), freshly graduated college, trying to start some kind of career in a field related to my degree. Still pretty financially dependent on my parents, still living at home. Have a paid internship this summer at a small company that may turn into a full time job, but dice are still in the air about that.

While the company I'm at isn't a ""Christian"" company, Jesus might as well be in the water everyone drinks. EVERYONE is Christian and involved with a church. I'm also still living at home with my very Christian family, and my dad who is a pastor, for good measure. I'm by no means out yet to anyone in these circles. But I'm getting weary of being nearly constantly surrounded by people who, if they won't directly oppose and confront my beliefs and future lifestyle (atheist and gay), will at the very least not be on my team, supporting me. And the way things could go financially, I'm possibly looking at not being out of my parent's house for another solid 6 months at the earliest.

I'm discouraged at feeling like it's me against the Christo-fascist mob. Also frustrated because it's safer for me to remain closeted and behaving as my parents would have me while I'm in their house, but I feel like I'm wasting time and youth that I will never get back, just sitting around and biding my time waiting to be able to live openly without hiding so much of what I believe and desire.

I think that about covers it for my pity party. Anyone relate or care to add anything?"

Rachel Lindsay’s journey to find love on _The Bachelorette_was rudely interrupted by the NBA Finals, so to make up for lost time, ABC gifted viewers with back-to-back episodes to help us fill the endless hours between birth and ascension to the stars. Last night’s episode ([read the recap here](http://ift.tt/2rZWXuC)) ended with Lee and Kenny on the dreaded two-on-one date in a dark Norwegian wood and it only went downhill from there.

Kenny vs. Lee Continued
-----------------------

When we last saw Rachel she was stuck in between a righteously indignant Kenny and a smirking, arrogant Lee and frankly there wasn’t enough room in all of Norway for the three of them. Rachel had to pretend it was a tough decision, but she knew Lee had to go. She told him that she doesn’t trust him, gave Kenny the rose, and they headed off to the helicopter to leave Lee to sulk in a pool of his own gas-lighting grossness. It was all over, but then Kenny made a fatal mistake. He had won the girl and was ditching Lee on a desolate spit of land in a distant corner of Norway. He was out the door, but went back to bid Lee a not-at-all fond farewell, leaving Rachel in the helicopter to question her choice. He finally finished telling Lee to “Be the you that God intended you to be” and went back to Rachel who was rolling her eyes so hard the helicopter pilot had to over-correct.

— Claire Fallon (@ClaireEFallon) [June 28, 2017](https://twitter.com/ClaireEFallon/status/879853651899990016)

Rachel wasn’t sure she wanted to give Kenny the rose, but he explained that he is able to be a calm, kind human because he doesn’t bottle things up. He knew that if he didn’t say something to Lee he would regret it, so he decided to make the mentally healthy choice and exorcise that high-haired drawlin’ demon before it started haunting him. It made a whole lotta sense, so Rachel decided to keep him around. She gave him the rose. He went and told his daughter and cried his eyes out.

A Random Rose Ceremony
----------------------

Remember when [rose ceremonies](http://ift.tt/2tiNvpX) happened at regular intervals on the show? Rachel gathers the men together and starts doling out roses. First up is Dean, Eric, Peter (the guy she made out with in a hot tub for an hour), Alex, Adam (who?) and then it was down to the final rose and she gave it to some guy named Matt who is a construction manager from Meriden, Connecticut (none of this is ringing a bell). That meant Anthony and Josiah were sent home and Josiah was not having it, saying things like, “If she doesn’t give me a rose, there’s something wrong with her brain,” ’causing every woman in America to simultaneously get in touch with their inner Beyoncé and say, boy bye.

Off to Denmark
--------------

To wash the taste of Lee out of her mouth (wait, she didn’t kiss him did she?) Rachel once again backed up her bevy of beaus and hurried across an international border. They landed in Copenhagen, land of vikings, saunas, and good design. Plus going to Denmark gave Rachel a great excuse to point out the castle that inspired Shakespeare to write Hamlet.

Did you know that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet in these very hot tubs?! [#TheBachelorette](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheBachelorette?src=hash)

Eric Gets A One-on-One Date
---------------------------

Rachel invites Eric to explore Copenhagen with her, so they hop on a boat and drift along the harbor and have a lot more chemistry than you might expect. They drink enough that they think getting in one of Copenhagen’s public hot tubs is a good idea. It’s a good hot tub, but it has nothing on her hot tub make out with Peter yesterday. After lounging around in swimsuits, they put on parkas and hats to fool around at the Tivoli amusement park, but then Eric brings the mood down by telling Rachel that he was never loved as a child. He’s about to tell Rachel that he will [guard and protect her heart](http://ift.tt/2rZTzzF), when she cuts him off with a rose and a kiss.

We can find a hot tub anywhere on the planet. 😉[#TheBachelorette](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheBachelorette?src=hash)

Viking Date
-----------

Dean, Kenny, Bryan, Alex, Matt, Peter, Adam are invited to play viking. They sail a viking ship to a viking beach to learn how to fight like vikings, which will surely end in a viking funeral. Then Rachel has to grab someone’s stick to protect herself from marriage and, well, that’s all there is to stay about that. Kenny and Adam were deemed the winners, but winning just meant more fighting. They both ended up bloody and bleeding all over the place, but it was Kenny who was crowned viking king. That didn’t earn him anything but bragging rights and a sick helmet, though. At the after party, Bryan grabbed Rachel for alone time and they kiss and catch up and Rachel meekly asks him if his family would accept her, and he assure her that they would. Then Kenny and Rachel have a talk. He really likes Rachel, but realizes that their relationship isn’t all that far along and he really misses his daughter. Rachel really likes him, too, but agrees and they decide that Kenny should go home. He calls his daughter from the limo and tells her he is coming home and breaks down in tears again. To cheer herself up, Rachel gives Peter the date rose.

Will Fails To Fly On His Date
-----------------------------

Will and Rachel cross an international border and head to Sweden for a date. They wander the city, meet a charming old couple who shares tips on a long-lasting relationship, and generally admire the scenery, but despite the fact that they are spending the day in a very romantic setting, Will is not making any sort of a move on Rachel. No kissing, no hugging, no canoodling. At dinner, Rachel calls him on it and as he explains, it seems clear that he has fallen into the typical nice guy trap of wanting to build a natural friendship, not a romance on the producers’ schedule. He goes home.

And Another Rose Ceremony
-------------------------

Rachel gathers the men together, but before she can start [handing out roses](http://ift.tt/2tj0Ej3), she is overcome with emotion. She leaves the room to get herself together and make sure her mascara isn’t running. Once she is composed, she hands out roses to Bryan, Matt (really?), and Dean get roses and then it’s the final rose. Peter and Eric are already safe, so that means Alex and Adam are on the line. For some reason she sends Alex home, opting to keep the man who brought a _doll_ on his date. Guess Rachel is just into dolls.

We may not know how to put together a proper PowerPoint, but we can incorporate dolls into rose ceremonies and group dates like a BOSS!

Roses and thorns time again! My rose is that I had a great vacation and now I'm starting two fascinating internships. My thorn is that I'm supposed to take the GRE in a month and I haven't started studying!!

What's your rose and thorn for this week?"
6jyk0g,1,2017-06-28,Can't tell if I hate my job or just depressed.,Anatumaini,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6jyk0g/cant_tell_if_i_hate_my_job_or_just_depressed/,"Some background:
I've been clinically depressed for about 6 years. I went back on antidepressants 6 mo ago (had a negative experience with doctors, scared me off for a bit) but haven't found anything that does squat yet.

I've worked at my current job (software development) for 5 years, first part time during college as an intern then full time after I graduated 2 years ago.

The job pays extremely well and the people I work with are professional in manner. There are a lot of horror stories in the software development industry about the ""boys club"" culture and rampant sexism, even at this company at the main hq (I'm at a remote branch), however the location I work at I have had no problems with such. The work is... Well, stress is common, but we have a high quality bar and generally understanding managers/stakeholders and the company really cares about its customers. We are making new stuff and releasing new stuff nearly every week, so not just maintenance and support work.

The culture is pretty laid back, no dress code, flexible hours, etc. It's a job where we help people make money by doing what they love, so no moral problems.

All in all, it's a great place to work and I should love working there. Right?

I dread getting up the mornings to go to work. More often than not I find myself counting the hours until I can go home. In a typical 8 hour day, this can start as early as 7 hours to go. My productivity has been dropping for the past year or so and my manager has called me out on it a few times (she doesn't know I'm depressed). I have a project I'm supposed to be delivering on by the end of the week and for the past 2 days I have made 0 progress on it because I just can't focus.

The problem is, I can't tell if it's me or the job.

I have never worked at this job while not depressed so I don't really have a baseline. I do know that I started having major problems-anxiety, even more dread, so freaking tired etc. about a year ago when my team underwent meosis &amp; I switched managers but there was a lot of other stuff going on around the same time so it's hard to point to that as being related.

I do know that I loved my CS college classes before I was depressed and on my better days a few years ago I almost looked forward to going to work, as much as it was possible to look forward to anything when everything is covered in a fog of angst and despair.

I told my mom that I wanted to quit, move back in with her, and live off disability forever. She didn't know if I was joking. Neither did I.

There might be an option soon for me to switch teams, to the other half of my old team before the split, so I might try that and see if it changes anything. But I don't know what else to do. Leaving the company seems like killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Especially if it's just me.

I'm afraid it's just me. I'm afraid work (being an adult [living]) will make life even more sucky than it already is until I find a treatment that helps. I'm afraid nothing will help and I will hate life for the rest of my life.

Thanks for letting me vent, /r/depression."
6jytwu,3,2017-06-28,I'm a [21 M] and my family [42 F] and [51 M] won't let me go- please help,Lucas1336,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6jytwu/im_a_21_m_and_my_family_42_f_and_51_m_wont_let_me/,"I feel crushed and trapped. I had grown up in a demanding household. My parents could be a bit abusive and excessive in my upbringing. Sometimes a punishment for bringing home a 60 or 70 on a test was some slapping around and a scolding. Sometimes a kick to the ribs. Sometimes it ranged to having a tooth knocked out. Dead serious. My parents were a bit excessive in the punishments at times. I've forgiven them- they were going through an emotional time and I wasn't the easiest child to handle.

Fast forward- I was a good high school student. 4.0 GPA, Honor Society, clubs, high SAT scores and extracurriculars. I had secured an internship at a civil engineering firm. I felt like I was on top of my game, and things were finally looking up for me. I felt in control, and excited for college- like so many students. My dark days were over. Heh.

I accepted and enrolled in a Ivy League School at my parents urging. I earned a partial scholarship and they promised to help me pay the rest of the rather small difference. They immediately gave me the two choices- Medical or Engineering. I naturally loved Engineering- especially civil. I excelled at my work in the firm and I was hoping I could major in Civil, maybe even Construction Management. However- my parents crushed that hope real fast. Computer Engineering was the new field they claimed. In actuality- they read a online article and ran with the idea.

I hated coding. I hated every class with a passion. I watched my other friends party it up at their colleges. I've never even been near a fraternity- or a party. I have next to no social life. The monotony of studying and worrying was my entire semester. I wound up taking loans to cover the cost. Even though I begged them to let me switch- they told me I could walk out and sleep on the street if I switched. Arguments became physical fights. They also realized quickly that the little kid they used to hit- could hit back.

My father struck me when I was in a argument with my mother. I struck him back and with horror I realized I broke his glasses and left a bruise. 

I'm at my wits end. I'm struggling in every class. I'm scraping by just to get the bare minimum for my scholarship. I hyperventilate and get chest pains on a regular basis. It's been 3 years of constant pain and stress. I just want this over with. I just don't think I can't last another year.

TL;DR: Stuck in a major I hate with loans piling up and I'm about to break down "
6jywh3,2,2017-06-28,Joining the military after college?,nojob1yeardead,Militaryfaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Militaryfaq/comments/6jywh3/joining_the_military_after_college/,"I graduated last year after 5 years of college with a major in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics.

I've applied to any job I could find regardless of experience needed or pay or anything really in the software industry. I live in Wisconsin and I've applied to jobs in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and even in places like Kentucky and Missouri and I've gotten no replies or follow ups whatsoever.

In college I didn't have any sort of senior project and I never had an internship (my GPA was extremely low at a 2.108 and I flunked several semesters after an extreme bout of depression and a few suicide attempts that landed me in the ER) so there's not much I can put on my resume outside of some of the basic skills I learned in school.

I have about 100k in student debt and work at an Applebee's kitchen to make ends meat and live in a rundown house in the middle of nowhere with 4 other guys. There's black mold everywhere and the roof leaks and the deck out back collapsed and tore a huge chuck outta the house where we had to nailgun tarps over it so water doesn't get in. We have spotty satellite internet that is very slow since we live in a rural area about 20 minutes outta the nearest town. I haven't coded anything since getting out of college. 

Another issue is I'm not at all physically fit, so I doubt any branch would want to accept me. Would joining the service help me find a job?"
6jz0qk,0,2017-06-28,[18/M] are my gf's [15/F] parents right when they say i should stay away,syskb,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6jz0qk/18m_are_my_gfs_15f_parents_right_when_they_say_i/,"TL;DR im a soon to be college freshman dating a sophomore in hs. we drink together often but (i think?) our relationship doesnt revolve around alcohol. her parents know about me after i made one of the worst first impressions possible and want us to stay away from each other. im going away to college soon. pretty sure im a terrible influence

so i've known this girl for around 6 months now, we met through school and gradually got closer as we started working an internship together, late night convos, movie/dinner dates etc. it got to the point where we were basically talking each and every night and during one of those dates i realized that i've never felt this way about a girl before. she laughs at my stupid jokes, comforts me, sings songs to me, we're both rebellious and adventurous, and both love the taste of alcohol. this is my first gf but not my first relationship, i might be her first bf (never asked). perhaps there is a little bit of puppy love involved but our feelings for each other do feel genuine. i asked her out and we've been official for about 2 months or so. 

here's where it gets juicy. i met her parents for the first time about a month ago... except that i hardly remember it. it all starts at a karaoke birthday party for one of her friends. i provide the alcohol because i'm the oldest one there and i have the means to do so. my gf and i end up being the only ones to actually get drunk, actually fuck that, we got HAMMERED, like 12+ shots and a few beers, both of us rather small people. i have never been that shmizzed in my entire life. we go on a liquor run to pick up some more and on the way back we split up somehow and i'm stuck outside the karaoke place alone. i end up passing out with 2 bottles of vodka in my hand on the sidewalk for a good 20 minutes according to bystanders. turns out my gf went inside and locked herself in the bathroom throwing up.. eventually her parents came to the venue because she told them where she was and of course they saw me passed out. when i finally came to her dad tried talking to me, asked me if i gave alcohol to his daughter, and i straight up told him ""fuck off i'm 23"" and sprinted away - with only 1 bottle (her dad took the other one lol).

that was her parents' first impression of me. their second was today. we were eating in a restaurant along with 2 other friends in the middle of the city when she randomly decides to track where her parents are... and they're right outside the restaurant. she told them what neighborhood she was in and they deadass narrowed it down. keep in mind this was in manhattan so not an easy task at all. us being the scheming little shits we are, devise a plan where the girls leave together and i chill inside the restaurant and leave a bit after. 

this backfires horribly. they completely miss the girls coming outside and walk straight into the restaurant to see me sitting alone when there were clearly other people eating there with me. the dad immediately recognizes me (my second time wearing the outfit that i wore to that party... coincidence huh) and starts interrogating me. asks me if im her bf, if i want to be her bf, what happened at that party, why i was kissing her (they saw security camera footage lol), if we've had sex, my future endeavors. i play dumb since my gf and i already talked about what our stories would be if something like this happened. tells me he just wanted to have a man to man conversation with me but he couldn't that night because i was passed out. gets my phone number for some reason. wraps up the conversation by saying that he knows we're a thing because one of her friends ratted her out and that he just wants me to stay away from her because she's too young.

i know we shouldn't be drinking underaged, especially her. the issue is that she'll drink anyway regardless of whether it's with me or not. she drinks quite often by herself, i would say every other night usually light stuff chardonnay/sake - why, i don't know. i guess because it's easily accessible to her in the house and she likes the taste and the feeling but i know she also drinks when she's stressed out or sad or whatever. when we drink together we usually just get tipsy tops, and when we're seeing each other often that's like.. 2-3 times a week. most recently we haven't been seeing each other so often and it has cooled down. but i would say at least half the time we hang out alcohol is involved. this worries me because i feel like this is pretty unhealthy for her. i'm also a little worried that she could just be using me to acquire alcohol (but she can acquire it anyway so...). this also makes me feel like a bad influence - it's not like i try to be one, but by me wanting to have fun and her asking for it, i just end up enabling her. keeping her out late also makes me feel like a bad influence. also i think it's worth noting that i've never drank as frequently as i have with this girl, i was always more of the stoner type but recently i've been drinking way more often because of her... whereas she drinks just as often as she always did.

i know that night was highly irresponsible. i've drank plenty of times before and never have i let it go that far. i do feel very guilty for letting my gf get that drunk and making an embarrassment out of both of ourselves. that situation could've easily been avoided if i was just a little more mature and i don't want something like it to happen ever again.

i'm going away for college (not that far from my city) so i know things will be weird when i'm ready to leave. when i asked her out i pretty much just wanted someone to have fun with for the rest of the school year and the summer and didn't think about what would happen after that. but now school is over, summer has started, and it's made me realize i don't have much longer until i go away for college and we can no longer see each other like we do now. i don't know how well long distance would work - tbh i miss her after just a few days of not seeing her. i would also be living a completely different life in college, surrounded by completely different people (girls) than in high school (i vibe much more with the people at my college than high school). i can't really see it ending any other way than heartbreak... 

some pet peeves i have with her: 

she gets mad when i take a while to reply but when i reply instantly (which i usually do) she will often take time to reply to me even though she literally just texted me.

most recently (past 2 weeks) hasnt been trying very hard to see me, cancelled plans a few times and when she finally made the time to see me (today) i don't even get a hug or a kiss or even a real greeting she just jumped into conversation with her friends and didn't pay much attention to me. maybe this was my fault for letting her friends have dinner with us since i dont know them very well so i felt a bit isolated

basically makes a post on snapchat every time she drinks

so like the questions i have:

is the age difference a big deal?

should i be worried about her alcohol consumption?

am i a bad influence?

is this a toxic relationship?

are her parents right when they say i should stay away from her?

how do i handle me going away to college when she still has 3 years of hs left?

what do i do???????? i want to live one day at a time but at the same time i want to have some forethought

should we keep seeing each other?

i really do care and want the best for this girl but i don't know how to do that if i can barely take care of myself. i'm a bit of a mess honestly but that's a different story.

if you managed to read all that bullshit, thank you, truly, i realize that a lot of it was probably unnecessary but i don't know how else to convey my feelings and the situation. stream of consciousness type shit"
6k038a,3,2017-06-28,"I [25F] was the other woman with [27M], struggling with my feelings over it",helpwhatdoid,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6k038a/i_25f_was_the_other_woman_with_27m_struggling/,"In summary: I had an internship at a hospital, and there was this doctor there I didn't think much of until we reconnected on Tinder. We started having phone sex for a couple months and then moved to a physical relationship. I was recovering from a broken heart so it was perfect for me. I know this is strange, but I had felt like I was never gonna be interested in sex with others again. So this situation helped me move on and I was finally feeling like myself again!


But. The whole time I felt like something was off. Mainly the fact that it took so long for us to meet in person (like 3 months). So I asked if he had been dating anyone while we were having phone sex. My gut feeling just knew, having previously been in the other girl's position. He admitted to it, but told me he broke up with her just before we met up. I was really upset, and felt gross about myself, but figured, they're broken up now so whatever.


He's been talking to this girl because she wanted to stay friends the whole time. Which is fine, he can do what he wants. But I told him if they have intentions of getting back together to please let me know as I'd rather not be involved. I couldn't knowingly do that to another girl. He kept assuring me that wasn't the case, but the constant texting her (sometimes with hearts), paired with him getting more ""attached"" to me (ie. having me stay at his place all weekend, every weekend, calling me to talk for hours, bringing me to his bday events, bringing me food when I'm stressed, likely because he's lonely) put a bad taste in my mouth and I said I didn't want to be involved with him while he was sorting his shit out. Right now we're spending some time apart but he'll send me a fucking meme every day. Maybe to ensure I don't forget him or to breadcrumb me, I dunno.



Now here is my problem. I am STRUGGLING hard with feelings of inadequacy. Last year, I was miserable because the guy I was dating did the same thing to me as this guy is doing to the girl he's dating (""oh we're exclusive"" but sending naked pictures back and forth to others). I was always telling myself I wasn't as good as the girls he was ""cheating"" with. But this year, I'm in the ""other girl"" position and feel like absolute shit. Morally, because I feel horrible for the girl, but also bad about myself because I dunno... I just feel like I'm never enough for these people.


Reddit, this is so dumb, but I feel like I should've been good enough to ""change"" him (my dad says ""only a strong woman will change cheaters and knock them off their feet""), and that this other girl is 10000% better than me and a literal goddess, when realistically I know that this guy will cheat on anyone! He's cheated on every girl he's ever been with!! And because of that, I couldn't even see myself dating this guy even though I've gotten super attached to our routine. But, I still keep comparing myself to this girl. So what on earth gives? I don't feel like these feelings are normal. What do I do? It's eating me inside. If it helps/probably is relevant, I have a dysmorphic disorder that I know I need to get therapy for, but I can't until early next year. Also, this thing with this guy has been going on for ~8 months (~2-3 months of just texting/phone, then 5 of meeting up). Probably way too long. 

Until then, how on earth do I deal with these weird feelings. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Started seeing a guy who cheated on his gf with me. I didn't know. They were long broken up by the time I found out but they still talk and for some stupid reason I feel sad about that. I know this isn't right. What gives?! "
6k08un,3,2017-06-28,Optimal path between two cities,winga889,csinterviewproblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/csinterviewproblems/comments/6k08un/optimal_path_between_two_cities/,"N cities and N-1 roads. There is a unique way to reach one city from another and takes a day to travel along on a road. 

Following properties are followed:

1. Each road connects exactly two cities
2. Each road is a one way road, i.e., traveling is possible from one of the city to only one other city
3. The city numbered 1 is considered as prime city to visit. The directions of road changes after every one day. For example, on day 1 the road is open only to go away from prime city. Then on day 2 the same road is open only to move towards the prime city. Again on day 3, the road is open only to go away from prime city and so on.

Given source and destination cities, estimate minimum number of days required to travel from source to destination.

Input:
N, S and D are integer numbers
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ S ≤ N
1 ≤ D ≤ N
ROADS is the integer array of even length where each element is from closed interval range [1…N]

Output:
For each input there will be one output representing minimum number of days required to travel from source to destination.

Example: 
N = 5
S = 4
D = 1
ROADS = [4,2,2,1,1,3,3,5]
Output: 4

My answer to the question:

	def findDays(n, s, d, roads):
		from collections import OrderedDict
		cities = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(roads))
		if len(cities) is not n:
			print('Error, number of roads are not ""n-1""')
			return 0
		s_ind = cities.index(s)
		d_ind = cities.index(d)
		p_ind = cities.index(1) # primary is always 1
		
		if s_ind &lt; p_ind:
			if d_ind &lt;= p_ind:
				if s_ind &lt; d_ind:
					return 2 * abs(d_ind - s_ind)
				else:
					return (2 * abs(d_ind - s_ind)) - 1
			else:
				return (2 * abs(d_ind - s_ind)) - 1
		elif s_ind &gt; p_ind:
			if d_ind &gt;= p_ind:
				if s_ind &gt; d_ind:
					return 2 * abs(d_ind - s_ind)
				else:
					return (2 * abs(d_ind - s_ind)) - 1
			else:
				return (2 * abs(d_ind - s_ind)) - 1
		else:
			return (2 * abs(d_ind - s_ind)) - 1


		
	# Test input

	n=6
	s=1
	d=5
	roads = [6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5]
	print(findDays(n,s,d,roads))

This question is been asked as a weekly programming challenge, where I am an intern. I understand that these could be a data structure like trees and tree traversal would make life easier. 

But isn't it abuse to unnecessarily use tree kind of data structure for such a simple task. I do not know if there were few test cases that my code violated, but to me this code seems to be working fine. What do you think?

We went on a few sushi dates, a hike, and a few times snowboarding in the couple months we were together, but mostly sleepovers, about 10 of them say. We've talked about summer and how we don't want it to ruin us and she expressed her worries for distance, but mainly because she was telling me she works at a camp for 6 weeks with not much service and time to be on the phone. So automatically, we knew we probably wouldn't be ""together"" over summer. She was telling me ""noooo dont over think, I reallllyyy like you"" about a week before she changed her mind. We were saying the summer could make it better and me saying it'll go by quick and we'll stay in touch and other things, we were optimistic and it was great.

Then two weeks before school, all went to shit. She said she thought a lot about it and said she doesn't see good coming from it and it won't work for her, I understand, its summer, we've only been talking for two months, although  ""basically"" dating, we weren't that close yet considering our busy schedules  and not texting a lot throughout the day you know? But it was okay, we had great sex, fun dates, and are pretty common. Shyish but active people. She also brought up at this time she lost ""little"" feelings for not getting personal and how I missed signs to ask her about her divorced parents and bad childhood, bullshit if you ask me, how can you expect that? Just tell me. It's like you expect me to tell you about my Father with Liver disease right now? Do I ever? No. We just weren't ""best friends"" yet, and that's okay right? Relationships, connections, and personal things take time. She said she felt like shes ""pushed"" out, although I did give her a few days then I asked her and we both opened up to each other(this personal talk was also before she ended things).

Anyway, I chased her....this was my mistake and I already know it. I came up with a plan to put it on hold and see if we work out or not and she was happy with it, assuring me she still had those feelings she had left. So I became desperate, the idea that she turned around on me so fast hurt so bad. And the worst confusing part being that she ""couldn't promise me anything or want us to have hope"" because of letdowns or whatever. I just wasn't okay with that, I kept bringing it up and trying to explain myself ""how great next year could be, its only 3 months, let's keep in communication, I'm sorry I should've made way more time for you but I won't have my lab intern next year,"" and a bunch of shit like that. All she would say is she just wants us to be content with the plan...which was to put it on hold and see next year. But you see my pain? How could I be content with just being a ""maybe"" when I really liked this girl, how could I be okay with just dropping all affection right now and ""putting it on hold."" I just couldn't have done that I see now, it needed to be a closure or there needed to be hope or I couldn't stay(wish I saw this before.) All I wanted was a little hope, because I didn't want to move on, but I now see that she couldn't give hope because she couldn't see it, and that just hurts, that's not ok. I deserve someone who knows they want to be with me, even if we are this early, it's only 3 months! If we both still liked each other, and once she did this I fell hard because ""you want what you can't have."" It drove me crazy, how could she not show affection over summer or show me hope only over 3 months, yet say she still has feelings for me and miss you when I say it. I understand she's going home to friends and family and I'm staying doing an internship and classes, so it's exciting for her you know? She doesn't want to attend to a relationship, but I take this as she not liking me enough to care. I totally get that, but it also sucks not being that guy that she wants really bad in her life, because she's the first girl I ever truly was ready and wanted to be part of my life. It just didn't make any sense. My pleading went on for about a month, and she knew how hurt I was, and still could only say ""I have hope I just don't want to show it because what if it just doesn't work out how we planned."" It confused me so much, and I was thinking about her nonstop during this time, I became depressed over her and it was horrible. I did truly learn a lot and know I shouldn't have been so pushy. But two weeks ago was the final time, we had a period of me ignoring her ""hey, how are you"" after talking to some friends and them saying leave her. So we didnt talk for like two weeks and I was so hurt during that time, I gave in and asked are we ok? And went on with my desperate self again, saying I just wanted hope and we could be so perfect together and shit. Basically, I overwhelmed her, I pressured her when I should've just trusted she would come back next year. Earlier on in my drama, I even cried on the phone a couple times because of how upset I was about it. She cared, but didn't care enough to compromise I guess. So yeah after my last drama, she finally said this all just pushed her away, and she doesn't feel that emotional connect anymore because she's at camp and is busy and I'm just not on her mind anymore, and that its been a slow process. I've already said sorry a lot for my drama and she knows I called myself pathetic and shit, and it was, and I probably lost so much attraction. She also said she feels like we lost the click since we've been gone for a month and a half and haven't really talked other than casually, or my fucking drama. She said she just doesn't see it working anymore. I ended it with the help of my sister with, ""I respect your decision and appreciate your honestly. Bye Sami, have a good summer."" Thank you, you too is what I got back.

Overall, how bad did I ruin it? I know I let my emotions over ride me, but this was my first almost real relationship with someone, and I just wasn't ready for her quick turn around. It threw me into an emotional depression, and this month has been horrible, never cried so many times in my life. I've been learning a lot about myself to, and maybe roots to low self esteem or confidence. I'm coming back stronger and more confident in myself already it feels like, I'm taking more actions than before. I'm back in the gym working hard, trying to quit weed and PMO(failing tbh), got a recommended self help book, and might see a counselor. Overall, I'm almost kinda happy this happened, because I know it's gonna be worth it and in the end it's okay anyway. I just want to get another perspective other than my sister at how bad I fucked it up. Like do I still have a chance next year you think? I'm not gonna text her anymore obviously, but it would really hurt if she doesn't reach out the rest of the summer. It would really hurt if she let my emotions and distance push her away, because that's just not fair. Maybe she will realize she messed up and will want something with me again next year, I truly believe this might happen and I know not to expect it but I just can't see how she turned on me so fast and just won't have attraction for me anymore? If I can show her a new me, 15 pounds up and more shredded, better fluency, better texting....Once were back and after two months of space and no contact, maybe she'll forget all the drama and my desperation and give me another chance? I really dont think its because of any guy over summer, she told me dont worry, and although she is in a sorority. She's kinda shy like I said, but really gorgeous, and the only frat boys she knows are kinda ""friend"" douchey types that I doubt she would get with. So I feel like when she comes back and doesn't have a man, she could come back. I know this is still my emotions speaking probably but man I really fucking want her back. I just want to hear some opinions about it. I told her I always understood it's mainly just been distance and she didn't want to start a early relationship into a long distance, I completely fucking understand that and told her so many times. But if she likes me why cant we show hope and affection throughout summer? Drove me fucking insane guys! Don't ever chase though, it's only gonna push her farther away, I'm scared she see's me as a weak desperate person now. I've always been the independent happy type, so this is not me, and I hope she knows that.

So what do you all think? I know it was long but advice would be GREATLY appreciated."

Some background- 20 years old in college (but on summer break) living in parents home. Two summers ago I had two jobs for about a month-2 months each before I quit due to severe anxiety. Last summer had an internship that didn't involve people- it went well. But now this summer I feel so pressured to work a job like everyone else is doing. 

I got a job as a bagger/cashier and worked for about 15 hours a week for 3 weeks before I couldn't handle the constant shaking and anxiety during my shifts. My last day I was on the verge of crying through every transaction I did. Went home and emailed my boss that I needed to take a leave from work and see a therapist. It's been 3 weeks since then.
Now I'm searching for a therapist (everyone I've approached isn't taking new clients) and I feel so useless. All my friends work 25-30 hour work weeks and some have anxiety and can still do it. I feel like there's something wrong with me because I can't. 
Living with my parents and not having to pay bills gave me a safety blanket and made me more comfortable leaving work but I feel guilty now and like I should  ""tough it out"" and force myself to work like so many people do.

6k2czu,16,2017-06-28,"An ode to the most important album in my life: ""Through Being Cool""",mexicomarmaduke,poppunkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/6k2czu/an_ode_to_the_most_important_album_in_my_life/,"&gt;Original link to my review, nearly a year ago, here:

&gt; http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/71135/Saves-the-Day-Through-Being-Cool/

&gt; Thought you guys might like to read it, too.

There was a time in my life when I thought this was the greatest album on the face of the Earth. There was a time when each iteration of my “top ten albums” list that I’d scribble in my notebook would vary ever-so-slightly in every single spot except for #1, which was inherently reserved for *Through Being Cool*. There was a time when I swear to God I could have written the words to this album myself and was hopelessly awestruck at how heartbreaking Chris Conley could get those relatively simple words to sound. Needless to say, I’m not 14 anymore; I’m so far removed from the young adolescent that stepped into that now-defunct Sam Goody record shop with his mother back in the winter of 2000. My exposure to Saves the Day preceded the internet – at least in my household – which means, no RateYourMusic, no Sputnik, no Pitchfork, no MetaCritic. I was too young to accurately seek out professional opinions elsewhere and probably too naïve to care, even if I did know where to look. At that particular point in my life, purchasing a CD that received no amount of radio play or critical recognition was as much of a gamble as buying a lottery ticket.

I’m still not sure what it was about the cover that caught my eye that day; the quintet perched upon a dorm room couch with so much nervous anxiety that it could be detected through a still photograph. Maybe it was the way I wished I could “pull off” argyle socks like Chris. Maybe it was the way I immediately connected with Bryan’s overwhelming look of social displacement. Maybe it was because I was a teenager who dreamt of one day having a girl stare at me the same way that redhead behind the couch was staring at Dave. I remember tearing off the shrink wrap in the car before I even arrived home. My mom’s Crown Victoria didn’t have a CD player, so it’s not like I could have even listened to *Through Being Cool* on the ride home. When I was younger, I had this obsession with CD jewel cases and booklets. The artwork, the lyrics printed all along the inside, the sometimes sentimental liner-notes and “thank yous” doled out by various band members. As I rummaged though the lyrics in the passenger seat of that Crown Vic underneath the fluorescent street lights of Dix-Toledo Rd, I distinctly recall the first time I read the words to *‘You Vandal’* – *“Yeah, my ribs have parted ways and said we’re not going to protect this heart you have.”* I was already in love with my purchase and I hadn’t even heard a single second of the record yet.

As a teenager experiencing a myriad of brand new things – high school, puberty, girls, what I presumed were “real” feelings – *Through Being Cool* was more than just an album. It was a bible. It was a collection of twelve confessional postcards, one of which could be used to accurately describe the way I was feeling at any given moment throughout the better part of the decade that would follow its purchase. It didn’t feel like Saves the Day wrote these songs for just anybody. They wrote these songs for me and only me. That was the only possible explanation, because every single word that jettisoned from the back of Chris Conley’s goddamn throat took the wind out of me like a swift punch to the stomach. It was just incredible to me. How could he possibly know? How in the hell was it so easy for Chris to not only capture every possible emotion that I’d ever felt in my life up to that point, but then portray it in such a way that I couldn’t even begin to conjure up myself? *“Even now that you’re not here, I climb these mountains of houses every night / Say your name, and wish I could have done things right.”* I couldn’t listen to that line in *‘All-Star Me’* and not be immediately taken back to Melvindale Park, where my first junior-high girlfriend, Amber, told me that she liked another kid named Mike because he was more manly than me. Does that mean anything to me now? Of course not. But in that moment, it meant everything. It meant everything be able to listen to *‘Holly Hox, Forget Me Nots’* on max volume and shout along with Chris at the top of my lungs, *“I’m diving in this river / Fishing out my heart / Never gonna let you get your hands on this again.”* as if those words were crafted specifically for this moment.

*Through Being Cool* was there to remind me that no matter how often and how deeply it appeared so, I wasn’t alone. I may have been “alone” in regards to physical proximity to another human being, or current relationship status, but those feelings - those feelings that broke my concentration each time my English teacher would read ‘Macbeth’ aloud to the class, those feelings that paced through my head as I ran laps around the school during football practice, those feelings that sank deep inside my gut each and every night as I’d force myself to get some sleep, wondering if I’d be alone forever – those feelings were no longer exclusively mine. And it felt nice to be able to experience grief in a communal medium, rather than one of complete solitude. From the ages of 14 to at least 19, maybe even a few years thereafter, *Through Being Cool* was staple gunned into my cerebrum. I would fall asleep at night, dreaming (wishing, maybe) that I was Chris Conley, on stage and playing these songs for an auditorium of jealous classmates. I wrote these lyrics and these songs were mine. It was the first album I learned to play from start-to-finish on the drums; I enjoyed every second, from the profuse sweating I’d encounter during the jarringly quick second verse of *‘You Vandal’* to the slick intro of *‘Do You Know What I Loved the Most?’* that I’d almost always miss by about a half-second. Chris’s words made their way across every social media medium I could possibly plaster them up upon – AOL Instant Messenger away messages, MySpace about me’s, Facebook status updates – you name it. Chris Conley from Princeton, NJ was the only person in the world who knew what I was going through. He had an answer for everything, and he always knew just what to say to constantly reassure me of two things: (1) he’s been there before, and (2) everything’s gonna be just fine.

Though I had advertised the album and my affinity towards it to close friends over the years, most of them hated it, some of them liked it alright, but it never really hit anyone else the same with it hit me. I was always perfectly fine with this, however, as it seemed to strengthen that proverbial “bond” that I artificially created between Chris and myself inside my head. It was further proof that he wrote this record vivaciously through my own experiences - he just had a much tidier and more digestible way of regurgitating them aloud. Saves the Day had effectively captivated a random teenage boy living in the suburbs of metro-Detroit unlike any other band had ever been able to do before. I’m not so sure the band would view that as any type of worthy accolade or special accomplishment, but when you’re so young and know so little about the world around you, it seems monumental. It was astronomical, the way *Through Being Cool* could pull emotions and evoke feelings from me so whimsically and without struggle. It didn’t even have to try anymore; no matter where I was or what kind of mental state I was in, a few seconds into the explosive drum and guitar introduction of *‘Banned From the Back Porch’* and I was a mess. I was suddenly falling back in love with a girl I had dumped years ago; I vividly remembered how I threw her down into a pile of leaves walking her home from Davidson one autumn and she chased me for three blocks until I stopped and kissed her on the corner of Poplar and Leroy, both of us out of breath and lips cracked like withered, dried-out newspaper pages. Never does dismemberment seem so elegant or beam with such potential as it does each time I hear, *“Let me take this awkward saw / Run it against your thighs / Cut some flesh away / I’ll carry this piece of you with me.”*

It wasn’t just the lyrical content, either – *Through Being Cool* was musically just as amazing. Saves the Day was to pop-punk what Thomas Edison was to the light bulb. They didn’t invent anything brand new, they didn’t make any groundbreaking discoveries, and they weren’t exactly pioneers of some mysterious, uncharted territory. They just took something that already existed and then perfected it, essentially re-establishing a more formidable baseline for many years to come. They simply cherry-picked the absolute best qualities from other bands of the genre – including their former selves – and articulated that conjunction in the most masterful way. They rolled up Jawbreaker, The Get Up Kids, American Football, and Lifetime into this beautiful smorgasbord of tracks that shone so elegantly like a diamond in the rough. The way guitar licks like the chugging intros of *‘Third Engine’* and *‘You Vandal’* could sound so aggressive and angry, yet so melodic and remorseful while retaining this incredibly nervous sense of energy throughout was astonishing. Fourteen year-old me certainly hadn’t heard anything like it, and even 27 year-old me would be hard-pressed to come up with an adequate parallel. The old saying, “they don’t make ‘em like they used to” is pretty fitting in this case, because, let’s be honest, they really don’t make music like this anymore, whoever “they” are.

It isn’t difficult to find emotional music. And it’s not difficult to find emotional music relating to: being in love with, falling in love with, falling out of love with, chasing after, dreaming about, thinking about, wishing for, wanting, hoping for, breaking up with, and/or getting over a girl. What IS hard to find, though, is music that does those things in such a poignant and outwardly manner without coming off as a try-hard, cringe-worthy façade. Therein lies the true essence of *Through Being Cool*, and ultimately, all of Chris’s songwriting abilities during the first-half of Saves the Day’s existence. His quips felt honest and heartfelt instead of forced, awkward, or rehearsed. They didn’t just come from the heart, the gut, or the brain – they came from some inwardly-focused place that you couldn’t really pinpoint yet you knew exactly where it was. His lines were simple and clean, but somehow so effective, and painted with such concise, yet intricate colors. *“You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide.”* Listening to that line over and over, at first you realize that you don’t really know exactly what he means, until all of a sudden, you know EXACTLY what he means. *“Did you know, my sweet, that I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?”* I never even knew that I wanted to just sit up and stare at a woman lying in bed, sleeping, admiring such a natural and accidental gracefulness, as much as I did the first time those words ran through my headphones. Chris was as much a storyteller as he was a musical artist. *“I’ll sit in the lazy chair all day / Remembering the things you do / So when you come home, I jump up to kiss you / And it will knock you back / You’ll fall over our TV set / Pick you up to dust you off / Baby, let’s give it a go.”*

I played Grand Theft Auto III on my old Xbox a few weeks ago. I loved that game as a kid – I stayed up all night and day playing it until my fingers went numb. This time around, the loading times seemed to drag on forever, the controls were incredibly janky and felt arbitrary, the graphics weren’t nearly as cutting-edge as I remember, and the missions were actually quite repetitive. I only made it through about 7 or 8 of them before I decided I’d had enough. This past Halloween, my fiancée and I watched the original Friday the 13th – another thing that I grew up watching as a kid (behind my parents’ backs, of course) that terrified the living daylights out of me and gave me a thrill like no other. But once again, I was disheartened to find that my love for this old flick had simply run dry. It wasn’t scary anymore – in fact, it was nearly laughable. I couldn’t make it through more than thirty minutes before I turned it off, ultimately disappointed that my nostalgia glasses blinded me for the second time in recent memory. Last week, while driving a few hours to Chicago and listening to my iPhone’s music on shuffle, *‘My Sweet Fracture’* made its way through my speakers. As Chris sang, *“Don’t you love those leaves? Don’t you wish the orange stayed forever and crickets sang in the night all through winter?”* I glanced out my driver’s side window at the half-dead grass in the highway median, then turned my head towards the passenger’s side and took in the miles of leafless trees, draped in chunky, Midwestern snow. I briefly thought about my first homecoming dance and how I was one of the only sophomores there because I was dating a junior. I wondered what she was doing with her life and hoped things turned out okay for her. I thought about some of the friends I spent my 9th grade Halloween skateboarding with and felt a segmented sadness that I no longer speak to any of them.

Then I thought about the time I took a few semesters off of school and moved to Kentucky for a year-long internship. I thought about how alone I felt at the time. I thought about the first time my parents came to visit me there, and took me to a comedy club that night. I thought about how we were seated across from an absolutely stunning Kentucky-native girl who appeared to be around my age and I thought about how my dad drunkenly struck up a conversation with her mother solely in an effort to bridge the seemingly furlong-wide gap between this gorgeous southern girl and his socially inept son. I thought about how we dated for a few years, broke up, saw other people, and eventually found our way back to each other. Then I thought about how that girl now is now my fiancée, living with me in Michigan, and I wondered what my dad would say if he were still here, knowing that he’s the catalyst that kick-started such an elegantly disheveled dynamic between two soul mates. I thought about how much I'll miss him at our wedding and how he'll never get to meet his grandchildren, but I smiled a bit because I knew that without him, none of that stuff would have been possible. That was the difference between things like Grand Theft Auto and *Through Being Cool* for me.

My point is, the simple fact that you once loved something when you were younger doesn’t automatically grant it access to be deemed “nostalgic” years down the road, and just because something is old doesn’t mean you’ll get the same rush of feelings you did when it was new and fresh in your mind. It has to truly and honestly mean something to you. **It has to have really been a part of who you were to still be a part of who you are.** As I’m closing in on 30, *Through Being Cool* doesn’t mean the same thing to me as it did when I was 14, but it still means **something**. It was there for me when nothing else was. It understood me in ways that nothing else did. It spoke to me in tongues that nobody else could comprehend. It stuck with me the same way Paige did even while we were apart. Holding her in my arms for the first time after those two long years of being separated and trying my hardest to forget her, I had a completely new and almost otherworldly appreciation for her that I didn’t have before. Things were different, but not in a bad way. We were stronger, we were more ductile, mature, and understanding. The same way I can listen to *Through Being Cool* over fifteen years later and still have those intangible moments. The moments are different – they’re more complicated, more involved, more wholesome – but most importantly, they’re there. They exist. And no matter how old I get, those opening three chords of *‘All-Star Me’* will never fail to make me feel *something* that nothing else will."

Hello, everyone. I'm studying translation and interpretation in Arabic in college and this is my first time in an Arabic speaking country (it's just been two days). 

Since I already speak fusha - not perfectly, but I can do more than getting by - I don't want to go to courses teaching fusha. Though, I've had moments where I couldn't exactly understand what locals were saying. Like that guy asking me directions (possibly, lol) who, I felt, spoke too fast. I desperately need to work on that. 


My current plans are to 

* Attend some summer classes in the University of Jordan. (I've been told that I can, and courses will start in approximately two weeks.) 
* Find an agency where I can work as an intern next month. 

I know a few people here who I believe can help me, however, I'm not getting together with them until next week. 

So, I'm open to any suggestions you may have. Be it a YouTube channel that's about the dialect, for which I couldn't find proper sources, or anything you got. I can even meet you if you're in town - I'm very close to the university.

Am I a decent candidate?,ShlomoKenyatta,urbanplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/6k2n6j/feeling_somewhat_discouraged_over_job_prospects/,"I've been talking to friends who graduated last year, and almost all of them had trouble finding a good job fresh out of school. I'm worried it'll be the same for me in a year when I finish my undergrad. 

As far as my experience goes, I feel like I'm a pretty good candidate for an Assistant Planner position somewhere. Some of my credentials:

-3.6 GPA
-6 months working in park management for a city Parks and Rec Dept 
-4 month internship at extremely fast-growing city (updated Moderate Income Housing Element of General Plan)
-9 months experience as GIS Technician for natural gas company
-Co-authored Economic Development Plan for the Main Street district of a small town
-Project leader on apartment inventory project for a large suburban city 

So even though I still don't have a degree, I feel like I've been able to do a lot of work pertinent to urban planning. Am I a competitive candidate for positions like Assistant Planner? What should I do to be better prepared?

Thanks in advance for the help!"

I'm an Indian student finishing up my bachelors and Masters (Integrated course) next year in August and thinking about applying for PhD in Computer Science at EPFL. I am going to be working on my masters thesis starting this August at a very reputed research institute in Germany with a very senior researcher. I also have one publication from my summer internship with another top research institute in France and looking forward to get 2-3 more during 1 year of thesis. My only worry is my GPA, I'll graduate with somewhere around 2.8. Professors/members of the admission committee/Current PhD students do you think my research experience (3 months summer + 1 year of thesis), open source contributions and very good recommendation letters from reputed researchers will compensate for my low grades?
Also how does the admission process works at EPFL, can a professor individually accept a student if he wants to work with him/her?

Thanks in advance!

Here's the rundown in order from the mundane to the get-me-outta-here:

-often heard footsteps and doors

-my clothes would ALWAYS be sitting on top of the dryer, dried, when doing laundry

-one night saw a silhouette right outside my bedroom window; drove to other interns' house and when we came back there were no tire tracks or foot prints even though the dew had fallen

-one day came home and all the furniture in a spare bedroom was pulled off the wall and pushed together in the center of the room

-woke up one morning, went to kitchen, and every door was wide open. Cabinets, oven, freezer, fridge...if it had a door, it was open. I drove to work like a banshee and demanded they put a male intern in the house with me or I'd quit immediately. 

I was living alone because I was the only female intern. The weirdness didn't stop but at least after they moved a guy in with me I wasn't suffering alone. 

Do you believe in ghosts? Ever experienced any?"

6k51vb,1,2017-06-28,"I've been feeling down lately. (height, looks, social life)",cunseytupo,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6k51vb/ive_been_feeling_down_lately_height_looks_social/,"Hello everybody,

I wouldn't consider myself as a short person. I'm average I guess. (16 Yo, M, 5'8 / 173ish cm) But it does drag me down every now and then when I see 6'0+ people. My growth plates have closed and I have no clue how to deal with that. I mean I shouldn't be complaining. I'm happy to be average height and healthy but still I would love to be a few inches taller. 5'11 would've been amazing. I guess that goes for every height though. 

I don't really have much confidence and I was quite chubby in my school days and I've been telling myself I'm ugly over these years. (That changed though, I'm working out 3 times a week now and I'm starting to at least like my body. Face wise I'm probably average)
And getting jealous over classmates getting girlfriends and hugging girls and whatnot probably didn't help me. Looking back it was pointless to get hurt over that I think. 

Throughout the last years of school I was diagnosed with depression so that time was a pain (grades went to shit too) and after finishing school I haven't been doing much with my life. (Though I'm proud to be working on myself and I'm even trying to find internships and so on)

I did have friends but I was mostly sitting in front of my computer so I kinda lack of social skills. I rarely went outside or to parties or participated in any social activity. 
Lately I've been feeling very lonely. Pretty much the only person in my life I can talk to is my loyal doggo and my dad but I've nearly lost him a couple of times already and at home my parents are fighting often. 

I catch myself daydreaming about having a girlfriend, doing couple things, cuddling
I daydream often in general. Even built my own fictional self. (I hope I'm not sounding weird) I listen to music many times while thinking about a scenario in my head with my fictional self. Scenarios like saving lives, fighting along with people in a battle. I imagine myself being part of a world from an anime too and having friends that care about me and stuff. I don't want to get too deep into this and it might seem cringy, but I've spent a big part of my life with tweaking my fictional self and world. Like, it's really confusing.

I wish I could just go out of the house and meet people, make new friends. I text with the ones left from school sometimes. Though my ""best"" friend hasn't replied in a long time. 

And again, I am really a noob at talking to people. Especially to girls. 
Being insecure about my looks and height is so annoying. In my damn head I think girls would turn me down and not give me a chance because of my looks or height if I'd try to talk to them. It's just stupid, really. 

Maybe I'm in a depressed phase at the moment, I don't know. I just really struggle with that shit, you know. I feel like no one really is there for me in my life if I need them. Except my dog I guess. But he doesn't talk much.

The thing is that I think I'm a good person. I am depressed frequently, I'm highly sensitive and I might be a tiny little bit weeeeird but I always tried to offer a helping hand to my friends. I'm a good listener and I can empathise others. Animals seem to like me too which is nice. I lack of education, yes, but I wouldn't consider myself as stupid either. 

I quit the ramble now though. I could write for ages probably because sometimes it just starts to flow, you know? 

And to anyone who has read through this wall of text, thank you. 
I hope it's not too big a mess and also I apologise for any grammatical / spelling errors. I'm not a native english speaker. :)

Thanks again and have a good one.

6k5oc0,2,2017-06-28,Denied Student Loan Refinance through SoFi,arbartz,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/6k5oc0/denied_student_loan_refinance_through_sofi/,"Alright, so I just graduated from a reputable university one month ago today, with a degree in Electrical Engineering.  I've been working as an Electrical Engineer making $68k since a week after graduation (but in reality I've been an Electrical Engineer intern at this company for over a year).  I have about $82k in student loans all together.  Two private loans (~$9k and ~$25k), both cosigned by my parents, and a slew of Stafford Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans making up the remainder.  

My top priority is to get my parents off both of the private loans as I have two younger brothers that will be needing to get loans to go to college.  If my parents are still cosigned on my loans, that hurts their credit, and thus makes it more difficult to help my brothers out.  I've been paying the interest on both of the private loans since I got them, so I have a 100% on-time payment history with both loan companies.  The $9k loan company said they can take that payment history and remove my parents from the loan once I show them two paychecks.  Awesome.  Except the $25k loan company said they won't do that, and will need 4 years of on time payments before they remove my parents.  That won't fly.

So I went to SoFi with the goal of refinancing all of my loans into a single payment with no ones names attached except mine.  They declined it due to ""Length of Employment"" and ""Excessive obligations relative to income"".  I called them to see if I could get more details, but they really were not able to tell me too much.  Basically it boiled down to how they want to see at least 2 years of work experience in my career field and they want to see less debt to income on my credit report.  

For work experience I explained that I have worked an internship at multiple companies throughout my college career.  I was told that I should include that as experience and resubmit my request.  So I've done that and am waiting to hear back, but I still don't know what I can do about the debt to income ratio.  I can't really do anything about that.  It's not like I'm hurting for cash either, I plan on paying $1000/month to my student loans at a minimum.  Even with that, and all other living expenses (plus saving for retirement) I still have about $1300 left over every month.  So I'm not sure why they are concerned about the debt to income.

Anyways, sorry about the long post, but I just want to know if any of you can shed some light on why these factors seem to be such a big deal, even though I am more than capable of paying the loan back.

Thanks!"
6k5ppc,168,2017-06-28,Vegas this weekend with my [40M] boss' daughter [22f],Jameson77,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/6k5ppc/vegas_this_weekend_with_my_40m_boss_daughter_22f/,"My firm is sending three employees to a seminar this weekend in Las Vegas. Me and two other employees, a male and a female, leave tomorrow afternoon. However, since he owns the company, my boss is using the trip as part of a family vacation as well. He and his wife fly to Vegas Sunday, and they will be there through 4th of July and fly home the afternoon of the 5th. Fine.

The boss, however, has a daughter - Shelby, who was also going. She is 22, has one year of college left, and she works as a courier in our office part time, then has an internship at a local TV station as well, where she hopes to get a job as a local reporter next summer. Shelby is a nice mix of girlish and womanly, sweet and dangerous, innocent and...not, or so it seems to me. She has a cute, little build, with maybe 32b breasts and a nice ass and legs. I know she runs, but I suspect she works out too. She has a bit of a Ronda Rousey build and vibe going on, but with brown hair. We had flirted before, but it was more silliness than anything, and she would typically talk to me like she might talk to an older brother - casual and comfortable, but not really suggesting anything. Anyway, today I went into the copy room and she was there, wearing a sort of tan, tartan skirt and a white blouse, her hair in a ponytail....so business dressed, but looking fun...and cute.

""Ready for Vegas?"" I asked. 

""Yeah we are,"" she said. ""How about you?"" I told her I was and asked if she'd ever been. She said she hadn't, and neither had her friend, Madison, who was going with her. ""Have you been?"" She asked. I told her I'd been about ten times. ""Big baller!"" She said, teasing me. ""I hope you don't mind us tagging along,"" she said. The girls are flying out on our flight, staying the full length of the trip, and of course, her father was paying for it. He and his wife are then flying out Sunday morning. Being that just hanging around hot girls is currency with other hot girls, I certainly did not mind. ""You'll have to show us around,"" she said. 

""Deal"" I said, still checking her out while she continued to work at whatever she was doing for her dad. About that time he came around the corner. 

""You ready to leave tomorrow?"" He asked me. I again said I was. ""How about you?"" He asked his daughter.

""Yeah,"" she nodded. 

""Are you all riding together?"" He asked. I didn't know that was an option and probably just looked at him like I was dumb. 

""Madison and I are taking an Uber,"" Shelby said. ""But James is getting us a limo from the airport to the hotel."" My boss laughed a bit at that. 

""Good,"" he said. ""Keep those two out of jail and if they cost you any money, make them work it off."" I think it was an innocuous comment, and he said it as he grabbed some things off the copier and walked out. But I saw her grin and raise her eyebrows at me.

""That sounds fun,"" she then said, still with a smirk.

""You're trouble,"" I said, taking what I had come for and leaving to my own office. 

""Uh huh,"" she said, smiling as I left. I thought little more of it. A few hours later, Shelby came in my office to drop off some transcripts she had picked up across the city. She dropped them on my desk, then sat on the couch in my office and began looking through a magazine. 

""You want to meet us at the airport bar before we leave tomorrow?"" She asked. I told her that sounded good. ""What are we going to do tomorrow night?"" She asked. I sort of shrugged.

""I don't know. What do you want to do?"" I said. She put the magazine down and smirked again. 

""Something I have to work off,"" she replied, winking at me as she broke into a grin. She stood up and continued to smile at me as she walked out of my office. I won't lie....I was instantly hard when she said that. I did not see her the rest of the day, but I did get online and book a limo from the airport to the hotel, figuring I would surprise everyone when we landed, and show off a bit, since she had mentioned that earlier. I finished the day and went home. While packing this evening I got a text from Shelby - she has all of our numbers in case she has to find us or get us a message, etc.

""We'll be at the airport bar around noon,"" it said. 

""I'll see you there,"" I said, still wary of jumping full steam ahead at my boss' daughter. My phone warbled again.

""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?"" Her next text read. I didn't know immediately how to respond. ""Yes"" seemed too forward. ""No"" seemed like I was rejecting her. 

""Why?"" I replied. ""What is going to happen in Vegas?"" She just sent back a winking smiley, with nothing more. ""See you tomorrow,"" I texted.

I won't lie. I'm interested in the possibilities here and at the same time excited that it could be super dangerous, at least to my job. At the same time, I'll be there three days without my boss present and the girls clearly want to hang out some, so I'm down. Sorry if this wasn't slutty enough yet, but I've never gone to Vegas and not hooked up with someone there, or a date I was with, so I'm sure there will be some follow up of some sort. Bear with me.

To be continued....

If I happened to have missed anything, be sure to let me know.

&amp;nbsp;

On that note, I’ve recently stumbled upon two resources that have already proven useful in helping catch a few overlooked items, and therefore helping to make this project as comprehensive as it deserves to be:

&amp;nbsp;

* [http://www.seinology.com/lists.shtml](http://www.seinology.com/lists.shtml) – some awesome lists contained here. Though perhaps not as comprehensive as one may wish for, as I’ve already noted a few omissions, for example: the reference to “Rosemary’s Baby” (from “The Baby Shower”) is missing, as is the mention of Kramer’s father (from “The Apartment”, the next episode in this project). Nevertheless, I’m sure those lists will be a valuable reference point to compare this project against as we move forward.

&amp;nbsp;

* [http://seincast.libsyn.com/](http://seincast.libsyn.com/) – a podcast series of two guys (Matt and Vinny) discussing all 180 episodes; each episode is its own podcast. I’ve checked out a few episodes so far and it’s pretty good; two dudes with an impressive knowledge of the show, dissecting each episode. My only gripe is that each show starts off with a “Seinfeld news” segment, which I personally don’t really care about so I tend to skip past it. As well, some of the podcasts run 80+ minutes, which, depending on your threshold (and considering most Seinfeld episodes are only 22-23 minutes long) might be a tad lengthy. The podcast started in July 2014 and the guys are currently in Season 8; “The Fatigues” is the most recent episode they’ve produced. So by my count, they have 39 episodes left to go. If you’re here reading this and you haven’t already tuned in to this podcast series, you might want to check it out.

&amp;nbsp;

Overlooked from previous episodes; (lists have been re-sequenced):

* Chinese food (from “The Stakeout”)

* Lo mein (from “The Stakeout”)

* Cocoon: The Return (from “The Stakeout”)

* Plan 9 From Outer Space (from “The Chinese Restaurant”)

* Hair (musical) (from “The Baby Shower”)

* Maria Shriver (from “The Baby Shower”)  

* Kennedy’s Inaugural address (from “The Baby Shower”)

* Ich bin ein Berliner (from “The Baby Shower”)


&amp;nbsp;

Dang, that Baby Shower episode; so many missed references!

## [“The Phone Message”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phone_Message)
Production code: **207**

Episode no.: **S02E04**

&amp;nbsp;

This episode has the distinction of being the hastily written and produced replacement for [“The Bet”]( http://seinfeld.wikia.com/wiki/The_Bet), an episode that was written, cast and read-through before ultimately being shelved. Deemed to be too provocative, “The Bet” never made it to air and so “The Phone Message” was thrown together by Larry David based on an SNL sketch he wrote (which was also not aired).

6k5t6s,95,2017-06-28,[MF] Vegas this weekend with my [40M] boss' daughter [22F],Jameson77,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6k5t6s/mf_vegas_this_weekend_with_my_40m_boss_daughter/,"Let's try this again, since it looks like it got removed. I'm not sure where to best post, since nothing has happened just yet....but here goes.

My firm is sending three employees to a seminar this weekend in Las Vegas. Me and two other employees, a male and a female, leave tomorrow afternoon. However, since he owns the company, my boss is using the trip as part of a family vacation as well. He and his wife fly to Vegas Sunday, and they will be there through 4th of July and fly home the afternoon of the 5th. Fine.

The boss, however, has a daughter - Shelby, who was also going. She is 22, has one year of college left, and she works as a courier in our office part time, then has an internship at a local TV station as well, where she hopes to get a job as a local reporter next summer. Shelby is a nice mix of girlish and womanly, sweet and dangerous, innocent and...not, or so it seems to me. She has a cute, little build, with maybe 32b breasts and a nice ass and legs. I know she runs, but I suspect she works out too. She has a bit of a Ronda Rousey build and vibe going on, but with brown hair. We had flirted before, but it was more silliness than anything, and she would typically talk to me like she might talk to an older brother - casual and comfortable, but not really suggesting anything. Anyway, today I went into the copy room and she was there, wearing a sort of tan, tartan skirt and a white blouse, her hair in a ponytail....so business dressed, but looking fun...and cute.

""Ready for Vegas?"" I asked. 

""Yeah we are,"" she said. ""How about you?"" I told her I was and asked if she'd ever been. She said she hadn't, and neither had her friend, Madison, who was going with her. ""Have you been?"" She asked. I told her I'd been about ten times. ""Big baller!"" She said, teasing me. ""I hope you don't mind us tagging along,"" she said. The girls are flying out on our flight, staying the full length of the trip, and of course, her father was paying for it. He and his wife are then flying out Sunday morning. Being that just hanging around hot girls is currency with other hot girls, I certainly did not mind. ""You'll have to show us around,"" she said. 

""Deal"" I said, still checking her out while she continued to work at whatever she was doing for her dad. About that time he came around the corner. 

""You ready to leave tomorrow?"" He asked me. I again said I was. ""How about you?"" He asked his daughter.

""Yeah,"" she nodded. 

""Are you all riding together?"" He asked. I didn't know that was an option and probably just looked at him like I was dumb. 

""Madison and I are taking an Uber,"" Shelby said. ""But James is getting us a limo from the airport to the hotel."" My boss laughed a bit at that. 

""Good,"" he said. ""Keep those two out of jail and if they cost you any money, make them work it off."" I think it was an innocuous comment, and he said it as he grabbed some things off the copier and walked out. But I saw her grin and raise her eyebrows at me.

""That sounds fun,"" she then said, still with a smirk.

""You're trouble,"" I said, taking what I had come for and leaving to my own office. 

""Uh huh,"" she said, smiling as I left. I thought little more of it. A few hours later, Shelby came in my office to drop off some transcripts she had picked up across the city. She dropped them on my desk, then sat on the couch in my office and began looking through a magazine. 

""You want to meet us at the airport bar before we leave tomorrow?"" She asked. I told her that sounded good. ""What are we going to do tomorrow night?"" She asked. I sort of shrugged.

""I don't know. What do you want to do?"" I said. She put the magazine down and smirked again. 

""Something I have to work off,"" she replied, winking at me as she broke into a grin. She stood up and continued to smile at me as she walked out of my office. I won't lie....I was instantly hard when she said that. I did not see her the rest of the day, but I did get online and book a limo from the airport to the hotel, figuring I would surprise everyone when we landed, and show off a bit, since she had mentioned that earlier. I finished the day and went home. While packing this evening I got a text from Shelby - she has all of our numbers in case she has to find us or get us a message, etc.

""We'll be at the airport bar around noon,"" it said. 

""I'll see you there,"" I said, still wary of jumping full steam ahead at my boss' daughter. My phone warbled again.

""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?"" Her next text read. I didn't know immediately how to respond. ""Yes"" seemed too forward. ""No"" seemed like I was rejecting her. 

""Why?"" I replied. ""What is going to happen in Vegas?"" She just sent back a winking smiley, with nothing more. ""See you tomorrow,"" I texted.

I won't lie. I'm interested in the possibilities here and at the same time excited that it could be super dangerous, at least to my job. At the same time, I'll be there three days without my boss present and the girls clearly want to hang out some, so I'm down. Sorry if this wasn't slutty enough yet, but I've never gone to Vegas and not hooked up with someone there, or a date I was with, so I'm sure there will be some follow up of some sort. Bear with me.

To be continued....

6k62dp,0,2017-06-29,Building a Hackintosh Laptop,LeRealPlatinum,hackintosh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/6k62dp/building_a_hackintosh_laptop/,"Hey guys, so I am working an internship at a store that essentially takes in old office computer donations and stuff like that and then rebrands them and fixes them up and resells them to schools and offices. As a present for interning, they are letting us take laptop form their ""graveyard"" pile and fix it up and then keep it. I was wondering if I might be able to find a Hackintoshable laptop in there. Most of them are going to be i5 or i3's. I'm still new to hackintoshing to idk what CPU's or mobo's that would be in office laptops would be able to hackintosh. For a reference, we have a pile of 1000+ Dell Optiplex 990's. So we get laptops that have been in offices and schools and such. Are there any suggestions on specific laptops I should look out for? Keep in mind we ONLY get to fix up a laptop. And I can pretty much swap all the parts, but it has to be done all in 1 day so I'd prefer to not start swapping mobo's. I was just wondering if anyone had any idea on laptop models that are popular in business that are able to be used as hackintoshes? Thanks guys ❤️️


Edit: So I got a Latitude E6420 with a core i5 and 16gb of DDR3 ram. I'm loading windows up on it right now and will let you know more specs in a bit."

It had been 2 weeks since 'The Tapper' had escaped Paulson in the subway. We had scoured each and every security tape we could get our hands on from the surrounding area, but we lost the bastard somewhere around 38th street. Too many places to hide in this hellhole of a city. Since then he went quiet. There didn't seem to be any new cases of his popping up. We made some headwa...some progress with the ID at least. Between the description from Paulson and the tapes we caught him on, we pegged him as a white or latino  man of 6ft - 6ft2 with short dark brown hair around his early to mid 20s. Heh. That only described half of New York City, but sure.

We had the morgue examine the bodies and all they could confirm was that it wasn't natural. Yeah, no shit. We got in a couple of those psych supers. Those that could detect things that us normies couldn't. They said that they felt it was like two giant hands grabbed the sides of the people's heads and tried to force them in both directions at the same time. Fuck knows what that means. Didn't tell us how to stop it, that's for sure. So we had a heap of bodies, a criminal on the loose, an ID that described most of the Bronx, and a power we had no idea how to stop. My day was going swell...

Someone knocked on my door and opened it. ""Um...Captain Washington? Sorry to bother you,"" it was Hernandez, the intern. I put down the papers I was looking at. They were much help anyway.

""Yeah, rookie. What do you want?"" I said as I rubbed my face. When was the last time I slept? Had to be recently... I took the coffee she brought in.

""I just wanted to...sir...I just wanted to tell you that Davids said that he found something.""

I sprang up, ""Shit, girl. Why didn't you say so?!"" I took a couple of steps toward the door, then remembered my coffee. Picking it up I went to find Sergeant Davids.

I found him at his desk, surrounded by some of the other officers, ""...everywhere...you wouldn't believe - Captain!""

I nodded, ""Davids. What have you got for me? Tell me we're closer to finding this sick fuck.""

""Oh yeah we are,"" he wiped his mouth, looking like he was gonna be sick, ""I found the piece of shit's lair.""

CSI was mobbed around the entrance to the abandoned building on Beekman street. Some were looking like they'd had a run in with the Scaremonger. Some were looking like it was their birthday. I'll never understand that one. When I asked once, they told me it's all about working through the puzzle, and every clue was like a new present to be opened. All I wanted was the dirt off my streets.

I walked up to the door and one of the CSI, a young photographer, stopped me, ""Captain. I'm not sure you want to go in there. I'm not sure anyone should. It's...""

""Step aside, boy. I've been on the force for 25 years, I've seen it all. I think I can handle more people with split heads."" I pushed him away from the door and opened it. The smell hit me like a freight train. A mixture of rotting meat and piss and shit made me lose my footing for a second and take a step back. ""Jesus H. fucking Christ...""

""Told you, sir. It gets worse inside,"" the photographer said, sympathetically.

I put my handkerchief over my mouth and nose and walked in. Turning into the lobby, I saw what I would think the devil's playground would look like. Bodies were everywhere. On chairs, tables, on the floor, a couple were propped up on the wall like some sort of sick tapestry. Blood was so thick on the floor, it was hard not to step in it. What got me wasn't the number of victims, it wasn't the stink, it was the way they were killed. There were the ones with split heads, yeah. But there were also others. Some had their necks broken, their head turned all the way around. Some had their heads inflated with massive internal bleeding from the neck up. The worst were the ones that looked like...just...a flattened mess. The eyes of those poor fucks were several feet in front of their bodies.

I stumbled back out to the street, forcing my lunch to stay down. ""Davids, bag 'em and tag 'em,"" I looked at the CSI team, ""make sure you find EVERYTHING you can in there. I don't care what it is. We have to catch this asshole...GO, GO!"" I threw my arms towards them, willing everyone to work faster.

Paulson walked up with a terrified look on his face, ""Captain...what's in there?""

I looked at him with hard eyes, ""He's been practicing..."""
6k65ws,1,2017-06-29,"Need Advice - 23 YO, Debt, Savings, Grad School",Pieck0301,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6k65ws/need_advice_23_yo_debt_savings_grad_school/,"Hello! My situation is a bit complicated so please bear with me.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background:** I am a 23-year-old African American who has recently graduated from university. I spent most of my undergraduate career studying abroad (studied in 3 countries) and learning international relations. My hometown is rural and in the middle of nowhere Danville, VA, one of the poorest if not the poorest towns in the state --  The income per capita is $20,569, which includes all adults and children. The median household income is $32,173. Needless to say, there are no opportunities here for a recent graduate who has career ambitions in the international community.

&amp;nbsp;

**Debt/Savings:** During university, I used credit cards irresponsibly which I own up to, and owws a host of late fees and payments. I used all of my graduation money to pay off the majority of things. My credit score is currently an abysmal 549 (just raised 51 points due to mentioned payments) and my current debt is:

&amp;nbsp;

* $1000 to Barclays
* $659.00 to Wells Fargo
* $358.00 to Cox Communications.

&amp;nbsp;

I am lost on the best way to pay them off while building up my credit and savings. I paid off nearly all the collections and debts, and these are the remaining things left. I guess in hindsight $2000 is not much to pay, but I want to pay them off as efficiently as possible, which I have no idea how to do. All the credit cards accounts have been closed and I am currently using a debit card/cash for all my transactions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Employment:** My current job pays me $10 an hour and I am full time. It is highest paying job offer I got in this area ( a call center...), and the nearest metropolitan area is 1 hour away, which would make quite the daily commute. This is supplemented by a job I got during an exchange program, where I make $16.00 an hour working from home. I can get up to a maximum of 12 hours a week for this job (make my own hours). That's $800 before taxes in job 1 and $320 from job 2 -- paid biweekly for both. I currently live home with mom and dad, and have no bills to pay other than the debt and a gym membership. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Grad School/Future:** I have $30k in current student loans to pay off, but I have been accepted into an internationally acclaimed (ranked top 5 for employability and best in its country, but 50k for the cost of attendance) for a Masters of International Relations program. It is the only school that accepted me out of the six I applied too, but I researched into the course, internships, and opportunities, and find it most appropriate for my career goals (for example the course offers internships in embassies/consulates/international orgs). However, I would like outside advice on how to proceed with this given my complete situation and the fact that it would put me 80k in loans to pay back if I were to pay the whole thing using them. If accepted I would start in July 2018. I think it would be worth the investment, but at the same time, I feel as if my judgment is clouded. I do not know how to proceed. To be competitive in international jobs, especially for the federal government, I would need a masters/Ph.D. and show my eagerness and capacity to be successful while overseas.

&amp;nbsp;

I am EXTREMELY lost and need all the guidance I can. I am young and eager to start my career, and I would appreciate any advice, harsh truths, or encouragements you can give me. I want to build up my credit score by paying off those three things, but even then I am not sure on the best way to do this. Should I go monthly minimum or pay as much as I can? In regards to savings and given my financial situation what should I do? About grad school, is this a foolish venture and I am being too ambitious given the enormous costs and general risks of postgrad life. I appreciate you for reading this long post and thank you so much!

&amp;nbsp;

Act 1

- *glomps elf-in-orange*

- ""Oh my god it was such a real struggle to get here, we were running everywhere, I nearly fainted!""

- *on my 'no guests allowed' excuse to not bring her to where I live* ""Oh no, I'm sure it's fine! Just tell them your mother arrived from overseas.""

Act 2

- ""Oh this is a nice house!"" *5 minutes later* ""This house is much too big for us, you booked wrong.""

- ""Ugh, look how disgusting [SO] is. Go fold his things."" *proceeds to stare as I fold the 3 articles of clothing, doesn't leave the room when I leave*

- *as she, my brother and I walk to the grocery store, a 12-min walk* ""It's too hot! This sun is bad for the skin. Call a taxi or I'm going to turn back."" (We crossed the road to the shaded side.)

- *walks really, really slow, causing my brother and I to have to wait for her to catch up*

- *makes me call an Uber for the way back*

Act 3

- ""How much longer do you have for your internship? ... Well, could you break the contract single-party? This is the last thing that's rooting you to City, so just wrap things up so you can come home. Your dad wants you to just come back right after this, but I said probably July so you can settle your affairs. July should be enough, right?""

- *gets on my brother's case about something stupid after I tell her to let's talk about this at a different time*



**Day 2: Graduation**

Act 1

- ""Remember when I hurried everywhere from [overseas business trip] to get to your high school graduation? That was such a struggle [no straight English translation for this word, connotations of martyr]. Why did I do that? That was so much trouble/chaos.""

- ""No, I don't have the invitations."" (I sent it to her on 2 occasions.)

- *upon arrival at venue* ""Oh my god, you didn't tell us we had to print out our invitations. We need to print out our invitations!"" (They didn't, they got through.)

Act 2

- *takes so many damn photos, heaven have mercy*

- *after seeing my SO take a photo with me, seems to take exception to our physical proximity in the pose; asks for a photo of just me and her, clings to me*

- *pulls us to the professional portrait booth*

- ""Can we cancel the dinner with [SO's parents]? I'm not feeling fit and the sea wind is bad for when you're not well."" (Yep, it was a seaside restaurant reservation.)

- *asks to go see where I live, five minutes later*

- *fusses over my hair and clothes for five minutes while I silently fume at photographer for (probably well-intentioned but still condescending) call to mum to help straighten me up*

- *pulls face when I said I wanted to see my supervisor*

Act 3

- *has a bad face throughout the way to the place we're going for lunch, gives curt ""Fine"" when SO asks what's wrong*

- *after I told her I'd be going out with graduating class*: [Text] What time are you coming home? Your brother and I need to eat. (The house is literally 15 mins from a strip.) Who are you with?

Intermezzo:

*depletes elf-in-orange's bank account through Uber trips*



**Day 3: Flying back**

Act 1

- ""I'm not impressed with SO. Why is he staying with us if he's not helping get us to places or sort the house? There's so much to clean up!"" *proceeds to busy herself cleaning up*

- *after I tell her a cleaner will come* ""It's OK, we have to do what we can when we can.""

- *after SO says to leave the cleaning to him, since we have to go* ""It's OK, he's tired from work. I'll just do it.""

- *after SO goes back to bed from sheer tiredness* ""Where is SO? He hasn't said goodbye yet.""

Act 2

- *in the Uber, addressing both my 16yo brother and I* ""What do you think about this place that your dad and I have picked to be buried in?"" (Yep, as in cemetery.)

- *to me, about my going out with friends* ""What would you have done last night if we still had to have dinner with SO's parents?""

- ""Did it never occur to you to tell your friends, ""I'm sorry but my family is visiting so I have to go""?""

- ""I understand, which is why I'm asking you gently now but other people may not be as understanding [in similar situation].""

- ""Friends will only remain friends but family will always come first.""

- ""[Brother] and I are so unfamiliar with this city and you are the host.""

Does anybody know what to expect from the exit interview and when they received their full time offer after the internship? Also, how did y'all decide who made the cut or not?

I just wanted to discuss about working out times.  

I want to discuss this, because I started my internship (9-17) grind. When I wake up, I'm full of energy, thinking about how I will be working out today, but throughout the day my energy level drops and I feel drenched. 
And I have to drag myself to the gym, because I have no energy and try to find every excuse I can not to workout.


When do you workout? What do you feel is best for you?"
6k83g1,2,2017-06-29,[Help] Dog breeds for a single adult who works full time?,stakoverflo,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/6k83g1/help_dog_breeds_for_a_single_adult_who_works_full/,"I grew up in a house where our dog was *almost* never alone. My dad would leave for work by 6AM and be home by 3PM. My mom would work 5PM until 11PM. He was exercised **thoroughly**. Every morning my mom and my aunt would walk their dogs on a hiking trail that was always empty, so they'd let the dogs off their leashes so they could run and play for about 2 hours per day. We also had half an acre of land, so not *huge* but plenty big enough that you could throw the ball and he could run, and either my dad / brother / I would walk him for 0.5 - 1 mile in the evening. He was a black lab mix that we got from a family who was handing out puppies in front of a grocery store, so we don't know exactly what he was.

I've wanted a dog since the day I moved out of my parents house 6 years ago, and I think it's finally time. I plan to get one within a year's time, so I'm starting to do research now but I have a few concerns about myself.

Currently, I commute 30 minutes each way to work so I would not be able to come home during lunch to let it out or anything. I rent an apartment downtown and have 2 roommates -- although I don't particularly want to ask them to help out with the dog because that's just unfair to them.

I like bigger dogs. The bigger the better IMO, but I probably couldn't afford something like a St. Bernard. I don't want anything that doesn't come up to my knees at least. But I'm afraid of leaving it home alone from 7AM until 5PM five days per week. It might not technically be alone the entire day -- one of my roommates leaves in the morning later than I do, but he's a grad student / works + internship / has a girlfriend so he's quite busy.

Also, I've been saving up to hopefully get my own place next year, somewhere closer to the office and then I could come home during my hour lunch break and let him out and stuff.

I've been looking over various shelters in the area and there are mostly terriers, pitbull mixes, and sometimes shepherds and labs and other things like that -- which I would like. I don't want either a terriers (too small) and a lot of landlords won't rent to pitbull owners.

With my schedule I'm not sure if a Shepherd mix or a lab mix would be a good idea? I'm certainly not opposed to coming home from work and going to park and walking / playing for an hour or two or going hiking on the weekends. I'm in my 20's, single, don't have a lot of commitments. But at the same time, I currently don't lead a very active lifestyle. I'd like to think that if I had a furry friend who depended on me then I'd be more willing to get out there and be the owner that I think a dog deserves.

So I don't know, really. Ultimately it depends on what the shelters have available for adoption. What sorts of breeds do you guys think might be a good for a mid/late 20's full time office drone? Do you think it would be 'ok' to have a lab or shepherd or something along those lines home alone ~50 hours per week?"

I'm a US citizen who lives in Germany, and will be in Silicon Valley for an internship from October till April next year. I'm trying to fill out the W-4 at the moment and used the IRS calculator, but it says to put 13 (!) allowances which doesn't seem right. After googling a bit I found out putting more than 9 at least requires the employer to send that to the IRS for verification, so it seems out of the ordinary at least, but my situation is kind of uncommon so I can't really refute it. [Here's a summary](https://puu.sh/wxiDh/08cba931fd.png) of what I put in the calculator.  
Some things to consider:

- I get paid $35/h, so at 40 hours a week and roughly 12 weeks (Oct-Dec) that amounts to around $16,800. The internship is 6 months but as I understand only this year counts, and I'll have update the W-4 at the end of the year

- My parents are not American, have never filed US taxes, and so have never claimed me as a dependent. I also live alone, but I get an allowance from them so I think that would count if they filed

- I'm 20 and have never had to file taxes because I haven't earned more than that $10k threshold, so I put $0 pretty much everywhere in the calculator

- I used the standard deduction, although I'm not entirely sure how that works

Any tips greatly appreciated!"
6k8wut,3,2017-06-29,Can I vent here?,MA811,OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/6k8wut/can_i_vent_here/,"Feeling pretty low at the moment, or the last few days, maybe actually the last few months. 

I don't even really know where to begin. 

I had had my anxiety/ and OCD pretty much at bay for about a year when shit started hitting the fan. 

I was going through a very stressful postgrad, and I had my first panic attack in a very long time. Then my brain latched on to ""it's back!"" and it got very bad again. My girlfriend at the time couldn't deal with it and left me, then went and slept with a bunch of guys directly after us breaking up. 

After the post grad I went back home for a month and looked for an internship in my field, and that process was grueling. I finally got hired by a great company, and started about 3 weeks ago, but it was around this time that my sleep became very erratic, and I was exhausted all the time. 

I also started getting these feelings of butterflies in my stomach constantly, and I've become obsessed with the idea that I'm bipolar 2. This is now my biggest fear. 

I can't stop researching depression, and bipolar 2. I'm comparing myself to people on forums, I'm reading, and rreading tons of stuff on the internet. I keep retaking depression quiz's online. 

I would say i'm definitely depressed, but never suicidal. I love myself, I love my family, my friends. I just wish I could feel better, so I feel a little worn out. I'm scared I have this mental illness that will stop me from achieving my dreams. My biggest fear is having to move back in with my mom, and become a coach potato, where I'm constantly on my computer torturing myself. 

Last night I went saw a movie with my friend, and I was feeling depressed before, but when I got in I was laughing, but the nervous feeling my stomach got so strong. I felt like I had a lot of energy, I thought for sure. This is a mixed episode. 

I got home, and felt so anxious, I tried to sleep but I kept waking up so I took an ativan. I called in sick to work today, and I had 2 really big meetings, and I'm scared i'm not pulling my weight there. 

I'm going back home for this long weekend tonight, have a therapist appointment also (not on any medication). I'm terrified I won't get back to that place where I was feeling good. 

How I beat anxiety in the past was acceptance, acceptance that it was only anxiety causing my problems, but now I'm sure there's something else wrong with me. I'm about check my self into a psycheward. 

I'm hurting a lot, and could use some help. 

Thank you to anyone who read all of this. "

6k96w6,1,2017-06-29,I [23 F] am enjoying my college experience but can't help feeling that I want to be back home.. (X posted from r/college),lovelykintsuroki,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6k96w6/i_23_f_am_enjoying_my_college_experience_but_cant/,"Hello all, I apologize for this rant.. It's a bit long winded but I needed to get this out.


I transferred into the university I'm studying at in Fall 2016. I took four years in JC due to personal and academic issues that had to be worked out. I don't regret taking that long. I changed majors upon transferring, and it's gonna take me one more year to graduate (2019 instead of 2018).


I did everything necessary to integrate into my new life at my uni. I did Greek life, joined some clubs, became part of the multicultural greek council and I took on more positions in my org. I am also doing an internship related to my major, and plan on being more active in my major.


I still feel that I don't belong.


My university is based in LA and everyone commutes from different parts of LA.. some as far as Temecula (holy shit).
I feel alone. I feel that I don't fit in. People in LA seem to be more appearance based. I don't feel genuine connections. I feel that I'm becoming more pessimistic and cynical. Maybe even gossipy. Basically someone I worked so hard to not become.


My hometown is a cozy beach town, 2 hours up north. Everyone knows each other, and is pretty friendly. I had genuine connections with people. I was under the radar, so I avoided all the drama that came with being ""popular"". Everything is within walking distance. There's a uni too! I just didn't want to stay home because I thought I wanted to live the city life. I don't know why, but I feel that I'm closer with my two best friends back home, than with the people in my org. I'm usually alone in my down time. No one but one person goes out of their way to hang out with me. And when I make plans, I feel like no one wants to come through.


I know that opportunities for my major are scarce back home. But I really just want to be back. I miss my family, my friends and my hometown. I miss how it wasn't so hard to hang out with a group of friends. Or that if my friends were busy, my little sister was there. I am in a LTR, and he's also a big reason why I want to be home. I feel that I grew into myself during my time in LA, and that I'm ready to go back home to show everyone I'm different and put in work..
Is this a normal feeling? Will it ever go away? I don't like feeling this way anymore. I'm starting to feel depressed and anxious.. Does anyone have advice? TIA


tl;dr: Small (ish) town girl moved into big city. Now living a semi-lonely existence. What to do?"

6k9gps,2,2017-06-29,Theater ordeals.,xhaozone,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6k9gps/theater_ordeals/,"When senior year of my high school started *(August 2016)*, I had an empty view on what's gonna happen. A bit of background information: I've been doing high school theater literally from freshman year to now. I even did it in all the years in middle school as well. So I had a rather good understanding with most of my peers and their personalities and whatnot. 

One person I was very close with, we'll call her **B**. Now **B** and I considered ourselves as close friends. There was one point during late freshman year where she admitted her romantic interests towards me, but I was a hardcore and driven student who just wanted to excel and only viewed relationships as obstacles. After a bit of time to let her move on forward after my rejection, it seems as if we were still rather close. She began dating another guy around sophomore year who eventually became a friend of mine as well.

Another key figure I should also describe is someone I'll refer to as **F**. **F** and I were also considered good friends all the back in 7th grade. We trusted each other pretty well. Although I always felt that there was some unspoken gap between us, I felt like I didn't have to look deep into it. Back when our new director came around in junior year, he kept kissing her ass to the point where it got him into the role of being the theater president. Funny thing is that he began accusing others of kissing her ass to get their roles in the ""theater hierarchy"".

There was this one girl in the theater who I'll refer to as **H**. **H** didn't like me at all. Anything I would say that is remotely sarcastic, she will get triggered. Even if I calmly explain that I wasn't being serious, she wouldn't care and have a huge tantrum. It's been known that she'll enjoy your company based on your looks. And the thing is that she's considered the new director's favorite student all because **H** used to have her as an English teacher before she got transferred to theater directing. If I go over the lines of saying the word ""Damn."", the director will go onto me saying I need to watch my mouth while **H** is having a huge attitude and tells a lot of rather shady stories only to have the director enjoy and laugh along.

Now back to senior year of the theater.  The thing is with my theater (and typically all high school organizations), there were some cliques going about. I didn't seem to mind too much because I already my own circle of friends. However, people started beginning to merge into other circles. Now just to be clear, I'm not the coolest person to be around with. I'm awkward, I'm not on the good end of the attractive scale, but I love cracking jokes and witty lines. So making new friends wasn't easy for me seeing that their clique's applications were closed. Not that big of a deal, as I mentioned earlier. But I began to observe some movements of some people. For instance, I noticed a rather popular theater figure (Let's refer to him as **P**) began dating **H** . **P** and I weren't close, but we respected each other. As **P** was getting more respected and looked up to (especially by the ladies),  **F** began making it his mission to be around **P** as much as possible to make himself look better as president, not to mention to make some new friends. And then I began to notice that **P** seemed to start showing a disinterest in my presence. We had a theater group chat and whenever anyone else (Especially **P**) had something to say, everyone would just join in. One night after homecoming, I decided to try to connect better with the theater and shared a photo of my date and I. Everyone seemed to find it cute, until **P** decided to say ""You guys remember when this chat was meant for theater related topics? Me too."". I decided to goof around and say ""You guys remember when I give a fawk? Me neither."" He instantly removed me from the chat and then someone else added me again only to see a very triggered and aggressive **P**. Now I can understand that he didn't detect my sarcasm in the chat, but the way he handled it was very unprofessional. The dude just kept going on and on about this and even created a new chat and added everyone in there to rant some more. Like dude what? I eventually grew very disinterested and said a few quick words about how overreacting he's being and left. Funny enough, one of the girls who originally admired my photo screenshotted his chats and sent it to me only to tell me to shut up. I told her that if he has such an issue, he can simply private message me rather than embarrassing himself like that. **P** and I talked briefly to clarify ourselves. I dropped my ego and apologized and he shortly followed up with his apology afterwards. I wake up the next morning with a message from the vice president enforcing the theater chat to only be theater related and anyone using it otherwise would be removed. I thought it was the end of that until later that day **P** decided to pull a prank by pretending that he's in a car accident and even got president **F** and even the same vice president that just clarified a rule to not spam the chat with needless topics. Of course, all the girls were freaking out over it until he came clean. So much for that new rule, huh?

I began to notice more and more of a distance between **P** and I and then it clicked. **H** was gossiping him everything about me that she dislikes and as a method to appeal to her, he started to carry on her work and used his popularity to demean me. There were a few other incidents that further validated my point, but I'd rather move on.

Sometime during September, we finished our fall show and decided to carpool and go eat outside. On the way home, it was four girls and I, including **B**. One of the girls decided to do an icebreaker by saying we should all admit who we like. I expected **B** to say her boyfriend for obvious reasons, but she actually said the name of one of my closest friends, **M**. I didn't want to look deep into it but then **B** worded that she'll text me later. Later that night, she told me that she will be meeting up with **M** tomorrow at his house. I started to become a bit uneasy because she cheated once in the past by kissing her ex, but I overlooked it after I told her that she needs to talk to her boyfriend about this. She admitted that her and **M** will most likely not have sex, but if she's itching to makeout with him, she won't hold back. I advised her not to go then because this isn't something to be willing to do. She tried to lie by saying that her and her boyfriend are not technically dating but I saw through that easily as I told her I legit saw them making out in the hallways. She grew defensive and began repeating to me that this is none of my business. How is she going to text me her plans and not expect a response of how I feel towards this? We ended that conversation on a bad note. I decided to go visit **M** in the morning and warn him about **B**'s intentions. He told me that he already knew as someone else in the car also told him about **B**'s crush. He clarified that none of that will happen. I let out a sigh of relief and went on with my day after telling him not to tell her who exactly told him. I go on with my day and then received a big paragraph from her telling me to never speak to her again. I recoiled and explained her actions but she did not want to hear it. And the way I knew I was right after I explained her whole relationship with her boyfriend was when she kept repeating the same words until she eventually blocked me. But that wasn't until before I told her that she has to talk to her boyfriend about this by next week, or I will. I was not going to let this dude be in an illusion that everything's okay between him and his girl. I went to a party during that week, and I was explaining this issue with the another circle of friends I trust. They agreed that she was in the wrong and that her boyfriend deserves to know. Shortly afterwards, we began gossiping about the different organizations. I decided to talk about a theater term known as ""prop hopping"" where basically 2 or more people go into the prop hop and do the deed. I eventually called **F** and warned him about what **B** might do, and he advised me to screenshot the chats because he doesn't want things to go crazy where people cannot work for One Acts (We were in the middle of a production for a theater competition.) Eventually, he asked if I talked about prop hopping because one of the guys went up to him and **P** and another theater person and asked if it was true. He didn't appreciate the gossip and I apologized and he forgave me. After a week goes by, I asked **B**’s boyfriend if he wants to stay after school to chill for a bit. I waited for him by the benches outside the building. I started off simple by just asking how his relationship with her is going. I also asked if she's told her what she's been up to lately. He began to see that I'm about to unveil something so he asked me what's going on. I showed him our texts. And I made sure he read all of it so he can understand the full situation. After about 5 to 10 minutes of screen scrolling, he grew quiet. He asked me a few other questions such as if she has had sex with anyone else and what not. I didn't know, but I did ask him if she ever mentioned to him about her previous cheating scandal with her ex and he replied that he never knew about that either. I advised her boyfriend to process this and to talk to her first before going straight forward with the break up hammer. He thanked me for speaking up because he understands how close I am to her. Just because I'm her friend doesn't mean I won't always let her do some dumb mistakes. I decided to give him some time alone to process this, and went on with my day. In the middle of SAT studying, I get a few texts from my theater friends that **B** is blowing up in the main theater chat. I go on over to read it, only to see that she explicitly left out the details of my reasons to break her and her boyfriend up. Everyone began apologizing to her and **P** brought up the fact that I was talking about prop hopping outside the theater and everyone instantly followed through on that. I decided to speak up and send all of our conversations and told everyone to read it. I also began rebutting and also called **B** about her previous cheating scandal, and as soon as I finished, **P** removed me from the chat once again. With the amount of madness I was feeling, I went to **M**'s house, and got on his phone to see the conversation. Everyone thanked **P** for removing me including **F**, who basically just went along with everyone. Eventually, I got a voice call from **F** saying he's disappointed with me because everyone else hates me right now, including the director (She didn't even know yet, he just wanted to add more emphasis) and told me to stay away from the theater. I can already see the chain of puppets going from **F** connected to **P** connect to **H**, but I couldn't take on all of them so I just accepted his words. I decided that with all the drama going on right now, it's just unhealthy for me to be a part of this right now. I eventually contacted the director, and she told me that she doesn't care about the cheating scandal, but she said she couldn't trust me after talking about prop hopping. Which as much as I try to understand, I feel like she's just being influenced by **H**. The ironic thing is that previously, she said that we should not be affected by other people's opinions and gossip, and yet look at all this brouhaha. I was metaphorically at this point just peeping through the window to see what I'm now abolished from, all because I tried to stop a cheating scandal to happen. At least they're broken up, right? WRONG. Literally later that evening when I got removed from the chat, **B**’s boyfriend forgave her and they started going back out again. 

So with my efforts in vain and losing a circle of friends that I grew up in high school with, I fell into a depression from the embarrassment I brought upon myself. It got to the point where I would not get out of bed for a few days because of what's happened. I decided to try to come ahead to **B**'s house and apologized to her. But the thing is, I felt an empty apology from her. Never have I regretted an apology like that. Because that's all she wanted: not an apology, but dominance. I thought I would be fine after that, but I wasn't. As everyone gossiped and hated on me in their pasttime, eventually **F** began adopting those habits and went out of his way to make sure I don't get accepted into another organization at my school by telling the officers that I cannot be trusted and whatnot. Why do I know this? It's because **M** told me that **F** decided to speak for me during acceptance decisions. And knowing **F**'s attitude, he either A) Purposely sounded really unprepared to not make me sound as great or B) Straight up try to bad mouth me on why I should not join. As much I tried to talk to him and have him explain himself, he would cower away and hide himself to prevent confrontation. A few connections I have in the theater can see through his act and admitted that this is just to fit in. 

But keep in mind, I wasn't theater-less for the rest of the year. I began to start this program that allows me to be released early to go do work somewhere else, and I managed to snag myself at an internship at a theater in the city of our town. I loved it there. Being around by people with various backgrounds and not having cliques, it felt like home to me. As much I loved being there, the pain from my high school theater still hurts me. Heck, it still lingers in the back of mind even though I just graduated high school. I even got sent to a mental institution on Christmas because of the madness I was going through. I often compared myself to Joker because I pleasured myself with harmful thoughts of torturing them and gaining adrenaline through their agony. I kept laughing out of trauma. But all of that just proved to me the corruption I've felt. 

I began to decide to work with the high school director again by using my hours at working in the professional theater to get my thespian induction. After months of playing her games and being manipulated, I got it in the end. But as I still have obtained this, I plan on burning it along with all of my other theater items to resemble my cleanse from this bad time and to move on forward where I can meet new people and hopefully strengthen my once blazing passion for acting and to hopefully pursue my dream to become an entertainer.

Thank you for reading. I just really felt like after all these months of just holding it in, it's best to release it out. Maybe someone, somewhere, will understand and I won't feel so alone on this situation. Whether or not that they agree with my actions or not, I just feel like I need to be heard. Because honestly, I feel like this will always remain a mental scar that shows to me how cruel and corrupted people can be. And the last thing I want to lose is my optimism to this world.

Fun fact: Even after **F** kicked me from the theater so they can focus on the competition, **M** told me that they ended up being placed second to last in the competition. 

TL;DR: I stopped a cheating scandal to occur at the cost of my membership for a theater organization and my sanity. I still haven't healed.

I'm going to be submitting 4 LORs: 2 character references, 1 from a previous supervisor at an internship, and 1 professor. 

I had a hard time choosing which professor to ask as I remain pretty anonymous in most of my classes. I chose to ask an IT professor because I got 100s on most of the assignments in his class. We don't have any sort of personal relationship so some of the questions on the DD 370 form might be hard for him to answer since he does not know me as a person. 

Do you think it is still okay to have him write a LOR regarding the quality of my work in his class even though we do not have a personal relationship? "

6k9swr,12,2017-06-29,I am afraid of casually getting back out there.,BlueFalcon2009,datingoverthirty,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/6k9swr/i_am_afraid_of_casually_getting_back_out_there/,"Well, some of you have interacted with me, and know some of my story.  This post is an expansion on a post from u/SAphoenixlady about dating recently divorced/separated people and our discussion there.  I'll include my situation here as well just in case:

Background:
I have been in a loveless and sexless marriage for over 11 years.  About a month ago, I caught my wife cheating on me.  My current living situation is complicated to say the least.  My STBXW and I had a talk after I caught her, and both agreed we are well overdue for divorce.  The issue is essentially a financial one as well.  With our kids, and our current combined income, we cannot afford a separate place, much less health insurance for me.  We are in a 'in house separation' essentially until I finish school.  After that divorce and move-out will occur.  From my point of view, there is 0 chance of reconciliation for multiple reasons.

With all that said, I have no idea how to meet people.  I have been married for over a decade, and prior to that, somewhat socially awkward in the 'meet people' situations (I am by nature an introvert, and quite nerdy).  I'm not sure I am ready to jump on the OLD world yet, but there is still some hope for meeting people in person.  As stated, I am attending a university, seeking an undergraduate degree (about 10 years behind the power-curve).  I have an internship that will turn into a lucrative job when I graduate (yes, its not in writing, but you will have to take my word on this, it's an ""extremely likely"" on the old magic 8-ball due to legitimate 'reasons').  Unfortunately, the pool at school is significantly younger than I am, and I have concerns about being able to even connect with people, or not be seen as 'the creepy old guy'.  After all, there is about a 8-10 year age gap between my fellow students and myself.

At the same time, my current social interactions are kinda limited, and I would like to start casual dating and meeting new people.  I DO NOT (yes caps...) want to jump in to something serious AT ALL.  I am not looking for ONSs or flings per say, but more of relearning how to become more social and interact with women in a healthy way.

Due to school, kids and my situation, time is crazy limited. I feel I am in a decent place emotionally to meet people, and have casual relationships and such, but most of the concerns and questions I have involve interpersonal relationship stuff that I do not think I will fully understand without beginning relationships.

More on my emotional state:

-Overall, I am happier now, than I have been in years. This is a continual work in progress, but the direction I am headed feels very right, and good for me.  I have plans for post-divorce, prospects for post-school, and even desires as far as housing/living situation goes post move-out.  Financially, these things seem very plausible too.

-I know where I went wrong in the relationship, and cannot really test fixing that without a relationship (I became emotionally closed of due to being unable to communicate my feelings with my STBXW, which turned into one of her reasons for wanting out of our marriage, among other things).  I do not feel guilt or shame per say, but more look at the situation as a learning experience.  I do have some residual issues with how the divorce will affect my children, but that will be there for quite some time.

-I am happy that my STBXW is seeking her own happiness, and if I am being honest, a bit jealous that she has friends and her 'not boyfriend' she can spend time away with, while I do not. I am not blocking or preventing her from doing these things, or anything petty.  I do not feel anger towards her, nor do I feel vindictive or anything.

-She constantly is trying to make sure I have time to get out of the house, without the kids.  I would wrap this as, overall, we are both supportive of each other in our individual pursuits of happiness.

-I actually have taken the cheating thing pretty well. I am not sure how much of that will be an issue as time goes on, I am sure there will be things that might trigger underlying feelings.  Overall, other people are not my wife.  Furthermore, I understand she has been suffering as well, and she cheated a) as an exit-affair, and b) has known this was pretty much over for a long time.

My goals:

-Meet new people, explore new friendships and begin to experience something other than work, school work, and my children. I would like these new people to be into things I want to explore, or spend more time doing.

-If things happen, they happen, but the goal is to keep things very casual, and slow.  I have no issues with exclusivity or any of that, other than jumping in too fast.

-I would like to build a better understanding of what I actually want in my own love-life.  I understand from my previous relationship with my STBXW that I am very much a touch love person, but what kind of person do I even want?  I have no idea what is out essentially.

-Continue my self-healing, and continue rebuilding me.  This is mandatory, and most important next to my kids.

Does this sound reasonable? Am I jumping the gun?  Am I over-analyzing this? Do I need to shut-up and go away? Do I need to find a hooker (this was a joke, totally not gonna do that)? I feel emotionally ready to begin, under the pretenses that it is casual (will be voiced). I also feel some concerns about jumping into things, and intend to be weary of that. I would be completely honest about the fact I am technically married, and my living situation.  I do not want people I meet to become my emotional support network, but more of my emotional growth and discovery network. I have people to talk to about my divorce issues, but even they are surprised how well I am doing when I check in with them.

So DOT, tear me apart!"
6k9v2e,6,2017-06-29,"M4F Recolonizing Latin America, one puta at a time",ldnby92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6k9v2e/m4f_recolonizing_latin_america_one_puta_at_a_time/,"*The Mandarin Hotel, Puta Cana, Dominican Republic, near future*

Ethan Brenthouse took a long, slow sip from his mojito, draining it down to the ice. He had to admit, as much as his preference was for American rye, the Dominicans made a damn good cocktail. He lazily signaled to a wide-eyed waitress, who quickly shuffled over.

""Another please, *mamacita*"" he sneered in his distinctive, privileged drawl. 

""Of course sir,"" the young girl quietly responded, giving him a pained smile before hurrying back to the bar. In the meantime Ethan sat back on his chair, folding his arms and listening to the waves of the Caribbean crashing into the white sand of Puta Cana Playa, just a hundred or so feet away.

It was good to be American again. 

It was hard sometimes to process how much the country had changed in a few short years. Ever since the astonishing electoral victory of the Founding Father's Party in 2020, America had finally fulfilled its Manifest Destiny and become the Empire it always deserved to be. The red, white and blue juggernaut had steamrolled through Venezuela in 2021, crushing the socialist uprising and liberating the world's largest proven oil reserves. 
Across Latin America rebellions and left-wing insurgencies everywhere from Honduras to Peru were crushed by US-backed dictators using America-made weapons. And yes, the FFP had also built the big, beautiful wall on the Mexican border.

The entire southern continent was now nothing more than one huge *maquiladora*, making American goods for next-to-nothing and pumping money into the glorious US economy. Places like the Dominican Republic had become veritable gold-minds for American investors. In the morning they could grease some palms, and displace a few hundred favela-dwellers to build a new luxury hotel for American tourists. In the afternoon, dine with corrupt government officials to ensure that US corporations could have monopolies on the country's natural resources. And in the evening, party with an army of Latina sluts, all desperate for a *principe blanco* to take them to the US. 

Which brings us back to Ethan Brenthouse.

Tall, blonde, and chiseled from years of polo and lacrosse, Ethan was about to enter his final year at Dartmouth, and had decided to take the summer to ""intern"" with a venture capital firm down in DR - one owned by an alumni of his frat. Ostensibly Ethan was there to help find *new, market-friendly investment opportunities for the growing and dynamic American market.* In reality this just involved a lot of partying and drinking, for which Ethan would receive an extremely generous stipend and a job after he graduated with one of Washington's biggest lobbying companies.
 
Tonight, however, Ethan wasn't interested in business. He was interested in pleasure.

He had tried to make some vague promise to himself to stay faithful to his girlfriend back in Dartmouth over the month he was down in DR - after all he'd cheated, and been forgiven, so many times it was honestly farcical at this point. That changed his second night in Puta Cana however, when he found himself in a strip club's VIP room with some whore on her knees in front of him, head bobbing up and down. The women down here were just so...*desperate* and *servile*. Was it the Catholicism? Their sense of inbred inferiority? Or just the fact they knew 21-year-old Ethan was in possession of more money than they could ever dream of? 

The waitress returned a deposited his mojito with a timid smile before disappearing. Taking a drink, Ethan's eyes scanned around the hotel's restaurant. It seemed the Mandarin had taken extra care to have plenty of eye-candy on display for their Western visitors, so Ethan wasn't exactly lacking for options. Waitress? Hostess? Classily-dressed girls, here all alone, who were likely  hookers?

One way or another, his privileged white seed would be flowing down some *puta's* throat tonight...
______________________________________

Hi there! Do taboo themes like corruption and raceplay turn you on? Do you want to explore the sick, dystopic side to American colonization? Do you want a well-written, eloquent roleplay that can be either short-term or long-term? Well then you're in luck.
This is a story where,  together, we craft the downfall of a [beautiful, young Latina girl](https://gfycat.com/AggravatingComplicatedDassierat). Maybe she's a waitress, struggling to make ends meet, and sees Ethan as a ticket to the top. Maybe she's a student, wide-eyed by Ethan's riches, or maybe she's a high-class escort, surviving a dystopic world, who knows how to give boys like Ethan the Latina experience they crave. Whatever character you choose, it'll be one where Ethan gets to realize his innate superiority over the mulatto hoards of Latin America, fucking their women just as his country had fucked over their people.

I realize the prompt is quite dark but I'm far, far more interested in mental degradation and corruption than anything physical. I find it so much hotter when a girl forces herself to willingly submit to an arrogant guy then any actual rape scene. 

If you're at all interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you!

6k9vmt,1,2017-06-29,Should I [27/f] break up with my bf [26/m]?,shmirstie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6k9vmt/should_i_27f_break_up_with_my_bf_26m/,"I'm at a loss. I could wait for life to get there, to make it glaringly obvious that it's not going to work out, but I'd like some guidance now. Please let me know if this relationship sounds similar to an experience you've had and how it worked out.

When we first met, I automatically had the feeling that it wouldn't work out. The sex was great and we have enough in common to stay interested and like talking to each other a lot. That was 2 months ago and I've had time to get over this, but he just wasn't who I saw myself being with. He's just a little more crass than I like. I can appreciate crudeness but he takes it over the line sometimes. I've learned that I appreciate how far he's willing to go mentally though to explore a thought experiment so it's two sides of the same coin. He lives with his parents and makes decent money but doesn't appear very ambitious, though has the faculties and is not lacking in self-confidence. This is important to me. I want someone who is as willing as me to make our life together work and to PUT IN work but I also appreciate about him that he chills me out, and that I feel relaxed talking to him. I am a PhD student in social work research, he's a medical technician. I never feel relaxed, always stressing about whether I should be doing something, so again, two sides of the same coin.

And the most obvious issue is that he's way more blunt than I would like. He's insensitive sometimes, saying things in a way that he doesn't mean to be hurtful but sound that way. He has no idea how to make me feel better when I'm upset and usually just makes it worse by trying to fix it or make me laugh instead of what I like to do which is talk it out. He has to argue a point to its source to get over something instead of just letting it go, making me feel like he needs to exercise his logic more than cares about our happiness.
So, those little things have been adding up and we've been arguing most nights. The day will be okay, we'll text and have fun and be loving and then at night when we're facetiming, he'll say something that irritates me, I'll let him know, he won't apologize or will try to explain to me why he said it, I'll get frustrated because he's explaining what I already know and won't just skip to the part where he apologizes. I even end up apologizing for being sensitive sometimes just to get him to shut up. 

Our arguments usually get resolved pretty thoroughly. I'll let it go once its over, he'll completely let it go too. But, it's happening a lot and I feel sometimes too that I'm not getting enough in other areas to make up for the lack of emotional connection. He's caring enough, that shows. But, he doesn't regularly compliment or make me feel special, he's super preoccupied with sex, and mentions it like 40 times a day. I'm pretty sexual but it gets to be over the top. I'm away for a two month internship right now and I practically had to beg him to send me a care package because he's not the materialistic type and his family relationships dont include a lot of gift giving. I can understand that but it's irritating to have to overcome all of these differences in love language. I'm not even sure if we will so I feel silly trying so hard when it feels as if it might be fruitless.

I appreciate that he keeps me stimulated, has the stamina to deal with the emotional side and come to common ground eventually even though it seems like forever and I hate the conflict. I like that he's as experimental and cerebral as me, I like that's eccentric and quirky and keeps life interesting but still interested in making a family. And probably a pretty huge plus is that we share the same ideals and life goals other than that I am more ambitious. He is still interested in making money and having nice things, and makes ok money, but his living with his parents is a huge turn off. He literally screams for his mom to make him coffee from his upstairs bedroom.

I kind of think we're either really great for each other and working out the kinks early or it's headed for hell. He just doesn't get the emotional side at all. Has anyone successfully navigated that kind of dichotomy in a relationship?

Edit: included some more about what I like about him to even it out. 

tl;dr- he's not exceptionally great at making me happy, I'm more on the sensitive side, he more on the logical, our communication styles lead to a lot of arguing with pretty good resolution in the end though... still, I'm wondering."

6kajp6,29,2017-06-29,I made a record with a ghost.,ARRRcade,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/6kajp6/i_made_a_record_with_a_ghost/,"Hi Reddit,

I want to share a story about dreams and perseverance.  Last week, I released a record I started with my band almost a decade ago. I wanted to tell the story here in the community that has shared so much with me over the last few years.  This might get long, so fair warning.

I’m a guitar player and songwriter, and got into recording because I knew I’d never have the money or clout to make a real record.  I quit college on 3 separate occasions to pursue a career in music.  Eventually, I got an internship at a recording studio in my hometown that would put me on the path to become an audio engineer. After a while, though, I realized that all I really wanted to do was my own thing, so I started a band with one of my best friends, Nick.

Nick was the ultimate guitar player.  Ever date a girl way out of your league?  It was like that.  He would just mesmerize you with the way he played.  I’ve still never heard anything like it.  From southern Alabama, it was clear he’d grown up worshipping Lynyrd Skynyrd, Pink Floyd, the Doobie Brothers and Led Zeppelin.

We started playing as an acoustic duo, and it just clicked.  We combined our songs and started writing new ones, and soon we got the opportunity to record an EP at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio (yes, THAT Muscle Shoals Sound Studio).  It was a little pitchy, but the content was there, and it was enough to get us a kick-ass bass player and drummer from New Orleans.

We were a band--we were becoming a good band--and soon enough we were recording our record.  We called one of my fellow audio engineer friends, gathered all our gear, rented a commercial office space, turned it into a functional studio, and began the process. We decided to record the right way: the old, analog way (on a Studer A800 24 2” track tape machine, at 15ips, using an IEC transfer curve, to be exact).

We recorded in the same room at the same time, just like the good old days. Some of the songs were recorded in just one take. When I listen to it now I can genuinely relive the magic of those sessions. The sound of the whole room is there. That was 2011.

In April of 2012, Nick was killed in a car crash by a drunk driver.  It felt like we would never get to tell his story and share his gifts with the world. It was a truly devastating experience. My band drifted apart, and I traded in my music “career” for one in electrical engineering.  Our record sat incomplete.  Two years ago, that changed.  We decided to reunite and finish (editing/mixing/producing) our record-- and we soon discovered that without Nick, it was a real challenge. Sometimes we would find that we didn’t quite have the right guitar take or not enough vocal passes from Nick. There were some areas of the record that we thought we wouldn’t even be able to finish. Thankfully, with equal parts ingenuity and miracle, we were able to circumvent all of our major obstacles.

Finally, in May of this year, we flew to Hollywood to have it mastered by Bernie Grundman at Bernie Grundman Mastering (P.S. he did Thriller and Aja) and only a few days ago we published it on almost all major digital and streaming services.

6kblnb,2,2017-06-29,How long to wait before hooking up with someone after a breakup?,dr_throwaway_phd221,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6kblnb/how_long_to_wait_before_hooking_up_with_someone/,"Here's the situation:


My ex and I dated for about a month and a half shy of two years. I broke up with her because I'm about to graduate, and we were in a LDR and I wanted to be able to focus on my studies. 


But right after the break up, I started having feelings for this other girl. At first, it was just a crush but once I was single we started spending time together and those feelings turned very real, which is scary and feels like everything is moving really fast.


The thing about this girl is that she's moving to Chicago in a few weeks, and I'll be home (I'm off doing an internship right now) about a week and a half before she leaves. In another world, I would be really happy about this, but the timing really sucks, and I feel guilty for having feelings for someone else so quickly.


This girl wants me to come and see her before she leaves, and I know that she wants to sleep with me before she goes. I do as well, but there's this part of me that feels like I'm doing wrong by my ex. I did not cheat on her, and I haven't done anything with anyone since the break up.

Should I feel bad about this? Or am I just being neurotic?

I'm interested in biotech, nanotech, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, materials science, etc and I'm not really interested in being a traditional process engineer in the middle of nowhere, or working in oil &amp; gas. 

I know getting internships and coops is important, but that's probably true for any field. Are job prospects truly terrible in these fields? My alternative is Computer Science, but I'd rather not just code for 8 hours a day after graduating, even though I love coding. I wouldn't mind going to grad school later on, if that would make prospects better. I'm just not sure if the negativity on this sub is because people who don't have good experiences tend to be more vocal, or if the market is really this bad and will continue to decline in the next decade. I'd really appreciate any advice."
6kc41y,2,2017-06-29,I'm almost 19. I can do practically anything with my life but what??,lostsummmer,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6kc41y/im_almost_19_i_can_do_practically_anything_with/,"I thought I had things figured out when I was 15. I'd get my computer engineering degree, get my masters/phd, travel, get a big house with a white fence and dogs in it. 

But ever since I moved out to college (at 16 -- I skipped a grade and stuff), my life feels like a big mess. I felt so lost my freshman year in college -- I got depressed, self-harmed, got betrayed by friends. Around that time I first started questioning my sexuality, which was a big deal since I could not see my family accepting the fact that as a girl, I liked girls. So I wrote it off as just appreciating the aesthetics of girls, until I finally (kinda) came to terms with my bisexuality about a year later.

You'd think that since I just got over with my junior year of college, I'd have things figured out by now. Wrong. While I cope with things in a more mature way, I'd be lying if I were to say that I feel happy and have a plan in life. I seem to be changing so much that I feel confused. I jump from one hobby to another. I look at my ideals from the past with disgust, etc..

I could do anything, but there's just so many things to do. Getting a driver's license, getting a motorbike, travelling to Peru, studying bats, building something from scratch, etc.. And at the same time, in theory all those things sound awesome, but in reality I don't feel like doing anything most of the time. 

I think the most fucked up thought that I've had in the back of my head for the past two months is that I'm never really happy. I'm just distracted from all the sad and shitty things about this world. So I keep myself occupied with all these things without actually knowing what I *really* want in life. I also feel like I can't talk to this to my friends, as all of them are going through their best times in life right now (first relationships, even marrying, internships abroad, stellar grades, amazing friends). And I'm over here just kinda struggling to stay afloat on the shore without a compass."
6kc5rm,1,2017-06-29,Question about applying at BB...,TechGuruGJ,Bestbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bestbuy/comments/6kc5rm/question_about_applying_at_bb/,"I'm an 18 year old college student, who is looking to apply at Best Buy. I've been looking everywhere to get a good job this summer, but I can't find anything besides Fast Food and high requirement IT jobs. I saw that my local Best Buy has some positions open and I noticed it says they prefer 3 months - 1 year of previous experience. I don't have any prior work experience as I was hoping to get into a local Intern program, which has unfortunately run out of resources to get me a position. I'm very knowledged in technology and consumer needs and I'm working on a degree in Computer Information Systems.  I have taken many computer  classes through my High School and even one at the local community college. I follow technology as much as I can and I think I could be a good fit. I'd just need training in sales.

Is it realistic for me to get a chance or would my lack of any previous experience disqualify me from any sort of consideration? I really want to avoid working fast food, but I understand that jobs are competitive and it's not entirely realistic to try for such careers without experience. But I'm not looking for money, I want experience and no one is offering experience without having experience.

Thanks for any help or advice you can give."
6kcm21,2,2017-06-29,Considering taking out private loans to pay for school ($28k) and living expenses for a year ($15k) because I don't want to go back home.,Evan_dood,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6kcm21/considering_taking_out_private_loans_to_pay_for/,"I currently have a B.A. in Psychology and am considering going through an online program to get a B.S. in Computer Science. I can't do anything with my B.A. as of right now and am stuck making $14/hour. I used up all of my Federal Loan allotment for undergrad and *really* don't want to move back into my mom's house for a variety of reasons, so I'm looking into getting private loans. 

I know moving home would be the best option financially, but I cannot deal with the people in that house and just thinking of living there again makes me grind my teeth. Would taking out a private loan for the total ($43,000) be unusual, absurd, or hard to pull off? I have fairly good credit the last time I checked (600-700) and ideally after a year of this program I would get an internship that would lead into employment and possibly help with living expenses towards the end."
6kcnlv,1,2017-06-29,"Started a job on monday, been working less then a week, there have been some red flags but I need money..what do i do?",ChasingAnxiousDogs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6kcnlv/started_a_job_on_monday_been_working_less_then_a/,"So I started a job at a small shop a few days ago, and it's clear the owner does not know how to run a business. Since taking over I have taken on the tasks of making a website, and running all the social media, AND designing some new artwork for the shop. (The deal was this would also be an internship for me, hence all the work). and the first 2 days i LOVED my job, I got to sit around, do art, social media etc all day. It was fun and creative. 

Im supposed to work full time, and get paid minimum wage right now. 

It is infinitely clear that the owner is making NO profit. 

I have still not signed any paperwork saying i am officially hired, i'm the only employee for this womans tiny start-up business. 

The shop makes less then 100 a day IF that and I am starting to get sent home early as the owner cant afford to pay me for 8 hours of work 5 days a week. 

I need to pay rent, so im thinking of leaving this job after just under a week. I need to know I can have money coming in...but if i haven't signed any paperwork, does she legally have no obligation to pay me for the time i've put in? I'm afraid to leave for fear she wont ever pay me the almost 200 dollars ive earned so far (which is  a lot for a broke college kid who needs to pay bills) 

the lady is nice enough, and has blindly trusted me with keys to the store already. I'm not sure where to go from here. Do I tell her I don't think she can afford to keep me as the sales are so low, and hand over the passwords/et to the social media stuff? 

I feel stuck. And I want out ASAP. 

TLDR; Started a new job, seemed awesome, owner seems broke, I want out, but since i havent signed official paper work im afraid she'll stiff me on the money i already earned. "
6kdacl,2,2017-06-29,How to adapt to an extroverted workplace,vintagegarden,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/6kdacl/how_to_adapt_to_an_extroverted_workplace/,"My current job is an internship and this is by far, the BEST job I've ever had and the best environment I've ever had. They treat you well; I'm treated like a competent person and am working on a real project. It's a blend of business analytics and IT, and it's really cool work.

I've been there a little over a month, and a nontraditional student and knew it would take me a little bit of time to feel settled in with a new job. It's been nearly 6 weeks and I feel so tired. If I don't have 2 cups of coffee every day, I can barely think. I know it's not necessarily managing my work and school schedules-- my program is online. I get 7.5 hours of sleep a night. I also exercise. It didn't occur to me today it's my work environment.

The culture is super collaborative because of the cross-functionality of projects. There are a lot of meetings, and working with people to get information. Because I'm new, I don't know a lot and I need to work with people to get information and to stay abreast of statuses on related projects. 

But I feel drained most of the time when I get home. My brain becomes nearly non-functional for 2 hours after getting home, although I need that time to exercise, do chores, homework, and talk to my husband. He's an extrovert and doesn't see me all day and hates that I feel drained and can't have a talk with him for a half an hour after I get home. I'm frustrated too, because I don't remember feeling this way the last time I started a new job. The difference between my job now and then is the last job was in a very introverted environment where the department was very quiet, people worked independently, and mostly talked to give someone help. The environment was better suited for introverts, but the irony is they treated people like crap.

It sucks to make this connection, and maybe I'm wrong. I hate to think that this great opportunity could be ruined because I'm an introvert and I can't figure out how to adapt to the environment. What should I do?"

6kezsn,15,2017-06-30,How do you survive mandatory work lunches?,Ethinyl,1200isplenty,https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/6kezsn/how_do_you_survive_mandatory_work_lunches/,"Hi all!

I just started doing CICO (3 weeks in) with a 1200 calorie max. And yesterday I bumped into my first real challenge. I had a mandatory lunch at my internship. They provided the lunch and it was very high in calories, and because I am an intern I didn't felt very comfortable to bring my own lunch. It is a small company so everyone would notice and I didn't want to talk about dieting with them. 
The lunch consists of french baguettes with filling (cheese, ham, chicken salad with mayo etc). It is tasty but to make me feel full enough I had to eat two sandwiches which were 700kcals combined... that did not leave me much room for breakfast (which was 250), dinner and snacks.

So I managed yesterday with just skipping the snacks and having a light dinner (and still went over my max). So basically this was a very bad day for me since i did not want to eat more than 2 sandwiches but the 2 werent enough to keep me full for the entire day so i was hungry. 

What do you do when these kinds of things happen? What are some tips so I can survive these mandatory lunches at a workplace? 

Thanks! "
6kfhko,2,2017-06-30,Family finances force me to forget about free time. I feel too young to feel so old.,goodplayer98,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6kfhko/family_finances_force_me_to_forget_about_free/,"I remember something happening in 2008 - some worry, some trouble, then; I was in elementary school still - but my good parents made sacrifices to make sure I never felt the impact. And I was sheltered, wholly - until some years ago, when my dad told me to ""learn C"". That was it, ""learn C"". I was to take over the software project of a senior engineer, and try to help his project get off the ground. Fine, I thought. I'm giving back to my family, and I made good money doing it too. 

My parents never showed me a bank statement, but they did let me know it was serious. My mother, by telling me to sleep early, stop playing, learn your mother tongue, and why aren't you helping your father? Do you hate your family? My father, by telling me that if he didn't have to use me, then he wouldn't. He couldn't afford to hire another... anything. I did everything from graphic design, to web design, to QA, to the GUI, to directing and editing the product videos, to writing the blog posts and handling social media, to writing some core components of the software - with important security features I had no reason to ever touch. 

Great portfolio builder, really. If not pleasant, then valuable. Very valuable.

It was fine, too; at least, until about five months back, when the ill Fates seemed to begin their assault in earnest. We completely ran out of money. Nobody is getting paid - not me, not the real engineers. We're losing the house. I eat a sandwich for lunch, and sleep for dinner. My computer is dying, too. The crashes are coming. I have no idea how I'm going to do anything if I lose this lifeline of mine; we haven't the means to acquire a new computer. (We do have other computers, though. So worry not.) I wanted to reach Global Elite in CounterStrike - but then I got framerate drops that made the game unplayable, so I reallocated that time to work. Bitterly, because I don't know that I'll still be fast enough to compete as I age. Then, my Overwatch started randomly crashing, black screening, etc. which was especially sad, because my father had originally purchased (to him, I imagine, invested in) the game to spend some time with me. 

My friends are also slipping away; games, our only common ground now that we've entered college, is out the window as POCs, demos, and other finishing touches on the product get put on the table. I seldom have two consecutive days where I talk to them - we've drifted.

So now here I sit. Oh-shit-its-early O'clock in the morning. I don't know why I'm so... upset. Angry, frustrated. I know both that I'm living an extraordinary case of life, and also that some people have it worse. I guess I simply want to be a regular young adult - gloating about that tech internship, working summer jobs, playing until all of a sudden I wake up and the sun is setting. Streaming. Drinking. Watching Youtube videos. *Making* Youtube videos. I guess I just feel trapped, pinioned. C'est la vie, huh?

6kfokc,45,2017-06-30,Mike is a big fat liar.,platinum_boots,talesofmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesofmike/comments/6kfokc/mike_is_a_big_fat_liar/,"Mike is relatively new at my job (started in March). I tried to get along with Mike because we're about the same age. But.. Mike is very fond of themselves and likes to tell stories that are obviously exaggerated.

i.e., Mike graduated last December. Apparently prior to graduation Mike was completing an internship in Washington D.C. for event planning. Mike was so good that when the internship ended in the summer the company offered a position paying $80,000/year despite the fact Mike was not graduated yet. Mike turned it down because it was not challenging enough. Mike is in charge of event planning at our company. The day Mike told me this, we went to lunch and he conveniently forgot the correct card, so I had to pay for his lunch. This happened with various stories at least 2x after this as well.

When Mike first started, he was late on around his fifth day due to a flat tire. Mike has never changed a tire but taught himself via Google to change a tire on the side of a busy high way in 15 minutes. Very clean nails and fingers for having just changes a tire. But whatever.

The following week.. Mike ran out of gas and was half hour late. The story texted to myself and the other person in our department was they ran out of fuel on the side of the highway. Once Mike arrives to work, he tells us he saw he was low on fuel and went to the nearest highway exit with gas stations. There was conveniently a cop behind him, which put his flashers on. Instead of pulling over Mike assumed that meant he could go through a red light. After going through the red light, Mikes car stopped moving directly in front of a gas station due to no fuel. The cop simply helped him get his car to the pump and said to have a nice day, nothing about the light that was ran.

Yesterday Mike told us that he was going to look at a couch he found on Facebook. The woman had posted the couch for $350, he offered $200. The woman messaged him yesterday morning and said someone offered $400 if she held the couch until Sunday and she told Mike, ""if you come get it tonight, you can have it for $45.""

One day Mike asked me if I have any tattoos, I said no to him and he responds with ""I don't either."" Now, Mike was very pushy about becoming Instagram friends with me... He has a photo of a tattoo covering 7/10 of his back. I think it took him a minute to remember that because about 4 minutes or so later, he goes ""Just kidding! I have one!"" 

More recently, Mike planned a big picnic party pack giveaway for one of our Grand Openings. Mike pulled about four winners and each did not have their loyalty card registered apparently (one of the requirements to win). Mike then conveniently pulled his significant other as the winner. Our boss is currently on maternity leave and when she saw the post about winners with Mike's boo winning the largest prize, she sent a text in the group text asking if it was rigged. Mike obviously said that it wasn't. But kept going on and on to me about how Mike did not rig it and felt bad that that was who won. All. Day. Long.

Mike also told us that he dated someone who is in a very popular band that I'm not going to name. He claimed they worked together at a retail store and the person from the band was in love with him. When Mike broke it off, the band member cried for hours on his couch and told him not to leave. Mike eventually told the band member to leave because it was his house.

Unrelated to Mike's story telling.. Mike also enjoys bragging about how popular and hot he was in high school.. and still is (A lot of stories begin with how everyone was hitting on him). He also enjoys bragging about how rich his lover is. Mike subtweets about me as well, not mean stuff, but not nice stuff because none of my work is good enough (because it's not Mike or one of his close friends' work). Mike is always sticking his nose in on my projects despite whining about how much work he still has and does not have enough time for.

If/when we try again, will I always be the ""bad guy"" in our relationship?",tiredofthis22,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6kfz3d/i_20f_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_22m_and_ive_been/,"Please try not to hate me. I have anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder, and I chose alcohol and drugs as my coping mechanism. I deeply regret cheating on my SO: It was a one-time, never-again scenario. I got caught a week before we went on a weekend cruise and I came clean. I honestly thought it would be the end of us. Well, it wasn't. During our vacation, we rediscovered what had drawn us close in the first place. My SO said that I brought ""the old him"" out again. And so, we went our separate ways for the summer – me to my internship, he to senior trip with his friends – vowing to maintain some distance but remain unambiguously in love all the same.  

All summer, I've been working very hard to reflect on what I did wrong and change my ways. I've gotten clean. I don't party. I work from 9-5, work out with my trainer (my only friend, really), eat dinner with family, do yoga, solve puzzles, read, and sleep. That's about it. I'm really trying to work on my self-esteem and happiness from the ground-up without the help of any substances, and to get myself away from that low mental point where I allowed myself to cheat.  

My SO can see this too. Last week, he passed through my city and stayed with me for a night. He said that of all the nights he's spent out partying with his friends, that was the best one of all. He definitely recognizes that I'm improving. Yet It feels like for all my improvement, me cheating while I was on drugs will always come first.   

It all started when I looked at his Instagram last week. After our last big fight as a couple, he followed some half-naked girls to ""get back at me"". Although we are on break, we've always made it clear that we're still in love... And that's not what you should do behind your loved one's back. When I said this, he unfollowed them but retorted that I had no right to ""police"" him. *And that really fucking bothers me.* If he followed them *just* to get back at me, then of course he knew I would look! So it's like he's doing this, expecting me to see, and expecting me to hold my tongue.  

Another thing he likes to say is this: ""The less you know the better"". I don't think this reasoning should apply to any good relationship. Imo, it is the kind of slippery slope that leads to unfaithful behavior – shit, I would know, wouldn't I? When I told him this, my SO said he saw where I was coming from and he knew that his reasoning was selfish and unfair. (He's told me 'white lies' in the past, like lying about applying to a job halfway across the world because he thought it would make me worry too much). **It seems like my SO is using my past mistakes and his past good behavior to justify some pretty selfish behavior.** . 

This brings me to our conversation from around an hour ago, which left me in tears resorting to this subreddit. Toward the end of our conversation, he dropped this bomb:   

""I should be the one not trusting you. Why can't you trust me? I've given you nothing to worry about in the past, and I think past is a pretty good indicator of future. Whereas you've given me a FUCK ton to worry about. YOU cheated on me.""  

And the whole time, I sat there sniffling on the phone. I even apologized for my insecurity five minutes later. And he stayed angry at me, even through his own half-assed apology, and even while admitting that I have improved a lot.  

I know that what I did was wrong. But I know I've been trying my best to improve. My question for all of you is... *how fucking long do I have to be the guilty party here?* Will he hold my infidelity over my head forever, even as I'm improving? And do I have to just sit back and deal with this?  

**TL/DR**: I cheated on my BF. We're currently on break, aiming to get back together next time we see each other. I'm using this time to better myself. Yet I don't think he's ever going to get over me cheating, and he's using it to justify some pretty rude behavior. "
6kg9zv,2,2017-06-30,18 M4F [Tease Me Till I Snap],TheSilentWatchman,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6kg9zv/18_m4f_tease_me_till_i_snap/,"*You and I have known each other our whole lives. Our fathers are best friends, and run a law firm together. As a result we spent a fair amount of together while growing up. We were never best friends, but we got along well enough and enjoyed each others company.*

*However, for years I've wanted you. You're four years older than me, when you were fifteen and I was eleven you joined your high schools cheer squad, your uniform fit your body perfectly, and the sight of you in it practically jump started puberty for me. And as we got older you only got hotter and my lust for you grew. When I was thirteen and you were seventeen our families went on a joint vacation to the Caribbean, while we were there you and I took a picture together on the beach. I kept a copy of that photo in my room, and would often jerk off to it. Your body was so perfect, especially in the bikini you wore that day.*

*I never acted on my desires, fearing that you'd reject me or that it would make things weird given how often we saw one another, but by the time you left for college I could barely keep myself from getting hard whenever I was around you.*

*After you left, my lust died a little bit, you were still without a doubt the hottest women I'd ever seen. I still wanted you, and I still used that photo when horny, but I wasn't as filled with desire for you. I'd even dated and fucked one of the girls who had joined the cheer squad your senior year. But each time you came home, I noticed you become even hotter.*

*This past year I started as a Freshman at the college you attended. You were doing an extra semester and my parents had asked you to show me around and watch out for me while you were still at school. As a result we ended up spending more time together in a few months than we had since you left for school.*

*It drove me mad! You had spent all summer at an internship for a company you wanted to work for. I hadn't seen you since the previous Christmas, and since then you'd somehow gotten so much better looking. The lust I'd had for you in my early teens returned tenfold, but I still didn't act on it. You were fucking perfect, and I couldn't imagine confronting you with my desire.*

*You found out though. For Christmas this year, your parents decided to go on a second honeymoon. As a result you were staying with my family through the holiday. I tried not to, I didn't want to risk it with you sleeping down the hall, but I broke. Earlier that day I had walked in on you changing, you were only wearing a bra and panties, and I couldn't get the picture out of my head. That night, when I thought everyone had gone to bed I jerked off to that picture in my head. Moaning your name under my breath, almost grunting it.*

*You caught me. You'd left your phone charger in my room and came to get it, and instead you found me, half naked, hard cock in my hand, moaning your name. Before I could react you had stripped down and mounted me. We didn't fuck long, I had already been close when you barged in. But it was the greatest pleasure I'd ever felt. You seemed to have enjoyed it as well. Before you went back to your room you told me* *""Just let me know if you want to do that again."" *

*It's been a week since then and I haven't taken you up n your offer, fearing that it was some kind of joke on your part. Meanwhile you've grown impatient, and have decided that if I won't make the first move, you will.*

In this Roleplay, I want you to seduce me. How you do it is up to you. Maybe you just tease me until I snap and pin you to the ground. Maybe you still have your high school cheer uniform and decided to fulfill my earliest fantasy. However you do it, I want to be teased and seduced by you. Don't worry, you won't be in charge the whole time. Once you break me down, I'll be much more aggressive. ;)

Kinks: Being seduced, teasing, semi-rough sex, spanking(giving, not receiving). Breastplay, anal, oral, and cumplay.

Turn offs/Will not do: Toilet play, incest, rimming.

Send me a letter if you're interested."
6kgd89,7,2017-06-30,Spring MVC Framework,ClaDosdotnet,javahelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/6kgd89/spring_mvc_framework/,"Hi Guys,

Im currently starting to learn web dev for an internship and I'm using the spring boot framework with thymeleaf. 

I have done the getting started tutorial on [Spring](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/ ), I have set-up a project, built some basic functionality with controllers and services, read some git projects with similar technology and tried to get it all into a big picture (this is mainly where i struggled). It all worked fine with copy-pasting code from the tutorial and changing it for my needs but i could really need some explanation.

Now most of the things make sense to me and I know where to search for further explanation. What would really help me however would be someone reading through what my current understanding of how everything works is and telling me where I'm wrong (which i most definetely am). 

So my understanding: 
All the Java code is running as a Servlet on a webserver, which is waiting for http requests from clients in form of a http POST or GET. Now when such a request comes in, the @RequestMapping annotation can map all requests to certain functions which again call services to do stuff on server side (i.e. get data, manipulate data etc.). Now in the linked tutorial the data gets returned to the client with this Spring.ui.model object with *model.addAttribute()* . And this is where I'm really confused, i've read that this object basically is just a Java Map that can get read on client side (i'm guessing here the objects gets marshalled with some sort of java serializer while sent). How is the model object sent (protocol, serialized/non-serialized etc) ? Or am I totally wrong with the purpose of said object?

Keep in mind that I'm studying CS on a pretty theoretical level and I have never done web-dev further than basic html/css/Js.

Thank you very much for reading through and event more for everyone trying to help, highly appreciated!
Also sorry for the brutal grammar mistakes I probably made.

TL;DR:
Main confusing points:
- What code is running where in detail in spring MVC?
- How does the server send data back to client?
- What is the scope and exact purpose of the Model object provided by spring ?"

Huddersfield fans love Monty Python apparently. 

Of course West Ham fans love Legend.

Newcastle fans, hang your heads in shame. That top five is total toilet. 

Lots of love for the Bridget Jones saga. Odd. 

The ‘Yes-yes-yes-yes-nooooo’ award goes to West Brom fans. "

I am 6'2, 185 pounds, I am a runner who also does weightlifting. You like to dress business slutty. Tight dress, high heels, dressed shirts that highlight your assets.

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

It's late, 8pm, and the whole office is empty except us two. You're extremely horny and you want to see if this can get further. What do you do?"

6ki016,6,2017-06-30,"Looking for a raw driving experience, a real enthusiasts car.",Chezziwick,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/6ki016/looking_for_a_raw_driving_experience_a_real/,"My first car was a 2005 Mini Cooper S. It was a manual and an absolute blast to drive. Unfortunately, it was also unreliable and rather costly to maintain, and 2 weeks before my summer internship in Michigan I got bad news from my mechanic that I would definitely want to get rid of it before my trip. He sold me a 2008 VW Jetta, which has been an excellent car. It had more than enough space for my move and I'm pleased that it's a manual. However, it is not the car I would've chosen, it was just the most convenient car to get at the time when I had less than 10 days to find a car before my trip.

Now that I'm graduating next semester and I've had time to accumulate some money, I'm looking to sell the VW 1-2 years down the road and pick up something I actually want. I have a HUGE list of cars (the list at the end is not complete) that I've drooled over throughout the years that I want to check out, but I want to see what gems the Reddit community can come up with.

As far as the car I'm looking for, here's some technical specifications:

* Used. I just feel I can get more value from a used car than with a new one. I don't want to eat depreciation.
* $30,000 or less, but cheaper is always nice. Fancy things aren't too important to me.
* Manual Transmission
* At least 4 seats (2 seats is just too inconvenient)
* RWD or AWD (Both the Mini and Jetta were FWD, and I'm tired of driving those.)
* Modifiable. If it's not worth modifying, it's not worth buying. I'm looking for something I can make mine.
* Reliable-ish/Cheap-ish to maintain. This stems from the Mini -- I'm not paying to repair a glorified BMW.

And here's some less-technical specifications:

* I'm looking for something **MEAN**. Something that stands out among the commuter cars, and makes other enthusiasts turn their heads or nod them in approval. Or in my case, howling like a frat boy at freshmen girls.
* Makes noise. It doesn't have to set off car alarms, but I want something that makes me smile.
* I like my cars raw and unfiltered. My sister has a new A4 with a sport package, and as fast and comfortable as it is, it's too docile. It accelerates effortlessly, the power steering is so strong there's no feedback, and I can barely feel the bumps. It's a fantastic car, but I'd rather have my manual VW. I **loved** the Mini, I loved how low to the ground I was, and how I could feel every bump and curve.
* Maximum smiles per gallon. My wallet can take a hit at the pump as long as every time I drive, I'm beaming.
* Fast. It needs to be fast. The Mini was quick, but I want something genuinely fast.

TL;DR I want a real enthusiasts car, raw and unfiltered. A car more powerful than any typical commuter would need, and, of all my previous cars, is statistically most likely to kill me. But I'll die with a smile on my face.

Cars already on my list (which may not fit all the parameters): GTI, ST, WRX, Evo, 350Z, 370Z, G35.
If you have any specific model years in mind, please don't hesitate to let me know!"

Shortly before becoming a moderator here, I decided to create an exhaustive timeline of Giant Bomb. It's been over 2.5 years since that post, and it's time I got to updating it!

The primary goal of this list is to help new users (and old) get a sense of where this site has come from, and what it goes through to provide such great content. If there's anything you think should be added to this list, post it here!

##The Birth of Giant Bomb

After being fired from GameSpot, [Jeff Gerstmann](http://www.giantbomb.com/jeff-gerstmann/3040-89712/) went on to co-found [giantbomb.com](https://giantbomb.com), *a website about video games*^^tm ,  with long time friend and GameSpot coworker [Ryan Davis](http://www.giantbomb.com/ryan-davis/3040-93335/).

##Acquisition by CBSi, and the current home of GBWest

In March of 2012 Whiskey Media was divided, with Giant Bomb and Comic Vine being purchased by CBS Interactive. They joined Jeff's (and Brad's, and Vinny's, and Ryan's, and Alex's) former employer GameSpot at the CBSi San Francisco office, where they still reside.

##Goodbye, Friend

I have struggled greatly with how to word this, and whether I should even mention it at all. After giving it much thought, I don't think the Giant Bomb story would be complete without discussing the passing of Ryan Davis on July 3, 2013.

##The Duders Go East

Vinny's exodus back to the land of his fathers lead to him combining forces with Alex and establishing the first *official* branch of the site, Giant Bomb East. It's been a challenge for GBEast to get off the ground, with the guys being moved around the city and Vinny's time being consumed by his family and house. With a new hire this year and access to a better studio, expect a lot more to come from our boys in New York.

##New Blood, Farewell Scoops

After months of deliberation (and Patrick putting tha site on his back), Giant Bomb finally announces their new hires: Senior Editor [Dan Ryckert](https://www.giantbomb.com/dan-ryckert/3040-109456/) and Senior Producer Jason Oestreicher!

Less than half a year later, Senior News Editor [Patrick Klepek](https://www.giantbomb.com/patrick-klepek/3040-100074/) announced that he will be leaving Giant Bomb after nearly 4 years of great times and massive scoops. He accepted a position as Kotaku's Senior Reporter, where he continued to scoop the industry like no one else.

##The West Moves South (two floors) and the Professor Enters the Building

Four years since being acquired by CBSi, the GBW crew gets moved to the 1st floor as Apple sets up shop in their old location. This means they get brand new podcast and video studios, open offices right next to the sales guys who mash on Tekken all day, and a Idea Forest!

Meanwhile, GBE finally gets fully staffed with the edition of Senior Editor [Austin Walker](https://www.giantbomb.com/austin-walker/3040-156443/), aka Professa Killah, aka Jean-Luc Go hard, aka LeBron Games.

##The Ever Changing East

2016 was a turbulent year for the BEAST crew. They finally set up a proper studio. Austin left the site to become Editor-in-Chief of VICE's new gaming vertical, [Waypoint](https://waypoint.vice.com), and is joined by a familiar Scooper from Chi City. Dan found love, and left for NYC with all of the fanfare one would expect. What a year!

##The Ascension of a Meme God and the Millennial Injection

War. War never changes. But Giant Bomb does.

What should I do?",RevengeHF,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6kim9a/my_mother_is_going_through_a_tough_time_but_has/,"Hey guys, not really sure where this belongs or even if this is a problem or just me being selfish. So I'm 22, started working 6 months ago for a software dev company as an intern before I go back to university (Paid internship).

So I get my money paid directly into my bank every month and at first, I didn't even realise the problem. I think it's first important to mention how this is working, I'm living at home with my mom and sister and recently her boyfriend of 10-15 years walked out on her/us so money for her is pretty tight to come by. Personally, I don't spend a lot of money and am happy for her to take a cut of my money towards whatever she needs it for and that includes things like letting me stay, food etc. 

However since I've started earning, I've made 2 expensive purchases and a few video games here or there (Expensive purchases being a Nintendo switch console and recently a new PC monitor. Both cost around €400). When I went to buy the PC monitor, I found out there's no money in my account whatsoever, and fair enough she offered to pay for it since she spent it but at the same time I feel like I've worked for 6 months and haven't saved any money at all. I'd consider myself pretty good at saving, I don't drink or smoke or anything like that so really my expenses come down to a few video games and general stuff such as food etc.

Am I right in being a little bit pissed about this? I don't even know what I should say or do, should I start earning from some freelance work and build up my own collection of money that she has no access to (This really seems to me like something that I shouldn't have to do though). It sucks because we get on really well and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

EDIT: Probably a good idea to mention that the amount is somewhere close to €1200 per month"
6kinfv,29,2017-06-30,A cautionary tale...,AuJaDe,ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/6kinfv/a_cautionary_tale/,"I've been in EMS in some form for around 3 years now. I've had jobs as an ER tech, EMT, phlebotomy, etc. I've done an internship at an FD and made it into a recruit class for an FD before I tore my hamstring. Things in terms of my career, even with some setbacks, were pretty decent considering my young age.

However, one thing that wasn't was my health. At my heaviest I was 265 at 5'5"". I've battled with weight issues my entire life, and have spent more years on a diet than anyone should. I never looked at the lifestyle change I needed. The idea of eating healthy to eat healthy wasn't something my mind could process. Eating healthy was for losing weight, right? I had my head shoved far up my ass and I didn't connect my medical knowledge to myself. I never looked at exercise as the thing that I need to do. I never looked at a life style change as what I need to do. My mentality was that diet can reverse the issues I was having.

You know what's exceedingly hard to do when you're working day in and day out, with lots of stress on you? Diet. Dieting (to clarify I mean extreme diets, not basic caloric deficit dieting that's needed to actually lose the weight) and EMS are not things that go well together (I admit there's strong willed folks who can will themselves to do extreme diets, it just has never been me). At the start of my very first experience in EMS I was 220, with a decently muscular but still overweight build. Since then, I put on 50 pounds in 3 years. How? Fast food here, sleep deprivation as an excuse there, coupled with years of struggling with weight issues. Between stress and time constraints, I just couldn't stick to any extreme diet. My mind would justify the next shitty meal.

Fast forward to a couple of months ago. After a hamstring tear and my weight delaying my dreams of working for the FD I interned with, I had enough. I quit my EMS job and have taken my health into play. I'm developing healthy eating habits. I have never worked out harder and have seen this much results (I do powerlifting on the side). I'm down 15 pounds and I can finally breathe a bit again. I've still got a long road to go, but it's worth the journey.

Why am I writing this? No, it's not to brag to you guys about shedding weight early into a lifelong journey of health and fitness. It's not to get it off of my chest. It's to tell the new guys this:

Don't come into this job with eating issues. Don't justify your bad eating habits with your stressful job. Avoid the fast food places. Avoid the sugary drinks. Fuck your caffeine and sugar filled drinks. Fuck your excuses as to why you can't eat right. I made the same shit excuses, I ate the bad shit, and look at where it got me. You know how embarrassing it is to have your once well fitted uniform look like shit on you, to get sweaty because you had to lift the stretcher? It's not worth it.

To everyone reading this who might be getting near the same situation I've found myself in: Get a lunch box, find a life style that's healthy, cut the diets out of your life, lift heavy (or do whatever your flavor of exercise is), and stop making excuses. If you wouldn't trust the cardiologist who smokes 2 packs a day, how the fuck do you think people feel when you're pushing it on the scale and you look like you're the one who needs the wee woo machine?

Anyways, I hope my message makes it out to the people who need to hear it. If anyone wants to chime in and help make this post less of a rant and more of a discussion on EMS health, please do.

I have been working for COMPANY for about two and a half years now.  I started as a data-entry intern.  I worked hard, made a huge effort to learn the business and the systems they used. They decided to extend my internship and give me a huge raise until they could actually hire me on full time about 8 months later.  I then went from Salesforce Admin/Dev work to Order Processing/Coordination, it was a completely different world.  Now, my boss has recommended that I try a sales position, as she thinks I would do well in it.

This all leads to my main question, does this look bad to future employers?  Jumping around from job to job at the same company?  I have enjoyed all my jobs (data entry, Salesforce, order coordination) immensely, and I absolutely love the culture of the company.  Each time I move, I am getting about a 20-25% raise in my salary as well.  Short term, it seems like a really good idea, but I'm worried how this will look long term."

What should I do?",RevengeHF,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6kiro9/my_mother_is_going_through_a_tough_time_but_has/,"Hey guys, not really sure where this belongs or even if this is a problem or just me being selfish. So I'm 22, started working 6 months ago for a software dev company as an intern before I go back to university (Paid internship).

So I get my money paid directly into my bank every month and at first, I didn't even realise the problem. I think it's first important to mention how this is working, I'm living at home with my mom and sister and recently her boyfriend of 10-15 years walked out on her/us so money for her is pretty tight to come by. Personally, I don't spend a lot of money and am happy for her to take a cut of my money towards whatever she needs it for and that includes things like letting me stay, food etc.

However since I've started earning, I've made 2 expensive purchases and a few video games here or there (Expensive purchases being a Nintendo switch console and recently a new PC monitor. Both cost around €400). When I went to buy the PC monitor, I found out there's no money in my account whatsoever, and fair enough she offered to pay for it since she spent it but at the same time I feel like I've worked for 6 months and haven't saved any money at all. I'd consider myself pretty good at saving, I don't drink or smoke or anything like that so really my expenses come down to a few video games and general stuff such as food etc.
Am I right in being a little bit pissed about this? I don't even know what I should say or do, should I start earning from some freelance work and build up my own collection of money that she has no access to (This really seems to me like something that I shouldn't have to do though). It sucks because we get on really well and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Probably a good idea to mention that the amount is somewhere close to €1200 per month. Posted this in /r/self also but thought you guys might be able to offer some advice too!"

6kj8yx,1,2017-06-30,Quadro vs. GeForce for Oculus,riffraff11235,oculus,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/6kj8yx/quadro_vs_geforce_for_oculus/,"I've been trying to configure an Oculus Rift CV1 on a computer at my internship. This thing is way over the minimum specs for the Oculus; dual Quadro P5000's, 256GB of RAM, dual Core i7 CPUs. I have the Oculus hooked up through an HDMI / Display Port adapter, and the USB for the headset goes to a USB 3.0 port. It seems to work fine, but sometimes the display in the headset goes to black and then comes back. Originally I thought it might be the cable going to the headset, but I set up the Oculus on a colleague's laptop containing a GTX 1080 and it did not have this issue. The drivers I have installed are the ones that the nVidia website recommended for this card, but GeForce Experience tells me there's an update available. Could it be a driver issue? I tried turning off power management for the USB ports but the problem persisted."

I put in HOURS of hard work and dedication...even overtook some other people's jobs because they weren't as efficient. But unfortunately my boss and I couldn't see eye to eye on my worth Vs time spent and I decided to resign.
I can't express how much the company means to me. Even prior to working for it it changed my life and helped me in so many ways. So leaving was/is a hard choice that I'm still feeling nervous about.
But what hurt me the most was that my boss was not there today to say goodbye. He didn't say anything regarding my leave to me since the day I told him I was resigning (a month ago). I wasn't expecting a parade or anything but a handshake might have been nice.

6kjn6r,1,2017-06-30,Bad 2nd Interview Can I Get the Job?!?!,msir123,interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/6kjn6r/bad_2nd_interview_can_i_get_the_job/,So I interviewed with a big tech company for a program marketing role.  The first interview was a phone interview for 30 minutes and it went very well. They decided to have me onsite and I interviewed with 4 managers for 30 minutes each.  I struggled with anxiety the day of the interview and was not my best.  My voice sounded weird and they even brought a box of tissues so I could blow my nose half way through the interview.  The interview with the 3rd person ended about 5 minutes early and she mentioned that its good that Im getting experience interviewing with other companies.  The last interviewer mentioned the benefits of working at the company but did not mention the next steps in the process.  They did really like my resume and cover letter and hinted that I was more experienced than the average intern.  Do you think I can still get the job after not being my best for the 2nd interview.
